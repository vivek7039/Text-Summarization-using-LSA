SHAREHOLDER RETURNS
On a constant currency basis, orders received 
grew by 11.8%, revenue was up 4.5% and adjusted 
operating profit grew by 16.1% reflecting strong 
performances by both divisions.
The Board considers the dividend to be an important 
component of shareholder returns and as such has 
a policy to deliver a progressive dividend year on 
year. The Board is pleased to be recommending an 
increased final dividend of 8.21p per share, making a 
total dividend for the year of 12.32p, which is a 30% 
increase on the previous year. 
GOVERNANCE AND THE BOARD
During the year, Andrew Lewis stood down as 
Group Finance Director and the Board retained the 
services of Paul Rayner on an interim basis while the 
search for a permanent successor was conducted. 
Nick Keveth was appointed Chief Financial Officer 
on 1 June 2017. Rob Rennie stepped down as Chief 
Executive Officer on 15 February 2017 and was 
replaced by Paul McDonald with immediate effect. 
We have a strong and stable Board and I remain 
personally committed to overseeing the next phase 
of the Group’s growth under the new Executive 
management team. 
The Board has continued to set the right tone 
from the top during the year, visiting all main sites 
and meeting regularly with senior management. 
Our internal Board evaluation in 2017 robustly 
challenged all aspects of the Board including my 
performance and that of each Director, the Board 
Committees and the Board as a whole. I am pleased 
to report that the Board continues to function 
effectively as a cohesive body with a good balance 
of support and challenge, and continues to be 
committed to the highest standards of governance 
and compliance. 
DELIVERING STRONG RESULTS
2017 was another strong year of delivery and we 
look to the future with confidence.
We have the right strategy, the right product 
portfolio and the right management team to 
generate further value for shareholders in the  
years to come.
David Evans
Chairman
15 November 2017
OVERVIEW
It has been a year of structural and strategic 
transition for the Group. We have a newly 
appointed and energised executive team in  
Paul McDonald and Nick Keveth, who have 
acted with impressive decisiveness in embedding 
changes within the organisation as we continue 
to strengthen the business.
In this year of management change, we have 
delivered a strong set of financial results. We enter 
the new financial year as a more robust business 
with stronger management, a broader product 
range, increased routes to market and a strong 
order book. We continue to maintain our focus on 
creating a healthy and sustainable business and, 
by investing in and integrating technology in both 
divisions, we are creating exciting future international 
growth opportunities. 
None of our achievements would have been 
possible without the energy and commitment of 
our people. Employees across Avon have worked 
tirelessly to deliver these results and I would like to 
thank them all for their commitment and support.
STRATEGY
The Board has focused on refining the Group’s 
strategy during the year. In broad terms, our 
strategy is to grow the core by maximising organic 
sales growth from our current product portfolio, 
supported by selective product development, 
and through value enhancing acquisitions to 
complement and extend the reach of our existing 
businesses and to bring new growth opportunities. 
Delivery of this strategy requires us to manage 
the impact of the end of the ten year sole-source 
contract with the US Department of Defense for 
the M50 respirator, which we are well prepared 
for. The investments we have made in recent years 
to broaden our Protection product portfolio to 
support a wider range of Military programmes, both 
in the US and in other countries, gives the Board 
confidence that we will continue to deliver against 
our organic growth targets, driving long-term 
profitable growth and providing sustainable value 
for our shareholders. 
“2017 was another  
strong year of delivery  
and we look to the future  
with confidence.”

THE CORE
GROWING THE CORE
We have established ourself as a technology and service leader 
in our chosen markets, with a range of innovative products and 
an established global customer base. We see opportunities 
to generate further, profitable growth from our core business 
through a number of initiatives:
• Leveraging the product and customer base. As a leader in 
a number of related technology areas, there is considerable 
scope to cross sell the wider product portfolio to our 
existing customers. We have seen with the acquisitions 
of argus and InterPuls that strong brand positions in 
complementary markets provide an opportunity to 
accelerate multi-product sales. 
• Responding to customers’ growing needs. Through 
our focus on innovation we are constantly enhancing 
the functionality and capability of our product range. 
As our customers grow, we see a clear opportunity to 
migrate them to our premium product offerings as their 
requirements increase. 
• Offering new models and solutions. The success of our 
Cluster Exchange and more recently launched Farm Services 
programmes have demonstrated the benefits of combining 
our leading product technology with a service that the 
customer values. We see alternative ownership models  
and value-added services as an additional differentiator  
that has scope to open up a broader market. 
• Expanding our reach through distribution. We participate 
in growing global markets with a large and diverse base 
of potential customers. Expanding our distribution 
network of agents and dealers will allow us to access 
wider market opportunities more quickly, in both new 
and existing territories.
• Enhancing our commercial effectiveness. As we target 
a wider market with increasingly sophisticated technical 
offerings, we are investing in our people to improve 
the effectiveness of our sales teams to ensure that we 
optimise the relationship with our global distribution 
partners and customers.
• Continuing focus on operational excellence. We have 
invested in a global manufacturing capability and supply chain 
to meet the high quality requirements of our products and 
customers. We pursue a continuous improvement culture to 
further reduce costs and enhance product margins and will 
benefit from improved operational gearing as we optimise the 
utilisation of our global operations.
SELECTIVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
As the established leader, we are committed to remaining 
at the forefront of technology evolution in our markets. 
To generate the best return on our innovation investment 
we need to ensure that our development is closely aligned 
with our customers to enable us to deliver the performance, 
capability and efficiency that they are looking for:
• Moving up the value chain in respiratory protection. 
Whilst we will continue to expand the portfolio of mask 
platforms, variant systems and consumables to cater for the 
specific needs of particular customers or applications, we 
are actively developing more advanced systems such as  
the Powered Air and Magnum SCBA ranges targeted at 
more specialist customer groups. 
• Enabling technologies and integrated systems. The 
equipment of the military fighter of the future is expected 
to be increasingly sophisticated, with seamless integration 
of protection and technology systems. We are investing  
in our expertise in enabling technologies, following  
an Internet of Things principle, to allow greater integration 
of respiratory protection systems with data and 
communications technology. 
• Building the Dairy portfolio around the service proposition. 
We are expanding the Farm Services product portfolio  
to include Cluster Exchange, Pulsator Exchange and  
Tag Exchange to leverage the unique value of this  
product range.
VALUE ENHANCING ACQUISITIONS
Through growing the core and selective product development, 
we believe that we can sustain attractive and profitable organic 
growth into the future. However, we also see the potential to 
complement this growth and accelerate our strategy through 
carefully selected value enhancing acquisitions within both 
Avon Protection and milkrite | InterPuls. These acquisitions have 
the potential to give us access to new technology and market 
segments. Our recent track record demonstrates our ability to 
generate real value by bringing complementary products onto 
our market leading platform:
• InterPuls (2015): significantly expanded the product 
portfolio of the Dairy business. Consistent with our 
‘Growing the Core’ principles, integration focused on 
combining the brands and maximising the cross selling 
opportunity for the expanded product range. The 
acquired best-in-class manufacturing footprint in Italy was 
established as the lead development location allowing it to 
accelerate the ‘Selective Product Development’ phase of 
the strategy to widen the portfolio for the global market.
• argus (2015): followed the ‘Growing the Core’ principles 
when consolidating the thermal imaging camera production 
into our UK manufacturing facility, whilst adding sales and 
marketing infrastructure to support organic growth with 
the traditional argus customers and launching a cross selling 
initiative with the existing North American SCBA Fire 
network. Over the mid term we will follow the ‘Selective 
Product Development’ principles to develop product 
upgrades to further enhance the product portfolio.

The FM61 uses pioneering conformal filter technology for closer

pull hazards as well as reducing neck loading.
The NH15 Escape Hood range is the smallest NIOSH-certified 
CBRN/CO air purifying escape respirator on the market and is ideal 
for police, emergency medical services and fire officers seeking 
immediate or emergency respiratory protection in a CBRN/CO 
escape scenario.
MCM100 is a state of the art underwater rebreather range for 
military diving use. During 2017 we obtained the CE European 
safety approval for the product and post year end we have secured 
the first orders for this product from military customers. Our 
underwater product range also includes the MDC150 dive computer 
designed for military use.
Our fire range is comprised of the argus 
thermal imaging camera and the Deltair 
SCBA. We are in the process of upgrading

slip and improve animal health 
with their unique interlocking 
anti-twist shell design. Impulse 
Air takes innovation one step 
further using a unique air flow to 
draw the milk away quickly.
Our premium silicone tubing is 
made from a strong material, 
with superior tear strength, 
with proven performance from 
benchmark testing against 
similar products. 
The Impulse Claw 300 with 
its durable, lightweight and 
ergonomic design makes the 
claw easier for the operator to 
handle and reduces the overall 
weight of the cluster, improving 
cow comfort.
Our lightweight shells are 
designed to optimise the 
performance of our Impluse and 
Impulse Air liners by increasing 
the responsiveness of the liners 
to the pulsation signal.
Our liner washing systems are 
designed to meet the cleaning 
and sanitisation needs of the 
dairy farmer.
We provide a range of Control products 
used to manage the milking process. 
iMilk600 is a state of the art milk meter 
with advanced electronics and sensors. 
The user-friendly panel displays real time 
milk yield, temperature, milking time, cow 
number and conductivity.
Our iFarm software consolidates and 
analyses data captured from neck and leg 
tags as well as the milking process to drive 
improved efficiency and farm performance. 
Through our first exchange offering, 
Cluster Exchange Service, farmers 
lease complete milking clusters and 
outsource their liner change process 
to us. This is managed through 
service centres established in our 
existing facilities, with the support 
of our dealers and third-party 
logistics specialists.
During 2017 we expanded Farm 
Services with the launch of Pulsator 
Exchange Service. Farmers lease 
our market leading pulsators and 
we provide ongoing servicing and 
maintenance.
We are currently piloting Tag 
Exchange Service whereby farmers 
lease leg and neck tags again 
with servicing and maintenance 
provided by us. This enables farmers 
to remove the burden of capital 
investment and to flex the number of 
tags according to changes in the size 
of their herds.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW Chief Executive  
Officer’s Review
Having worked for Avon for the last 14 years, I was 
delighted to be appointed Chief Executive Officer on 15 
February 2017. There are significant growth opportunities 
for the Group and I am confident in our ability to deliver 
value to our customers, our people and our shareholders.
STRATEGY
Following my appointment, I have been working with 
the Board and my Group Executive management team, 
to update the Group’s strategy for delivering long-term, 
sustainable growth. Our strategy for creating shareholder 
value is based upon three key elements: 
• grow the core by maximising organic sales growth from 
our current product portfolio
• pursue selective organic product development to 
maintain our innovation leadership position
• target value enhancing acquisitions to complement 
our existing businesses and add additional growth 
opportunities for the Group
GROW THE CORE
Avon Protection
We see clear growth opportunities for Avon Protection’s 
existing product and service offering across all our markets 
of Military, Law Enforcement and Fire.
Expanding our global Military customer base
Our technology platform and commitment to service 
delivery have made Avon Protection the global leader in 
respiratory protection. Through our strong relationship 
with the US military, we have created a specialist product 
portfolio ranging from general service respiratory 
equipment through to complex integrated CBRN systems. 
As a result we can offer a tailored solution that addresses 
both the functionality and cost requirements of our 
customers. Coupled with excellent service and reliability, 
this enables us to serve the sophisticated needs of 
special forces customers as well as high volume general 
service requirements. 
Our world leading expertise and reputation for quality 
in respiratory protection systems has been recognised 
by the UK Ministry of Defence through our nomination 
as the preferred bidder for the resupply and in-service 
support of its General Service Respirator.
We are actively pursuing further opportunities to 
broaden our Military customer base and provide access 
to our world leading products.
Growing the Law Enforcement market
Demand from this market continues to be driven by a need 
to provide improved protection against growing global 
CBRN threats, as recently seen in several countries around 
the world. During 2017 we have experienced strong sales 
momentum in this market and have seen increased demand 
for our escape products. In the US in particular, our leading 
product technologies for Law Enforcement departments are 
setting Avon Protection apart and enabling us to continue 
to grow our market share. Over the mid-term we expect 
market share gains to continue. To cross-sell a broader 
range of CBRN systems, we look forward to launching our 
US powered air range once NIOSH approvals are received.
Reshaping our Fire strategy
Our market for Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus 
(SCBA) in the Fire sector remains competitive and 
with a fragmented customer base. However we see an 
“There are significant growth 
opportunities for the Group  
and I am confident in our  
ability to deliver value to our 
customers, our people and  
our shareholders.”

opportunity to leverage our technology 
capability to enhance the product offering 
in this segment and are in the process of 
upgrading our system to comply with the new 
2018 NFPA standards. We have developed 
a revised sales strategy to ensure we deliver 
sustainable growth over the mid-term. 
The argus thermal imaging camera 
technology we acquired in October 2015 
has been a significant addition to the Fire 
product portfolio. This is a trusted brand for 
firefighters and will enable us to open cross-
selling opportunities across the product range 
and build a wider distribution network for the 
combined product offering.
Continuous focus on  
operational excellence
Over the last ten years we have established 
an efficient and flexible manufacturing 
operation from which to serve our global 
customer base. This has enabled us to 
maintain excellent product reliability, as well 
as actively manage order scheduling, ensuring 
that we can maintain high productivity whilst 
being able to meet our customers’ quality and 
delivery needs.
We are committed to continually improving 
our production processes and see 
opportunities for further scale efficiencies 
in the medium-term. Furthermore, we are 
exploring opportunities to deploy flexible 
manufacturing solutions, including local 
assembly operations to support regional 
customers, and optimise our production cost 
base to meet our future growth aspirations. 
milkrite | InterPuls
milkrite | InterPuls has developed a set  
of strategic sales growth priorities for 
each of its lines of business.
Interface
Further expand our existing global market-
leading position and counter competitive 
challenge by focusing on expanding the  
global dealer network and launching the  
next generation of milking products.
Precision, Control and Intelligence (PCI) 
Leverage our dominant market position in 
Interface to maximise cross-sales of our PCI 
range of products. Complete the development 
of the control and intelligence product ranges 
to meet the regional requirements for the 
geographies that we serve.
Farm Services
Continue to build on the success of Cluster 
Exchange Service (CES) in both US and 
European markets by introducing the 
additional Pulsator Exchange Service (PES) 
and Tag Exchange Service (TES) and marketing 
as a Farm Services portfolio, whilst becoming 
a key partner directly with the farm on a lease 
hire arrangement. 
SELECTIVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Continued investment to expand  
our product range
To maintain our innovation leadership 
position, we will continue to invest in 
new products in both businesses and in 
enhancements to our existing product 
ranges. Our aim is to generate the highest 
return from our research and development 
activities by focusing on innovation that is 
most relevant to our customers and offers 
the best commercial outcomes. This means 
that whilst we do not intend to invest at the 
same levels as recent years, we will target 
investment in large projects where we see 
further opportunity to add value in line with 
our strategic objectives and growth targets.
Building on our long-term partnership 
with the DoD
The ten year sole-source JSGPM contract for 
the M50 mask system has been a significant 
platform for establishing the Group both as a 
trusted supplier to and as a critical innovation 
partner for the US Department of Defense 
(‘DoD’). We have established multi-level 
relationships with the world’s largest military 
customer and our R&D teams continue 
to work closely in addressing the future 
challenges for military technology.
We have been working on a number 
of potentially significant new platform 
programmes, including the M69 Aircrew 
Mask and the M53A1 powered air respirator 
and Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) 
system. Following the recent confirmation 
from the DoD of the Group’s participation 
under the Joint Enterprise – Research, 
Development, Acquisition and Production 
Procurement contract vehicle, we anticipate 
commencing production of these systems 
during 2018 and expect this to offset any 
revenue reduction as a result of the transition 
of the JSGPM contract in 2019. 
VALUE ENHANCING ACQUISITIONS 
We intend to complement the organic growth 
strategy described above with carefully 
selected, value enhancing acquisitions within 
both Avon Protection and milkrite | InterPuls. 
Acquisitions are intended to complement and 
extend the reach of our existing businesses. 
This will have the effect of building a more 
robust and diversified business, albeit within 
our existing markets. We have a strong 
balance sheet including net cash of £24.7m, 
together with committed bank facilities of 
£29.9m and a cash generative business. This 
financial position, as well as our willingness 
to extend leverage up to two times EBITDA, 
means we are well positioned to pursue 
potential acquisitions that meet our criteria 
and act decisively when we find them. 
I am excited by the potential of our updated 
strategy which sets out the next chapter in 
building a brighter future for Avon through 
the delivery of long-term sustainable growth 
at improved margins. 
PEOPLE
This year saw a high level of transition 
within the senior executive team, with my 
appointment as Chief Executive Officer 
and that of Nick Keveth as Chief Financial 
Officer. I am delighted to welcome two new 
divisional leaders this year, Leon Klapwijk for 
Avon Protection and Craig Sage for milkrite 
| InterPuls, both being internal appointees 
from within our business who have extensive 
knowledge and experience of the Group and 
the markets we serve. I believe we have a 
stronger senior management team in place 
to continue to build on the success of recent 
years and deliver our ambitious and exciting 
growth strategy for the future. 
Since my appointment, I have visited all of our 
sites and wish to personally thank all of our 
employees for their positive response to my 
appointment and their input to the updated 
strategy. I thank you all for your continued 
dedication, enthusiasm and professionalism 
and look forward to sharing in our future 
success as a Group.
OUTLOOK
Our closing order book of £34.0m together 
with £26.6m of orders received post year end 
provides good visibility as we enter the new 
financial year and we are well positioned to 
deliver further growth in 2018.
Within Avon Protection we expect initial 
orders for the M53A1 powered air respirator 
and M69 aircrew respirator programmes 
in 2018, with these orders offsetting the 
non-recurrence of the 37,000 FM50 general 
purpose respirator order and anticipated 
lower M50 mask systems deliveries to the US 
DoD during 2018. In the medium-term these 
programmes together with UK General Service 
Respirator revenues are expected to offset 
any revenue reduction from anticipated lower 
M50 deliveries once the ten year sole-source 
contract ends in 2018. We are also excited 
by the opportunities emerging from our 
wider product portfolio that will enable us to 
grow with the DoD as well as broadening the 
Military and Law Enforcement customer base.
The Dairy market environment continues to 
be positive with improved milk prices and 
low feed costs reflected in increased farmer 
confidence. In this environment, we anticipate 
that the growth trends experienced by milkrite 
| InterPuls in 2017 will continue in the new 
financial year.
We are well positioned to deliver against all 
three of our strategic priorities of growing the 
core, selective product development and value 
enhancing acquisitions.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Orders received totalling £123.9m (2016: £99.7m) 
together with favourable currency movements drove 
an increase in revenue of 12.8% to £113.8m (2016: 
£100.9m). On a constant currency basis, revenue 
grew by 3.6% with flat Military revenue, 6.1% growth 
in Law Enforcement and Fire growing by 17.7%. 
Adjusted operating profit grew by 31.1% to  
£19.8m (2016: £15.1m) and adjusted EBITDA  
was up 26.0% to £27.1m (2016: £21.5m), resulting 
in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.8% (2016: 
21.3%). Our margins have improved due to the  
mix of product shipped and cost efficiencies.  
On a constant currency basis adjusted operating 
profit and adjusted EBITDA grew by 22.2% and 
16.6% respectively.
MILITARY
Military revenue of £68.2m (2016: £62.3m) was 
up 9.5% due to favourable currency movements. 
On a constant currency basis, Military revenues 
were flat versus last year with the 37,000 FM50 
general purpose respirator order offsetting lower 
DoD revenues.
DoD revenue from M50 mask systems, filters, 
spares and development costs totalled £50.5m 
versus £52.9m in 2016 reflecting lower M50 
mask system volumes offset by favourable 
currency movements. 
We delivered 150,000 M50 mask systems and 
144,000 filter pairs, compared with 189,000 
mask systems and 122,000 pairs of filter spares in 
2016. DoD spares and development costs revenue 
increased to £15.6m (2016: £12.9m) due to higher 
development costs relating to the M69 air crew mask.

“Avon Protection has performed strongly with excellent growth in the  
Law Enforcement and Fire revenues. The strong order book provides  
good visibility going into 2018.”
Having received orders for 169,000 M50 mask 
systems during the year, this leaves us with an 
order book of 49,000 systems as we enter 2018. 
The closing order book also includes spares of 
£4.1m primarily relating to 15,000 M50 face piece 
assemblies. Since the year end we have received 
further orders for 118,000 filters and £4.5m of 
spares from the DoD.
Revenue from our Rest of World Military business 
increased to £13.7m (2016: £4.8m) primarily due 
to delivery of the 37,000 FM50 general purpose 
mask order.
Avon Engineered Fabrications (‘AEF’) has 
experienced another soft year with revenues of 
£4.0m (2016: £4.8m), reflecting the variability in 
timing of certain DoD procurement programmes 
for fuel and water storage tanks. AEF experienced 
strong order intake in the final quarter of 2017 and 
enters 2018 with an order book totalling £4.0m. Our 
acquisition strategy will result, in the medium-term, 
in AEF losing the benefits it currently enjoys under 
the US Small Business regime and therefore we are 
considering the strategic options for this business.
LAW ENFORCEMENT
Law Enforcement revenue grew 14.2% to £29.0m 
(2016: £25.4m) due to favourable currency 
movements and 6.1% at constant currency. North 
America revenues grew by 22.3% on a constant 
currency basis to £20.0m, driven by strong 
performance in hoods and mask systems as we 
continue to convert police forces to our C50 mask. 
FIRE
Fire revenue grew by 25.8% to £16.6m (2016: 
£13.2m) and 17.7% at constant currency with solid 
contributions from both SCBA and thermal imaging 
cameras. 
OUTLOOK
The strong closing order book totalling £30.5m 
(2016: £20.9m) together with the further orders 
received post year end for 118,000 M61 filter pairs 
and £4.5m of DoD spares provide excellent visibility 
for 2018. 
The previously reported M53A1 powered air 
respirator and M69 aircrew mask opportunities 
continue to progress with initial DoD orders 
expected in the 2018 financial year. We anticipate 
that the initial orders under these programmes will 
offset the non-recurrence of the 37,000 FM50 
general purpose respirator order and anticipated 
lower M50 mask systems deliveries to the US DoD 
during 2018 resulting in stable Military revenues. 
We expect similar levels of Law Enforcement 
revenue growth in 2018 driven by continued 
conversion of North American police forces to our 
C50 mask system and continuing demand for our 
hoods from a range of global customers. We also 
expect sales of our new Powered Air Purifying 
Respirator range to build momentum once NIOSH 
approvals have been obtained.
We anticipate slower revenue growth in Fire in 
2018 as the growth rate for argus thermal imaging 
cameras reverts to a more normal level.

Divisional Review
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue increased by 17.6% to £49.4m (2016: 
£42.0m) due to favourable currency movements and 
6.6% on a constant currency basis. On a constant 
currency basis, Interface grew revenue by 4.3%, PCI 
by 20.2% and Farm Services by 18.9%. The growth 
trends reflect increased farmer confidence following 
sustained improvements in the milk price/feed cost 
ratio as the market recovers from the weaker market 
conditions experienced in 2016.
Adjusted operating profit grew by 11.1% to £8.0m 
(2016: £7.2m) and adjusted EBITDA was up 11.2% 
to £10.9m (2016: £9.8m), resulting in an adjusted 
EBITDA margin of 22.1% (2016: 23.3%). Our 
margins have softened due to increased investment 
to deliver growth in response to improved market 
conditions. On a constant currency basis adjusted 
operating profit and adjusted EBITDA grew by 5.8% 
and 4.7% respectively.
INTERFACE
Interface revenue grew by 12.4% to £34.5m (2016: 
£30.7m) benefiting from favourable currency 
movements and 4.3% constant currency growth 
driven by Europe and Brazil.
North America revenues grew 9.1% to £19.2m  
(2016: £17.6m), reflecting favourable currency 
movements. On a constant currency basis revenue 
declined by 1.1% reflecting a further decline in OEM 
revenues. milkrite | InterPuls manufactures 64% 
(2016: 61%) of liners sold in the US with its own 
brand products share stable at 51% and with the 
Impulse Air mouthpiece vented liner increasing its

“Strong performance in milkrite | InterPuls resulted in revenue growth  
of 8.5% with positive performances from PCI and Farm Services.”
In Europe, revenue grew by 17.4% to £9.7m and 
15.6% at constant currency. Avon manufactured 
liners have a 76% (2016: 72%) market share with 
milkrite | InterPuls’s own branded product increasing 
to 38% (2016: 32%) due to growth in traditional 
own brand products and the success of our Impulse 
Air mouthpiece vented liner with its market share 
increasing to 8% (2016: 6%).
Latin America grew liner revenues by 29.3% on a 
constant currency basis reflecting market share 
gains in Brazil. Asia Pacific liner revenues declined 
by 1% at constant currency as a result of difficult 
market conditions experienced in China during 2017.
PRECISION, CONTROL & INTELLIGENCE
Sales of our PCI products have benefited from 
increased farmer confidence resulting in higher 
investment spend. Revenue grew by 33.3% to £10.4m 
(2016: £7.8m) reflecting 20.2% constant currency 
growth and favourable currency movements. 
The constant currency growth was driven by growth 
in Europe of 29.5% and 82.5% in Latin America 
again reflecting our performance in Brazil. In North 
America, PCI growth was 3.3% on a constant 
currency basis. 
FARM SERVICES
Farm Services has continued to show exceptional 
growth with revenue increasing by 28.6% to £4.5m 
(2016: £3.5m) and with constant currency growth 
of 18.9%. The constant currency growth was 
driven by growth in North America of 16.8% and 
22.7% in Europe.
At the end of the year, Cluster Exchange had grown 
by 25% to 35,000 cluster points (2016: 28,000) 
serving 624,000 cows on 1,891 farms, up from 
467,000 cows and 1,530 farms at the same time  
last year. To increase our European capacity, we  
plan to open a Farm Services exchange centre at  
our Albinea site in Italy during 2018.
During the year, we have expanded Farm Services 
with the launch of Pulsator Exchange in North 
America. From a zero base, we have introduced  
478 Pulsators onto 11 farms serving 19,570 cows. 
Tag Exchange will follow in 2018 with farm pilots 
underway and progressing successfully. We plan  
to launch Tag Exchange in both North America  
and Europe in 2018.
OUTLOOK
The dairy market environment continues to be 
positive with improved milk prices and low feed 
costs reflected in increased farmer confidence. In 
this environment, we anticipate that the growth

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW The Group has delivered a strong financial 
performance during the year with growth in 
orders received of 22.2% and favourable currency 
movements delivering revenue growth of 14.2% and 
adjusted operating profit growth of 23.4%. After 
amortisation of acquired intangibles, the write down of 
the Emergency Escape Breathing Device (‘EEBD’) (see 
below) and post-acquisition adjustments, operating 
profit grew by 17.9% to £19.8m (2016: £16.8m). At 
constant currency, orders, revenue and adjusted 
operating profit increased by 11.8%, 4.5% and 16.1% 
respectively. Our continued focus on profitable 
growth has resulted in our adjusted EBITDA margin 
increasing to 22.1% compared to 20.9% in 2016.
Adjusted profit before tax was £25.6m (2016: 
£20.7m) and after a tax charge of £0.4m (2016: credit 
of £1.1m), the Group recorded an adjusted profit for 
the year of £25.2m (2016: £21.8m).
On a statutory basis, profit before tax was £18.6m 
(2016: £15.9m) and, after a tax credit, profit for the 
year was £21.5m (2016: £17.6m). 
Adjusted basic earnings per share grew by 15.2% to 
82.8p (2016: 71.9p). Basic earnings per share were 
70.6p (2016: 58.1p) up 21.5% on 2016.
Our results for 2017 reflect the £2.9m exceptional 
write down of the EEBD development costs following 
the discontinuation of this product, as well as higher 
non-cash share based payment costs of £0.9m to 
fully reflect the fair value of the share awards.
We have restated our 2016 operating profit to 
correct the prior year charge for share based 
payments resulting in a restated 2016 operating 
profit of £20.9m compared to the £21.8m previously 
reported. Going forward we expect the higher 
share based payments costs to be offset by lower 
amortisation costs in relation to intangible assets.
Cash generation has continued to be strong with 
98.1% of adjusted EBITDA converted into operating 
cash inflows. This has resulted in year end net cash of 
£24.7m, an increase of £22.7m in the year, which will 
help fund our growth strategy and future acquisitions.
Against this backdrop, the Board has increased the 
final dividend by 30% to 8.21p resulting in total 
dividends for the year of 12.32p also up 30% on 2016. 
The closing order book of £34.0m is 45.3% 
higher than at the end of 2016, reflecting strong 
performances across all markets in which we operate. 
On a constant currency basis, the closing order book 
grew by 46.3%. The closing order book together with 
£26.6m of orders received post year end provides 
good visibility for 2018.
“Cash generation has 
continued to be strong with 
98.1% of adjusted EBITDA 
converting into cash and year 
end net cash of £24.7m.”

ADJUSTMENTS
Adjustments of £6.0m (2016: £4.1m) have been excluded from adjusted operating profit and include  
the £2.9m exceptional write down of costs in developing the EEBD product, amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets of £3.0m (2016: £3.3m) and pension administration costs of £0.4m (2016: £0.3m). 
Adjustments in 2017 also included an exceptional credit of £0.3m (2016: nil) for a post-acquisition  
working capital adjustment relating to the acquisition of InterPuls.
FINANCE COSTS
Net interest costs were £0.2m (2016: £0.2m). Other finance expenses of £1.0m (2016: £0.7m) represent 
the unwind of the discount on the net pension liability and, as in previous years, has been excluded from 
adjusted profit for the year.
TAXATION
Taxation was a tax credit of £2.9m (2016: credit of £2.0m) which consists of a £4.3m charge relating to 
the current year and a £7.2m credit in respect of previous periods. The current year charge represents an 
effective rate of 23% of profit before tax. The £7.2m credit in respect of previous periods includes a £2.3m 
credit in connection with company restructuring in previous years and the release of provisions following 
an updated assessment of uncertain tax positions. 
DIVIDENDS
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 8.21p per share (2016: 6.32p) which together with the 
4.11p per share interim dividend gives a total dividend of 12.32p (2016: 9.48p), up 30% on last year.  
The final dividend will be paid on 16 March 2018 to shareholders on the register at 16 February 2018  
with an ex-dividend date of 15 February 2018.
Our policy is to maintain a progressive dividend policy balancing dividend increases with the rates of adjusted 
earnings per share growth achieved, taking into account potential acquisition spend and the Group’s financing 
position. Over recent years, we have grown the dividend per share by 30% per annum and we expect to 
continue to grow dividends ahead of earnings over the medium-term. Our policy is to maintain dividend cover 
(the ratio of dividend per share to adjusted earnings per share) above two times. This year dividend cover was 
6.7 times (2016: 7.6 times). Once dividend cover has reduced to two times we intend to increase dividends in 
line with the growth in adjusted earnings per share.

CASHFLOW AND NET CASH
Adjusted cash generated from operations was £35.3m up 6.6% on 2016. Operating cash conversion from 
adjusted EBITDA continued to be strong at 98.1% (2016: 110.7%) and operating cash conversion from 
adjusted operating profit was 136.8% (2016: 158.4%).

At the year end, the Group had net cash of £24.7m (2016: £2.0m) and an undrawn US Dollar denominated 
bank facility of £29.9m which is committed to 30 November 2019.
Our strong balance sheet gives us the capacity to fund our growth strategy and make further acquisitions. 
Our policy is to maintain a strong financial position and keep the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA 
under two times. 
R&D INVESTMENT
We continue to invest for the future and our total investment in research and development (capitalised 
and expensed) amounted to £8.4m (2016: £8.3m) as shown below. Total research and development as a

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW R&D INVESTMENT CONTINUED
In Avon Protection the most significant investments have been in further developing the M69 aircrew 
mask, our Deltair SCBA and MCM100 product range. In milkrite | InterPuls, investment has been  
focused on expanding our Precision, Control and Intelligence (PCI) product range.
Having appraised the range of future product opportunities available, we have decided to discontinue the 
NIOSH approvals process for the EEBD. This product, which is outside of our core CBRN and respiratory 
range, was primarily developed for a US Navy contract which was ultimately awarded to a competitor in 
2015. Following review of alternative commercial opportunities for this technology, further development 
has been terminated in view of the limited opportunities identified to commercialise the product in the 
foreseeable future. As a result, an exceptional non-cash impairment charge of £2.9m has been recorded 
in the year end accounts as a non-recurring item.
PENSIONS
The Group has a UK pension scheme which is closed to future accrual. The net pension liability, as 
measured under IAS 19 (revised), is £44.1m (2016: £39.9m). The £4.2m increase in the deficit over the 
last year is due to adopting more conservative mortality and inflation assumptions and the discount rate 
exceeding actual investment return. 
We received the results of the triennial funding valuation as at 31 March 2016 and this showed the plan to 
be 90% funded on a continuing basis with a deficit of £33.8m. A deficit recovery plan is in place. In 2017, 
the Group made total contributions of £1.0m (2016: £0.7m) and has agreed to pay £1.5m per annum in 
future. The level of contributions will next be reassessed following the 2019 triennial funding valuation.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of foreign exchange risk. Exposures resulting 
from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and net exposure may be hedged 
by the use of forward exchange contracts. The Group does not undertake foreign exchange transactions 
for which there is no underlying exposure.
Credit and counterparty risk are managed through the use of credit evaluations and credit limits. Cash deposits 
are made at prevailing interest rates which are not generally fixed for more than one month. Borrowings and 
overdrafts are at floating interest rates. The Group does not carry out any interest rate hedging.
Financial risk management is further detailed in Note 19 to the Group Financial Statements and the 
Group’s principal business risks are set out on pages 32 to 35.
CURRENCY EFFECT
The Group has translational exposure arising on the consolidation of overseas company results into Sterling. 
Based on the current mix of currency denominated profit, a five cents appreciation of the US Dollar increases 
revenue by approximately £5.0m and operating profit by approximately £0.7m. A five cents appreciation of 
the Euro increases revenue by approximately £0.5m and operating profit by approximately £0.1m.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The non-cash charge to the income statement for share based payments has been understated in previous 
years, as share awards under the Performance Share Plan have been undervalued for accounting purposes. 
As a result, the 2016 share based payments charge has been restated from £0.1m to £1.0m, to reflect the 
fair value of these awards, which has the effect of reducing the 2016 reported and adjusted operating 
profit by £0.9m. Further details of this restatement to the 2016 comparators is provided in note 24 to the 
financial statements.
Financial Review continued
ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE MEASURES
This document contains certain financial measures that are not defined or recognised under IFRS including 
adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share. The Directors believe that adjusted measures 
provide a more useful comparison of business trends and performance. These adjusted measures exclude 
the effect of exceptional items, defined benefit scheme pension costs, the amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets and discontinued operations. The Group uses these measures for planning, budgeting and 
reporting purposes and for its internal assessment of the operational performance of individual businesses 
within the Group. Given the term adjusted is not defined under IFRS, the adjusted measures may not be 
comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following tables show the adjustments made to arrive at adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit for 
the year and adjusted basic earnings per share.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW risks affecting the  
achievement of the Group’s 
strategic objectives 
issues that could affect  
the finances of the business  
both externally and internally
matters arising from the  
operational activities of the  
Group relating to areas such 
as sales, product development, 
procurement, and dealings with 
commercial partners
THERE ARE THREE MAIN RISK AREAS:
Operational 
Risks
Financial 
Risks
Strategic 
Risks
Principal Risks and Risk Management
The principal risk areas identified through the 
risk management process in October 2017 and 
approved by the Audit Committee at its meeting 
on 9 November 2017 are listed on the following 
pages in order of the potential severity of their 
impact on the Group during the forthcoming year. 
The categorisation given to the risk areas internally 
is shown alongside. Available mitigation in the form 
of a generic control structure, is shown by each 
identified risk area. The individual priority tasks 
allocated to each risk area during the year within 
the generic control structures are not noted. 
In 2018 projects failure/acquisition integration risk 
is considered the Group’s highest risk, principally 
due to the reliance on one-off projects and 
acquisitions to deliver the strategy and build a 
better business. Market threat is considered the 
second highest risk due to the reliance on sales 
growth and managing markets in both businesses. 
Talent management and product development 
remain important priorities for the Group, followed 
by financial management given the new CFO and 
proposed change of external auditor. 
Brexit was considered as a specific risk within the 
political/economic instability area as part of the 
annual review in 2017. Given that a substantial 
part of the Group’s business takes place outside 
of the EU with the US being our largest market; 
the majority of sales within the EU being made 
by milkrite | InterPuls with the product being 
predominantly manufactured within the EU; and 
our main cross border trading flows being between 
the UK and US, the risks arising from Brexit are 
considered to be low. 
The Group has an established process for the 
identification and management of risk across the 
two divisions, working within the governance 
framework set out in our corporate governance 
statement (see pages 43 to 47). Ultimately the 
management of risk is the responsibility of the 
Board of Directors, and the development and 
execution of a comprehensive and robust system 
of risk management has a high priority at Avon.
The Board’s role in risk management includes 
promoting a culture that emphasises integrity at 
all levels of business operations, embedding risk 
management within the core processes of the 
business, approving appetite for risk, determining the 
principal risks, ensuring that these are communicated 
effectively across the businesses and setting the 
overall policies for risk management and control.
The principal risks affecting the Group are identified by 
the Group Executive team and reviewed by the Board.
Each risk area has priority tasks allocated to it that 
are the responsibility of the members of the Group 
Executive to deliver during the financial year. The risk 
areas are also addressed and mitigated by the control 
structures permanently embedded throughout the 
Group. Regular sessions are held throughout the year 
to review progress in delivery of the priority tasks at 
an operational level and the fitness for purpose of 
the control structures.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW HEALTH AND SAFETY (H&S)
Avon is committed to safeguarding the health 
and safety of its employees and contractors. All 
employees are encouraged to take an active role 
in ensuring that our working environment is a safe 
place to work and visit by actively reporting all 
safety observations, being involved in safety audits, 
assessments and regular training sessions.
Over the year, monthly global H&S meetings are 
held where information, knowledge and ideas are 
shared to implement best practice across our sites 
and create positive safety attitudes.
Our management teams put considerable focus 
on potential hazard reporting, to ensure the 
appropriate action is taken before they can cause 
an incident or an accident. These actions are key 
to ensuring our facilities are safe places in which 
to work.
ENVIRONMENT
We are committed to minimising the impact of our 
operations on the environment and encourage 
all employees to think about ways of modifying 
their behaviour.
At the start of each year we set environmental 
improvement goals. Each site has delivered 
a number of improvements, for example the 
replacement of overhead lighting with LEDs at 
our Melksham site. 
Each facility participates in recycling paper, metal, 
plastic, cardboard and used products, and continues 
to focus on minimising energy consumption. 
We have experienced no external environmental 
incidents or concerns throughout the 2017 financial 
year at any of our locations.
The electricity, gas and water used at our UK sites is 
monitored on a weekly basis to spot peaks in usage. 
The aim is to identify possible improvements to 
reduce energy consumption of these processes.
With evolving environmental legislation within 
Europe and USA, Avon ensures compliance through 
regular environmental updates from its membership 
to the Institute of Environmental Management and 
Assessment (IEMA).
In order to secure the 
future of the business 
we are committed 
to contributing to 
economic, social 
and environmental 
sustainability, both 
locally and globally. The 
Directors acknowledge 
that this involves 
balancing the interests 
of shareholders, 
employees, customers, 
suppliers and the wider 
communities in which 
our business operates.
THE GROUP’S APPROACH
A forward thinking approach to health and safety, 
the environment, business ethics and employee 
engagement are of paramount importance and we 
constantly endeavour to improve our systems to 
maintain our excellent record.

MANDATORY CARBON REDUCTION SCHEME
The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013 requires 
quoted companies to include within their annual 
report details of greenhouse gas emissions 
for which they are responsible and other 
environmental matters for which key  
performance indicators are selected.
Avon has employees in each of its facilities who are 
responsible for collecting and acting on the data.  
The collected data allows the organisation to 
monitor and examine carbon emission trends.

BUSINESS ETHICS
Our Code of Conduct (‘the Code’) sets out the 
values and standards of behaviour expected from 
all those working for or on behalf of Avon and 
is available on the Group’s website. The Code 
requires all representatives of the Group to comply 
with the laws and regulations in the countries 
in which we operate. It also contains guidance 
on avoiding conflicts of interest, confidentiality, 
adherence to export controls, our approach to 
gifts and hospitality, bribery and corruption and 
managing relationships with third parties. 
We encourage everyone to report any behaviour, 
which may be a breach of the Code, or is unethical 
or illegal. 
We implement and enforce effective systems to 
uphold our zero-tolerance approach to bribery 
and corruption. To ensure we only work with third 
parties whose standards are consistent with our 
own, all agents and third parties who act on behalf 
of the Group are obliged by written agreement to 
comply with the standards set out in the Code. In 
addition, a programme of supplier audits exists to 
ensure suppliers adhere to Avon’s standards.
Avon is fully committed to respecting the human 
rights of all those working with or for us. We do not 
accept any form of child or forced labour and we 
will not do business with anyone who fails to uphold 
these standards.
Avon has a zero-tolerance approach to modern 
slavery and is committed to acting with integrity 
in all of its business dealings and relationships and 
to implementing and enforcing effective measures 
to ensure modern slavery is not taking place in the 
business or its supply chains. Our first Modern 
Slavery Act statement is on our website and will be 
updated in 2018 to reflect the progress made. 
EMPLOYEES
Our success depends on our people. The Group aims 
to support all employees to develop their potential 
and we are committed to recognising, encouraging 
and nurturing talent across our business. 
We are committed to providing a working 
environment where everyone feels respected and 
valued and we pursue equality of opportunity in 
all employment practices, policies and procedures 
regardless of race, nationality, gender, age, marital 
status, sexual orientation, disability and religious or 
political beliefs. A formal diversity policy is in place, 
setting out our approach to diversity. A copy can 
be found in the corporate governance section of 
our website.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW OUR CORE VALUES
The Group’s core values are 
embodied by the acronym 
CREED, a set of principles 
and cultural values rigorously 
pursued and adhered to across 
the Group.
C
Understanding and delivering 
our customer (internal/
external) needs and 
expectations. 
R
Motivating our people through 
appropriate recognition and 
reward programmes.
E
Providing responsibility 
through meaningful employee 
empowerment.
E
Ensuring a friendly and engaged 
environment that embraces 
worthwhile communications where 
innovation is encouraged.
D
Recognising the value of 
cultural diversity and talent 
across our business.
Environment and Corporate Social Responsibility continued
“Great Place to Work is a framework 
that gives every  employee an 
opportunity to contribute towards a 
culture  that truly does make Avon a 
great place to work. The framework 
comprises five key areas: Recognition, 
Communication, Wellbeing, 
Community and Training and 
Development.”
RECOGNITION
All employees have a part to play in 
ensuring Avon remains a great place 
to work. One of our corporate values 
is to motivate our people through 
appropriate recognition and  
reward programmes.
 
Under our reward programme, employees 
can nominate colleagues whom they believe 
embody one or more of the CREED values in 
their job performance. Each month all those 
nominated receive a recognition award from 
the Group, with a quarterly and annual winner 
selected from those nominated. The 2017 
Albinea Annual Site winner, Giovanni Grasselli, 
is pictured above with Paul McDonald, Chief 
Executive Officer. 
COMMUNICATION 
Employee engagement is important 
to us and effective communication 
throughout the business is vital in 
achieving this. 
We communicate our strategy, performance 
and business priorities to all employees in a 
variety of ways, including through our intranet 
sites, email and quarterly newsletters as 
well as through regular employee meetings 
at all levels of the organisation. We also 
encourage employees to provide feedback 
to the business, either face to face or 
through discussion boards on our intranet. 
All employees have the ability to make 
suggestions directly to the CEO via our  
‘Ask the CEO’ mailbox.
Part of the communication programme is our 
employee opinion survey. The survey gives 
employees the opportunity to give anonymous 
feedback to management, which we assess and 
use to inspire improvement plans. The survey 
helps to ensure Avon listens to its employees 
and strives for continuing improvement. This 
year’s survey had a response rate of 67% 
against a target of 50%. The responses are 
evaluated by each level of management and it 
will continue to be a platform that helps Avon 
invest in its people and drive success. 
WELLBEING
Under our wellbeing initiative, we 
offer healthy lifestyle support and 
advice, with the aim of encouraging 
better health and wellbeing for 
all employees.
We believe wellbeing works best when the 
experience is a shared one, we have regular 
global wellness challenges for our employees 
to take part in to help stimulate small changes 
to improve their overall health. These include 
challenges related to increasing activity levels, 
eating healthier and drinking more water.
We have a global wellness week each year 
with a variety of activities on offer at all of our 
sites including healthy eating options in our 
canteens, a wellness fair and health quizzes. 
Pictured above is the team at AEF and their 
healthy lunchtime options.
Our wellbeing programme also covers 
financial wellness. We operate group-wide 
employee share plans to encourage our staff 
to participate in the future of the Group 
through share ownership. All UK employees 
are entitled to participate in the Share 
Incentive Plan whilst US employees are 
invited to join the Employee Stock Purchase 
Plan. Both provide the opportunity to 
purchase shares through payroll deductions.
COMMUNITY
We aim to work with and for the 
communities in which we operate, 
recognising our role as a major employer 
in our geographical site locations. We 
are aware of the impact the Group has 
on its local environment and seek to 
contribute to its economic, social and 
environmental sustainability.
Our community programme is led from the 
bottom up rather than top down, which means 
each site is empowered to create their own 
initiatives to help benefit their local community. 
Engaging with, and giving back positively 
to the local community ensures that we are 
supporting our employees, their friends and 
families. We also work with many charitable 
organisations who are involved in some way 
with the areas of business in which we operate.
This year we launched the #thinkSTEM 
campaign to help address the issue of skills 
shortage in science, technology, engineering 
and maths careers. Through this campaign, we 
want to inspire more young people to consider 
STEM related careers and we do this by working 
with our local schools to engage with pupils 
from a young age to help them understand the 
different opportunities available to them.
We recognise the value provided to local and 
wider communities by members of the reserve 
forces and those in public service. We are 
proud to have employees serving and a number 
of our employees are part of service families. 
We support their commitment and dedication 
to serve.
It’s not just about supporting our local 
communities, it’s also about creating a 
community at work. That’s why we offer 
opportunities for our employees to establish 
relationships with each other outside of their  
day to day job. From football matches to 
bake-offs, we want our employees to feel 
that working within and for the community 
is embedded within the culture of the 
organisation. Pictured below is the bake-off  
held at our Melksham facility to raise money 
for Macmillan Cancer Support.
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
We want to attract, retain and 
develop talented individuals.
We strive to provide an environment that 
offers the right training and development to 
ensure we retain our employees. By providing 
a combination of formal training opportunities 
and on the job experiences, our employees 
have the opportunity to achieve their 
potential and become the future leaders  
of our business.
We will run our flagship Global Leadership 
Programme in the new financial year for 
individuals identified as having the potential 
to be future leaders. Several of our senior 
executives and other influential managers 
have previously completed this programme, 
which is testimony to the value added to the 
business from this initiative. 
Our global Professional Development 
Programme has completed two cycles. 
The programme enables participants across 
our business to manage their own career 
development through setting self-learning 
objectives with the help and guidance of a 
mentor from the senior leadership team and  
an external facilitator. 
Employees can apply for training grants for 
qualifications they wish to work towards. 
Avon funds half of the tuition fees and loans 
the other half to the employee, repaid over 
time. So far the initiative has helped the 
continued development of many departments 
across the business.
We also offer numerous positions for 
placement students in our engineering team, 
both in the US and the UK. The students 
help us tackle real-world engineering 
problems as they learn about the profession 
as well as having the potential for long-term 
employment within Avon. A number of our 
student placements have taken up full-time 
employment with the Group following their 
graduation and contribute significantly to 
Group achievements. 
Our graduate recruitment scheme is now in 
its third year and two new graduates joined in 
September to support the growing needs of 
our business. The scheme is based on a two 
year ‘work and learn’ programme designed to 
bring new talent into our organisation.

Corporate Governance Report Board of Directors
The Board of Directors believes in high standards 
of corporate governance, notwithstanding the 
Company’s size and status as a member of the FTSE 
SmallCap Index, and is accountable to shareholders 
for the Group’s performance in this area. This 
statement describes how the Group is applying the 
relevant principles of governance, as set out in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) which 
is available on the website of the Financial Reporting 
Council (‘FRC’). 
The Company is a smaller company for the purposes 
of the Code and in consequence certain provisions 
of the Code either do not apply to the Company 
or may be judged to be disproportionate or less 
relevant in its case.
The Board considers that throughout 2017, Avon 
complied with the Code, save that the Senior 
Independent Director does not attend meetings 
with the major shareholders to listen to their views 
(which is explained further below).
This statement will address the main subject areas 
of the Code, namely leadership, effectiveness, 
accountability and relations with shareholders. 
Remuneration is dealt with in the Remuneration 
Report on pages 53 to 74.
The Board has an established framework of 
internal controls covering both financial and non-
financial controls. In addition, there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
significant business risks faced by the Group. This 
process was in place throughout the 2017 financial 
year and accords with the FRC’s Guidance for 
Directors on Internal Control. 
THE BOARD
During the year there have been three changes 
to the membership of the Board. Andrew Lewis, 
Group Finance Director, stepped down from the 
Board on 30 November 2016 and was replaced by 
interim Group Finance Director, Paul Rayner, on 
1 December 2016. Mr Rayner stepped down from 
the Board when Nick Keveth was appointed Chief 
Financial Officer on 1 June 2017. Rob Rennie, 
Chief Executive Officer, stepped down from the 
Board on 15 February 2017 and was replaced by 
Paul McDonald.
Rules concerning the appointment and replacement 
of Directors of the Company are contained in the 
Articles of Association.
Amendments to the Articles must be approved 
by a special resolution of shareholders. Under the 
Articles, all Directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first annual general meeting 
following their appointment, and to re-election 
thereafter at intervals of no more than three years.
The Board is aware of the FRC’s suggestion that 
companies outside the FTSE 350 should consider 
the annual re-election of all Directors. On the basis 
that this is not a requirement of the Code and it has 
not been raised as an issue by any shareholders the  
Board has chosen not to change its existing practice.
Non-Executive Directors submit themselves for 
annual re-election if they have served for more than 
nine years since first election.
The Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the 
Board on terms which allow for termination on three 
months’ notice. Copies of Executive Directors’ service 
contracts and terms and conditions of appointment for 
Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at 
the Registered Office and prior to the AGM.
Biographies of the Directors appear on page 42. 
These illustrate the range of business and financial 
experience upon which the Board is able to call. 
The intention of the Board is that its membership 
should be balanced between executives and non-
executives and have the appropriate skills and 
experience. The special position and role of the 
Chairman under the Code is recognised by the 
Board and a written statement of the division of 
responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer has been agreed. The Chairman is responsible 
for the leadership of the Board and ensuring its 
effectiveness on all aspects of its role. The Chief 
Executive Officer manages the Group and has the 
prime role, with the assistance of the Board, of 
developing and implementing business strategy.
One of the roles of the Non-Executive Directors 
under the leadership of the Chairman is to 
undertake detailed examination and discussion of 
strategies proposed by the Executive Directors, so 
as to ensure that decisions are in the best long-term 
interests of shareholders and take proper account of 
the interests of the Group’s other stakeholders. The 
Chairman ensures that meetings of Non-Executive 
Directors without the Executive Directors are held.

The Remuneration Committee’s principal responsibilities are to decide on remuneration policy on behalf of 
the Board and to determine remuneration packages and other terms and conditions of employment, including 
appropriate performance related benefits for the Executive Directors and other senior executives. More details 
of the activities of the Remuneration Committee are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 53 to 74.
ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS
The Board schedules eight regular meetings per year. This year, three further meetings were convened to 
deal with matters arising between scheduled meetings. 
The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer attend meetings of the Committee by 
invitation, but are absent when issues relating to each of them are discussed.

HOW THE BOARD OPERATES
The Chairman ensures through the Company 
Secretary that the Board agenda and all relevant 
information is provided to the Board sufficiently 
in advance of meetings and that adequate time 
is available for discussion of all agenda items, in 
particular strategic issues. The Chief Executive 
Officer and the Company Secretary discuss the 
agenda ahead of every meeting. At meetings the 
Chairman ensures that all Directors are able to 
make an effective contribution and every Director 
is encouraged to participate and provide opinions 
on each agenda item. The Chairman always seeks to 
achieve unanimous decisions of the Board following 
due discussion of agenda items. The Non-Executive 
Directors fully review the Group’s operational 
performance and the Board as a whole has, with a 
view to reinforcing its oversight and control, reserved 
a list of powers solely to itself which are not to be 
delegated to management.
This list includes appropriate strategic, financial, 
organisational and compliance issues, including the 
approval of high level announcements, circulars 
and the Annual Report and Accounts and certain 
strategic and management issues.
Examples of strategic and management issues 
include the following:
• Approval of the annual operating budget and the 
three year plan
• The extension of the Group’s activities into new 
business and geographic areas (or their cessation)
• Changes to the corporate or capital structure
• Financial issues, including changes in accounting 
policy, the approval of dividends, bank facilities  
and guarantees
• Changes to the constitution of the Board
• The approval of significant contracts, for 
example the acquisition or disposal of assets 
worth more than £1,000,000 or the exposure 
of the Company or the Group to a risk greater 
than £1,000,000
• The approval of unbudgeted capital expenditure 
exceeding £250,000
• The approval of quotations and sale contracts 
where the sales commission payable to an 
intermediary exceeds 10% of the net invoice price
• Consideration and approval of all proposed 
acquisitions and mergers
Each Director has full and timely access to all 
relevant information and the Board meets regularly 
with appropriate contact between meetings. All 
Directors receive a tailored induction to the Group 
from the Company Secretary on joining the Board. 
When appointed, Non-Executive Directors are 
made aware of and acknowledge their ability to 
meet the time commitments necessary to fulfil 
their Board and Committee duties. Procedures are 
in place, which have been agreed by the Board, for 
Directors, where necessary in the furtherance of 
their duties, to take independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense and all Directors have 
access to the Company Secretary. The Company 
Secretary is responsible to the Board for ensuring 
that all Board procedures are complied with. The 
removal of the Company Secretary is a decision for 
the Board as a whole.
COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD
Of particular importance in a governance context 
are the three committees of the Board, namely 
the Remuneration Committee, the Nomination 
Committee and the Audit Committee. Each 
Committee operates under clear terms of reference, 
copies of which are available on our website. Detail 
of the operation of each Committee is provided 
within the relevant Committees’ report.
The members of the Committees comprise the 
Chairman and all the Non-Executive Directors. 
The Company Secretary advises and acts as a 
secretary to the Committees. The Non-Executive 
Directors continue to regard the Chairman as 
adding significant value to the deliberations of the 
Audit Committee and his membership is ratified 
by Provision C.3.1. of the Code, which permits 
listed companies outside the FTSE 350 to allow the 
Chairman to sit on the Audit Committee where he 
or she was considered independent on appointment 
as Chairman. Pim Vervaat is Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. The Board is satisfied that Mr Vervaat 
has recent relevant financial experience and his 
profile appears on page 42. David Evans is Chairman 
of the Nomination Committee but, in accordance 
with the Committee’s terms of reference, is not 
permitted to chair meetings when the Committee 
is dealing with matters relating to the Board 
Chairman position. Chloe Ponsonby is Chair of  
the Remuneration Committee.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The Board conducts an annual review of its 
performance and that of its Committees and 
the individual Directors. The 2017 Board 
evaluation process was conducted internally, led 
by the Chairman and facilitated by the Company 
Secretary. All Board members completed detailed 
questionnaires and took part in individual 
interviews. The evaluation covered a number of 
areas including: Board remit and responsibilities, 
Committees and their operation, induction and 
development; Group strategy, internal control 
and risk management. A detailed discussion of the 
findings was held at the September Board meeting 
to consider the matters raised. 
The results of the evaluation concluded that all 
Board members considered that the Board, its 
Committees and individual Directors performed 
effectively during 2017, both individually and as a 
collective unit. 
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Directors regard regular communications with 
shareholders as extremely important. All members 
of the Board receive copies of analysts’ reports of 
which the Company is made aware and receive an 
investor relations report from the Chief Financial 
Officer at every Board meeting.
The Board reports formally to its shareholders 
in a number of ways, including regulatory news 
announcements or press releases in response to 
events or routine reporting obligations, a detailed 
Annual Report and Accounts and, at the half year,  
an interim report.
Regular dialogue takes place with institutional 
shareholders, including presentations after the 
Company’s preliminary announcements of the half 
and full year results. The Board receives comments 
from analyst meetings and shareholder meetings 
after both interim and final results and at other 
times during the year.

INTERNAL CONTROL
There is a clearly defined delegation of authority 
from the Board to the business units, with 
appropriate reporting lines to individual Executive 
Directors. There are procedures for the authorisation 
of capital expenditure and investment, together with 
procedures for post-completion appraisal.
Internal controls are in existence which provide 
reasonable assurance of the maintenance of proper 
accounting records and the reliability of financial 
information used within the business or for publication.
The Group finance department manages the financial 
reporting process to ensure that there is appropriate 
control and review of the financial information 
including the production of the consolidated annual 
accounts. Group Finance is supported by the 
operational finance managers throughout the Group, 
who have the responsibility and accountability 
for providing information in keeping with our 
policies, procedures and internal best practices as 
documented in the internal control manual.
The Board has issued a Code of Conduct which 
reinforces the importance of a robust internal 
control framework throughout the Group. The 
Board recognises that an open and honest culture is 
key to understanding concerns within the business 
and to uncovering and investigating any potential 
wrongdoing. The Code of Conduct sets out the 
procedure whereby individuals may raise concerns 
in matters of financial reporting or any other matter 
of concern with management and directly with 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee to ensure 
independent investigation and appropriate follow  
up action. The Code of Conduct is reviewed annually.
Although the Board itself retains the ultimate power 
and authority in relation to decision making, the 
Audit Committee meets at least three times a year 
with management and external auditors to review 
specific accounting, reporting and financial control 
matters. This Committee also reviews the interim, 
preliminary and annual statements and has primary 
responsibility for making a recommendation on 
the appointment, reappointment and removal of 
external auditors.
DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY RULES (‘DTR’)
Disclosures in respect of the DTR requirements under 
DTR 7.2.6 are given in the Directors’ Report on pages 
75 to 79 and have been included by reference.
GOING CONCERN
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors 
have, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, formed a judgement that there is a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and Group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
the Directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
This conclusion is based on a review of the 
resources available to the Group, taking account 
of the Group’s financial projections together with 
available cash and committed borrowing facilities.
In reaching this conclusion, the Board has 
considered the magnitude of potential impacts 
resulting from uncertain future events or changes 
in conditions, the likelihood of their occurrence and 
the likely effectiveness of mitigating actions that the 
Directors would consider undertaking. 
LONG-TERM VIABILITY STATEMENT
The Directors have assessed the viability of the 
Group over a three year period to September 2020, 
taking account of the Group’s current position 
and the potential impact of the principal risks 
documented in the Strategic Report. Based on 
this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the period to September 2020.
In making this statement, the Directors have 
considered the resilience of the Group, taking account 
of its current position, the principal risks facing the 
business in severe but reasonable scenarios, and the 
effectiveness of any mitigating actions.
This assessment has considered the potential 
impacts of these risks on the business model, future 
performance, solvency and liquidity over the period.
The Directors have determined that the three year 
period to September 2020 is an appropriate period 
over which to provide its viability statement. In 
making their assessment, the Directors have taken 
account of the Group’s net cash position (see note 
22), its ability to raise new finance in most market 
conditions and other potential mitigating actions 
such as restricting dividend payments.

RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS 
CONTINUED
Shareholders have the opportunity to ask questions 
at the AGM and also have the opportunity to leave 
written questions with the Company Secretary 
for the response of the Directors. The Directors 
also make themselves available after the AGM to 
talk informally to shareholders, should they wish 
to do so and respond throughout the year to any 
correspondence from individual shareholders.
At the AGM on 1 February 2018, the Board will 
be following the recommendations in the Code 
regarding the constructive use of annual general 
meetings; as usual, the agenda will include a 
presentation by the Chief Executive Officer 
on aspects of the Group’s business and an 
opportunity for shareholders to ask questions. 
The level of proxies received for each AGM 
resolution is declared after the resolution has 
been dealt with on a show of hands, providing no 
poll has been called for. The Board has no plans 
to introduce poll voting on all business at general 
meetings as a substitute for using proxy votes,  
as this is not a requirement of the Code.
The Non-Executive Directors, having considered 
the Code with regard to relations with shareholders, 
are of the view that it is most appropriate for the 
shareholders to have regular dialogue with the 
Executive Directors. The results of all dialogue with 
shareholders are communicated to the Board and 
reviewed by all Non-Executive Directors. However, 
should shareholders have concerns, which they feel 
cannot be resolved through normal shareholder 
meetings, the Chairman, Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director and the remaining Non-
Executive Director may be contacted through  
the Company Secretary.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
The Code requires that Directors review the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
controls on a continuing basis. The scope of this 
review covers all controls including financial, 
operational and compliance controls, as well as risk 
management. As indicated earlier, the Board has 
put in place a framework of internal controls and 
the Audit Committee has responsibility to review, 
monitor and make policy and recommendations to 
the Board upon all such matters.
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for 
the Group’s system of internal control. The Board, 
through the Audit Committee, keeps this system 
under continuous review and formally considers its 
content and its effectiveness on an annual basis. 
Such a system can provide only reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatements 
or losses. The section on internal control in the 
Audit Committee Report on pages 50 to 52 and 
the following paragraphs describe relevant key 
procedures within the Group’s systems of internal 
control and the process by which the Directors have 
reviewed their effectiveness.
Systems exist throughout the Group which provide 
for the creation of three year plans and annual 
budgets; monthly reports enable the Board to 
compare performance against budget and to take 
action where appropriate.
Procedures are in place to identify all major 
business risks and to evaluate their potential 
impact on the Group.
These risks are described within the Strategic 
Report on pages 32 to 35. 
RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk is managed by the Group Executive team 
during the year, led by the Company Secretary and 
the Chief Executive Officer. The Group Executive 
team sets its key priorities for successfully managing 
the Group’s businesses. This process inherently 
addresses risk and the Company Secretary leads 
an exercise that ensures the known risks to the 
businesses, together with any newly identified risks, 
are assessed and analysed effectively and that the 
priorities eliminate, minimise, control or transfer risk 
(or the effect thereof) as appropriate. The Company 
Secretary also sponsors a review of the continuing 
effectiveness of other aspects of the control 
environment by the Group Executive team.
The Board carried out quarterly reviews of the key 
risks facing the Group during the year, following 
the quarterly reviews conducted by the Group 
Executive management team.
The Board also carried out an annual review of the 
major business risks affecting the Group, including 
the macro risks. In the year under review, the risk 
assessments carried out both at business level 
and at Board level continue to be reviewed and 
strengthened.

The Nomination Committee is also responsible  
for the Board’s policy on diversity.
The Board recognises the benefits of diversity. 
Diversity of skills, background, knowledge, 
international and industry experience, and gender, 
amongst many other factors, will be taken into 
consideration when seeking to appoint new Directors 
to the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Board 
appointments will always be made on merit. The 
Board’s diversity policy can be found in the Corporate 
Governance section of the Company’s website.
Further information, including the number of 
women in senior management and within the 
organisation is shown in the Environmental  
and Corporate Social Responsibility Report on  
pages 36 to 39.
RECENT APPOINTMENTS TO THE BOARD
The Committee initiated the recruitment process  
for a permanent successor to the departing Group 
Finance Director, Andrew Lewis, following the 
announcement on 18 October 2016 that he would 
step down from the Board on 30 November 2016. 
The Committee directed the selection process,  
which included agreeing a candidate profile and 
engaging SR Search to work with the Committee  
on this assignment. 
SR Search researched the market for potential 
candidates to produce a ‘long list’ of candidates  
for the Committee’s consideration. The potential 
candidates were considered on the basis of their  
skills and experience and shortlisted for interview 
with members of the Nomination Committee 
and the Chief Executive Officer. Nick Keveth 
was identified as the preferred candidate and 
was appointed Chief Financial Officer on 1 June 
2017. To allow sufficient time to run a robust and 
comprehensive recruitment process, the Committee 
recommended to the Board the appointment of an 
interim Group Finance Director, Paul Rayner who 
was in post from 1 December 2016 to 1 June 2017.
The Nomination Committee reviews the Board 
structure, leads the process for Board appointments 
and makes recommendations to the Board, including 
on Board succession planning. The Nomination 
Committee evaluates the balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience on the Board and, in light of this 
evaluation, prepares a description of the role for  
new appointments.
In identifying potential candidates for positions as 
Non-Executive Directors, the Committee has full 
regard to the principles of the Code regarding the 
independence of Non-Executive Directors.
The Committee meets at least once each year and 
thereafter as circumstances dictate. The Committee 
met four times during the year in connection with 
identifying replacements for Mr Lewis and Mr Rennie. 
MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES
The main responsibilities of the Committee are  
as follows:
• To lead the process for identifying and nominating 
candidates for the approval of the Board, to fill 
Board vacancies as and when they arise
• To put in place plans for succession
• To regularly review the Board’s structure, 
size and composition taking into account the 
challenges and opportunities facing the Group 
and the skills, knowledge and experience needed 
by the Board and make recommendations to the 
Board with regard to any changes
The Committee’s terms of reference are available 
within the Corporate Governance section of the 
Company’s website.
All Directors are appointed by the Board following 
a rigorous selection process and subsequent 
recommendation by the Committee. Board 
appointments are made on merit, against criteria 
identified by the Committee having regard to the 
benefits of diversity on the Board, including gender.
SR Search have no other connection with the 
Company and are an independent provider of 
recruitment services to the Company.
At the time of departure of Rob Rennie, the 
Committee recommended to the Board the 
appointment of Paul McDonald as replacement 
Chief Executive Officer. Following an intensive 
interview process, the Committee came to the 
view that, as an internal candidate with extensive 
experience, Mr McDonald had the appropriate skills 
to take on the role. No external recruitment process 
was run to identify Mr Rennie’s successor and Mr 
McDonald was appointed on 15 February 2017.

FINANCIAL REPORTING
During the year the Committee reviewed the 
appropriateness of the Group’s half year and full 
year financial statements including considering 
significant financial reporting judgments made by 
management, taking into account reports from 
management and the external auditors. The main 
areas of focus considered by the Committee during 
2017 were as follows:
• The presentation of the financial statements 
and, in particular, the presentation of adjusted 
performance and the adjusting items. The 
Committee reviewed a paper prepared by 
management and reviewed the disclosure of 
adjusted items within the Group’s half year and 
full year results, agreeing that the position taken 
in the financial statements is appropriate
• Review of the key judgements made in 
estimating the Group’s tax charge. The review 
and discussion included an update on the current 
position and the status of discussions with 
the relevant tax authorities. The Committee 
agreed that the position taken in the financial 
statements is appropriate
• The impairment review in respect of intangible 
assets and goodwill on acquisition. Following a 
review of a report summarising the key issues in 
relation to impairment, the Committee concurred 
with management’s assessment to record an 
impairment charge against the carrying value 
of intangible assets relating to the Emergency 
Escape Breathing Device. The Committee 
concurred with management’s assessment that 
the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired
• Review of the funding level of the defined benefit 
pension scheme. As the costs, assets and liabilities 
are regularly reviewed and advice is taken from an 
independent actuary on the appropriateness of 
the assumptions used, the Committee agreed this 
was being managed appropriately
MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES
• Reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s 
financial reporting, internal control policies and 
procedures for the identification, assessment and 
reporting of risk
• Reviewing significant financial reporting issues  
and judgements
• Monitoring the integrity of the Company’s  
financial statements
• Keeping the relationship with the auditors under 
review, including their terms of engagement, fees 
and independence
• Monitoring the role and effectiveness of the 
internal audit function
• Advising the Board on whether the Committee 
believes the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy
ACTIVITIES DURING THE YEAR
The Audit Committee meets three times a year. 
Meetings are also attended by the Executive 
Directors and the Group’s external auditors. Time is 
allowed for the Audit Committee to discuss issues 
with the external auditors at each meeting without 
the Executive Directors being present.
An annual rolling agenda is reviewed to ensure that 
all matters within the Audit Committee’s Terms 
of Reference during the year are appropriately 
covered. The Committee operates under formal 
terms of reference and these are reviewed annually. 
The Committee considers that it has discharged its 
responsibilities as set out in its terms of reference to 
the extent appropriate during the year.
• The accounting treatment in respect of share 
based payments. Following consideration 
of a report by management, the Committee 
concurred with management’s conclusions that 
the non-cash charge to the income statement 
for share based payments had been understated 
in error in previous years, as a result of share 
awards under the Performance Share Plan 
having been undervalued for accounting 
purposes. The Committee agreed that the 
revised valuations prepared by independent 
valuation experts were appropriate and 
accepted management’s recommendation to 
restate the 2016 consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income
• At the request of the Board, the Committee 
considered whether the 2017 Annual Report 
was fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether it provided the necessary information 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Having taken account of the other information 
provided to the Board throughout the year, 
the Committee was satisfied that, taken as a 
whole, the Annual Report and Accounts was fair, 
balanced and understandable
The Committee was content, after due challenge 
and debate, with the assumptions made and the 
judgements applied in the accounts and agreed 
with management’s recommendations. In addition, 
the Committee reviewed and recommended 
the approval of the statements on corporate 
governance, internal control and risk management  
in the Annual Report and Accounts and the half  
year and all trading statements.
EXTERNAL AUDITORS
The Committee oversees the relationship with 
the external auditors and monitors all services 
provided by and fees payable to them, to ensure 
that potential conflicts of interest are considered 
and that an objective and professional relationship 
is maintained. In particular the Committee reviews 
and monitors the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditors and the effectiveness of the 
audit process. At the outset of the audit process, 
the Committee receives from the auditors a detailed 
audit plan, identifying their assessment of the 
key risks and their intended areas of focus. This is 
agreed with the Committee to ensure coverage is 
appropriately focused.
Feedback on the audit process is requested 
from management. For the 2017 financial year, 
management were satisfied that there had been 
appropriate focus and challenge on the primary areas 
of audit risk and assessed the quality of the audit 
process as satisfactory. The Committee concurred 
with the view of management. The Committee also 
keeps under review the nature, extent, objectivity 
and cost of non-audit services provided by the 
external auditors.
The Audit Committee keeps the assessment of the 
need to tender the audit mandate under continuing 
review. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) have 
been the Company’s external auditors for well 
over 20 years and as disclosed in last year’s report, 
under new legislation on mandatory audit firm 
rotation, PwC would not be able to be appointed 
as the Company’s external auditors after 2020. 
Following the change in Executive management, 
the Committee recommended to the Board that 
the Company bring forward the tender process 
for the external audit mandate and appoint a new 
external auditor for 2018. The Board accepted the 
recommendation at its meeting on 9 November 
2017 and requested the Audit Committee run a 
tender process in early 2018. 
As the tender process will not have concluded 
before the AGM, and the Company should at all 
times have an auditor in place, PwC have confirmed 
their willingness to stand for reappointment as 
auditor of the Company at the upcoming AGM. 
Following the completion of the tender process in 
2018 the Board will appoint a successor to PwC 
in respect of the current financial year until the 
conclusion of the 2019 AGM, at which shareholders 
will be invited to vote on the reappointment of the 
successor firm.

In addition, site controllers and plant managers are 
obliged to positively confirm, on a bi-annual basis, 
that the controls as documented in the internal 
control manual are in place and are being adhered 
to, with specific reference to key controls such 
as bank and control account reconciliations. This 
process has been in place for the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts. It has been reviewed by the Board 
and continues to be monitored by the Committee, 
which remains satisfied with the arrangements.
No significant failings or weaknesses were identified 
by the internal audit process but several minor 
improvements were identified and implemented. 
As part of its work, and in line with its terms of 
reference, the Committee also considers the 
discharge of the Board’s responsibilities in the areas 
of corporate governance, financial reporting and 
internal control, including the internal management 
of risk, as identified in the Code and the FRC 
guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial Business Reporting.
Risk management activities are dealt with in more 
detail in the Corporate Governance Report on 
pages 43 to 47. 
Pim Vervaat
Chairman of the Audit Committee
15 November 2017
In order to ensure the independence and objectivity 
of the external auditors and avoid a situation where 
the auditor’s familiarity with the Group’s affairs 
results in excessive trust, the Committee maintains 
a formal Auditor Independence Policy. This policy 
provides clear definitions of services that the 
external auditors can and cannot provide. They 
may only provide non-audit services where those 
services do not conflict with their independence. 
A formal authorisation policy is in place for the 
provision of non-audit services to ensure that 
appropriate pre-approval is obtained as necessary. 
The latest version provides that non-audit services 
permitted under the policy with a value of more 
than £50,000 or which cumulatively exceed the 
annual audit fee require the approval of the Board. 
This approach was preferred to capping the value 
of non-audit services performed by the external 
auditor by reference to the external audit fee. The 
policy also establishes guidelines for the recruitment 
of employees or former employees of the external 
auditor. To ensure compliance with this policy the 
Audit Committee carried out a review during the 
year of the remuneration received by PwC for audit 
services, audit-related services and non-audit work. 
The breakdown of the fees paid to the external 
auditor, including the split between audit and 
non-audit is included in note 5 on page 101 of the 
financial statements. No non-audit services were 
carried out by PwC during the year. These reviews 
ensure a balance of objectivity, value for money and 
compliance with this policy. The outcome of these 
reviews was that no conflicts of interest existed 
between such audit and non-audit work.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Committee regularly reviews the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal controls and risk 
management. This involves the monitoring and review 
of the effectiveness of internal audit activities, which 
included a review of the audits carried out and the 
results thereof, the management response and the 
programme and resourcing for 2017 and 2018. The 
Committee believes it is appropriate that the internal 
audit process is undertaken by members of the 
finance team who conduct financial reviews of the 
sites on a rotational basis.
Remuneration Report
LETTER FROM THE CHAIR OF THE 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 
30 September 2017. 
The Remuneration Report is split into three sections:
• This Annual Statement summarising the work of 
the Remuneration Committee in 2017
• The Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) 
as approved at the 2016 AGM
• The Annual Report on Remuneration, which 
provides details of the remuneration earned by 
Directors in the year ended 30 September 2017 
under the Policy. This will be the subject of an 
advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM
2017 PERFORMANCE
As set out in the Strategic Report, the results for 
the year ended 30 September 2017 reflect another 
strong performance, confirming the progress 
the Group has made over the past 12 months 
in delivering growth. Increases were seen in 
revenue (14%) adjusted operating profit (23%) and 
adjusted earnings per share (15%). Strong financial 
management has produced good cash conversion, 
meaning the Group ended the year with net cash 
of £24.7m.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE  
ACTIVITIES IN 2017
The key decisions made by the Remuneration 
Committee (‘the Committee’) in respect of 2017 
remuneration were as follows:
Board changes
In a year of change at Board level, the Committee 
oversaw the negotiation of and approved all 
packages paid to current and former Executive 
Directors as follows: 
• Following eight successful years as Group 
Finance Director and as announced to 
shareholders on 18 October 2016, Andrew 
Lewis stood down as Group Finance Director on 
30 November 2016. It was agreed that a short 
period of handover would be helpful and Andrew 
remained an employee of the Group, receiving 
his salary, pension and other contractual benefits 
until 16 December 2016. Full details of the terms 
agreed in connection with Mr Lewis’s departure 
are disclosed in the Remuneration Report
• The Board retained the services of Paul 
Rayner, an experienced listed company Finance 
Director, on an interim basis while the search 
for a permanent successor for Mr Lewis was 
conducted. The remuneration agreed for Mr 
Rayner was specific to the interim nature of his 
appointment and details of the remuneration 
paid are set out on page 67
• Rob Rennie stepped down as Chief Executive 
Officer on 15 February 2017 to pursue other 
interests. Details of Mr Rennie’s leaving package 
are disclosed on pages 72 and 73. In summary 
the Company agreed to pay Mr Rennie’s salary 
for his 12 month notice period in monthly 
instalments, subject to an obligation on Mr 
Rennie to mitigate his loss, such that monthly 
payments would either reduce or cease in the 
event Mr Rennie gained new employment or 
remuneration. Mr Rennie remained entitled to 
participate in the 2017 annual bonus scheme on 
a pro-rated basis, with the personal performance 
element removed. All of Mr Rennie’s outstanding 
share awards lapsed in full
• Paul McDonald was appointed Chief Executive 
Officer on 15 February 2017 and Nick Keveth 
was appointed Chief Financial Officer on 1 June 
2017. In accordance with our Remuneration 
Policy, annual salaries for each were set below 
the median level, at £300,000 and £230,000 
respectively. Both will be considered for increases 
to the median level on the anniversary of their 
appointment. Full details of the agreed packages 
are set out in the Remuneration Report

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW Non-Executive Director pay
• Under the Policy, the fees of Non-Executive 
Directors are reviewed and benchmarked every 
three years, with increases only implemented if 
current fees are found to be below the median of 
a comparator group. The previous review was in 
2014 and therefore a review and benchmarking 
exercise was conducted during this financial year. 
The review, which was conducted by the Board 
Chairman and the Executive Directors for the Non-
Executive Directors, excluding the Chairman, and 
by the Remuneration Committee for the Chairman, 
concluded that as current fees remained close to 
the median of the comparator group, no increases 
would be made for the 2018 financial year
Performance related pay
• The bonus outcomes for the Executive Directors 
were determined by reference to performance 
against the agreed financial business targets, 
as well as the Committee’s assessment of their 
individual performance and delivery of personal 
objectives. The Company’s financial performance 
for the year, together with the assessment of 
individual performance and contribution, resulted 
in bonus awards for the Executive Directors at 
81% of maximum for Paul McDonald and 83% 
of maximum for Nick Keveth. As both were 
appointed during the financial year, awards were 
paid on a pro-rata basis according to quarters of  
the financial year worked. Mr McDonald also 
received a bonus payment relating to the first 
half of the financial year when he was Managing 
Director of the Dairy division. This was calculated 
using slightly different financial performance 
metrics which are explained on page 68. This 
element of Paul McDonald’s bonus payment has 
not been included in the above percentage figure 
which relates only to the period while he was 
appointed Chief Executive Officer
• Vesting of the 2010 Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) 
took place in December 2016, based on the agreed 
measures of relative Total Shareholder Return 
(‘TSR’) and Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) growth over 
the three years to 30 September 2016. The overall 
vesting level achieved for these awards was 100%
• The Committee also considered the impact of 
the restatement of the 2016 income statement 
on payments made under the annual bonus 
scheme and the vesting of awards made under 
the Performance Share Plan in previous years. 
The definition of profit before interest, tax and 
exceptionals (‘PBITE’) used in the calculation of 
the annual bonus explicitly excludes the charge 
for the share based payment so the calculation 
error did not impact the achievement of the 
PBITE bonus objectives in previous years. The 
definition of EPS in the performance condition 
for PSP purposes does not exclude this charge, 
however, given the extent of overachievement 
against the maximum vesting target, the inclusion 
of the revised charge would not have impacted 
the vesting level of awards in December 2015 or 
December 2016
POLICY
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by 
shareholders at the AGM on 26 January 2016 and 
will remain in effect until the 2019 AGM. Following a 
review of feedback received from shareholders, the 
Committee decided to limit the maximum bonus for 
Executive Directors for the 2017 financial year to 
100% of salary by removing the 50% element for EPS 
growth in excess of 20% of prior year. This change is 
within the existing approved policy and therefore the 
Policy Report is not subject to a shareholder vote this 
year. This change will continue to apply for the 2018 
financial year.
LINK BETWEEN REMUNERATION  
AND COMPANY STRATEGY
The Committee seeks to support the delivery of the 
Group’s strategy through establishing appropriate 
remuneration arrangements. The Remuneration 
Policy is designed to align the Executive Directors’ 
interests with those of shareholders, and to 
incentivise the Executive Directors to meet the 
Company’s financial and strategic objectives by 
making a significant proportion of remuneration 
performance-related. The Group’s financial and 
strategic objectives are set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 10 to 39. The Committee reviews 
the application of the Policy regularly to ensure 
it remains appropriate and it expires next year 
after three years. Between now and then I will 
be working to review all aspects of Executive 
Director remuneration to ensure it is aligned with 
the new strategy communicated to shareholders 
this year. In particular, I will be reviewing the annual 
bonus scheme with the intention of proposing an 
updated scheme as part of the next version of the 
Remuneration Policy.

REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
The Company’s Remuneration Policy was approved 
by shareholders at the AGM on 26 January 2016 
and took effect from that date. The Policy Report is 
not subject to a shareholder vote this year but has 
been reproduced here for ease of reference.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for 
developing and implementing remuneration policy 
and for determining the Executive Directors’ 
individual packages and terms of service together 
with those of the other members of the Group 
Executive management team.
GUIDING POLICY
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference 
are available on the Company’s website and include:
• Determining and agreeing with the Board the 
policy for the remuneration of the Company’s 
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial 
Officer, Chairman, the Company Secretary 
and such other members of the senior 
management team as it chooses to consider or 
is designated to consider (currently the Group 
Executive management team), having regard to 
remuneration trends across the Group
• Within the terms of the agreed policy, determining 
the total individual remuneration package of each 
Executive Director including, where appropriate, 
bonuses, incentive payments, share options and 
pension arrangements. The remuneration of Non- 
Executive Directors is a matter for the Chairman 
and the Executive Directors
• Determining the targets for the performance 
related bonus schemes for the Executive Directors 
and the Group Executive management team
• Reviewing the design of all share incentive plans 
for approval by the Board and shareholders.  
For any such discretionary plans, determining 
each year whether awards will be made, the 
overall amount of such awards, the individual 
awards to Executive Directors and the Group 
Executive management team (and others) and  
the performance targets to be used
• Agreeing termination arrangements for 
senior executives
The Committee aims to provide a remuneration 
structure that supports the achievement of the 
Company’s performance objectives and, in turn, 
increases shareholder value.
The Company’s guiding policy on executive 
remuneration is that:
• Executive remuneration packages should 
take into account the linkage between pay 
and performance by both rewarding effective 
management and by making the enhancement 
of shareholder value a critical success factor in 
the setting of incentives, both in the short and 
the long-term
• The overall level of salary, incentives, pension 
and other benefits should be competitive when 
compared with other companies of a similar size 
and global spread to attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors of superior calibre in order 
to deliver continued growth of the business
• Performance related components should form a 
significant proportion of the overall remuneration 
package, with maximum total potential rewards 
being earned through the achievement of 
challenging performance targets based on 
measures that represent the best interests 
of shareholders

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION
The Committee’s policy on recruitment remuneration is that 
new Executive Directors will be offered a base salary below 
the median level in the applicable benchmarking report 
until proven, at which point they will receive an uplift to the 
benchmark median salary level determined and maintained by 
reference to independent benchmarking studies carried out 
every three years. Annual bonus awards, performance share 
plan awards and pension contributions would not be in excess 
of the current levels stated for the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Chief Financial Officer. This is the approach that has 
been followed in setting the remuneration package for the new 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
In unusual circumstances it may be necessary to pay a joining 
incentive to secure the right candidate. The Committee 
might consider paying up to 2.5 times base salary in these 
circumstances with the actual amount being defined by 
market requirements at the time. However, any such payment 
would be subject to performance conditions and a claw 
back on underperformance during the first two years of 
employment. The Committee would be very cautious before 
using such flexibility and would do so only when absolutely 
necessary to secure the right candidate. Any proposed 
buyout would take account of remuneration given up at 
the individual’s former employer and would be capped at 
the value foregone. The Company has not paid any joining 
incentives in connection with recruitment of new Directors 
under the current Remuneration Policy. 
CONSIDERATION OF CONDITIONS  
ELSEWHERE IN THE COMPANY
The experience of Committee members and an independent 
experts’ benchmarking report have been relied upon in setting 
the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and 
this Remuneration Policy. Employees have not been specifically 
consulted in this regard. In line with other small to mid-sized 
companies there is no works council and therefore there is no 
established process or platform to consult employees in relation 
to executive remuneration, although the Committee has regard 
to the general terms and conditions of employment within the 
Company. Consistent with this approach, annual cost of living 
increases granted to the wider workforce are not paid to the 
Executive Directors or to the other members of the Group 
Executive management team. The Company does hold an annual 
Employee Opinion Survey and the Committee is kept informed 
of pay and conditions applying to the general population across 
the Group. 
The Committee monitors the remuneration of the wider 
workforce and, in particular, the divisional management teams 
as well as other key employees. As with the current policy for 
the Executive Directors, general practice across the Group is 
to recruit employees at market rates and this tends to be at 
the median salary level or above to attract them to the Group. 
When considering salary increases for Directors, the Company 
will be sensitive to pay and employment conditions across the 
wider workforce.
Because of the numbers involved and the need to absorb new 
recruits at salaries comparable with those already employed, 
salaries are normalised upwards over time to the median salary 
level so that the pay level of the workforce is always kept close 
to the median level and maintained at that level by the cost 
of living increases. Employees are then able to earn annual 
bonuses in excess of the mid-market rate in return for delivering 
exceptional performance.
In addition, the Group Executive management team maintains 
a benchmarking database of all management employees in 
the Group with the aim of ensuring that each is being paid 
at or near the median local benchmark level for their role 
and that, where applicable, each has a career and associated 
salary progression plan. It is possible that some of the more 
senior personnel within that group will be brought within the 
Committee’s remit but the Committee remains comfortable 
that the Group Executive management team sets the 
remuneration for the divisional management levels beneath it 
in the organisation structure. 
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Committee engages pro-actively with the Company’s 
major shareholders. Ahead of the next Remuneration Policy 
being put to shareholders at the 2019 AGM, the Committee 
intends to consult with major shareholders. 
POLICY TABLE
Set out on the following pages is a summary of the main 
components of the remuneration policy for Directors, 
together with further information on how these aspects 
of remuneration operate. The Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 26 January 2016 and will remain in effect until 
shareholders are asked to approve a new policy at the 2019 
AGM. The Remuneration Committee has discretion to amend 
remuneration and benefits in 2018 to the extent described in 
the table and the written sections that follow it.
Element of 
remuneration
Purpose and

Maximum  
potential value Performance targets
Base Salary To provide 
competitive fixed 
remuneration.
To attract and retain 
Executive Directors 
of superior calibre  
in order to deliver 
growth for the 
business.
Intended to reflect 
that paid to senior 
management of 
comparable 
companies.
Reflects individual 
experience and role.
Reviewed every three years by the 
Remuneration Committee.
Individual salary adjustments take into 
account each Executive Director’s 
performance against agreed challenging 
objectives and the Group’s financial 
circumstances, as well as relative to  
the external market as identified in  
a benchmarking study based on an 
appropriate comparator group.
An Executive Director may be paid a 
salary supplement for fulfilling the role 
of another higher paid Executive 
Director when that Executive Director 
retires or leaves the Company.
No prescribed 
maximum triennial 
increase. Basic 
salary should 
reflect the median 
of a suitable 
comparator group.
Salary supplement  
is capped at the 
leaving Director’s 
base salary.
Not applicable.
Benefits As above. Executive Directors are entitled to 
medicals every two years and private 
health insurance. Cash for car 
payments were phased out in 2009. 
Life assurance is a benefit under the 
pension scheme but paid for by the 
Company. Small loans have been made 
in connection with the jointly owned 
equity awards under the Performance 
Share Plan.
Full cost of 
healthcare benefits 
is circa £2,000 per 
Executive Director 
per annum.
Life assurance is 
provided as part of 
a group-wide policy 
and therefore a 
specific cost cannot 
be attributed to the 
Executive Director.
Not applicable.
Annual Bonus Rewards the 
achievement of annual 
financial and strategic 
business targets and 
delivery of personal 
objectives. 
Maximum bonus only 
payable for achieving 
demanding targets.
Deferred element 
encourages long-term 
shareholding and 
discourages excessive 
risk taking.
Paid in cash except for 25% which 
is deferred into shares to be held 
for two years.
Not pensionable.
Deferral does not apply to the 
percentage award relating to 
achievement of personal objectives.
Claw back applies if the financial 
results which led to the bonus being 
paid are restated due to an error in the 
subsequent two years.
Shareholders have previously 
approved annual bonus potential for 
the CEO and CFO of up to 150% of 
salary. The Remuneration Committee 
have decided to cap CEO and CFO 
bonuses at 100% of salary for FY17 
and again in FY18.
CEO and CFO: 
150% of salary. 
Capped at 100%  
in FY17 and FY18.
The first 100% is based 
upon a combination of 
Group profit budget 
achievement (Group 
PBITE), year on year PBITE 
growth and Group cash 
generation (ratio of 
operating cash flow to 
operating profit) plus 
specific personal 
performance targets.
Bonus in excess of 100% 
of salary is based upon EPS 
growth occurring in excess 
of 20% over the previous 
year. This element of 
annual bonus was not 
included for the 2017 
financial year and 
maximum bonus potential 
is therefore capped at 
100%. The same applies 
for FY18.

Performance 
Share Plan
Designed to align 
Executive Directors’ 
interests with both the 
strategic objectives of 
delivering sustainable 
earnings growth and  
the interests of 
shareholders.
The Company has one 
Performance Share Plan,  
which was originally approved 
by shareholders in 2010 and 
most recently amended and 
approved in 2016.
Annual grants of conditional 
share awards which vest after 
a three year performance 
period, subject to achievement 
of performance targets and 
continued service.
Under the rules of 
the PSP, Executive 
Directors may 
receive a normal 
award of up to 
100% of salary and 
up to a further 
100% in exceptional 
circumstances. All 
awards to date have 
been normal. No 
exceptional awards 
have been made.
For the normal 100% award,  
the split is as follows:
50% TSR (of which 25% vests  
for median increasing to 100% 
vesting for upper quartile of the 
FTSE SmallCap Index excluding 
investment trusts). For awards 
after 1 October 2015, the FTSE 
All-Share Index is used as the 
comparator group.
50% EPS (which starts vesting at 
nil for RPI +3% rising to 100% at 
RPI +8%).
For awards after 1 October 
2015, CPI is used instead of RPI.
For the additional 100%  
exceptional award:
Financial performance conditions 
dependent on circumstances of 
award, measured over a three 
year period.
Share

guidelines
To increase alignment 
between executives 
and shareholders.
Executive Directors are 
required to retain a proportion 
of their net of tax vested 
awards until the guideline  
is met.
Executive Directors 
are required to build 
up and maintain a 
shareholding worth 
200% of salary. An 
additional two year 
holding period 
applies for awards 
made in excess of 
100% of salary.
Not applicable.
Pension To reward sustained 
contribution by 
providing retirement 
benefits.
The Company funds 
contributions to a Director’s 
pension as appropriate, 
through contribution to  
the Company’s money 
purchase scheme or  
through the provision  
of salary supplements.
Company 
contribution fixed  
at 15% of salary.
Not applicable.
One off bonus To mitigate continuity 
risk amongst Executive 
Directors associated 
with the departure of 
other Executive 
Directors by retaining 
their services and to 
reward extra work and 
responsibility during 
the recruitment and 
transition period.
Executive Directors may be 
awarded a one off bonus 
capped at one year’s base 
salary, payable in instalments 
over a defined period and 
subject to an adjustment 
factor based on the 
Company’s TSR compared  
to a comparator group TSR 
over the defined period.
One year’s base 
salary.
Payment to be multiplied by an 
adjustment factor set by 
reference to the Company’s 
relative TSR performance when 
compared to the FTSE All-Share 
Index excluding investment trusts 
over the previous 12 months. If 
Avon tracks the FTSE All Share 
exactly over the period the 
adjustment factor is 1. For 
example, if Avon underperforms 
by 10% the adjustment factor is 
0.9, if it outperforms by 10% the 
adjustment factor is 1.1.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW Basic salary and benefits
The basic salary for each Executive Director is reviewed every three years by the Remuneration Committee. It is intended that 
basic salary levels should reflect the median of a suitable comparator group selected according to size, industry sector or location 
as a suitable benchmark group for the Company and will be paid subject to the Group’s wider financial circumstances.
The Group’s employees have received an increase of approximately 8% over the same period, including annual cost of living, 
promotional increases and increases based on exceptional performance.
The Company has the ability to pay a salary supplement where any Executive Director takes on another Executive Director’s role 
in addition to their own. The amount of supplement when added to the Executive Director’s existing salary will always be capped 
at the salary level of the Executive Director being replaced.
Annual cash bonus
The Executives’ annual bonus arrangements are focused on the achievement of the Company’s short and medium-term financial 
objectives. Before the start of each year, the Remuneration Committee confirms financial performance targets for the year. These 
are designed to be stretching. Bonus payments are not pensionable.

The financial and performance targets Mr McDonald was subject to for the first half of the year while Managing Director of 
Dairy are explained on page 68.
2017
For the year ended 30 September 2017, 70% of the Executive Directors’ bonus potential, capped at 100% of salary, was based 
on the achievement of Group financial targets.
The remaining 30% was based on achieving measurable personal performance targets, as shown above.
Performance measures (a) to (c) were the same as in previous years and closely align the performance of the Executive Directors 
with the strategy of the Company’s business and shareholder value creation. The Committee decided to remove performance 
target (d) for the Executive Directors and cap the bonus potential at 100%. The personal performance targets are a set of non-
financial personal targets which also support the delivery of the strategy. 
A claw back rule applies if the Group’s financial results are restated due to an error during the two years following their release and 
a deferral rule provides for 25% of annual bonus payments to be deferred into shares to be held for two years. Upon release these 
shares are not subject to the executive shareholding guidelines.
One off bonus arrangements
In order to mitigate continuity risk associated with the departure of an Executive Director and to recognise any extra work and 
responsibility carried out by the remaining Executive Director(s) during this period, Executive Directors may be awarded a one 
off bonus capped at one year’s base salary, payable in instalments over a defined period and subject to an adjustment factor 
based on the Company’s total shareholder return compared to a comparator group TSR over the defined period.
During the three year term of the Policy, the Committee has only approved one bonus payment under this arrangement, 
which was put in place following the retirement of Peter Slabbert as Chief Executive Officer in 2015. This was a one off bonus 
arrangement for Andrew Lewis, at the time the Group Finance Director, in order to minimise the risk of him leaving and preserve 
the stability of the Board while the recruitment and transition to a new CEO was completed. The payment was also designed to 
reflect the extra work and responsibility Mr Lewis had to carry out during this period. As reported in last year’s Remuneration 
Report, the final payment under this arrangement was made to Mr Lewis on 30 November 2016. 
As confirmed last year, the Committee felt it was important to mitigate the continuity risk associated with the departure of Mr 
Slabbert after his long tenure as Chief Executive Officer, although it was also recognised that shareholders have concerns in 
relation to such arrangements. Only the above mentioned payment was agreed under this element of the Policy and no new 
arrangements were agreed during the year. This element of the current Policy will be reviewed as part of the updated Policy to 
be put before shareholders next year. 
Long-term incentive plan – Performance Share Plan (the ‘Plan’)
The Remuneration Committee introduced the Plan with shareholder approval at the AGM in 2002. In 2010 and 2016 
shareholders approved an updated plan. The existing version of the Plan therefore came into effect from 26 January 2016 and 
expires in 2020. The aim of the Plan is to motivate Executive Directors and other senior executives to achieve performance 
superior to the Company’s peers and to maintain and increase earnings levels whilst at the same time ensuring that it is not at the 
expense of longer-term shareholder returns. This is reflected in the Plan’s performance conditions which are based on TSR and 
earnings per share (‘EPS’). 
The current financial performance conditions remain appropriate for a growing business and the expectations of shareholders 
over the life of the current policy. They will therefore be applied to the next cycle of awards in December 2017. Non-financial 
performance conditions are not considered appropriate at the current stage in the development of the Group, although this will be 
kept under review.
The TSR measure takes the total return received by the Company’s shareholders in terms of share price growth and dividends 
over a three year period and compares it with the total returns received by shareholders in companies within a predetermined 
and appropriate comparator group.
The EPS measure is based on real growth in adjusted earnings per share over the performance period where real growth is 
expressed as a percentage above inflation.
Under the Plan, Executive Directors and a limited number of other senior executives and employees receive conditional share 
awards (which may be in the form of nil-cost options) in respect of the Company’s shares. The awards are split so that 50% vests 
in accordance with the TSR target and 50% in accordance with the EPS target. The Committee considered as part of its 2015 
review, whether to make the targets apply concurrently but decided against this, preferring the balance of measures relating 
to earnings growth and long-term strategic performance that are assessed independently of each other. The actual number of 
shares that each participant receives depends on the Company’s performance over a three year performance period against the 
combined EPS/TSR target.
The Committee believes following its review that a three year performance period remains appropriate for the Company and in 
line with market practice. An extended retention period of two years applies for ‘exceptional’ awards in excess of 100% of salary, 
none of which have been made.
For the TSR measure, the performance of the Company’s shares over the performance period is compared with the TSR 
performance within a comparator group comprising the FTSE Small Cap Index, excluding investment trusts. For awards after 
1 October 2015, the comparator group is the FTSE All Share index (excluding investment trusts).

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW Long-term incentive plan – Performance Share Plan (the ‘Plan’) continued
Over the three year period:
• If the Company’s TSR performance is below the median TSR of the comparator group, no shares will vest
• If the Company’s TSR performance is equal to the median TSR of the comparator group, 25% of the shares may vest
• If the Company’s TSR performance is between the median and upper quartile TSR of the comparator group, shares may  
vest on a pro-rata basis
• If the Company’s TSR performance is equal to, or exceeds, the upper quartile TSR of the comparator group, 100% of the 
shares may vest
The above reflects the Remuneration Committee’s intention to reward only TSR performance which outperforms the 
comparator group and the Committee’s view is that measuring this by reference to median and upper quartile placing  
remains appropriate.
For the EPS measure, adjusted earnings per share over the performance period are compared with a scale which provides for 
nil vesting at RPI +3% and maximum vesting at RPI +8%, with vesting on a pro-rata basis for performance between these two 
figures. This range was first introduced for the awards made in December 2011 and remains appropriate, but the Committee  
will keep it under review and will include it as part of its review of all aspects of executive remuneration during 2018.
For all PSP awards from 1 October 2015, the Committee amended the calculation of the EPS performance condition to  
CPI instead of RPI.
The maximum value that can currently be granted under the Plan rules in any year for a ‘normal’ award is 100% of salary and 
up to a further 100% in exceptional circumstances, if an appropriate business challenge warrants such treatment e.g. a major 
acquisition or strategic initiative. The performance conditions for special awards will be financial and will be set at the time the 
awards are made. They are likely to be a more challenging version of the existing TSR/EPS conditions, but the Committee may 
decide to use a different financial performance condition if appropriate in the circumstances. The Committee has no current 
plans to issue any exceptional awards and none have been awarded to date.
The Committee has discretion to reduce the number of shares which will vest or decide that no shares will vest if it considers 
that the financial performance of the Company or the performance of the participant does not justify vesting. In addition, the 
Committee has discretion to allow good leaver status on a case-by-case basis and for added flexibility, the rules allow for a clean 
break when an executive leaves. This permits vesting to be triggered at the point of leaving by reference to performance at that 
date, rather than waiting until the end of the performance period if the Committee so decides. This, in turn, will allow vesting 
at rates appropriate to the Board’s strategy for managing an exit, for example to offset cash compensation by allowing earlier 
vesting conditions. On a change of control, any vesting of awards will be pro-rated by reference to time and performance. 
The current remuneration policy is that both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer should receive ‘normal’ 
awards of up to 100% of salary, being the median level identified in the 2016 benchmarking exercise.
Under the Plan as amended in 2010, joint ownership awards were permitted for the first time and have been issued to UK resident 
employees ever since. In the Company’s case until 2016, savings in employer National Insurance Contributions resulting from this 
were not offset by the loss of corporation tax credits because of the presence of historic corporation tax losses in the UK.
Where joint ownership awards are made, the Company loans recipients the small up-front cost of purchasing their interest in the 
joint ownership award shares. For consistency the Executive Directors have been treated in the same way as other recipients 
and have therefore received small loans in connection with their outstanding awards. The total value of the loans received by the 
Executive Directors is capped at £10,000.
Remuneration Report continued
As announced to shareholders in December 2016, joint ownership awards, nil-cost options and conditional awards of shares 
were granted under the 2010 Plan to the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Group Executive management team and other 
valued employees. A further award will be made in December 2017 in the form of nil-cost options within the existing parameters 
of the Plan as approved under the Policy at 100% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
Shareholding guidelines
Executives participating in the Performance Share Plan are required to build up and retain a shareholding in the Company. For 
Executive Directors, the shareholding requirement is two times base salary. For other recipients the shareholding requirement is 
equivalent to one times base salary. The Executive Directors and other members of the Group Executive management team are 
required to retain a portion of any awards that vest under the Plan until their respective shareholding guideline is met. Once the 
shareholding guideline is met executives are not required to retain any portion of future awards that vest.
For awards in excess of 100% of salary, a two year mandatory holding period applies following the three year performance 
period. At the end of this period the shares subject to the award will not be subject to the shareholding guidelines for normal 
awards and may be sold.
Dilution
The Company reviews the awards of shares made under the all employee and executive share plans in terms of their effect on 
dilution limits in any rolling ten year period. The current position is set out on page 70 of this report and no change to this is 
proposed. In summary, in 2011 shareholders approved a 15% dilution limit for all employee schemes which is in excess of the 10% 
recommended by the Investment Association, and a 10% dilution limit for discretionary (executive) schemes which is in excess of 
the 5% recommended by the Investment Association. At the time the Company committed to consult with certain institutional 
shareholders before exceeding the 10% limit but has never had cause to do this and has no plans to exceed 10% in future. In 
practice there is therefore a 10% dilution limit on all schemes which the Company will continue to operate within. 
Other share plans
Shareholders approved the introduction of the Avon Rubber p.l.c. Share Incentive Plan (the ‘SIP’) at the AGM in February 
2012. All UK tax resident employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are entitled to participate. Under the SIP, participants 
purchase shares in the Company monthly using deductions from their pre-tax pay. The maximum contribution each month under 
the SIP is currently £150, a sum which is set by the Government. Nick Keveth has participated in the SIP at the maximum level 
since July 2017. Paul McDonald is not currently a member. 
Shareholders also approved the introduction of the Avon Rubber p.l.c. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ‘ESPP’) at the AGM 
in February 2012. The ESPP is open to all US tax resident employees and allows participants to accumulate deductions from 
their post-tax pay over an offering period of 12 months. The maximum contribution for each 12 month period is $3,000. At the 
conclusion of the offering period the accumulated funds are used to purchase the Company’s shares at a discount. Executive 
Directors are not eligible to participate in the ESPP.
In 2016 shareholders approved the introduction of two new share option schemes, the Avon Rubber p.l.c. 2015 Share Option 
Plan (the ‘CSOP’) in the UK and the Avon Rubber p.l.c. 2015 Incentive and Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (the ‘ISO’) in the US. 
Awards under both schemes are targeted at junior management and may be supplemented by unapproved share options. Neither 
Paul McDonald nor Nick Keveth will be granted awards under the CSOP and neither will be entitled to participate in the ISO.
Pension
Under the Policy, UK-based Executive Directors joining the Company are offered defined contribution arrangements. Under the 
Company’s money purchase scheme, members receive a pension based upon the size of their retirement account on retirement 
from age 65. Membership of the pension scheme entitles members to life assurance which pays a lump sum of four times 
pensionable salary on death, together with a spouse’s pension of one quarter of the member’s pensionable salary. The Company 
funds contributions to an Executive Director’s pension as appropriate, through contribution to the Company’s money purchase 
scheme or through the provision of salary supplements. Both Paul McDonald and Nick Keveth receive a company pension 
contribution equal to 15% of annual salary. Mr McDonald is a member of the money purchase scheme. Part of his company 
pension contribution is paid into the pension scheme with the remainder paid as a salary supplement. Mr Keveth has reached 
the lifetime allowance and his company contribution is paid as a non-pensionable salary supplement. Mr Keveth receives the life 
assurance benefit described above despite not being a member of the pension scheme.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW Service contracts and policy on payments for loss of office
The Company’s policy is that Executive Directors should normally be employed under a contract which may be terminated 
by either the Company or the Executive Director giving 12 months’ notice. The Company may terminate the contract with 
immediate effect with or without cause by making a payment in lieu of notice by monthly instalments of salary and benefits  
to a maximum of 12 months, with reductions for any amounts received from providing services to others during this period. 
There are no obligations to make payments beyond those disclosed elsewhere in this report.
The Remuneration Committee may vary these terms if the particular circumstances surrounding the appointment of a new 
Executive Director demand it but this would be exceptional and has never occurred. The parameters for varying the contractual 
terms on recruitment are described in the guiding policy section above.
The Remuneration Committee strongly endorses the obligation on an Executive Director to mitigate any loss on early 
termination and will seek to reduce the amount payable on termination where it is appropriate to do so. The Committee will also 
take care to ensure that, while meeting its contractual obligations, poor performance is not rewarded. The Executive Directors’ 
contracts contain early termination provisions consistent with the policy outlined above.
The table below summarises key details in respect of each Executive Director’s contract.
Contract date Company notice period Executive notice period
Paul McDonald 14 February 2017 12 months 12 months
Nick Keveth 9 May 2017 12 months 12 months
Other appointments
Neither Paul McDonald nor Nick Keveth is currently appointed as a Non-Executive Director of any company outside the Group.  
The Remuneration Committee will consider its approach to the treatment of any fees received by Executive Directors in respect 
of Non-Executive roles as they arise.
CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Non-Executive Directors are not employed under service contracts and do not receive compensation for loss of office. All Non-
Executive Directors are appointed on a rolling annual basis, which may be terminated on giving three months’ notice at any time.
Chairman and Non-Executive Director appointments are subject to Board approval and election by shareholders at the annual 
general meeting following appointment and, thereafter, re-election by rotation every three years. Any Non-Executive Director 
who has served for more than nine years since first election is subject to annual re-election by shareholders. This now applies  
to David Evans. 
The date of each appointment is set out below, together with the date of their last re-election by shareholders.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
ROLE AND COMPOSITION OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing and implementing remuneration policy and for determining the 
Executive Directors’ individual packages and terms of service together with those of the other members of the Group Executive 
management team.
The Committee comprises Chloe Ponsonby, David Evans and Pim Vervaat. The Committee uses external independent 
professional advisers when needed. Deloitte are the Company’s independent actuarial advisor on pension matters and will 
provide the Committee with information on executive pension arrangements when this cannot be provided by the pension 
scheme actuary AonHewitt. During 2017, EY provided annual performance monitoring data and share award valuations for 
review by the Committee in relation to the Performance Share Plan. EY also provided remuneration benchmarking of the reward 
packages received by the Executive Directors, the Group Executive and the fees received by the Chairman and the other Non-
Executive Directors as well as more general advice on executive remuneration. The Company’s solicitors, TLT LLP, provide advice 
on remuneration governance and all share plans.
The Committee addressed the following main issues during the last year:
• Reviewed and approved all remuneration packages paid to current Directors
• Reviewed and approved the leaving terms of former Directors
• Approved the annual bonus payments to the Executive Directors in November 2016
• Approved the annual bonus plan for the Executive Directors for the 2017 financial year
• Reviewed and confirmed the vesting of the 2014 Performance Share Plan awards in December 2016
• Reviewed and approved the 2017 Performance Share Plan awards granted in December 2016 and monitored the 
performance of the outstanding awards against their performance targets
• Oversaw the remuneration benchmarking process for the Non-Executive Directors
Since the end of the 2017 financial year, the Committee has:
• Approved annual bonus payments to the Executive Directors and the Group Executive management team, following 
completion of the external audit in November 2017
• Made preparations for the 2018 Performance Share Plan awards to be granted in December 2017
The information that follows has been audited (except where indicated) by the Company’s auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 30 September 2017 was as follows:

1  P. McDonald was appointed to the Board with effect from 15 February 2017. The remuneration shown for P. McDonald includes all remuneration received 
during 2017, including that received in the period prior to his appointment as Director.
2 N. Keveth was appointed to the Board with effect from 1 June 2017.
3 R. Rennie stepped down from the Board on 15 February 2017.
4 A. Lewis stepped down from the Board on 30 November 2016.
5 P. Rayner was appointed to the Board with effect from 1 December 2016 and stepped down from the Board on 1 June 2017.
6 R. Wood retired from the Board on 26 January 2016.
7 P. Slabbert retired from the Board on 30 September 2015.
8 S. Pirie retired from the Board on 29 January 2015.
9  This amount includes a salary supplement for acting as Interim Chief Executive Officer during October and November 2015.
*  This is the cost of private health insurance, executive medical and for R. Rennie, relocation costs paid. No Director waived emoluments in respect  
of the year ended 30 September 2017 (2016: £nil).
**  2017 bonus payments as a percentage of salary were 73% for P. McDonald and 83% for N. Keveth, against maximum percentages of 100%. The calculation of the 
percentage figure for Mr McDonald reflects all bonus received in respect of the full financial year, including prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer.   
For the first half of the financial year while Managing Director of the Dairy division, Mr McDonald received a bonus payment of 61% out of a maximum of 100%  
and for the second half of the year following his appointment as Chief Executive Officer he received a bonus payment of 81% out of a maximum of 100%.  
 ***  Calculated by multiplying the number of shares that vested by the share price on the day of vesting, which in 2017 was 1020p (100% vesting), in 2016 was 
1030p (100% vesting) and in 2015 was 720p (96% vesting).
Interim Group Finance Director
The Company appointed Paul Rayner as Interim Group Finance Director with effect from 1 December 2016. Mr Rayner was 
appointed on a fixed-term contract expiring on 31 July 2017. He stood down from the Board on 1 June 2017 and remained 
an employee of the Company for a period of handover until 31 July 2017. Under the terms of his agreement, his salary for the 
eight month period was £233,336. Mr Rayner was entitled under the terms of his contract to receive an extra month’s salary of 
£29,167, as a completion bonus.
Paul Rayner did not receive any pension contribution or other benefits and did not participate in the annual bonus scheme or 
performance share plan. Prior to Mr Rayner’s appointment as Interim Group Finance Director, he became an employee of the 
Company on 18 October 2016, working on an ad-hoc basis as necessary between then and 1 December 2016 as part of the 
transition of responsibilities from Mr Lewis. During this period Mr Rayner was paid £11,250. These remuneration arrangements 
were specific and tailored to this interim assignment. 
PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION OF THE CEO COMPARED WITH OTHER EMPLOYEES (UNAUDITED)
The Committee continues to believe it is inappropriate to compare the percentage change in remuneration of the CEO with the 
wider workforce. This is because the CEO’s salary is fixed and brought up to the median level every three years, whereas the 
wider workforce are, largely, already at the median level and receive annual cost of living increases. Nevertheless in line with 
current practice, we have reported changes in the CEO’s remuneration against the wider workforce. Last year we reported that, 
having brought the CEO’s salary up to the median level in 2013, we expected future increases, made to keep track with the 
median, to start aligning with the annual increases made to other employees each year, when measured over a three year period. 
The result of the 2016 benchmarking exercise was that the CEO’s 2013 salary remained the median of the 2016 comparator 
group and the increase made for Mr Rennie in October 2016 brought his salary up to that level. Mr McDonald’s salary is 
consistent with this approach.
The following table sets out the percentage change in remuneration between the reported year and the preceding year in certain 
aspects of the CEO’s remuneration and the average of employees across the Group:
CEO All employees
2015 2016 2017 2015 2016 2017
Salary 0% -9% 0% +3% +2% 2%
Benefits 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%
Annual Bonus -1% -61% +4% +8% -51% 109%
The ratio of CEO fixed pay to average employee fixed pay is 8.8:1 for the year under review (2016: 9.6:1).

ANNUAL BONUS (UNAUDITED)
The Remuneration Committee determined at its meeting on 9 November 2017 that certain criteria for making an award under 
the annual bonus scheme had been met. No discretion was exercised by the Committee to reduce or increase payments. The

*  Changes to the annual bonus scheme are implemented at the beginning of the quarter following a change of role and so Mr McDonald became entitled to 
participate in the CEO bonus scheme from 1 April 2017, having been appointed on 15 February 2017.
The Board considers the disclosure in advance of actual performance against the targets for the upcoming year to be 
commercially sensitive and the Committee has taken the decision not to disclose them. The Committee is not of the view that 
such targets will necessarily always be confidential but will keep this under review. The Committee is prepared to disclose 
financial performance targets and performance against them retrospectively as set out below:

Of the bonus payable for meeting the financial targets 75% will be paid in cash and the remaining 25% will be deferred into 
shares to be held for two years. A claw back rule applies if the Group’s financial results are restated due to an error during the 
two years following release.
PENSIONS
As confirmed under the Policy, the Executive Directors are entitled to receive a contribution towards pension of 15% of basic 
salary, paid either as a non-pensionable salary supplement or delivered though the Group’s money purchase scheme.
Mr McDonald is a member of the money purchase scheme. Part of his company pension contribution is paid into the pension 
scheme with the remainder paid as a salary supplement.
Mr Keveth has reached the lifetime allowance and has not joined the Plan. His pension contribution is paid entirely as a  
salary supplement.

PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN 2010 (‘THE PLAN’)
The Committee determined in December 2016 that the 2014 award vested in full on the basis that the TSR over the three  
years from 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2016 was significantly ahead of the upper quartile of the comparator group.  
As a consequence, and as announced to shareholders in December 2016, 20,424 shares were awarded to Mr McDonald who 
was subsequently appointed as a Director on 15 February 2017.
The Directors’ contingent interests in ordinary shares under the Plan at 30 September 2017 were as follows:

DILUTION
In respect of the 5% and 10% limits recommended by the Association of British Insurers, the relevant percentages were 7.39% 
and 7.44% respectively based on the issued share capital at 30 September 2017.
It remains the Company’s practice to use Employee Share Ownership Trusts (‘ESOTs’) in order to meet its liability for shares 
awarded under the Plan. Two trusts have been established in connection with the jointly owned equity awards. At 30 September 
2017 there were 565,803 shares held in the ESOTs which will either be used to satisfy awards granted under the Plan to date, or 
in connection with future awards. A hedging committee ensures that the ESOTs hold sufficient shares to satisfy existing and future 
awards made under the Plan by buying shares in the market or causing the Company to issue new shares. Shares held in the ESOTs 
do not receive dividends.

additional month’s salary as a completion bonus. The total sum received by Mr Rayner from 1 June to 31 July 2017 was £87,500.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2018
Salary benchmarking 
As detailed in last year’s report, Executive Director salaries were benchmarked last year. The median salary level was not 
increased. The level of median salary identified last year for the Chief Financial Officer role was benchmarked and confirmed 
this year as part of the recruitment process which resulted in the appointment of Mr Keveth. The annual salaries of both Paul 
McDonald and Nick Keveth were set below the median level and will be considered for increase to the median level on the 
anniversary of their appointment, when they are expected to be proven in their roles. 
Basic salaries for Directors
Basic salary 2017 2018 % Increase Median
Paul McDonald £300,000 £300,000 – £330,000
Nick Keveth £230,000 £230,000 – £240,000
Non-Executive Director Fees
In accordance with our Policy, the fees of Non-Executive Directors are reviewed and benchmarked every three years, with 
increases only implemented if current fees were found to be below the median of a comparator group. The previous review was 
in 2014 and therefore a review and benchmarking exercise was conducted during the 2017 financial year. The review concluded 
that current fees remained close to the median and therefore no increases were made for the 2018 financial year.
Current fees for Non-Executive Director fees are:
2017 2018 % Increase
Chairman £125,000 £125,000 –
Base fee Non-Executive £38,500 £38,500 –
Committee Chairman fee £10,000 £10,000 –
Committee attendance fee £2,000 £2,000 –

As at 30 September 2017, the market price of Avon Rubber p.l.c. shares was £9.375 (2016: £10.10). During the year the highest 
and lowest market prices were £11.19 and £9.31 respectively.
PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS AND PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
The Committee’s approach when exercising its discretion under the policy is to be mindful of the particular circumstance of the 
departure and the contribution the individual made to the Group. 
Andrew Lewis
Andrew Lewis stood down as Group Finance Director on 30 November 2016. The remuneration received by Mr Lewis in respect 
of his services as an Executive Director in the 2017 financial year is set out in the 2017 Single Figure Table and includes salary 
and an annual bonus payment. This remuneration also included payment of a one off bonus of £252,000, paid in connection 
with the retirement of a previous CEO, Mr Slabbert, as previously disclosed. 
Mr Lewis’s employment with the Group ended on 16 December 2016. Between 30 November 2016 when he stood down 
from the Board and 16 December 2016, Mr Lewis received £13,257 in respect of salary, benefits and pension contributions in 
accordance with his contract of employment. In line with market practice, the Group paid the professional legal fees incurred by 
him in finalising his termination arrangements, which amounted to £1,500 plus VAT. In addition, in consideration of agreeing to 
certain restrictive covenant provisions, Mr Lewis received £200. Mr Lewis did not receive a loss of office payment and did not 
retain any pro-rated entitlement to an annual bonus for the 2017 financial year. 
Mr Lewis continued to be provided with private medical and dental insurance cover and life assurance until the policy expired 
in April 2017. 
Mr Lewis’s deferred bonus award of £33,811.18 in respect of the 2015 financial year and £24,578.80 in respect of the 2016 
financial year will be released in accordance with the plan rules upon announcement of the Company’s full year financial results 
for the years ending 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2018 respectively. 
Recognising Mr Lewis’s contribution to the Company’s success over a period of eight years, the Committee exercised its 
discretion in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy to determine that Mr Lewis was permitted to retain his 2015 
and 2016 PSP awards on a good leaver basis, pro-rated for service by one third and two thirds respectively. The Committee also 
permitted these awards to vest early, under the clean break provisions in the rules of the 2010 Performance Share Plan, subject 
to the normal performance conditions which were assessed at the time. Mr Lewis received 27,198 shares as a result of the 
accelerated vesting of the 2015 and 2016 awards on 30 November 2016, with a value of £277,420 which is included in the 2017 
Single Figure Table. 
Rob Rennie
Mr Rennie stepped down as Chief Executive Officer on 15 February 2017. The remuneration he received in respect of his services as 
an Executive Director is set out in the 2017 Single Figure Table. Mr Rennie will receive up to £330,000, which equates to 12 months’ 
salary and reflects the 12 month notice clause in Mr Rennie’s service agreement, plus a cash supplement in lieu of pension, paid in 
monthly instalments. These monthly payments are being made subject to an obligation on Mr Rennie to mitigate his loss, such that 
the payments will either reduce or cease in the event Mr Rennie gains new employment or remuneration. Mr Rennie did not receive  
a loss of office payment.

Benefits and pension
These will be paid and provided in accordance with the approved policy. Benefits will be in line with those received in 2017. 
Bonus
The maximum opportunity under the annual bonus plan for 2018 will be 100% of base salary for both Executive Directors. 
Bonuses will be based on Group profit budget achievement (25%), profit growth on previous year (25%), Group cash generation 
(20%) and personal performance targets (30%) as set out on page 60. 
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the financial performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include 
matters which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. Retrospective disclosure of the performance against them will be 
made in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration to the extent the targets are not commercially sensitive at that time.
Long-term incentive plan – Performance Share Plan
The Remuneration Committee has decided that the 2018 PSP awards will take the form of nil-cost options with a market value  
at grant of 100% of salary for the Executive Directors. Vesting will be subject to the following performance conditions:
• 50% will be based on relative TSR performance with 25% vesting at median increasing to 100% for upper quartile 
performance. The comparator group will be the FTSE All-Share index (excluding investment trusts)
• 50% will be based on EPS growth. EPS growth will be compared on a scale which provides for nil vesting at CPI + 3%  
and maximum vesting at CPI + 8%, with vesting on a pro-rata basis between these two figures
DETAILS OF ADVISORS TO THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE AND THEIR FEES
During the year to 30 September 2017 the Company incurred costs of £14,000 (2016: £11,000) in respect of fees for advisors

Wales with company registration number 32965. The Company’s principal subsidiary undertakings and branches, including  
those located outside the UK, are listed in note 27 to the financial statements. 
STRATEGIC REPORT
The Strategic Report, which contains a review of the Group’s business (including by reference to key performance indicators),  
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group, and commentary on likely future developments is set out 
on pages 10 to 39 and is incorporated into this Directors’ Report by reference.
FINANCIAL RESULTS AND DIVIDEND
The Group statutory profit for the year after taxation amounts to £21.5m (2016: £17.6m). Full details are set out in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on page 88.
An interim dividend of 4.11p per share was paid in respect of the year ended 30 September 2017 (2016: 3.16p).
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 8.21p per share (2016: 6.32p) resulting in a total dividend distribution per share 
for the year to 30 September 2017 of 12.32p (2016: 9.48p).
SHARE CAPITAL
As at 15 November 2017, the issued share capital of the Company was 31,023,292 ordinary shares of £1 each. Details of the 
shares in issue during the financial year are set out in note 20 of the financial statements.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s shares are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association (‘the Articles’), 
copies of which can be obtained from Companies House or by writing to the Company Secretary. Shareholders are entitled to 
receive the Company’s reports and accounts, to attend and speak at general meetings, to exercise voting rights in person or 
by appointing a proxy and to receive a dividend where declared or paid out of profits available for that purpose. There are no 
restrictions on the transfer of issued shares or on the exercise of voting rights attached to them, except where the Company 
has suspended their voting rights or prohibited their transfer following a failure to respond to a notice to shareholders under 
section 793 of the Companies Act 2006, or where the holder is precluded from transferring or voting by the Financial Services 
Authority’s Listing Rules or the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers.
The 565,803 shares held in the names of the two Employee Share Ownership Trusts on a jointly owned basis or as a hedge 
against awards previously made or to be made pursuant to the Performance Share Plan are held on terms which provide voting 
rights to the Trustee and, in certain circumstances under the terms of joint ownership awards, to the recipient of the awards.
The Company is also not aware of any agreements between its shareholders which may restrict the transfer of their shares or 
the exercise of their voting rights. The only exception to this being the Trustees of the two Employee Share Ownership Trusts 
have waived their rights to dividends.
At the Company’s last AGM held on 2 February 2017, shareholders authorised the Company to make market purchases of  
up to 4,653,492 of the Company’s issued ordinary shares. No shares were purchased under this authority during the year.  
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM to renew this authority, although this number has been  
reduced to 3,102,329 shares representing 10% of the Company’s issued share capital. 
The Directors require authority to allot unissued share capital to the Company and to disapply shareholders’ statutory pre-
emption rights. Such authorities were granted at the 2017 AGM and resolutions to renew these authorities will be proposed  
at the 2018 AGM, see explanatory notes on pages 134 to 136. No shares were allotted under this authority during the year.

SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS – CHANGE OF CONTROL
The only significant agreements to which the Company is a party which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control 
of the Company following a takeover bid are:
• the Company’s revolving credit facility agreement
• the Performance Share Plan
The unsecured revolving credit facility of $40 million provided by Barclays Bank PLC and Comerica Bank Inc. contains a provision 
which, in the event of a change of control of the Company, gives the lending banks the right to cancel all commitments to the 
Company and to declare all outstanding credit and accrued interest immediately due and payable.
A change of control will be deemed to have occurred if any person or persons acting in concert (as defined in the City Code on 
Takeovers and Mergers) gains direct or indirect control of the Company.
Under the rules of the Performance Share Plan, on a takeover a proportion of each outstanding grant will vest. The number 
of shares that vest is to be determined by the Remuneration Committee, including by reference to the extent to which the 
performance condition has been satisfied and the number of months that have passed since the award was made.
The Company does not have agreements with any Director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a change of control, except in relation to the Performance Share Plan as described above.
DIRECTORS
The names of the Directors as at 15 November 2017 are set out on page 42 along with their photographs and biographies.
The Company’s rules about the appointment and replacement of Directors, together with the powers of Directors, are contained 
in the Articles. Changes to the Articles must be approved by special resolution of the shareholders.
During the year there have been three changes to the membership of the Board. 
Andrew Lewis Group Finance Director, stepped down from the Board on 30 November 2016 and was replaced by interim Group 
Finance Director, Paul Rayner, on 1 December 2016. Mr. Rayner stepped down from the Board when Nick Keveth was appointed 
Chief Financial Officer on 1 June 2017. Rob Rennie, Chief Executive Officer, stepped down from the Board on 15 February 2017 
and was replaced by Paul McDonald.
The Board is satisfied that David Evans, Pim Vervaat and Chloe Ponsonby are independent Non-Executive Directors.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Company’s Articles, all Directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment, and to re-election thereafter at intervals of no more than three years. 
Non-Executive Directors who have served longer than nine years are subject to annual re-election.
David Evans retires by rotation and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election. The Board confirms that Mr Evans has 
contributed substantially to the performance of the Board. Pim Vervaat, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director,  
gives his full support to Mr Evans’s offer of re-election and draws the attention of shareholders to his profile on page 42.
Paul McDonald and Nick Keveth who, having been appointed since the Company’s last AGM, retire in accordance with Article 79 
of the Articles and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. The Board confirms that both have contributed substantially 
to the performance of the Board since their appointment and the Chairman gives his full support to their offer of re-election and 
draws shareholders’ attention to their profiles on page 42.
All Executive Directors’ service contracts with the Company require one year’s notice of termination. Neither Paul McDonald nor 
Nick Keveth are currently appointed as a Non-Executive Director of any company outside the Group.
None of the Directors have a beneficial interest in any contract to which the Company or any subsidiary was a party during the 
year. Beneficial interests of Directors, their families and trusts in ordinary shares of the Company can be found on page 69.
DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ INDEMNITY INSURANCE
In accordance with the Company’s Articles and subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (‘the Act’), the Company 
maintains, at its expense, Directors and Officers insurance to provide cover in respect of legal action against its Directors. 
This was in force throughout the financial year and remains in force as at the date of this report.
The Company’s Articles allow the Company to provide the Directors with funds to cover the costs incurred in defending legal 
proceedings. The Company is therefore treated as providing an indemnity for its Directors and Company Secretary which is a 
qualifying third party indemnity provision for the purposes of the Act. 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
During the year no Director held any beneficial interest in any contract significant to the Company’s business, other than a 
contract of employment. The Company has procedures set out in the Articles for managing conflicts of interest. Should a 
Director become aware that they, or their connected parties, have an interest in an existing or proposed transaction with the 
Group, they are required to notify the Board as soon as reasonably practicable.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Group continues to utilise its technical and materials expertise to further advance its products and remain at the forefront 
of technology in the fields of respiratory protection, dairy milking technology and polymer engineering. The Group maintains 
its links to key universities in the US and UK and continues to work with new and existing customers and suppliers to develop 
its knowledge and product range. Total Group expenditure on research and development in the year was £8.4m (2016: £8.3m) 
further details of which are contained in the Strategic Report on pages 29 to 30.
Through ARTIS, the Group’s research and development arm, the Group is recognised as a world leader in understanding the 
composition and use of polymer products.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. The 
Directors have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union, and the parent company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 
101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). In preparing the Group financial statements, the Directors have also elected to 
comply with IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true  
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the parent company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
• Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent
• State whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and IFRSs issued by the IASB and applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and parent company 
financial statements respectively
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and with 
regards to the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and the Group and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Each of the Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ Report confirm that, so far as they are aware, 
there was no relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware; and each Director has taken all the steps they 
ought to have taken as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Board considers that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 42 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge the Group 
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and the Strategic Report contained on pages 10 to 39 includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Company’s Annual General Meeting will be held at our Hampton Park West facility, Semington Road, Melksham, Wiltshire 
SN12 6NB on 1 February 2018 at 10.30am. The Notice of Meeting can be found on pages 132 to 139. Registration will be

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion:
• Avon Rubber p.l.c.’s Group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a 
true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 September 2017 and of the Group’s 
profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, 
and applicable law); and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the ‘Annual Report’), which comprise: 
the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets as at 30 September 2017; the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity for the 
year then ended; the Consolidated and Parent Company accounting policies and critical accounting judgements and the notes to 
the financial statements.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section  
of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and  
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group or the parent company.
We have provided no non-audit services to the Group or the parent company in the period from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2017 .
Our audit approach
Overview
• Overall Group materiality: £930,000 (2016: £850,000), based on 5% of Group profit before tax.
• Overall parent company materiality: £700,000 (2016: £645,000), based on 1% of total assets, 
restricted due to component reporting requirements.
• The UK audit team performed an audit of the complete financial information of the two main 
operating units in the USA (Avon Protection NA and Avon Dairy Solutions NA) and the two 
main operating units in the UK (Avon Polymer Products Ltd (comprising of Avon Protection UK 
and Avon Dairy Solutions) and Avon Rubber p.l.c.).
• Taken together, these four reporting units account for 88% of Group revenue and in excess of 
90% of the total Group profit before tax.
• Specific audit procedures were also performed by the UK audit team on certain other balances  
and transactions at the remaining seven reporting units.
• Provisions for uncertain tax provisions (Group).
• Valuation of the Group’s net pension deficit (Group).
• Intangible assets (development expenditure) impairment assessment (Group).
• Risk of fraud in revenue recognition (Group).

Audit scope
Key audit 
matters
Our audit approach continued
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all 
of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was 
evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether 
or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we 
make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete  
list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Provisions for uncertain tax provisions (Group)
As noted in the critical accounting judgements section on page 
97, and included within note 6, there are a number of significant 
judgements involved in the determination of taxation balances.
The Group also has material uncertain taxation positions 
resulting from the interpretation of the impact of the 
application of tax regulations in certain jurisdictions, 
particularly the US. Management have applied judgement in 
estimating the magnitude of the risk and probability of a future 
outflow in each case to derive the level of provisions held.  
In total the provision for uncertain tax provisions was £6.7m  
at 30 September 2017.
Given the number of judgements involved and the complexities of 
dealing with taxation rules and regulations in different countries 
and states within the US, this was an area of focus for us.
We used tax specialist to assess the adequacy of the level of provision 
established in relation to a number of uncertain taxation positions primarily in 
respect of risks in the US. The judgements made by management took account 
of the level and nature of the risks giving rise to the uncertain tax positions, 
together with their assessment of the likely outcome. We considered the 
judgements made by management to be reasonable based on our 
understanding of the relevant tax regulations.
We also obtained the filing positions for each jurisdiction which we read, 
considered in light of our understanding of the business and reconciled to  
the underlying taxation calculations used to prepare the taxation balances  
in the financial statements, noting no material differences.
Valuation of the Group’s net pension deficit (Group)
We focussed on this area because of the magnitude of the 
defined benefit pension deficit of £44.1m and the material 
judgements involved in determining the actuarial assumptions 
which are set out in note 10.
The net pension deficit is subject to the Directors’ judgements 
regarding the selection of appropriate actuarial assumptions 
based on the nature of the scheme, including the discount rate, 
inflation rate and mortality rate, being the assumptions to 
which the deficit is most sensitive
A change in each of these assumptions by 0.25% can cause a 
material change in the value of the underlying pension deficit 
(as highlighted on page 107).
The Directors employed an independent actuary to assist  
them with the valuation of the deficit.
We used our actuarial experts to assess the methodology adopted by the 
Directors and their actuary to determine the net pension deficit. We concluded 
that the requirements of IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ had been applied.
We also used our actuarial experts to assess the reasonableness of the key 
actuarial assumptions selected, by comparing these to our own independent 
benchmark ranges based on our assessment of current market conditions and 
available actuarial data. We noted that the discount rate, inflation rate and 
mortality rate were within our acceptable range.
We considered the competence and objectivity of the Directors’ 
independent actuary including the experience and reputation of the firm 
together with the length of service. We were satisfied that the actuary was 
competent and objective.
We also assessed the actuary’s valuation by obtaining supporting evidence 
for each of the key inputs into the overall pension deficit calculation including 
independently agreeing changes in membership census data to pension 
scheme records and agreeing the scheme asset values to independent 
sources, such as fund manager confirmations and/or quoted market prices 
where available, noting no exceptions.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.  
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect 
of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Overall materiality £930,000 (2016: £850,000). £700,000 (2016: £645,000).
How we determined it 5% of Group profit before tax. 1% of Total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that profit before tax is the primary 
measure used by the shareholders in assessing  
the performance of the Group.
We believe that total assets is the most suitable measure  
as the parent entity is not a trading company, and is a 
generally accepted auditing benchmark. Overall 
materiality applied is limited to £700,000, lower than  
1% of total assets, due to being restricted for Group 
reporting for the purposes of the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality.  
The range of materiality allocated across components was £540,000 to £838,000.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £46,500 
(Group audit) (2016: £43,000) and £34,900 (parent company audit) (2016: £32,000) as well as misstatements below those 
amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to 
in respect of the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether 
the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements and the Directors’ identification  
of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern over a period of at least twelve months from the date 
of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s and parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to Going Concern in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our 
Auditors’ Report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based 
on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we also considered whether the 
disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Our audit approach continued
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Intangible assets (development expenditure) impairment assessment (Group)
We focussed on this area because of the magnitude of 
capitalised development expenditure of £15.4m and the risk 
that amounts may not be recoverable if estimated future sales 
orders cannot be delivered or regulatory approvals are not 
obtained. This risk is set out in the critical accounting 
judgments on page 97 and the amounts capitalised are 
included in note 11.
In particular we focussed on the capitalised development costs 
relating to the PAPR and Deltair, given the amounts held in the 
balance sheet and the stage of their development. These 
products are described on page 15.
We also focused on whether the impairment of EEBD 
was appropriate.
We tested a sample of capitalised development costs against the criteria set 
out in IAS38 ‘Intangible assets’ including the technical feasibility and the 
viability of the completion of the projects and the ability for the projects to 
generate future economic benefits and gain necessary regulatory approvals.
We met with key operational personnel to update our understanding of the 
status of major projects and assessed the process and governance which 
have been put in place around project approval, authorisation and ongoing 
monitoring. We considered that these processes were appropriate.
We assessed individually each of the major projects for indicators of 
impairment, such as an inability to obtain regulatory approval or not 
achieving forecast sales orders. As a result of our work we determined  
that the judgement by management to fully impair EEBD is appropriate  
and that no impairment was required for PAPR, Deltair and other major 
development projects.
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition (Group)
We focused on this area as judgements are made by the 
Directors in determining whether provisions should be made 
against revenue on certain contractual arrangements in the US 
Protection business
The Directors made an estimate of amounts which could be 
due back to customers reflecting the risks inherent within the 
performance of the contracts over a number of years. 
We obtained the calculations of contractual revenue provisions and evaluated 
the Directors’ assessment of the risk of claw back based on our independent 
reading of the relevant contractual terms and the revenue recognised.
In doing so, we concluded that the Group recognised revenue in line with 
their contractual obligations and their revenue recognition accounting policy.
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the parent company to communicate in our report.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the parent company, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Group comprises two divisions, being Protection and Dairy and we focused our audit work on the Group’s largest operating 
units, within these divisions, in the USA and UK. The UK audit team conducted an audit of the complete financial information of 
four operating units (the two largest in the USA, and two largest in the UK) due to their size and risk characteristics. 
Taken together, these four operating units where we performed audit work accounted for approximately 88% of Group revenues 
and in excess of 90% of Group profit before taxation.
Specific audit procedures were also performed by the UK team on certain balances and transactions material to the Group financial 
statements at the remaining reporting units. The parent company’s complete financial information was also subject to audit.
The procedures set out above, together with additional procedures performed at the Group level over centralised processes and 
functions, including the audit of consolidation journals, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial 
statements as a whole.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 78, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not  
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the members prior to 1955 which is as far back as 
records have been located, and therefore the length of uninterrupted engagement is at least 62 years.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Reporting on other information continued
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for 
the year ended 30 September 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit,  
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
Corporate Governance Statement
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement (on 
pages 43 to 47) about internal controls and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital 
structures in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the FCA (‘DTR’) is 
consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit,  
we did not identify any material misstatements in this information. (CA06)
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement  
(on pages 43 to 47) with respect to the parent company’s corporate governance code and practices and about its administrative, management 
and supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the DTR. (CA06)
We have nothing to report arising from our responsibility to report if a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the parent 
company. (CA06)
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The Directors’ confirmation on page 46 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The Directors’ explanation on page 47 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope 
than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the 
statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’); and considering whether the 
statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the 
course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the Directors, on page 78, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and parent company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and parent company obtained in  
the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 50 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The Directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006. (CA06)

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity. 
When a foreign operation is sold, the cumulative amount of such 
exchange difference is recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded at the 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling 
at the balance sheet date of monetary assets or liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except  
when deferred in equity as qualifying hedges.
REVENUE
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration 
received for the sale of goods and services, net of trade 
discounts and sales-related taxes. Revenue is recognised 
when the risks and rewards of the underlying sale have 
been transferred to the customer, and when collectability 
of the related receivables is reasonably assured. Transfer of 
risks and rewards is determined with reference to shipping 
terms or when a separately identifiable phase of a contract 
or customer-funded development has been completed and 
accepted by the customer.
SEGMENT REPORTING
Segments are identified based on management information 
provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief 
operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating 
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, 
has been identified as the Group Executive team. A business 
segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing 
products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are 
different from those of other business segments. A geographical 
segment is engaged in providing products or services within a 
particular economic environment that are subject to risks and 
returns that are different from those of segments operating in 
other economic environments. The chief operating decision-
maker assesses the performance of the operating segments 
based on the measures of revenue, EBIT and EBITDA. Central 
overheads, finance income and expense and taxation are not 
allocated to the business segments.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Transactions are classified as exceptional where they relate 
to an event that falls outside of the ordinary activities of the 
business and where individually or in aggregate they have a 
material impact on the financial statements.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Pension obligations and post-retirement benefits
The Group has both defined benefit and defined 
contribution plans.
The defined benefit plan’s asset or liability as recognised in 
the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of 
plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation 
is determined by discounting the estimated cash outflows 
using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be 
paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the 
terms of the related pension liability. Actuarial gains and losses 
arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which 
they occur, as part of other comprehensive income. Costs 
associated with investment management are deducted from 
the return on plan assets. Other expenses are recognised in 
the income statement as incurred.
For the defined contribution plans, the Group pays 
contributions to publicly or privately administered pension 
insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary  
basis. Contributions are expensed as incurred.
SHARE BASED COMPENSATION
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share based 
compensation plans, under which the entity receives service 
from employees as consideration for equity instruments 
(options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee service 
received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised 
as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined 
by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
• including any market based performance conditions;
• excluding the impact of any service and non-market 
performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, 
sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the 
entity over a specified time period); and
• including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for 
example, the requirement for employees to save).
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions 
about the number of options that are expected to vest. The  
total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is 
the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions 
are to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, the 
entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are 
expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. 
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if 
any, in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) 
and share premium when the options are exercised.
Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Judgements
For the year ended 30 September 2017
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation 
of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
Avon Rubber p.l.c. is a public limited company incorporated 
and domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary shares  
are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) and IFRS Interpretations Committee interpretations 
and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost 
convention except for derivative instruments which are held  
at fair value through profit or loss.
RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS
The following amendments to existing standards were  
adopted for the financial year but with no impact on the 
financial statements: 
• Amendments to IAS 1, ‘Disclosure Initiative’
• Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28,  
‘Applying the consolidation exemption’
• Annual improvements 2012–2014 cycle
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements,  
the following standards and interpretations which have not 
been applied in these financial statements were in issue but 
not yet effective for the financial period:
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ (applicable from year  
ending 30 September 2019)
• IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from Customer Contracts’  
(applicable from year ending 30 September 2019)
• IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ (applicable from year ending 
30 September 2020)
The Directors plan to adopt these standards in line with  
their effective dates.
Under IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, lessees will be required to apply a 
single model to recognise a lease liability and asset for all 
leases, including those classified as operating leases under 
current accounting standards, unless the underlying asset 
has a low value or the lease term is 12 months or less. The 
adoption of IFRS 16 will have a significant impact on the 
financial statements as each lease will give rise to a right of use 
asset which will be depreciated on a straight line basis, and a 
lease liability with a related interest charge. This depreciation 
and interest will replace the operating lease payments 
currently recognised as an expense. The impact will depend 
on the transition approach and the contracts in effect at the 
time of the adoption. At 30 September 2017, operating lease 
commitments were £19.7m (see note 23) and operating lease 
payments for 2017 were £2.3m (see note 2). 
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 
15 will not have a material impact on the amounts reported 
and disclosures made in the Group’s financial statements in the 
period of initial application. 
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
results and position of the Group and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has power, 
exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement 
with the entity and the ability to use its power to affect the 
amount of the Group’s returns.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated 
from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for 
the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, 
equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed  
at the date of exchange.
Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair values 
at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-
controlling interest. Inter-group transactions, balances and 
unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies 
are eliminated; unrealised losses are also eliminated unless 
costs cannot be recovered. Where necessary, accounting 
policies of subsidiaries have been changed to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
The Group’s presentation currency is Sterling. The results and 
financial position of all subsidiaries and associates that have a 
functional currency different from Sterling are translated into 
Sterling as follows:
• assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the 
balance sheet date; and
• income and expenses are translated at the rate of exchange  
at the date of the transaction
All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate 
component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the 
translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of 
borrowings and other currency instruments designated as

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW LEASES
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards 
of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are 
charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The sale and lease back of property, where the sale price 
is at fair value and substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership are transferred to the purchaser, is treated as 
an operating lease. The profit or loss on the transaction is 
recognised immediately and lease payments charged to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.
Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements, 
which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets 
are treated as if they had been purchased and the capital 
element of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations 
under finance leases. Assets acquired under finance leases 
are initially recognised at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. The rentals payable are apportioned between 
interest, which is charged to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, and the liability, which reduces the 
outstanding obligation so as to give a constant rate of charge 
on the outstanding lease obligations.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) 
method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress 
comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and 
related production overheads (based on normal operating 
capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is 
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, 
less applicable incremental selling expenses.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value 
and subsequently held at amortised cost less any provisions 
for impairment.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand 
and highly liquid interest-bearing securities with maturities 
of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within 
borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
TRADE PAYABLES
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services 
that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business 
from suppliers.
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment  
is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle  
of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-
current liabilities. They are initially recognised at fair value  
and subsequently held at amortised cost.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when:
• the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a  
result of a past event
• it is probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation and the amount has 
been reliably estimated
Where there are a number of similar obligations, for example 
where a warranty has been given, the likelihood that an outflow 
will be required in settlement is determined by considering the 
class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even 
if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item 
included in the same class of obligation may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Where a leasehold property, or part thereof, is vacant or  
sub-let under terms such that the rental income is insufficient 
to meet all outgoings, provision is made for the anticipated 
future shortfall up to termination of the lease, or the 
termination payment, if smaller.
BORROWINGS
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of 
transaction costs incurred and subsequently stated at 
amortised cost. Borrowing costs are expensed using the 
effective interest method.
Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Judgements continued
For the year ended 30 September 2017
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable 
net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of 
acquisition. Identifiable net assets include intangible 
assets other than goodwill. Any such intangible assets are 
amortised over their expected future lives unless they are 
regarded as having an indefinite life, in which case they are 
not amortised, but subjected to annual impairment testing 
in a similar manner to goodwill.
Since the transition to IFRS, goodwill arising from acquisitions 
of subsidiaries after 3 October 1998 is included in intangible 
assets. It is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment 
and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains 
and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying 
amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill arising from acquisitions of subsidiaries before 
3 October 1998, which was set against reserves in the year 
of acquisition under UK GAAP, has not been reinstated and is 
not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on 
disposal of the related entity.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or 
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be 
impaired. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for 
the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to 
those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units 
that are expected to benefit from the business combination 
in which the goodwill arose. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. Subsequent reversals of impairment losses for 
goodwill are not recognised.
DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE
Expenditure in respect of the development of new products where 
the outcome is assessed as being reasonably certain as regards 
viability and technical feasibility is capitalised and amortised over 
the expected useful life of the development (between five and  
15 years). Expenditure that does not meet these criteria is 
expensed as incurred. The capitalised costs are amortised over 
the estimated period of sale for each product, commencing in 
the year in which the product is available to sale. Development 
costs capitalised are tested for impairment whenever there is 
an indication that the asset may be impaired. Any impairment 
is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. Subsequent reversals of impairment  
losses for research and development are not recognised.
COMPUTER SOFTWARE
Computer software is included in intangible assets at cost  
and amortised over its estimated life.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group as part 
of business combinations are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. The useful lives take 
account of the differing natures of each of the assets acquired. 
The lives used are:
• Brands and trademarks – four to ten years 
• Customer relationships – seven to ten years
• Order backlog – three months to one year
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of the assets through general and 
administrative expenses.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost or 
deemed cost where IFRS 1 exemptions have been applied, less 
accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Costs include the original purchase price of the asset and the 
costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition 
for its intended use including any qualifying finance expenses.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on other 
assets estimated to write down the depreciable amount 
of relevant assets by equal annual instalments over their 
estimated useful lives.
In general, the lives used are:
• Freehold – 40 years
• Short leasehold property – over the period of the lease
• Plant and machinery
 – Computer hardware and motor vehicles – three years
 – Presses – 15 years
 – Other plant and machinery – five to ten years
The residual values and useful lives of the assets are reviewed, 
and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately 
to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount is greater 
than its estimated net realisable value. Gains and losses on 
disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying 
amounts. These are included in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. 
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the 
process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or  
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to  
the financial statements are disclosed below.
Retirement benefit obligations
Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires 
estimation of future changes in inflation and mortality rates, 
and the selection of a suitable discount rate (see note 10).
Impairment of intangible assets
The Group capitalises the development of new products 
and processes as intangible assets or property, plant 
and equipment. Initial capitalisation and any subsequent 
impairment is based on the Group’s judgement that 
technological and economic feasibility is demonstrated. In 
determining the amounts to be capitalised the Group makes 
assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation 
of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected 
period of benefits.
Valuation of acquired intangible assets
Acquisitions may result in the recognition of customer 
relationships, brands and trademarks, patents and order 
backlogs. Valuation estimates are used to determine the fair 
values of these intangible assets. This includes estimation 
of future cash flows, weighted average cost of capital and 
useful lives.
Taxation
The Group operates in a number of countries around the world. 
Uncertainties exist in relation to the interpretation of complex 
tax legislation, changes in tax laws and the amount and timing 
of future taxable income. In some jurisdictions agreeing tax 
liabilities with local tax authorities can take several years. This 
could necessitate future adjustments to taxable income and 
expense already recorded. At the year end date, tax liabilities 
and assets are based on management’s judgements around the 
application of the tax regulations and management’s estimate of 
the future amounts that will be settled.
The Group’s operating model involves the cross-border supply 
of goods into end markets. There is a risk that different tax 
authorities could seek to assess higher profits (or lower costs) 
to activities being undertaken in their jurisdiction, potentially 
leading to higher total tax payable by the Group.
At 30 September 2017 there is a provision of £6.7m in 
respect of uncertain tax positions. Due to the uncertainties 
noted above, there is a risk that the Group’s judgments are 
challenged, resulting in a different tax payable or recoverable 
from the amounts provided. Management estimates that 
the reasonably possible range of outcomes is between an 
additional liability of up to £2.5m and a reduction in liabilities 
of up to £6.7m.
TAXATION
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current 
and deferred tax.
Taxable profit differs from accounting profit because it 
excludes certain items of income and expense that are 
recognised in the financial statements but are treated 
differently for tax purposes. Current tax is the amount of tax 
expected to be payable or receivable on the taxable profit or 
loss for the current period. This amount is then amended for 
any adjustments in respect of prior periods.
Current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been written 
into law (‘enacted’) or irrevocably announced/committed by 
the respective Government (‘substantively enacted’) at the 
period-end date. Current tax receivable (assets) and payable 
(liabilities) are offset only when there is a legal right to settle 
them net and the entity intends to do so. This is generally true 
when the taxes are levied by the same tax authority.
Because of the differences between accounting and taxable 
profits and losses reported in each period, temporary 
differences arise on the amount certain assets and liabilities 
are carried at for accounting purposes and their respective 
tax values. Deferred tax is the amount of tax payable or 
recoverable on these temporary differences.
Deferred tax liabilities arise where the carrying amount of 
an asset is higher than the tax value (more tax deduction has 
been taken). This can happen where the Group invests in 
capital assets, as governments often encourage investment 
by allowing tax depreciation to be recognised faster than 
accounting depreciation. This reduces the tax value of the 
asset relative to its accounting carrying amount. Deferred 
tax liabilities are generally provided on all taxable temporary 
differences. The periods over which such temporary 
differences reverse will vary depending on the life of the 
related asset or liability.
Deferred tax assets arise where the carrying amount of an 
asset is lower than the tax value (less tax benefit has been 
taken). This can happen where the Group has trading losses, 
which cannot be offset in the current period but can be carried 
forward. Deferred tax assets are recognised only where the 
Group considers it probable that it will be able to use such 
losses by offsetting them against future taxable profits.
However the deferred income tax is not accounted for if 
it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction other than a business combination that at the time 
of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit 
or loss.
Taxable temporary differences can also arise on investments 
in foreign subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures. Where the Group is able to control the reversal of 
these differences and it is probable that these will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future, then no deferred tax is provided. 
Deferred tax is calculated using the enacted or substantively 
enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled. Similarly to current taxes, 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is 
a legal right to settle them net and the entity intends to do so. 
This normally requires both assets and liabilities to have arisen 
in the same country.
Income tax expense reported in the financial statements 
comprises current tax as well as the effects of changes in 
deferred tax assets and liabilities. Tax expense/credits are 
generally recognised in the same place as the items to which 
they relate. For example, the tax associated with a gain 
on disposal is recognised in the income statement, in line 
with the gain on disposal. Equally, the tax associated with 
pension obligation actuarial gains and losses is recognised in 
other comprehensive income, in line with the actuarial gains 
and losses.
DIVIDENDS
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the Group’s 
financial statements in the period in which the dividends 
are approved by shareholders, while interim dividends are 
recognised in the period in which the dividends are paid.
SHARE CAPITAL
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new 
shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of 
tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company equity 
share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including 
any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), 
is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity 
holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed 
of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, 
any consideration received, net of any directly attributable 
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax 
effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s 
equity holders.

Exceptional integration costs – (0.5)
Defined benefit pension scheme administration costs (0.4) (0.3)
(6.0) (4.1)
The tax impact of the above gives rise to a deferred tax credit to the income statement of £1.0m (2016: £0.9m).
The impairment of capitalised development expenditure and plant and machinery in 2017 represents the write down of costs of 
developing the Emergency Escape Breathing Device (EEBD) product. Further development of this product has been terminated 
as there are limited commercial opportunities in the current market.
The integration costs in 2016 relate to the acquisition of the argus thermal imaging camera business and the relocation of the 
manufacturing to our Melksham, UK site.
Defined benefit pension scheme costs relate to administrative expenses of the scheme which is closed to future accrual. £1.0m 
(2016: £0.7m) of other finance expense relating to the pension scheme is also treated as an adjustment.
The impact on the cash flow statement of the exceptional items was £0.3m cash inflow (2016: £0.4m cash outflow).

Loss from discontinued operations – 0.3
The loss from discontinued operations in 2016 relates to dilapidations costs of former leased premises of a business which was 
disposed of in 2006. There was no tax impact of these costs.
Discontinued operations had no impact on the cashflow statement in 2017 (2016: £0.3m).

A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2016 Budget Statement, which reduce the 
main rate of corporation tax to 17% by 1 April 2020. These changes were substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets in respect of the following matters in the UK, as it is uncertain when the 
criteria for recognition of these assets will be met.

£m
Pension liability 44.1 39.9
Defined benefit pension scheme 
Full disclosures are provided in respect of the UK defined benefit pension scheme below.
The Group operated a contributory defined benefits plan to provide pension and death benefits for the employees of Avon 
Rubber p.l.c. and its Group undertakings in the UK employed prior to 31 January 2003. The plan was closed to future accrual 
of benefit on 1 October 2009 and has a weighted average maturity of approximately 17 years. The assets of the plan are held 
in separate trustee administered funds and are invested by professional investment managers. The Trustee is Avon Rubber 
Pension Trust Limited, the Directors of which are members of the plan. Four of the Directors are appointed by the Company 
and two are elected by the members.
The funding of the plan is based on regular actuarial valuations. The most recent finalised actuarial valuation of the plan 
was carried out at 31 March 2016 when the market value of the plan’s assets was £298.6m. The fair value of those assets 
represented 90% of the value of the benefits which had accrued to members, after allowing for future increase in pensions.
During the year the Group made payments to the fund of £1.0m (2016: 0.7m), in respect of scheme expenses and deficit 
recovery plan payments. In accordance with the deficit recovery plan agreed following the 31 March 2016 actuarial valuation, 
the Group will make payments in 2018 of £1.5m in respect of deficit recovery plan payments and scheme expenses.
The defined benefit plan exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, inflation risk and investment risk.
An updated actuarial valuation for IAS 19 (revised) purposes was carried out by an independent actuary at 30 September 2016 
using the projected unit method.
8 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the employee share ownership trust. The Company 
has dilutive potential ordinary shares in respect of the Performance Share Plan (see page 61). Adjusted earnings per share 
removes the effect of the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, exceptional items, acquisition costs and defined benefit 
pension scheme costs.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Inflation (RPI) 3.10 2.85

Mortality rate
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice, published statistics and experience. The average life 
expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date is as follows:
2017 2016
Male 22.2 21.9
Female 24.1 23.9
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65, 20 years after the balance sheet date is as follows:

Inflation (RPI) (0.25% increase) 7.3
Discount rate for scheme liabilities (0.25% increase) (11.4)
Future mortality (one year increase) 12.3
The above sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the defined benefit obligation only, not the net pension liability as it does not 
take into account any impact on the asset valuation. 
Each sensitivity analysis disclosed in this note is based on changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.  
In practice, this is unlikely to occur.
Defined contribution pension scheme

The Liability Driven Investment (LDI) comprises a series of LIBOR-earning cash deposits which are combined with contracts to 
hedge interest rate and inflation rate risk over the expected life of the plan’s liabilities. 
All equity securities and corporate bonds have quoted prices in active markets. 
The aim of the Trustee is to invest the assets of the plan to ensure that the benefits promised to members are provided. The 
target weightings under the current asset allocation strategy are 50% to growth assets, 20% to mid-risk assets and 30% to LDI.

Development expenditure is amortised over a period between five and 15 years.  
Computer software is amortised over a period between three and seven years. 
The remaining useful economic life of the development expenditure is between five and 12 years.
Acquired intangibles include customer relationships, development costs, order book on acquisition and brands and are amortised 
over a period between three and ten years. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the groups of cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to 
benefit from that business combination. Goodwill of £1.8m (2016: £1.8m) is allocated to the Protection division and £1.4m 
(2016: £1.4m) is allocated to the Dairy division.  
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
Goodwill values are compared against the value in use of the relevant CGU groups. The value in use calculations were based 
on projected cash flows for 2018 to 2020 derived from the latest three year plan approved by the Board. Cash flows for 2021 
onwards for both divisions were projected to grow by 2.0% per annum. Cash flows were discounted to give a present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate of 11.7%.       
Management considers that there are no reasonably likely changes to the above key assumptions which would lead to an 
impairment being recognised.       .

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW (i) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and monies on deposit with 
financial institutions.
The US Government through the Department of Defense is a major customer of the Group. Credit evaluations are carried 
out on all non-Government customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set above this 
depending on the value of the sale. At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk, except  
in respect of the US Government noted above.
Counterparty risk arises from the use of derivative financial instruments. This is managed through credit limits, counterparty 
approvals and rigorous monitoring procedures. 
Where possible, letters of credit or payments in advance are received for significant export sales. 
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.

facility in the UK. £0.3m of this provision is expected to be utilised in 2018 and the remaining £0.9m over the following three 
years. Other property obligations relate to former premises of the Group which are subject to dilapidation risks and are expected 
to be utilised within the next ten years. Property provisions are subject to uncertainty in respect of the utilisation, non-utilisation, 
or subletting of surplus leasehold property and the final negotiated settlement of any dilapidation claims with landlords.
19  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial instruments by category
Trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments) and cash and cash equivalents are classified as ‘loans and receivables’. 
Borrowings and trade and other payables are classified as ‘other financial liabilities at amortised cost’. Both categories are initially 
measured at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost.
Derivatives (forward exchange contracts) are classified as ‘derivatives used for hedging’ and accounted for at fair value with gains 
and losses taken to reserves through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Financial risk and treasury policies
The Group’s treasury management team maintains liquidity, manages relations with the Group’s bankers, identifies and manages 
foreign exchange risk and provides a treasury service to the Group’s businesses. Treasury dealings such as investments, 
borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of foreign exchange rate risk. The Group treasury management team 
is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying 
exposure. Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure 
may be hedged by the use of forward exchange contracts.

(iii) Market risks    
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s results.  
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control risk within suitable parameters.
(a) Currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than Sterling. 
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the US Dollar and related currencies and the Euro. The Group hedges material 
forecast US Dollar or euro foreign currency transactional exposures using forward exchange contracts. In respect of other 
monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than Sterling, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an 
acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at 
fair value through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Fair value is assessed by reference to year end spot 
exchange rates, adjusted for forward points associated with contracts of similar duration. The fair value of forward exchange 
contracts used as hedges at 30 September 2017 was a £0.2m asset (2016: £0.9m liability).
All forward exchange contracts in place at 30 September 2017 mature within one year. 
Sensitivity analysis
It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal (in particular other exchange rates), a general change of five cents in the 
value of the US Dollar against Sterling would have had a £0.7m (2016: £0.6m) impact on the Group’s current year profit before 
interest and tax, a £0.7m (2016: £0.6m) impact on the Group’s profit after tax and a £1.7m (2016: £0.9m) impact on shareholders’ 
funds. The method of estimation, which has been applied consistently, involves assessing the translation impact of the US Dollar.
A general change of five cents in the value of the Euro against Sterling would have had an £0.1m (2016: nil) impact on the 
Group’s current year profit before interest and tax, a £0.1m (2016: nil) impact on the Group’s profit after tax and a £1.0m 
(2016: £0.2m) impact on shareholders’ funds. The method of estimation which has been applied consistently, involves assessing 
the translation impact of the Euro.

20.4 (0.3) 20.1 18.4 (0.4) 18.0
The total past due receivables, net of provisions is £3.4m (2016: £3.1m).
The individually impaired receivables mainly relate to a number of independent customers. A portion of these receivables is 
expected to be recovered. For trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historical collection experience, 
management records an impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection.
(ii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach  
to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, 
under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group uses weekly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its borrowing position. Typically 
the Group ensures that it has sufficient borrowing facilities to meet foreseeable operational expenses and at the year end had 
facilities of £32.0m (2016: £33.4m).

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW Derivatives 
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined by using valuation techniques using year end spot rates, adjusted 
for the forward points to the contract’s value date. No contract’s value date is greater than one year from the year end. These 
instruments are included in level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation is based on inputs that are either directly or 
indirectly observable. 
Secured loans 
As the loans are floating rate borrowings, amortised cost is deemed to reflect fair value. 
Trade and other receivables/payables
As the majority of receivables/payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect  
the fair value.

19  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
(b) Interest rate risk
The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area. All foreign currency cash deposits are made at prevailing interest 
rates and where rates are fixed the period of the fix is generally not more than one month. The main element of interest rate risk 
concerns borrowings which are made on a floating LIBOR-based rate and short-term overdrafts in foreign currencies which are 
also on a floating rate.
The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations but with net cash of £24.7m (2016: £2.0m) a 1% increase in interest rates 
would have no material impact on interest costs (2016: nil).
The floating rate financial liabilities comprised bank loans bearing floating interest rates fixed by reference to the relevant LIBOR 
or equivalent rate. 
All cash deposits are on floating rates or overnight rates based on the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
(iv) Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio, calculated as net debt divided by capital. Net debt is calculated as 
total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is measured by the current market capitalisation of the Group, plus 
net debt. 
The Group’s net debt at the balance sheet date was:

24  SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The Group operates an equity-settled share based performance share plan (‘PSP’). Details of the Plan, awards granted and 
options outstanding are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 53 and 74 and are incorporated by reference into these 
financial statements. An expense of £0.9m was recognised in the year. In 2017 an error was identified in the process for valuing 
the share based payments charged to the income statement in previous years. The comparative figures for 2016 have therefore 
been restated to correct the charge and the related disclosures. The effect is to increase the 2016 share based payment charge 
(included in General and administrative expenses in the Income Statement) from £0.1m to £1.0m and to reduce statutory and 
adjusted operating profit by £0.9m. This reduces adjusted basic and basic earnings per share by 2.3 pence and reduces diluted 
earnings per share by 2.2 pence. The share based payment charge is a non-cash amount and there is no impact on the Group’s 
balance sheet.
A Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate the fair value of awards granted that are subject to a Total Shareholder Return 
performance condition. The fair value of other awards was calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant 
reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period. The principal assumptions used were:

Intangible assets comprise customer relationships (£0.6m), development costs (£0.8m), order book (£0.4m) and brand (£0.5m).
The results of the acquired business have been included in the Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income from  
8 October 2015 and contributed revenue of £5.5m and profit of £0.5m in 2016.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW Parent Company Accounting Policies
For the year ended 30 September 2017
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation 
of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis 
and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and with 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (FRS 101) and under the historical cost convention 
except for financial assets and liabilities (including derivative 
instruments) held at fair value through profit and loss.
The Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions 
available under FRS 101 in relation to the following:
• presentation of a cash flow statement and related notes
• comparative period reconciliations for share capital and 
intangible and tangible fixed assets
• transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries
• capital management 
• share based payments 
• financial instruments
• compensation of key management personnel
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the  
Group financial statements.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
The Company’s functional currency is Sterling. Foreign 
currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling 
on the date of transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from 
the retranslation at year end exchange rates of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the profit and loss account.
PENSIONS
The Company operated a contributory defined benefits plan 
to provide pension and death benefits for the employees 
of Avon Rubber p.l.c. and its Group undertakings in the 
UK employed prior to 31 January 2003. The scheme is 
closed to new entrants and was closed to future accrual of 
benefits from 1 October 2009. Scheme assets are measured 
using market values, while liabilities are measured using the 
projected unit method. One of the Company’s subsidiaries, 
Avon Polymer Products Limited is the employer that is legally 
responsible for the scheme and the pension obligations are 
included in full in its accounts. No asset or provision has been 
reflected in the Company’s balance sheet for any surplus or 
deficit arising in respect of pension obligations.
The Company also provides pensions by contributing to 
defined contribution schemes. The charge in the profit and 
loss account reflects the contributions paid and payable 
to these schemes during the period. Full disclosures of the 
UK pension schemes have been provided in the Group 
financial statements.
SHARE BASED PAYMENT
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share 
based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of the options is 
recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed 
over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair 
value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-
market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales 
growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included 
in assumptions about the number of options that are expected 
to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its 
estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. 
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, 
if any, in the profit and loss account. The proceeds received 
net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited 
to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the 
options are exercised.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Computer software is included in intangible assets at cost and 
amortised over its estimated life.
Impairment charges are made if there is significant doubt as 
to the sufficiency of future economic benefits to justify the 
carrying values of the intangible assets based upon discounted 
cash flow projections using an appropriate risk weighted 
discount factor.
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical 
cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised 
impairment losses.
Costs include the original purchase price of the asset and 
the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use including any qualifying 
finance expenses.
Depreciation is provided estimated to write down the 
depreciable amount of relevant assets by equal annual 
instalments over their estimated useful lives.
In general, the lives used are:
• Computer hardware – three years
• Other plant and machinery – five to ten years
The residual values and useful lives of the assets are reviewed, 
and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately 
to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount is greater 
than its estimated net realisable value. Gains and losses 
on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with 
carrying amounts.
LEASED ASSETS
Operating lease rentals are charged against profit over the 
term of the lease on a straight line basis.
INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are recorded at cost 
plus incidental expenses less any provision for impairment. 
Impairment reviews are performed by the Directors when 
there has been an indication of potential impairment.
DEFERRED TAXATION
Because of the differences between accounting and taxable 
profits and losses reported in each period, temporary 
differences arise on the amount certain assets and liabilities 
are carried at for accounting purposes and their respective 
tax values. Deferred tax is the amount of tax payable or 
recoverable on these temporary differences.
Deferred tax liabilities arise where the carrying amount of 
an asset is higher than the tax value (more tax deduction has 
been taken). This can happen where the Company invests in 
capital assets, as governments often encourage investment 
by allowing tax depreciation to be recognised faster than 
accounting depreciation. This reduces the tax value of the 
asset relative to its accounting carrying amount. Deferred 
tax liabilities are generally provided on all taxable temporary 
differences. The periods over which such temporary 
differences reverse will vary depending on the life of the 
related asset or liability.
Deferred tax assets arise where the carrying amount of an 
asset is lower than the tax value (less tax benefit has been 
taken). Deferred tax assets are recognised only where the 
Company considers it probable that it will be able to use such 
losses by offsetting them against future taxable profits.
However the deferred income tax is not accounted for if 
it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction other than a business combination that at the 
time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss.
Deferred tax is calculated using the enacted or substantively 
enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair 
value and subsequently held at amortised cost after deducting 
provisions for impairment of receivables.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, 
highly liquid interest-bearing securities with maturities of 
three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts 
are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the 
balance sheet.
TRADE PAYABLES
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services 
that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business 
from suppliers.
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment 
is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle 
of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-
current liabilities. They are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently held at amortised cost.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when:
• the Company has a legal or constructive obligation  
as a result of a past event
• it is probable that an outflow of resources will be  
required to settle the obligation and the amount has  
been reliably estimated
Where there are a number of similar obligations, for example 
where a warranty has been given, the likelihood that an 
outflow will be required in settlement is determined by 
considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is 
recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect 
to any one item included in the same class of obligation may 
be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Where a leasehold property, or part thereof, is vacant or sub-
let under terms such that the rental income is insufficient to 
meet all outgoings, provision is made for the anticipated future 
shortfall up to termination of the lease, or the termination 
payment, if smaller.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW 1  PARENT COMPANY
As a consolidated statement of comprehensive income is published, a separate profit and loss account for the parent company 
is omitted from the accounts by virtue of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The parent company’s profit for the 
financial year was £3.1m (2016 restated: £6.4m). As disclosed in note 24 to the Group Financial Statements, in 2017 an error 
was identified in the process for valuing the share based payments charged to the income statement in previous years. The 
comparative figures for 2016 have therefore been restated to correct the charge and the related disclosures. The effect is to 
increase the 2016 share based payment charge from £0.1m to £1.0m and to reduce profit for the year after tax by £0.7m.  
The share based payment charge is a non-cash amount and there is no impact on the Company’s balance sheet.
The audit fee in respect of the parent company is set out in note 5 to the Group financial statements.

Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 September 2017
BORROWINGS
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of 
transaction costs incurred and subsequently stated at 
amortised cost. Borrowing costs are expensed using the 
effective interest method.
DIVIDENDS
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the Company’s 
financial statements in the period in which the dividends 
are approved by shareholders, while interim dividends are 
recognised in the period in which the dividends are paid.
SHARE CAPITAL
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company purchases its own share capital 
(treasury shares) through Employee Share Ownership Trusts, 
the consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from 
shareholders’ funds until the shares are cancelled, reissued 
or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold 
or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related 
income tax effects, is included in shareholders’ funds.

1.5 2.5
Property obligations include an onerous lease provision of £1.2m in respect of unutilised space at the Group’s leased Melksham 
facility in the UK. £0.3m of this provision is expected to be utilised in 2018 and the remaining £0.9m over the following three 
years. Other property obligations relate to former premises of the Group which are subject to dilapidation risks and are expected 
to be utilised within the next ten years. Property provisions are subject to uncertainty in respect of the utilisation, non-utilisation, 
or subletting of surplus leasehold property and the final negotiated settlement of any dilapidation claims with landlords.
11  BORROWINGS
On 9 June 2014 the Company agreed new bank facilities with Barclays Bank and Comerica Bank. The combined facility 
comprises a revolving credit facility of $40m and expires on 30 November 2019. This facility is priced on the Dollar LIBOR plus  
a margin of 1.25% and includes financial covenants which are measured on a quarterly basis. The Company was in compliance 
with its financial covenants during 2017 and 2016.
The Company has provided the lenders with a negative pledge in respect of certain shares in Group companies.
There was no drawdown of loans in 2017 and 2016.

securities (or sell treasury shares) in pursuance of any 
such offer or agreement notwithstanding that the power 
conferred by this resolution has expired.
Resolution 11
That, subject to the passing of Resolution 9, the Directors be 
authorised, in addition to any authority granted under Resolution 
10, to allot equity securities (as defined by section 560 of the Act) 
for cash under the authority conferred by that resolution and/or 
to sell ordinary shares held by the Company as treasury shares 
for cash, as if section 561 of the Act did not apply to any such 
allotment or sale, provided that this power shall:
(a)  be limited to the allotment of equity securities or sale of 
treasury shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£1,551,164; and
(b)  be used for the purposes of financing (or refinancing, if 
the authority is to be used within six months after the 
original transaction) a transaction which the Directors 
have determined to be an acquisition or other capital 
investment of a kind contemplated by the Statement 
of Principles on Disapplying Pre-Emption Rights most 
recently published by the Pre-Emption Group prior to  
the date of this notice; and
(c)  expire on the date 15 months after the date of this 
Resolution or, if earlier, the date of the next annual 
general meeting of the Company (unless renewed, varied 
or revoked by the Company prior to or on that date) 
save that the Company may, before such expiry make an 
offer or agreement which would or might require equity 
securities to be allotted (or treasury shares to be sold) 
after such expiry and the Directors may allot equity 
securities (or sell treasury shares) in pursuance of any 
such offer or agreement notwithstanding that the power 
conferred by this Resolution has expired.
Resolution 12
That the Company be and is hereby unconditionally and 
generally authorised for the purpose of section 701 of the 
Act to make market purchases (within the meaning of 693(4) 
of the Act) of ordinary shares of £1 each in the capital of the 
Company provided that:
(a)  the maximum number of shares which may be purchased 
is 3,102,329;
(b)  the minimum price (excluding expenses) which may be 
paid for each share is £1;
(c)  the maximum price (excluding expenses) which may be 
paid for each ordinary share is an amount equal to the 
higher of: 
 (i)  105% (one hundred and five percent) of the average 
of the middle market quotations of the Company’s 
ordinary shares as derived from the Official List of 
the London Stock Exchange for the 5 (five) business 
days immediately preceding the day on which such 
share is contracted to be purchased; and
 (ii)  the value of an ordinary share calculated on the 
basis of the higher of the price quoted for the 
last independent trade of and the highest current 
independent bid for any number of the Company’s 
ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange 
Official List at the time the purchase is agreed; and
(d)  this authority shall expire on the date 15 months after the 
date of this Resolution or, if earlier, the date of the next 
annual general meeting of the Company (except in relation 
to the purchase of shares the contract for which was 
concluded before the expiry of such authority and which 
might be executed wholly or partly after such expiry) 
unless such authority is renewed prior to such time.
Resolution 13
That a general meeting of the Company (other than an 
annual general meeting), may be called on not less than  
14 clear days’ notice.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW
132 Avon Rubber p.l.c. 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Board believes that the adoption of resolutions 1 to 13 
will promote the success of the Company and is in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole. The 
Board unanimously recommends that all shareholders should 
vote in favour of all the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM. 
Each of the Directors of the Company intends to vote in favour 
of all resolutions in respect of their own beneficial holdings.
Resolution 1 – Report and Accounts
The Directors are required by law to present to the AGM the 
accounts, and the reports of the Directors and Auditors, for 
the year ended 30 September 2017. These are contained in 
the Company’s 2017 Annual Report.
Resolution 2 – Directors’ Remuneration Report
Resolution 2 seeks approval for the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the year ended 30 September 2017 contained 
on pages 53 to 74 of the Annual Report. As in previous 
years, the vote on this resolution is advisory only and the 
Directors’ entitlement to remuneration is not conditional on 
it being passed. The Company’s Remuneration Policy, which 
is re-stated in the Remuneration Report was approved by 
shareholders at the 2016 AGM and an amended policy will be 
put before shareholders at the 2019 AGM. No amendments 
to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy are proposed at this 
year’s AGM.
Resolution 3 – Declaration of a dividend
A final dividend can only be paid after the shareholders have 
approved it at a general meeting. The Directors recommend 
that a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 
30 September 2017 of 8.21p be paid. 
Subject to approval, the final dividend will be paid on 
16 March 2018 to eligible shareholders on the Company’s 
register of members at close of business on 16 February 2018.
Resolutions 4 to 6 – Election and re-election of Directors
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
the Company’s Articles, all Directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment, and to 
re-election thereafter at intervals of no more than three years. 
Non-Executive Directors who have served longer than nine 
years are subject to annual re-election.
David Evans retires by rotation and, being eligible, offers 
himself for re-election.
Paul McDonald was appointed as a Director with effect from  
15 February 2017 and Nick Keveth was appointed with 
effect from 1 June 2017. In accordance with the Company’s 
Articles, both retire at this year’s AGM and Resolutions 5 and 
6 propose their re-appointment.
Resolution 7 & 8 – Re-appointment and remuneration 
of Auditors
The current appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP (‘PwC’) as auditor of the Company terminates at the 
conclusion of the AGM. As noted in the Audit Committee 
Report on pages 50 to 52, the Audit Committee intends to 
commence a tender process for the external audit mandate. 
Under new legislation on mandatory audit firm rotation, 
which came into force in June 2016, listed companies are 
required to change auditor at least every 20 years. As PwC 
would not be able to remain as external auditors after 2020, 
it has been agreed that PwC will not participate in the 
forthcoming tender process. 
As the tender process will not have concluded before the 
AGM, and the Company should at all times have an auditor 
in place, PwC has confirmed its willingness to stand for 
reappointment as auditor of the Company at the upcoming 
AGM and the Directors recommend their reappointment.
Following the tender process the Board will appoint a 
successor to replace PwC to act as external auditor in 
respect of the 2018 financial year until the conclusion  
of the 2019 AGM, at which shareholders will be invited  
to vote on their reappointment.
The Directors are also seeking authority to set the 
auditor’s remuneration. 
Resolution 9 – Directors’ authority to allot
This Resolution deals with the Directors’ authority to allot 
Relevant Securities in accordance with section 551 of the 
Act. The authority granted at the last annual general meeting 
is due to expire at the conclusion of this year’s AGM and 
accordingly it is proposed to renew this authority.
This Resolution will, if passed, authorise the Directors to 
allot Relevant Securities up to a maximum nominal amount of 
£10,341,097, which is equal to approximately one-third of the 
issued share capital of the Company as at 15 November 2017 
in accordance with institutional shareholder guidelines. 
The Directors have no present intention of exercising 
this authority.
The authority granted by this resolution will expire on the date 
15 months after the date of this Resolution or, if earlier, the 
date of the next annual general meeting of the Company.
EXPLANATORY NOTES RELATING TO THE RESOLUTIONS
In this resolution, Relevant Securities means:
(i)  shares in the Company other than shares allotted 
pursuant to:
 –  an employee share scheme (as defined by section 
1166 of the Act);
 –  a right to subscribe for shares in the Company 
where the grant of the right itself constituted a 
Relevant Security; or
 –  a right to convert securities into shares in the 
Company where the grant of the right itself 
constituted a Relevant Security; and 
(ii)  any right to subscribe for or to convert any security into 
shares in the Company other than rights to subscribe for 
or convert any security into shares allotted pursuant to an 
employee share scheme (as defined by section 1166 of the 
Act). References to the allotment of Relevant Securities in 
this resolution include the grant of such rights.
Resolution 10 – General disapplication of pre-emption rights
This Resolution will, if passed, give the Directors power, 
pursuant to the authority to allot granted by Resolution 9, to 
allot equity securities (as defined by section 560 of the Act) 
or sell treasury shares for cash without first offering them to 
existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings 
up to a maximum nominal amount of £1,551,164 which 
represents approximately 5% of the Company’s issued share 
capital as at 15 November 2017 and renews the authority 
given at the AGM in 2017.
The figure of 5% reflects the Pre-Emption Group 2015 
Statement of Principles for the disapplication of pre-emption 
rights (the ‘Statement of Principles’). The Directors will have 
due regard to the Statement of Principles in relation to any 
exercise of this power, in particular they do not intend to allot 
shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis pursuant to this 
power in excess of an amount equal to 7.5% of the total issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company in any rolling three 
year period, without prior consultation with shareholders save 
as permitted in connection with an acquisition or specified 
capital investment as described in the notes for Resolution 11.
The power granted by this Resolution will expire on the date 
15 months after the date of this Resolution or, if earlier, the 
date of the next annual general meeting of the Company.
The Directors have no present intention to exercise the 
authority conferred by this resolution.
Resolution 11 – Additional disapplication of pre-emption rights
This Resolution seeks a further power pursuant to the 
authority granted by Resolution 9, to allot equity securities 
(as defined by section 560 of the Act) or sell treasury 
shares for cash without first offering them to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings up to a 
maximum nominal amount of £1,551,164 which represents 
approximately 5% of the Company’s issued share capital as at 
15 November 2017. This is in addition to the 5% referred to 
in Resolution 10 above.
The power granted by this Resolution will expire on the date 
15 months after the date of this Resolution or, if earlier, the 
date of the next annual general meeting of the Company.
The Directors will have due regard to the Statement of 
Principles in relation to any exercise of this power and in 
particular they confirm that they intend to use this power only 
in connection with a transaction which they have determined 
to be an acquisition or other capital investment (of a kind 
contemplated by the Statement of Principles most recently 
published prior to the date of this Notice) which is announced 
contemporaneously with the announcement of the issue, or 
which has taken place in the preceding six month period and is 
disclosed in the announcement of the issue.
Resolution 12 – Authority to purchase own shares
This Resolution seeks authority for the Company to make 
market purchases of its own shares and is proposed as a 
special resolution. If passed, the resolution gives authority for 
the Company to purchase up to 3,102,329 ordinary shares of 
£1 each, representing 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital as at 15 November 2017.
The Resolution specifies the minimum and maximum prices 
which may be paid for any ordinary shares purchased under 
this authority. The authority will expire on the earlier of the 
date 15 months after the date of this Resolution and the 
Company’s next AGM. The Company purchased no ordinary 
shares in the period from the last AGM to 15 November 
2017 under the existing authority. 
The Directors have no present intention of exercising the 
authority to make market purchases; however, the authority 
provides the flexibility to allow them to do so in the future.

135 Avon Rubber p.l.c. 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW The Directors will exercise this authority only when, in the 
light of market conditions prevailing at the time, they believe 
that the effect of such purchases will be to increase the 
earnings per ordinary share having regard to the intent of the 
guidelines of institutional investors and that such purchases 
are in the best interests of shareholders generally. Other 
investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the 
overall position of the Company will be taken into account 
before deciding upon this course of action. In the event of any 
purchase under this authority, the Directors would either hold 
the purchased ordinary shares in treasury or cancel them. 
Bonus and incentive scheme targets for Executive Directors 
would not be affected by any enhancement of earnings per 
share following a share re-purchase.
As of 15 November 2017 there were options to subscribe 
outstanding over 415,207 ordinary shares, representing 
1.34% of the Company’s ordinary issued share capital. If the 
authority given by Resolution 12 were to be fully exercised, 
these options would represent 1.49% of the Company’s 
ordinary issued share capital after cancellation of the re-
purchased shares. As of 15 November 2017 there were  
no warrants outstanding over ordinary shares.
Resolution 13 – Notice of Meeting
Resolution 13 is a resolution to allow the Company to hold 
general meetings (other than annual general meetings) on 
14 days’ notice.
Before the introduction of the Companies (Shareholders’ 
Rights) Regulations in August 2009, the Company was able 
to call general meetings (other than annual general meetings) 
on 14 clear days’ notice. One of the amendments that the 
Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 made to 
the Act was to increase the minimum notice period for listed 
company general meetings to 21 days, but with an ability for 
companies to reduce this period back to 14 days (other than 
for annual general meetings) provided that: (i) the Company 
offers facilities for shareholders to vote by electronic 
means; and (ii) there is an annual resolution of shareholders 
approving the reduction in the minimum notice period from 
21 days to 14 days.
Resolution 13 is therefore proposed as a special resolution 
to approve 14 days as the minimum period of notice for all 
general meetings of the Company other than annual general 
meetings. The approval will be effective until the Company’s 
next annual general meeting, when it is intended that the 
approval be renewed. The Company will use this notice period 
only when permitted to do so in accordance with the Act and 
when the Directors consider it appropriate to do so.
Notice of Annual General Meeting continued
(1)  Information regarding the annual general meeting 
including the information required by section 311A  
of the Act, is available at www.avon-rubber.com.
(2)  In order to be able to attend and vote at the AGM 
or any adjourned meeting (and also for the purpose 
of calculating how many votes a person may cast), a 
person must have his/her name entered on the register 
of members of the Company by close of business on 
30 January 2018 (or close of business on the date 
two days before any adjourned meeting, ignoring 
non-working days). Changes to entries on the register 
of members after this time shall be disregarded in 
determining the rights of any person to attend or 
vote at the AGM.
(3)  A form of proxy is enclosed for use by shareholders and, 
if appropriate, must be deposited with the Company’s 
registrars, Link Asset Services, PXS1, 34 Beckenham 
Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4ZF not less than 48 hours 
before the time of the AGM. Appointment of a proxy 
does not preclude a shareholder from attending the 
AGM and voting in person.
(4)  A member entitled to attend and vote at the AGM 
may appoint one or more proxies (who need not be a 
member of the Company) to attend and to speak and to 
vote on his or her behalf whether by show of hands or 
on a poll. A member can appoint more than one proxy 
in relation to the AGM, provided that each proxy is 
appointed to exercise the rights attaching to different 
shares held by him. In order to be valid an appointment 
of proxy (together with any authority under which it is 
executed or a copy of the authority certified notarially) 
must be returned by one of the following methods:
 (a)  in hard copy form by post, by courier or by hand 
to the Company’s registrars, Link Asset Services, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4ZF;
 (b) via www.signalshares.com; or
 (c)  in the case of CREST members, by utilising the 
CREST electronic proxy appointment service in 
accordance with the procedures set out below,
  and in each case must be received by the Company  
not less than 48 hours before the time of the AGM.
  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies 
through the CREST electronic proxy appointment 
service may do so for the AGM and any adjournment 
thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST 
Manual (available from https://euroclear.com). CREST 
personal members or other CREST sponsored members, 
and those CREST members who have appointed a 
voting service provider(s) should refer to their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able  
to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
  In order for a proxy appointment, or instruction, 
made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate 
CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be 
properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear 
UK & Ireland Limited’s (‘EUI’) specifications and must 
contain the information required for such instructions, 
as described in the CREST Manual. Regardless of 
whether it relates to the appointment of a proxy or to 
an amendment to the instruction given to a previously 
appointed proxy the message must, in order to be valid, 
be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent 
(ID RA 10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy 
appointments specified in this Notice. 
  For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be 
the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the 
message by the CREST Applications Host) from which 
the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by 
enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. 
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy 
Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 
35(5) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. 
CREST members and where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting service providers should note that 
EUI does not make available special procedures in 
CREST for any particular messages. Normal system 
timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to 
the input of CREST Proxy instructions. It is therefore the 
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take 
(or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member 
or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service 
provider(s), to procure that his or her CREST sponsor or 
voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be 
necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by 
means of the CREST system by any particular time. In 
this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, 
their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are 
referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST 
Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST 
system and timings.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW (5)  The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons 
whose shares are held on their behalf by another 
person and who have been nominated to receive 
communication from the Company in accordance 
with section 146 of the Act (‘Nominated Persons’). 
Nominated Persons may have a right under an 
agreement with the registered shareholder who holds 
shares on their behalf to be appointed (or to have 
someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if 
Nominated Persons do not have such a right, or do not 
wish to exercise it, they may have a right under such an 
agreement to give instructions to the person holding the 
shares as to the exercise of voting rights.
(6)  To change your proxy instructions simply submit 
a new proxy appointment using the methods set 
out above. Note that the cut-off time for receipt 
of proxy appointments (see above) also applies in 
relation to amended instructions; any amended proxy 
appointment received after the relevant cut-off time 
will be disregarded.
(7)  In the case of joint holders, where more than one of 
the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the 
appointment submitted by the most senior holder will 
be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in 
which the names of the joint holders appear in the 
Company’s register of members in respect of the joint 
holding (the first-named being the most senior).
(8)  In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to 
inform the Company by sending a signed hard copy 
notice clearly stating your intention to revoke your 
proxy appointment to the Company’s registrars, Link 
Asset Services, PXS1, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, 
Kent BR3 4ZF. In the case of a member which is a 
company, the revocation notice must be executed under 
its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer 
of the company or an attorney for the company. Any 
power of attorney or any other authority under which 
the revocation notice is signed (or a duly certified copy 
of such power or authority) must be included with the 
revocation notice.
  In either case, the revocation notice must be received by 
the Company’s registrars, Link Asset Services Registrars, 
PXS1, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4ZF 
no later than 30 January 2018 at 10.30am.
  If you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but 
the revocation is received after the time specified then, 
subject to the paragraph directly below, your proxy 
appointment will remain valid.
  Appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from 
attending the AGM and voting in person. If you have 
appointed a proxy and attend the AGM in person, your 
proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.
(9)  A corporation which is a member can appoint one or 
more corporate representatives who may exercise, on 
its behalf, all its powers as a member provided that 
no more than one corporate representative exercises 
powers over the same share.
(10)  Any member attending the AGM has the right to ask 
questions. The Company must cause to be answered 
any such question relating to the business being dealt 
with at the AGM, but no such answer need be given if; 
(a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation 
for the AGM or involve the disclosure of confidential 
information, (b) the answer has already been given on 
a website in the form of an answer to a question, or (c) 
it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the 
good order of the AGM that the question be answered. 
(11)  Biographical details of the Directors are shown on  
page 42 of the Annual Report.
(12)  The issued share capital of the Company as at 
15 November 2017 was 31,023,292 ordinary shares, 
carrying one vote each and representing the total 
number of voting rights in the Company.
(13)  Copies of Executive Directors’ service agreements and 
copies of the terms and conditions of appointment of 
Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at 
the Company’s registered office during normal business 
hours from the date of this Notice until the close of the 
AGM (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excluded) 
and will be available for inspection at the place of the 
AGM for at least 15 minutes prior to and during the 
AGM. 
(14)  Please note that the Company takes all reasonable 
precautions to ensure no viruses are present in any 
electronic communication it sends out but the Company 
cannot accept responsibility for loss or damage arising 
from the opening or use of any email or attachments 
from the Company and recommends that the members 
subject all messages to virus checking procedures prior 
to use. Any electronic communication received by the 
Company, including the lodgement of an electronic  
proxy form, that is found to contain any virus will not  
be accepted.
(15)  Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the 
threshold requirements set out in that section have the 
right to require the Company to publish on a website 
a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the 
audit of the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s 
report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid 
before the AGM; or (ii) any circumstance connected 
with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office 
since the previous meeting at which annual accounts 
and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 
of the Act, (in each case) that the members propose to 
raise at the AGM. The Company may not require the 
members requesting any such website publication to 
pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 
of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a 
statement on a website under section 527 of the Act, it 
must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor 
not later than the time when it makes the statement 
available on the website. The business which may be 
dealt with at the AGM includes any statement that the 
Company has been required under section 527 of the 
Act to publish on a website.
(16)  Under section 338 and section 338A of the Act, 
shareholders meeting the threshold requirements in 
those sections have the right to require the Company: 
(i) to give, to the Company’s shareholders entitled to 
receive notice of the meeting, notice of a resolution 
which may properly be moved and is intended to be 
moved at the meeting; and/or (ii) to include in the 
business to be dealt with at the meeting any matter 
(other than a proposed resolution) which may be 
properly included in the business. A resolution may 
properly be moved or a matter may properly be 
included in the business unless: (a) (in the case of a 
resolution only) it would, if passed, be ineffective 
(whether by reason of inconsistency with any enactment 
or the Company’s constitution or otherwise); (b) it 
is defamatory of any person; or (c) it is frivolous or 
vexatious. Such a request may be in hard copy form or 
in electronic form, must identify the resolution of which 
notice is to be given or the matter to be included in the 
business, must be authorised by the person or persons 
making it, must be received by the Company not later 
than six clear weeks before the AGM, and (in the case 
of a matter to be included in the business only) must be 
accompanied by a statement setting out the grounds for 
the request. 
(17)  You may not use any electronic address provided in 
either the Notice of Annual General Meeting or any 
related documents (including the Form of Proxy) to 
communicate with the Company for any purposes  
other than those expressly stated.
