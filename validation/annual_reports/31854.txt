Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Chairman’s Statement
Achieving 
our objectives
" We will continue to work hard  
to run our existing businesses  
as efficiently and effectively 
as possible whilst investing 
for the future..."
Peter Baker
Non-Executive Chairman 4 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
We continue to make good progress  
in line with our stated aim of becoming  
a leading speciality bakery group  
in the UK. 
We have delivered a resilient performance despite  
the changing consumer and customer dynamics 
and the challenging economic environment for  
food manufacturers across the industry, which 
has made the journey somewhat slower and 
harder than expected. The Board has reviewed 
the Group’s strategy in the light of these external  
changes and has concluded that there is no need  
for any radical change of direction and we still 
firmly believe we are set on the right path to 
achieve our goal. We will continue to work hard 
to run our existing businesses as efficiently and  
effectively as possible whilst investing for the  
future and keeping a solid balance sheet that can  
be utilised, as and when the right opportunities 
present themselves.
The Board welcomed Bob Beveridge as a  
Non-Executive Director in July and he will be  
joining the Audit Committee. The new Group 
management structure has bedded in well and  
is delivering the scale opportunities and benefits  
expected, whilst preserving our largely 
decentralised site system.
The Results
The Group’s revenue for the 52 weeks was 
£314.3m, up 0.3%, on a like for like basis, 
compared to last year’s adjusted 52 week figure. 
Profit before tax at £13.0m is up from £11.8m 
in the prior period, which on an adjusted and 
like for like basis is £16.6m versus £15.7m, 
representing a 5.6% increase. Debt is at 0.7 
times EBITDA.
This result delivers on our expectations and 
has been achieved against a deflationary UK 
retail food market which is changing in terms 
of channel balance, as consumers shop in less 
traditional ways. This has led to an upswing 
in the discounter’s market share and online 
gains. Specific cost issues, that relate to the 
current weakness of Sterling and increased 
costs of the new national living wage have  
also had to be overcome through efficiency 
gains and price adjustment. The European 
business has performed strongly this year  
and has demonstrated the benefit of having  
a diversified portfolio. A full financial review  
is available further on in the Report. 
This outcome has not been easy to achieve 
and has only been possible because of our 
Board’s long-term focus on driving efficiency 
and managing costs, as well as the hard work 
of Finsbury’s committed team. This was 
demonstrated when the Board was presented 
with the results of the first Group employee 
engagement survey. The participation was 
excellent and the results gratifying, with only  
a few areas marked for improvement.  
Investing for the Future
The Group’s capital investment of £12.5m 
means we have completed, or are in the throes 
of completing, some very important strategic 
projects. A new cake line is coming on stream 
in Cardiff and there is a new IT system being 
rolled out which will give a common platform 
for the whole business. The benefits of these 
and other projects will help improve our overall 
productivity and offset increases in our cost base.
In light of the current environment, we maintain 
a strong focus on investing in our future. With this  
in mind we plan to invest in new plant, equipment  
and systems to further improve efficiency, 
product quality and our capability in sustainable  
and environmentally-responsible manufacturing. 
We continually assess our role within various 
product markets and are committed to critically 
reviewing our presence in those that are less  
successful. To this end the Company has entered  
into consultation with the workforce of Grain D’Or,  
the Group’s loss making pastry factory in North  
London, to close the site. This consultation will 
conclude mid-October.
Strategy for Continued Growth
The licensing of brands is an important part of the  
business and we have worked hard to improve 
and strengthen our relationships with existing 
licensees and we were delighted to launch a 
range of Mary Berry cakes in the second half 
of the year.
We continue to win awards for our products and  
to add to our capabilities, such as in a new cupcake  
line and an artisan bread production facility, 
both meeting the needs of changing consumer 
demands. In the same way, our new product 
development is increasingly directed towards 
providing healthier and more convenient 
products. 
Development of the foodservice channel is also 
an ongoing target for growth alongside any 
business acquisitions that meet our criteria.
Finally, on behalf of the Board I would like to thank  
everyone who works at Finsbury for delivering 
another successful year. Their passion, energy 
and contribution continues to drive the 
business forward. 
Dividends
The final dividend per share of 2.0p will take the  
total dividend for the year to 3.0p per share, up 
7% from last year’s dividend of 2.8p per share.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Chief Executive’s Report
" The Group is now one of  
the largest speciality bakery 
groups in the UK with a small 
but fast growing European 
business."
John Duffy
Chief Executive Officer
Achieving 
e ffi ci e n cy 6 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Since joining the Company in 2009, 
our team has been keenly focused 
on creating strong foundations and 
a competitive cost base to ensure 
that we are in a solid position to 
weather industry-wide challenges. 
Driving efficiency and scale has been a long-term  
focus for Finsbury and has represented the 
rationale behind a range of initiatives we have  
implemented over recent years.  
With this in mind, having been operating within 
a deflationary UK grocery food market during 
the period under review, the effectiveness of 
these initiatives has been tested. Therefore I am  
pleased to report on the solid performance and  
trading resilience the Group has demonstrated 
against the headwinds posed by sustained Sterling  
devaluation and high input costs experienced 
during FY 2017 . This performance, which includes  
growth in both Group sales and profit in the year 
on a like for like basis, follows several years of  
very strong organic and acquisition-led growth 
and demonstrates the benefits of the investment  
and diversification strategy implemented over 
recent years. Additionally, our strong cashflow 
and robust balance sheet allowed us to both 
reduce debt and increase our dividend whilst 
continuing to invest to strengthen our business 
for the future. 
The Group is now one of the largest speciality 
bakery groups in the UK with a small but fast  
growing European business. The latter performed  
particularly strongly as it benefited from 
improved celebration cake and free from product 
ranges and was boosted by the exchange rate 
tailwind from a weaker Sterling.
All food manufacturers and their customers 
have had to navigate the transition from the 
deflationary food market of recent years to the  
inflationary environment evident throughout 
the second half and beyond. Sterling’s structural  
decline amplified typically cyclical commodity 
input cost increases for UK manufacturers 
importing many of their ingredients. The National  
Living Wage has similarly amplified annual labour 
cost inflation throughout the labour intensive 
food and agriculture sector and indeed beyond. 
This trend looks set to continue for some time 
with high profile butter price hikes, driven by 
increased demand and a supply shortfall, the 
most significant example in recent months.
This market transition has seen us work 
proactively with our brand partners and customers  
to revise our product, pricing and promotional 
portfolio to strike the right sustainable balance  
of providing value for consumers whilst delivering  
on margin requirements. These are difficult 
customer conversations and whilst diminished 
promotional spend reduced sales growth in the  
short-term, operating margin was successfully 
maintained in FY17 in conjunction with our 
internal efficiency improvement initiatives  
and recent capital investment.
Strategic Investment Underpinning 
the Future
Finsbury’s goal is to ensure that the Group is well  
positioned to maintain pricing for consumers and  
to remain a low cost producer for customers. 
These resilient results are testament to the  
importance of continually investing in our  
operations in order to improve overall productivity 
and offset increases in the Group’s cost base.  
FY17 saw the second consecutive year of record  
capital investment at £12.5m, some 181%  
of depreciation, as we further strengthen the 
Group’s growth capacity, product capability, 
efficiency and cost competitiveness. 
This has seen the installation of a new automated 
whole cake line in an upgraded bakery at our  
Cardiff site. This is currently undergoing product 
commissioning for full production in FY18.  
We have also opened a new artisan bread bakery 
at our Salisbury site. Both of these will enable 
future growth aligned to changing consumer 
demand for premium, healthy and authentic 
product ranges across different market channels.
The second major investment area is focused 
on redesigning our business processes to drive  
scale and efficiency across the Group businesses.  
This standardisation of process across all sites 
in the Group establishes agreed best practice 
and this is then embedded within the roll out 
of our new ERP IT platform across the Group 
during the first half of FY18.
The third major investment area, largely non 
capital expenditure, is our ‘people’ strategy. 
Having successfully rolled out our vision and  
values last year, we completed our first Group 
employee engagement survey, with an 
engagement score of 68%, to establish a base 
for future improvement. A new Group-wide 
talent management system and an associated 
management development programme were 
also successfully deployed during the year to 
nurture the development of both today’s and, 
importantly, tomorrow’s leaders.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Chief Executive’s Report
Finally, we have entered into consultation for the  
closure of Grain D’Or, the Group’s loss-making 
pastry factory. Over the two and a half year  
period since acquisition we have been working 
closely with management of this site to stem 
the losses it experienced. However, although 
improvements have been made, the ongoing 
pressures from commodity and labour cost 
increases has made it difficult to maintain 
customer contracts. The cost to close, if seen  
as an investment, will be justified by the reduction  
in losses. The Group will update the market 
following the completion of the consultation 
process and, depending on the outcome,  
will outline the financial consequences  
of any decision.  
A Consistent Strategy  
for Uncertain Times
Our vision is to be a leading speciality bakery 
Group which produces a broad range of high  
quality products for growing channels and market  
niches, delivers growth and differentiation for  
our major customers, and fulfills end-consumer 
requirements. Our focus is on the UK but 
increasingly we are extending our reach  
into Europe.
We operate in competitive sectors and markets,  
supplying brand partners and customers with  
innovative, safe and high quality bakery products  
which anticipate and fulfil consumer trends, 
are efficiently and sustainably made and offer 
great value. These results show that this 
strategy has delivered results for the Group. 
Additional investment to better  
understand consumer needs and category 
growth opportunities complements the product,  
business process and people investment outlined 
previously. Our ability to leverage scale and best  
practice intellectual property across the Group,  
whilst delivering for individual customers and 
brand partners, is central to our continued 
competitiveness and underpins our growth 
ambitions. It is rewarding to see Group businesses  
winning a number of externally recognised 
industry and customer food awards, whilst also  
extending and deepening our licensed brand 
relationships with both existing partners such  
as Thorntons and Mars, as well as new partners 
such as Mary Berry.
In line with our stated growth strategy the Group  
has continued to explore acquisition opportunities  
that fit strategically and meet our value criteria. 
However, none were successful in the year as 
valuations remained unrealistic given known 
market headwinds. More challenging market  
conditions may provide new acquisition 
opportunities in the year ahead and we remain  
patient. Meanwhile there are ample opportunities  
identified to further strengthen and optimise 
our current Group businesses.
I would like to thank my Board, Executive teams  
and the thousands of colleagues across Finsbury  
for their continued commitment and hard work  
in baking great food products every day and in 
particular, to those individuals which drive the 
investment and change programmes on top  
of their other day job responsibilities.
The business environment isn’t going to get any  
easier but I remain confident that Finsbury has  
the right people, investment approach and M&A  
strategy to deliver growth in the years ahead, 
delivering value for employees, customers  
and shareholders alike.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Our business expertise and our baking skills continue  
to win industry accolades. The Bakery Industry Awards  
crowned us Celebration Cake Business of the year, 
while the International Licensing industry awarded 
us Best Licensed Food Product. Among many other 
successes were the Quality food award, the Café 
Quality food award and the Grocer Own Label 
Innovation award. 9 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
Our vision is to be a leading speciality  
bakery group producing a broad 
range of high quality products 
targeted at growing channels and 
market niches and which deliver 
growth and differentiation for our  
customers whilst fulfilling the needs  
of end consumers. 
Our focus is the UK but increasingly we are 
extending our reach into Europe, particularly 
for cake products.
Our growth strategy will be delivered by a 
combination of organic growth and targeted 
acquisitions. We will invest to consolidate and  
grow within existing areas, such as round cakes  
and artisan bread. We will also invest to expand  
our capabilities into new product formats and 
capability. This investment will accompany 
and facilitate the diversification of our product  
capability into new channels such as foodservice 
cake and gluten free. Further acquisitions will  
introduce new product, customer or channel  
diversification or accelerate market consolidation  
in our core product areas.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
We continually develop new lines to meet new 
consumer demand trends such as healthier and  
more convenient bakery products, and innovation 
is key to this. This year we invested in new cupcake 
production methods and another artisan bread

Strategic Report
Brands and Licences
The Group is proud to have a well balanced 
portfolio of retailer own label business and a  
strong and evolving licensed branded portfolio,  
all supported by collaborative and strategic 
partnerships. We also have our own cake brand,  
Memory Lane, and the Kara foodservice brand.
Kara
Kara is the innovative foodservice brand of the  
Finsbury Food Group, distributing to more than  
300 wholesalers and end users such as UK pubs,  
hotels and restaurant chains, as well as exporting  
to countries including Germany, France, Denmark,  
Portugal, Spain and Holland. The Kara brand  
is 100% dedicated to foodservice. Kara began  
its journey in 1985 with its famous floured baps, 
and today the range includes new premium 
additions such as artisan breads, brioche buns, 
traybakes and large premium cakes. Kara has 
successfully built an ever-growing portfolio  
of sweet and savoury baked goods; continuing 
to focus on the latest consumer trends, and 
developing new and innovative products that 
enable foodservice customers to stay ahead. 
The year to 1 July 2017 was one of 
consolidation for the foodservice business 
after several consecutive years of growth. 
Revenues marginally ahead of the prior year in  
a challenging foodservice market. New business  
was secured on the new cake ranges with the 
two major UK foodservice wholesalers, as well  
as major cafes and pub groups. Market leading  
Kara brioche buns continue to grow in line with  
demand for more premium product, traditional  
doughnuts continued their renaissance, and 
artisan bread products continued to grow in both  
sales and outlet penetration. There was strong 
growth in the top four customers, somewhat 
offset by reduced trading in export markets, 
particularly France, and also in some smaller 
customer business closures. The foodservice 
business also continued to grow its Kara branded 
sales, whilst still being a key supplier of own 
brand to core customers.
Thorntons
The Group has recently completed the renewal  
of its successful, long standing partnership with  
Thorntons which will extend this collaboration 
over two decades. The agreement will see the  
Group continue to produce and market cakes 
under the much loved Thorntons brand. 
Thorntons is still one of the fastest growing 
premium brands within cakes where continued 
success has come through strong product 
innovation across both celebration and 
snacking cakes.
Mary Berry
We are delighted to announce the partnership 
and launch of the new Mary Berry range in the  
Spring of this year. The full product range extends 
to loaf, sharing and celebration cakes which have  
all been developed in partnership to stay true  
to Mary Berry’s original recipes. The range brings  
a new dynamic to the cake category by providing 
a branded solution that appeals to a broader 
age demographic. 
Character Licensed Portfolio
Our character licences portfolio is a key focal  
point to the business which allows us to develop  
and produce products that meet consumer 
trends and occasions. We have a long standing 
relationship within the licensed industry which  
we are very proud of. Every licensed partnership  
is dear to our business and we take pride in being  
able to work together to bring popular characters  
to life across different cake formats. Successful 
licences for the Group this year have included 
Batman v’s Superman, Minions, Star Wars and 
Emoji which have been linked to big movie 
releases, together with well established 
evergreen properties such as Me to You,  
Peppa Pig and Paw Patrol.
The full product range extends to  
loaf, sharing and celebration cakes 
which have all been developed  
in partnership with Mary Berry's  
original recipes. 12 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Disney
As a long-term partner of the Disney brand, 
we have taken a leading role in supporting 
Disney’s strategy to inspire healthier choices 
for families and we have recently relaunched 
our celebration cake range with an innovative 
reduced sugar recipe. Our new range is the first  
in the UK to launch with Disney Kitchen branding 
and we continue to drive innovation and 
consumer enjoyment of the Disney brand  
in cake.
Mars
Mars has a wide portfolio of confectionery brands  
and we have worked in collaboration to develop 
an innovative cake range. The Galaxy and M&M 
cakes are built around key elements of these 
classic brands which provide the consumer 
cakes that meets most consumer occasions.
Vogel’s
Vogel's range of 'clean label’ breads are 
crammed to bursting with seeds and grains. 
Alfred Vogel was a pioneering Swiss nutritionist 
who created the first Vogel’s recipe in the 1950’s.  
He passionately championed natural ingredients, 
which is why Vogel’s loaves are baked without 
added sugar, emulsifiers, enzymes, or artificial 
preservatives or flavourings. To this day we share 
his commitment to tasty food and healthy living 
inspired by nature. The unique way we bake 
Vogel’s means it’s tremendously tasty toasted.

The range of organic fresh rye bread brands 
are perfect, if you are looking to avoid wheat. 
We keep it simple, only using the best organic 
natural ingredients: The Loyal range of rossisky 
and seeded rye breads will have the addition 
of a new Village Bakery pumpernickel rye loaf, 
made with molasses and a blend of kibbled 
ryes to give a distinct sweet and sour flavour. 
Keeping to minimal ingredients of organic 
flours, water, a little sea salt with the benefit 
that they are all made with no added yeast, 
emulsifiers or enzymes. 
Cranks
Cranks aspires to wholesome, simple, nutritious 
food. Our organic wholemeal loaf with organic 
stoneground flour is fermented for longer. 
Baked using specific baking processes that 
produces a loaf with great flavour through  
its fermentation process is made without any 
additives such as emulsifiers and enzymes. 
The popular stoneground wholemeal loaf 
will be joined by the new Cranks organic 
wholemeal seeded loaf.  
Consumer Trends
Differentiation for our customers whilst fulfilling  
the needs of the end consumers is key to the 
Group’s success, it follows that innovation and  
product development is an essential part of the  
Group’s strategy. We have worked under the four  
broad banners to be able to focus on the macro  
consumer trends. The continuing challenge for 
the Group is to match the consumer trends with  
our dynamic product portfolio. The Group’s 
new product development team reinforces 
Finsbury’s expertise as a leading speciality 
bakery and provides increased differentiation 
from our competitors.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
The Board recognises the need for a robust  
system of internal controls and risk management.  
The assessment of risks and the development 
of strategies for dealing with these risks are 
achieved on an ongoing basis through the way 
in which the Group is controlled and managed 
internally. A formal review of these risks is 
carried out by the Group on an annual basis.  
The review process involves the identification 
of risks, assessment to determine the relative 
likelihood of them impacting the business 
and the potential severity of the impact and 
determination of what needs to be done to 
manage them effectively. Risk management  
is integral to the ability of the Group to deliver 
on its strategic objectives.
The Directors have identified the following as 
the principal risks and uncertainties that face 
the Group:
Economic Environment
The market place remains challenging and  
there is an uncertain macro-economic outlook 
following the vote to leave the EU. Currency 
hedging and long-term contracts give the 
Group time to plan and formulate strategies 
to face future challenges. The Group will 
continue to focus on quality and value and 
will explore new channels, new products and 
new formats to gain competitive advantage. 
Forging strong customer relationships and 
aligning strategic business plans through 
innovation and category management helps 
create mutual growth opportunities.
The Impact of Brexit
Brexit brings uncertainty in the following areas:
Labour: The food industry employs many  
non-UK nationals, the sector in general could 
see a shortfall in workers. Increasing reliance 
on UK workers which may push up wage costs 
may prompt a change in business model. 
Material: The weakening of the pound post 
Brexit has had an impact on ingredient prices.
Regulations: All current regulations on food  
safety, labelling or health and safety will continue  
to apply to UK businesses. Product standards 
will need to be observed by UK companies 
when trading with the EU.
The Group will respond to the challenges that 
Brexit brings once negotiations are advanced. 
Competitive Environment and  
Customer Requirements
The environment remains competitive  
within the bakery sector. The monitoring of key  
performance indicators at customer level such  
as service levels and customer complaints is part  
of the risk management process associated with  
this specific risk. Providing quality products, 
investing in innovation and competing on value 
helps to strengthen customer relations and 
support growth initiatives. The Group invests 
heavily in category management, new  
product development and marketing skills. 
This investment has helped create an insight 
into customers and consumer demands. 
Product Quality
Product quality is a key strength of the Group 
and failure to maintain a high standard of safety 
and food quality would have a severe impact 
on service levels and customer relationships. 
The Group’s technical function is responsible 
for the implementation and maintenance  
of high standards for food safety striving for 
best practice. Quality assurance procedures 
are managed at site level and are reviewed 
continuously with improvements made as 
appropriate. The operating subsidiaries are 
subject to regular internal and independent 
food safety and quality control audits including 
those carried out by, or on behalf of, our 
customers. The Group maintains product recall 
insurance cover to mitigate the potential 
impact of such an occurrence.
Providing quality products, investing 
in innovation and competing on 
value helps to strengthen customer 
relations and support growth 
initiatives. 15 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
The National Living Wage is driving forward the  
cost of labour ahead of inflation and demand 
related adjustments. More recently the future  
availability of labour has become a concern.  
Ongoing capital investment and improvements  
in operational efficiency help reduce the impacts  
of both labour availability and cost as well  
as material inflation. 
Pension Fund Deficit
The Group has one defined benefit pension 
scheme within its Memory Lane Cakes Limited 
business in Cardiff. The scheme was closed to 
new members in 2010 to reduce the funding 
risk to Memory Lane Cakes. The valuation of 
the scheme on a technical provision basis as 
well as the underlying performance of the 
invested assets can cause large fluctuations in 
valuations. There is an agreed deficit recovery 
plan fixed until September 2023 or until a new 
schedule is agreed based on the next valuation 
which will be at 31 December 2018. 
Cyber Security
The Group is exposed to random and malicious 
attacks from cyber criminals. The maintenance  
of protections software is one tool in the fight  
to protect our data. In addition, the Group is  
investing to implement common information  
systems across all companies with standardised  
protection, operating requirements and security 
protection. Finally, real time back-up, training 
and regular communication pulls the Group’s 
defences together.
Group Systems
The Group will, during the next financial year,  
complete the upgrade of its business systems  
across UK bakery. The ERP system is the latest  
version of the existing system within the Fletchers  
business acquired in 2014. Recognising the  
inherent risks to a systems upgrade, an 
appropriate Corporate Governance structure 
has been put in place, a Steering Committee 
comprising senior operational management 
from both businesses and chaired by an 
independent implementation specialist with 
KPMG engaged to independently assess and 
advise the Board on progress and risks to the 
business associated with the program. The fact 
that the new ERP system is the latest version 
of the existing system in operation within the 
Fletcher’s business is also a significant risk 
reduction factor.
Dividend
Subject to shareholder approval at the Company’s  
AGM on 22nd November 2017, the final dividend  
of 2.0 pence per share will be paid on 22 December  
2017 to all shareholders on the register at 24 
November 2017 and will be recognised in the 
financial year ending 30 June 2018.
Financial Review
Continuing Group revenue for the 52 week period  
to 1 July 2017 was up 0.3% to £314.3 million 
(2016: £313.5 million 52 weeks, £319.7 million  
53 weeks). Operating profit margins were 5.5%  
(2016: 5.3%). Capital investment, improvement 
in operational efficiency and product mix are  
the main drivers for the improvement in margin.  
Administrative expenses have decreased despite 
inflationary pressures. This decrease is driven by  
continued focus on overhead control, operational  
improvements and efficiencies from record levels  
of capital investment. The prior year also 
included a charge of £2.8 million for the 
cancellation of legacy share options. 
Grain D’Or Business
The Group’s Grain D'Or business was acquired 
as part of the Fletchers acquisition in October 
2014, it is a producer of premium baked products  
for the UK pastry sector and based in London. 
The business has been historically loss making 
and despite the implementation of a range of  
initiatives to improve the business, including strict  
cost control and new working practices, the site  
remained loss making in the year to 1 July 2017.  
The Company now proposes to close the site.  
A formal consultation with representatives  
of the workforce commenced on 1 September 
2017. The consultation is expected to conclude 
mid October 2017. Until this consultation period 
concludes uncertainty remains over the use of 
the assets. In light of this, a decision has been 
taken to impair the assets used in the business 
by £4.0 million in the year to 1 July 2017.
Commodity and Labour Pressures
Bakery entails the use of commodities whose 
price is determined by worldwide demand and  
macro-economic factors. Commodity pressures  
have increased as a consequence of a number of  
factors; 1) A step change in the value of Sterling  
against both the Euro and Dollar following the 
Brexit vote. 2) The commodity cycle which, in the  
recent past, has been relatively low. The cycle 
has seen significant increases in the price 
of a number of commodities which are over 
and above any exchange rate deterioration.  
Finally, 3) European policies particularly in the 
areas of butter and sugar.  
The Group maintains a high level of  
expertise in its buying team and will consider 
long-term contracts where appropriate to 
reduce uncertainty in input prices. The team 
also cultivates strong relationships with major 
suppliers to ensure continuity of supply at 
competitive prices. Regular renovation and 
innovation in our product range can help 
to manage margin pressures in an effective 
manner as far as the competitive environment 
allows. The Group also purchases forward 
foreign currency in order to minimise the 
fluctuation of input costs linked to future 
currency conversion rates.  16 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Our foodservice business provides differentiation 
from our bakery retail sector business by servicing 
wholesalers and end users – such as pubs, hotels and 
restaurant chains – with ranges of convenient bread 
and cakes products. It also has a healthy export trade. 
Developing our foodservice channel is part of our 
strategy for growth.  17 Finsbury Food Group

Earnings Per Share (EPS)
EPS comparatives to the prior year can be distorted by significant non-recurring items and other items highlighted on the previous page, as well  
as the impact of the 53rd week for the previous financial year. The Board is focused on growing adjusted diluted EPS, which is calculated by eliminating  
the impact of the items highlighted on the previous page as well as amortisation of intangibles and incorporates the dilutive effect of share options. 
Adjusted diluted EPS is 9.5p (2016: 9.5p for the 52 week period).

The prior year to 2 July 2016 was a 53 week period. Like for like figures have been calculated using financial data by excluding the 53rd week. 
Cash Flow
There was an increase in our working capital 
requirement of £2.5 million (2016: £1.6 million) 
in the financial year, corporation tax payments 
made in the financial year totalled £2.7 million  
(2016: £1.6 million), the payments in the current  
and prior year took account of the research and 
development tax relief due to the Group and tax  
losses being utilised. Capital expenditure  
in the year amounted to £12.5 million  
(2016: £12.1 million).  
Debt and Bank Facilities
The Group’s total net debt is £17.5 million 
(2016: £19.7 million) down £2.2 million from 
the prior year. Within this total, £11.6 million 
is due within one year, including cash at bank 
and invoice finance (2016: £10.9 million).  
The Group’s debt facility is a bilateral facility 
with HSBC Bank Plc and Lloyds Bank Plc totalling 
£50.9m, the key features of the facility are  
as follows:
• Overdraft (£2.0m) 
• Term loan (£13.4m) 
• Confidential invoice discounting facility  
 (£22.0m) 
• Mortgage facility (£3.5m) 
• Rolling asset finance facility (£2.0m) 
• Revolving credit facility (£8.0m)
Note 18 gives details of the amounts drawn  
on these facilities and maturity dates.
The Group is able to offer strong asset backing  
to secure its borrowings. The Group owns freehold  
sites at Memory Lane in Cardiff, Fletchers’ site 
at Sheffield and Lightbody and Campbells in 
Scotland. In addition, the Group has a strong 
trade debtor book to support the invoice 
discounting facility, made up primarily of the 
UK’s major multiple retailers. This debtor book 
stood at £45.2 million (2016: £44.9 million)  
at the period end date.
The Group recognises the inherent risk from 
interest rate rises, to mitigate these risks the 
Group uses interest rate swaps. There was no 
interest rate swap coverage in place at the year 
end, (2016: coverage of £9.0 million, equivalent 
to 46% of total net bank debt). The Group has 
one forward dated interest rate swap for five 
years from 3 July 2017 with a coverage of £20 
million (2016: £9 million), the forward dated 
swap has a rate of 0.455% (2016: weighted 
average rate 1.8%). 
The effective interest rate for the Group at the  
year end, taking account of the interest rate swap  
in place with base rate at 0.25% and LIBOR at 
0.42%, was 2.15% (2016: 3.0%). A £3.0 million 
swap fixed at 1.65% expired on 22 May 2017 
and a £6.0 million swap fixed at 1.89% expired 
on 2 June 2017.
Financial Covenants
The Board reviews the Group’s cash flow 
forecasts and key covenants on a regular basis  
to ensure that it has adequate facilities to cover 
its trading and banking requirements with an 
appropriate level of headroom. The forecasts 
are based on management’s best estimates  
of future trading. There has been no breach 
of covenants during the year. 
Interest cover (based on adjusted earnings before  
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
– EBITDA) for the 52 weeks to 1 July 2017 was 
28.4 (2016: 23.4). Net bank debt to EBITDA 
(based on adjusted EBITDA) for the year to  
1 July 2017 was 0.7 (2016: 0.8). 
Taxation
The Group taxation charge for the year was  
£3.0 million (2016: £3.3 million). This represents 
an effective rate of 21.4% on profits before 
significant non-recurring items (2016: 20.4%).  
Further details on the tax charge can be found 
in Note 8 to the Group’s Financial Statements.
Non-Financial Key Performance 
Indicators 
A range of non-financial key performance 
indicators are monitored at site level covering, 
amongst others, customer service, quality and 
health and safety. The Group Board receives 
an overview of these on a regular basis. 19 Finsbury Food Group

Strategic Report
Environmental Matters
As part of the environmental activities, site 
wide LED replacement programs are ongoing 
along with continued focus on energy usage 
such as oven burner efficiencies and insulated 
traywash facilities. Trade effluent reduction 
initiatives are ongoing with investment in a new  
effluent treatment plant completed at one  
of our larger bakeries. 
Employee Social and Community Issues
With the successful roll out of the Groups vision  
and values the Group holds various family fun days  
as part of the employee engagement program. 
We have links with employment agencies and  
continue to participate in employability work  
placements that help provide work placements  
for individuals who find it difficult to get back 
to full time employment. Various charities are  
supported and in some instances the site’s  
employee forum decides on the local charity.  
In an attempt to promote health and wellbeing  
fitness and running clubs have been established  
at a local basis.  
Technical Matters
All sites hold grade A, or the highest AA rating  
under the British Retail Consortium version 7  
standard. As a Group, all technical functions have  
come together to establish a Group Technical 
Strategy which is a dynamic three year plan 
covering all aspects of people, food safety, legal  
compliance and the establishment of a quality 
culture underpinned by consistent process 
control. Major investment has also taken place  
in the form of upgrading team member facilities  
to a best in standard and we have continued  
to invest in a strong visual good manufacturing 
programme on site.
Health continues to be a major focus for the 
business. Dedicated resource continues to work  
on sugar and salt reduction targets as part of the  
Government Obesity Strategy and Public Health  
England recommendations. In conjunction with  
a major brand owner the Group were first to 
market providing a range of licensed products 
which were 18 months in development and 
which exceed these requirements.   
The Strategic Report was approved by the 
Board of Directors on 15 September 2017  
and was signed on its behalf by:

Corporate Governance
Report on Corporate Governance 21 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Peter Baker 
Non-Executive Chairman
Peter joined the Board on 1 July 2014 and  
is Chairman of the Nominations Committee. 
Peter has over 30 years’ senior CEO and Board 
level experience within the global bakery and  
consumer packaged goods industry. He also  
chairs another Board and is a Non-Executive 
Director in one other business. Peter held the  
position of Managing Director of Maple Leaf  
Bakery from 2009 to 2013, moving into this  
position after the sale of La Fornaia Bakeries,  
where he was the CEO. Prior to these roles,  
Peter held COO and Divisional Managing 
Director positions at RHM in the Consumer 
Brands, British Bakeries and Cereals Divisions  
(including Rank Hovis Mills). Peter was 
previously a Non-Executive Director at Jordan’s 
Cereals, now a part of Associated British Foods. 
He has also served as Vice President of CIAA  
(a European trade association for food and  
drink) and was on the Executive Board of FDF  
the UK Food and Drink Federation.  
John Duffy 
Chief Executive Officer
John was appointed CEO of Finsbury Food Group  
with effect from 30th September 2009, following  
a year as interim COO, and has led the turnaround  
of an indebted Group with a market capitalisation  
of only £6m in 2009 to the restructured and fast  
growing £150m+ market cap growth business  
of today. This transformation required significant 
operational improvements and new leadership  
throughout the Group as well as both a business  
disposal and several acquisitions. The acquisition 
of Fletchers Bakery Group for £56m in 2014 
delivered a step change in scale to £300m+ 
sales and diversification into the faster  
growing ‘out of home eating’ channel.
Following an engineering degree, John’s early 
career was in the oil industry in exploration and 
production with Shell International. John then 
completed a full-time MBA at the University  
of Strathclyde Business School before enjoying 
10 years at Director-level in manufacturing 
and logistics roles at Mars, the global FMCG 
business. This was followed by private equity 
experience within the portfolio investments  
of both L&G Ventures and Bridgepoint e.g. 
as Operations Director at crisps and snacks 
manufacturer Golden Wonder and Managing 
Director of WT Foods’ largest chilled foods 
subsidiary, Noon Products, before and after  
its sale to Kerry Foods.
John has Non-Executive experience in both 
start-up and established businesses including 
Denby the household pottery manufacturer.
Marnie Millard

Financial Instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise mortgage, asset finance facilities, a confidential invoicing facility, revolving credit facility, cash and liquid  
resources, and various items arising directly from its operations, such as trade creditors. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance 
the Group’s acquisitions and operations. It is the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies  
for managing these risks, which have remained substantially unchanged for the year under review. The policies are summarised below:
Interest Rate Risk 
The Group finances its operations by retained profits and bank borrowings. A suite of borrowing facilities totalling £50.9 million is available of which 
£17.5 million was drawn at the balance sheet date leaving a headroom of £33.4 million. The interest rate risk is managed through interest rate swap 
transactions. The Group entered into a forward dated swap for £20.0 million for five years from 3 July 2017 (fixed) at 0.455%. The total balance  
of swaps at 1 July 2017 is nil (2016: £9.0 million). The counterparty to these transactions is HSBC Bank Plc.
Liquidity Risk
Short-term flexibility is available through existing bank facilities and the netting off of surplus funds. Full details of the Group’s financial assets 
and liabilities are given in Note 21.
Foreign Exchange Risk
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Full details are given in Note 21.
Diversity 
Finsbury Food Group is committed to encouraging diversity, promoting a diverse culture where everyone is treated with respect and valued for 
their individual contribution and creating a work environment free of bullying, harassment, victimisation and unlawful discrimination. We have  
a Diversity Policy in place to ensure that selection for employment, promotion, development or any other benefit is on the basis of merit and ability 
and does not impact negatively upon diversity. It is a key objective to ensure that all employees are helped and encouraged to fulfil their potential.
Equal Opportunities 
It is our policy to ensure equal opportunity in recruitment, selection, promotion, employee development, training and reward policies and we have 
an equal opportunities and diversity policy in place. It is a key objective to ensure that successful candidates for appointment and promotion are 
selected taking account of individual ability, skills and competencies without regard to age, gender, race, religion, disability or sexual orientation.
Involvement of Employees 
Employees are key to the Company’s success and we rely on a committed workforce to help us achieve our business objectives. Employees are 
encouraged to operate in an open environment, embracing teamwork and aligning personal development with the strategy of the business and their 
behaviours with Company Values. We are keen to engage our employees by providing an environment where they can contribute their own ideas 
and challenge those of others. We are committed to involving employees and consider that good communication helps to achieve this. All sites have 
regular briefings, employee forums and communication mechanisms which are designed to keep colleagues informed of, amongst other things, 
the financial and economic factors that affect the Company’s performance. Many sites also hold open days to allow employees’ families to see  
the environment in which their family members work.
Political and Charitable Contributions
During the year charitable donations amounting to £75,000 (2016: £13,000) were made. No political donations were made.
Going Concern
On the basis of current financial projections and available funds and facilities, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operation for the foreseeable future and, therefore, consider it appropriate to prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern 
basis. Further details are set out in the basis of preparation.
Auditor
In accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG LLP as auditor is to be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.
• So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
•  Each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors’ Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 15 September 2017 and was signed on its behalf by:
Stephen Boyd 
Director 25 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Role and Responsibilities of the Audit Committee 
The principal responsibilities of the Committee are to:
•  Review and monitor the integrity of the Financial Statements of the Group and assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities relating to external 
financial reporting and similar announcements.
•  Review significant issues and the judgements of management and the methodology and assumptions used in relation to the Financial Statements.
• Review and monitor the Group’s financial control systems and risk management procedures.
• Recommend the appointment and/or reappointment of the external auditor and approve their terms of engagement.
• Review and monitor the independence of the external auditor and the effectiveness of the audit process.
• Implement and review policy on external auditor non-audit services.
• Review and monitor the Group’s compliance with all regulatory legislation and current practice.
• Report to the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities.
The full terms of reference, which can be found on the Company’s website at www.finsburyfoods.co.uk, are reviewed periodically by the Board. 
Membership
The Committee is chaired by me, and, the other member is Zoe Morgan, a Non-Executive Director. 
The Audit Committee met three times during the year. The Finance Director is invited to attend Committee meetings together with other senior  
members of the finance team including those members of staff that conduct internal audits. The external auditor attends those meetings involving 
the Financial Statements, the annual audit and other significant matters. Time is set aside during at least one meeting each year for the Committee 
to hold discussions in private with the external auditor in the absence of management and Executive Directors. 
External Auditor
The Committee carried out an assessment of the effectiveness of the external audit process which focused on criteria that the Committee considered 
to be important factors in an effective audit process. These factors included the quality of audit staff, the planning and execution of the audit and the 
role of management in the audit process. Following this assessment, the Committee concluded that the external audit process remained effective 
and that it provides an appropriate independent challenge.
The engagement of the auditor to carry out non-audit services is approved in advance by me or, in the case of a significant instruction, by the 
Committee. This enables the Committee to satisfy itself of the auditor’s independence and objectivity. 
Internal Controls and Risk Management
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls. The system of internal control is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Group management prepare an Annual Report for the Committee’s consideration that identifies the risks and uncertainties to which the Group  
is exposed, the procedures in place to mitigate those risks and uncertainties and the potential impact on the Group. The Committee reviews this  
Report and any concerns that it has over the adequacy of the controls in place, or the level of risk accepted by the Group, are reported to the Board. 
The principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed are considered by the Board and are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 
14 to 15. Following this review, the Committee, is satisfied that the Group has in place effective internal control systems and risk management. 
The Committee continues to keep under review the need for a separate dedicated internal audit function in the Group. The Committee remains 
satisfied that the Group’s system of internal control is appropriate for a Group of the size and nature of the Company and the Committee’s current 
view is that a separate formal independent internal audit function is not required at this time. The Committee will monitor the situation closely  
as the Group continues to expand.
A programme of rolling internal control and risk reviews is monitored by the Committee which considers reports on these reviews at each meeting 
and monitors any follow up action that is required.

External Reporting
The Board delegates primary responsibility for the preparation of complete, balanced and accurate Financial Statements and disclosures, in accordance 
with Financial Reporting Standards and regulations, to the Finance Director. The responsibility of the Committee includes consideration of significant 
accounting policies, any changes in policies and significant estimates and judgements, taking into account the external auditor’s view, and to report 
back to the Board on any concerns that it might have. The Audit Committee reviews the clarity and completeness of disclosures within the Financial 
Statements. Ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the annual Financial Statements and half yearly reports remains with the Board.
The Committee also reviews related information presented with the Financial Statements, in particular the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report 
and the Report on Corporate Governance.

• Revenue recognition
• New business system introduction and compliance

Directors’ Remuneration Report  
(unaudited)
Statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 1 July 2017.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the Directors’ Remuneration Policy remains appropriate and will continue to apply it in 2017-18. 
Accordingly, we have not included the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in this Report, however, a copy is available in our investor section of the 
website at www.finsburyfoods.co.uk/investor-relations/annual-reports. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details of the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 1 July 2017 and how the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy will be operated for the year commencing 2 July 2017.
Similar to last year and as a matter of best practice, the Annual Report on Remuneration has been prepared taking into account the remuneration 
reporting regulations applicable to fully listed companies in the UK. 
Review of the 2016-17 Financial Year
As described earlier in the Annual Report the Company has delivered a solid performance, with continued organic growth in 2016-17. Alongside 
this growth, our capital investment strategy, together with our continued efficiency programme has resulted in improved operating margins. 
The 2016- 17 annual bonus was subject to an EBITDA performance metric. The Company achieved £24.9 million EBITDA for 2016- 17 which was above  
our forecast for the year. Consequently, this resulted in 87% of salary being earned as an annual bonus. In line with the Committee’s commitment 
to align Executives’ interests with those of shareholders, 50% of total bonuses earned in the year will be paid as cash and 50% in the form of shares,  
in order to develop further the shareholdings of the Executive Directors. Further details are set out on page 29. The current personal shareholdings 
of J G Duffy and S A Boyd equate to circa 7.5 and 4.6 times salary respectively.
A new long-term incentive plan was introduced in 2015 following discussions with shareholders. It was designed to motivate the senior management 
team over the longer term to deliver the Group’s strategy and to reward appropriately, reflecting the contribution to shareholder value creation. 
The first awards granted under the Company’s LTIP were made in 2015 and these vested in respect of performance in the three financial years 
to 1 July 2017. The awards vested at 97.45% of the maximum due to strong share price and EPS performance over the period. For continued 
alignment with shareholders, the vested awards are subject to a further two year holding period. Full details of the vested awards are provided 
on page 30. 
Awards under the LTIP were made during the year in line with the Remuneration Policy and will vest based on relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)  
performance and absolute EPS targets over the three year period to 2019. These awards are subject to a two year post vesting holding period.
The Committee remains committed to a responsible approach to executive pay and believes that salary increases above wider workforce increases 
will only be awarded in limited circumstances. S A Boyd and J G Duffy were both awarded a 1.8% salary increase which was in line with increases 
for the wider workforce.
Outlook for the 2017-18 Financial Year
Details in relation to the application of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2017-18 are set out on page 28.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report 
(unaudited)
The full Policy can be viewed in the investor section of the website at www.finsburyfoods.co.uk/investor-relations/annual-reports.
The main aim of the Company’s Policy is to align the interests of Executive Directors with the Company’s strategic vision and the long-term creation 
of shareholder value. The Company aims to provide returns to shareholders through both organic and acquisitive growth. The Policy is intended 
to remunerate our Executive Directors competitively and appropriately for effective delivery of this and allows them to share in this success and 
the value delivered to shareholders. The Policy is based on a broad set of remuneration principles:
•  Promote shareholder value creation
•  Support the business strategy
•  Promote sound risk management 
•  Ensure that the interests of the Directors are aligned with the long-term interests of shareholders
•  Deliver a competitive level of pay for the Directors without paying more than is necessary to recruit and retain individuals
•  Ensure that the Executive Directors are rewarded for their contribution to the success of the Group and share in the success delivered  
to shareholders and
•  Motivate the Directors to deliver enhanced sustainable performance. 29 Finsbury Food Group

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect  
of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company Financial Statements for each financial year. As required by the AIM 
Rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU) and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company Financial Statements in accordance with UK accounting standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), 
including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company 
Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent; 
• For the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
•  For the Parent Company Financial Statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements; 
• Assess the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and 
•  Use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its Financial 
Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report and a Directors’ Report that complies 
with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

15 September 2017 34 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Independent Auditor’s Report to the 
Members of Finsbury Food Group Plc
1. Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the Financial Statements of Finsbury Food Group Plc (“the Company”) for the 52 week period ended 01 July 2017 which comprise 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, Company Balance Sheet, Company Statement of Changes in Equity, and the 
related Notes, including the accounting policies in Notes 1 and 30.  
In our opinion: 
•  The Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 01 July 2017 and  
of the Group’s profit for the 52 week period then ended;  
•  The Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted  
by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);  
•  The Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework; and 
•  The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Basis for Opinion  
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities are  
described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and are independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements  
including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate 
basis for our opinion. 
2. Key Audit Matters: Our Assessment of Risks of Material Misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements and include  
the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest 
effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were  
addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. In arriving at our audit opinion above, the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows 
(unchanged from 2016):
The risk Our response
Revenue
(£314.3m;  
2016: £319.7m)
Refer to page 25 
(Audit Committee 
Report), page  
45 (accounting  
policy) and page  
47 ( financial 
disclosures).
Accounting application:
Revenue is significant to the Group due to its  
size and the presumed fraud risk that the entity  
may overstate revenue to meet targets and 
budgets. This fraud risk may occur through 
recognition of revenue in advance of the 
correct date or through the exercise of bias  
in the recognition of over-riders and rebates 
provided to customers or promotional 
expenditure.
Our procedures included:  
•  Control reperformance: We tested the design, implementation and 
operating effectiveness of manual controls including those controls in place 
over the matching of sales invoices to sales orders and delivery notes.
•  Test of detail: For key customers at a number of the sites we reconciled 
revenue recognised through the year to cash receipts.
•  Test of detail: For smaller customers and other sites we agreed a sample  
of sales transactions to invoice and cash received. 
•  Test of detail: We agreed a sample of revenue recorded around the year end 
to proof of delivery. For a sample of post-year end credit notes we assessed 
whether these indicated a reversal of in-year revenue. For a sample of debit  
notes and bank payments we evaluated whether these represented 
unrecognised deductions against in year revenue. 
•  Expectation vs outcome: An expectation was developed for sales rebate 
expenses and accruals based on sales volumes and rebate contracted rates 
or promotional terms and this was compared to actual sales rebate expenses 
recognised. We challenged management’s explanation of any significant 
differences arising.
Investments
(£100.7m;  
2016: £100.7m)
Refer to page 25 
(Audit Committee 
Report), page  
44 (accounting  
policy) and page  
58 ( financial 
disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation  
(Parent Company key audit matter):
The Parent Company holds significant 
investments in subsidiaries and whilst the 
valuation of these is not a significant risk  
it is an area of audit focus within the Parent  
as there is a risk that the value of the 
subsidiaries is less than the investment value. 
Our procedures included:  
•  Tests of detail: We compared the carrying amount of the investments with 
the net assets value of the respective subsidiary, being an approximation of 
their minimum recoverable amount, to identify whether the net asset values 
were in excess of the carrying amounts.
•  Our sector experience: Where the investment value was not supported 
by the net assets of the subsidiary we obtained the forecasts used by the 
Directors’ in their assessment of the recoverability of their investments. 
We challenged the forecasts by agreeing the brought forward position to 
actual results and, based on our understanding of the Company and sector, 
assessed whether expected future conditions had been incorporated. 
•  Benchmarking assumptions: We challenged the discount rate used  
in the forecasts by benchmarking this against similar companies. 35 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
3. Our Application of Materiality and an Overview of the Scope of our Audit 
Materiality for the Group Financial Statements as a whole was set at £875,000 (2016: £950,000), determined with reference to a benchmark of Group  
profit before interest and tax of £17.6m, of which it represents 5% (2016: Group profit before tax normalised to exclude certain one-off costs 
including the write-off of goodwill of £4.3m and payments for settlement of share options of £2.8m, of which it represents 4.8%). 
Materiality for the Parent Company Financial Statements as a whole was set at £656,000 (2016: £712,000), determined with reference to a benchmark 
of company total assets, of which it represents 0.5% (2016: 0.6%).
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £43,750 (2016: £47,000), in addition 
to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 8 (2016: 8) reporting components, which include the Parent Company, we subjected 7 (2016: 7) to audits for Group reporting purposes.
We conducted specified procedures over financial information (including enquiry) at a further one non financially significant component. The component  
for which we performed work other than audits for Group reporting purposes was not individually significant but was included in the scope of our 
Group reporting work in order to provide further coverage over the Group’s results.
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group’s results.
The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed on the previous page 
and the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the component materialities, which ranged from £20,000 to £450,000 (2016: 
£20,000 to £712,000), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The work on 4 of the 8 components 
(2016: 4 of the 8 components) was performed by component auditors and the rest by the Group audit team.  
The Group audit team visited 7 (2016: 7) component locations in the UK. At these visits, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed  
in more detail, and any further work required by the Group team was then performed by the component auditor.

4. We have nothing to Report on going Concern  
We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is inappropriate or there is an undisclosed 
material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over the use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval  
of the Financial Statements. We have nothing to report in these respects.
5. We have nothing to Report on the other Information in the Annual Report
The Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the Financial Statements. Our opinion on the  
Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our Financial Statements audit work, the information 
therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified 
material misstatements in the other information. 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
Based solely on our work on the other information:
•  We have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report;  
•  In our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the Financial Statements; and  
•  In our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
6. We have nothing to Report on the other Matters on which we are required to Report by Exception  
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
•  Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received  
from branches not visited by us; or  
•  The Parent Company Financial Statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or  
•  Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
•  We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
 We have nothing to report in these respects.  
7 . Respective Responsibilities
Directors’ Responsibilities   
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 33, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the Financial Statements including  
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend  
to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud  
or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of the Financial Statements.  
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.    
8. The Purpose of our Audit Work and to whom we owe our Responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). The Company is a public company which 
is incorporated, domiciled and registered in the UK.
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). The Financial Statements for the Company have been prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards 
and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework  
(“FRS 101”), these are presented on pages 72 to 81.
It should be noted that current liabilities exceed current assets. Having reviewed the Group’s short and medium term plans and available financial 
facilities, the Board has reasonable expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the next 12 
months and the foreseeable future. 
The Group meets its funding requirements through internal cash generation and bank credit facilities, which are committed until October 2019.  
Committed banking facilities are £50.9m, of which £17.5m were drawn at the year end. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of  
reasonably possible changes in trading performance, including the possible effect of the UK’s decision to withdraw from the EU, show that the Group 
will be able to operate comfortably within its current bank facilities. The Group has a relatively conservative level of debt to earnings. As a result, 
the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook. 
The Board reviews the Group’s covenants on a regular basis to ensure that it has adequate facilities to cover its trading and banking requirements 
with an appropriate level of headroom. The forecasts are based on management’s best estimates of future trading. There has been no breach  
of covenants during the year and none expected during the next 12 months. All covenant tests were passed at the year end.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the Financial 
Statements. Accordingly, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements for both the Group and the 
Parent Company. The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative 
financial instruments and pension scheme assets.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The Group is required to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. These estimates and judgements are based on historical experience  
and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting 
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. Accounting estimates and judgements have been required for the production 
of these Financial Statements. The following are those that are deemed to require the most complex judgements about matters that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements.
•  The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets is significant. The determination of the estimated recoverable amount is subjective due to 
the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows. Impairment reviews in respect of intangibles are performed 
where there is indication of impairment. Impairment of goodwill is carried out annually and can significantly impact the Group’s Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss for the year. The Group estimates the recoverable amounts based on historical experience of margin, volumes and 
cost structure and expectations of future events. The discount rate takes account of the current market conditions and is applied as a pre-tax 
discount factor to obtain a current value. Refer to Note 10 for further details.
•  The Group has one defined benefit pension scheme. The net deficit or surplus is the difference between the plan assets and plan liabilities at the  
period end date. The valuation of the assets and liabilities is based on a number of judgements. The assets are based on market value at the period  
end date, the liabilities are based on actuarial assumptions such as discount, inflation and mortality rates. The assumptions applied are based 
on advice provided by the scheme’s actuary in accordance with IAS 19 (Revised), further detail can be found in Note 13. 
•  A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised. The deferred tax asset recognised for losses relate to acquired businesses. Based on current and forecast levels of 
profitability, the losses are expected to be utilised within 3 years.
•  The Grain D’Or business unit has been historically loss making and despite the implementation of a range of initiatives to improve the business 
including strict cost control and new working practices the site remained loss making in the year to 1 July 2017. The Company now proposes to 
close the site. A formal consultation with representatives of the workforce commenced on 1 September 2017. The consultation is expected to 
conclude mid October 2017. Until this consultation period concludes uncertainty remains over the use of the assets. In light of this a decision 
has been taken to impair the assets used in the business by £4.0 million in the year to 1 July 2017. A degree of judgement has been exercised in 
calculating the level of impairment based on information available at the time of preparing these Financial Statements.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(forming part of the Financial Statements) 43 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated Financial Statements,  
except as explained in the basis of preparation, which addresses any changes in accounting policies resulting from new or revised standards.
Basis of Consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, the Group takes into  
consideration the potential voting rights. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The Financial Statements  
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
The accounting policies of new subsidiaries are changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. Intra-group balances 
and transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated Financial Statements.
Lightbody Stretz Limited which is 50% owned by the Group has been consolidated into the Group accounts as a subsidiary with a corresponding 
non-controlling interest on the basis that the Group has the controlling interest. Control arises by virtue of the fact that Lightbody Group Limited, 
a wholly owned subsidiary of Finsbury Food Group, has a majority of voting rights arising from an agreement between Lightbody Group Limited 
and Philippe Stretz, the owner of the remaining 50%.
Business Combinations
The acquisition method of accounting is used in accounting for the acquisition of businesses. In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, 
the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are measured at fair value. When the initial accounting for a business combination is determined 
provisionally, any adjustments to the provisional values allocated are made within twelve months of the acquisition date and are effected from 
the date of acquisition.
Foreign Currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the period end date are retranslated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. 
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which 
they were initially recorded are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to Sterling, 
at foreign exchange rates ruling at the period end date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the 
year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Group has derivative financial instruments in respect of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange hedges. The Group does not hold derivative 
financial instruments for trading purposes. The existing interest rate swaps and foreign exchange hedges used by the Group while they function 
as hedges, do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting set out by IAS 39, and have thus been treated as financial assets and liabilities which are 
carried at their fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Fair value is deemed to be market value, which is provided by the 
counterparty at the year end date. 
Changes in the market value of interest rate swaps have been recognised through the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as finance income 
or cost. Changes in the market value of foreign exchange hedges have been recognised through the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss within 
administrative costs.
Non-derivative Financial Instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, 
loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Unless otherwise indicated, the carrying amounts of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
Trade and other Receivables 
The value of trade and other receivables is the amount that would be received if the receivable was paid on the period end date which is a close 
approximation to amortised cost.
Trade and other Payables
The value of trade and other payables is the value that would be payable to settle the liability at the period end date.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and which form an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Interest-bearing Borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 44 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
Property, Plant and Equipment
Recognition and Measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost or fair value at the date of acquisition, less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
provisions. Costs include expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost  
of materials and direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs 
of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality  
of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of the property, plant and equipment by equal instalments over their 
estimated useful economic lives to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have 
different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. The depreciation rates used 
are as follows:
Freehold buildings 2%-20% Plant and equipment 10%-33%
Leasehold property Up to the remaining life of the lease Assets under construction Nil
Fixtures and fittings 10%-33% Motor vehicles 25%-33%
Impairment reviews of fixed assets are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Leased Assets
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial 
recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Assets acquired by finance lease and hire purchase are depreciated over the lease term or their useful lives.
Obligations under finance leases are included in liabilities net of the finance charge allocated to future periods. The finance element of the rental 
payment is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as finance expense so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the 
net obligations outstanding in each period.
Other leases are operating leases and the leased assets are not recognised on the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Operating Lease Payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the term  
of the lease.
Finance Lease Payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated 
to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Equity Accounted Investees 
Equity Accounted Investees (Associates) are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating 
policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 percent of the voting power of another entity. 
Application of the Equity Method to Associates and Joint Ventures
Equity Accounted Investees are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s 
investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated Financial Statements include 
the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence 
commences until the date that significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, 
the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred 
legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee. 
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested 
annually for impairment. Intangible assets are capitalised separately from goodwill as part of a business combination, only if the fair value can be 
measured reliably on initial recognition and if the future economic benefits are expected to flow to the Group. All intangible assets recognised are  
considered to have finite lives and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives that range from 15 to 20 years. 
Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration for the business exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Where the excess is negative 
(negative goodwill), the amount is taken to retained earnings. Goodwill is capitalised and subject to impairment reviews both annually and where 
there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 45 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed at each period end date to determine whether there is an indication 
of impairment. Intangible assets and goodwill are considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative 
effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each period end date.
An impairment loss would be recognised whenever the carrying amount of an intangible asset, goodwill or its cash generating unit exceeds  
its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Calculation of Recoverable Amount 
The recoverable amount is the greater of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing an assets’ value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value  
of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Inventories 
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the first-in first-out basis, and includes all direct costs 
incurred and attributable production overheads. Net realisable value is based upon estimated selling price allowing for all further costs of completion 
and disposal. Specific provisions are made against old and obsolete stock taking the value to zero or an estimated reduced value based on the most 
likely route for disposal of each particular item of stock.
Employee Benefits 
Defined Benefit Plans
Memory Lane Cakes Ltd operates a defined benefit pension scheme and the pension costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and  
Loss and Other Comprehensive Income in accordance with IAS 19 (revised), with current and past service cost being recognised as an administrative 
expense, interest on assets and liabilities is shown as finance income or a finance cost in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.  
The remeasurements are recognised in full in Other Comprehensive Income.
Defined Contribution Plans
The costs of contributing to defined contribution and personal pension schemes are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss  
as an administrative expense in the period to which they relate.
Share Based Payment Transactions
The value, as at the grant date, of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, 
over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using  
an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
Revenue
Revenue represents the amounts derived from the sale of bakery products. Revenue is the invoiced value of consideration received or receivable 
excluding value added tax, trade discounts, transactions with or between subsidiaries and less the cost of price promotions and sales related 
rebates known as over-riders. Revenue is recognised upon despatch of goods. The nature and timing of promotions and overriders is typically 
known, accruals are established at the time of sale based on information available and management’s expectations of the amounts necessary  
to meet the claims of customers. 
Segmental Reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including 
revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. All segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly 
by the Group’s Board of Directors. The Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker is considered to be the Board.
Licence Fees
Payments made for licence fee charges are recognised under cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period to which 
they relate. Any charges relating to future years are deferred and recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss under cost of sales 
over the life of the contract.
Finance Income and Cost
Finance costs comprise loan interest payable, interest payable and finance charges on finance leases recognised using the effective interest method, 
unwinding of the discount on provisions and deferred consideration, interest on the net defined benefit pension plan position and adverse changes  
in the fair value of interest rate swaps.
Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and favourable changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps. Interest income  
is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 46 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the period end date, 
and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and  
the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: 
• The initial recognition of goodwill;
• The initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and
• The differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the period end date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Research and Development Expenditure
The expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding,  
is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. 
2. Revenue and Segment Information 
Operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reporting and decision making. The Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker is considered 
to be the Board as it is primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance by segment. 
The Board uses adjusted operating profit, reviewed on a regular basis, as the key measure of the segments’ performance. Operating profit in this instance  
is defined as profit before the following:
• Net financing expense
• Significant non-recurring items
• Pension charges or credits in relation to the net pension position
• Revaluation of interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts
The UK bakery segment manufactures and sells bakery products to the UK’s multiple grocers and foodservice sectors. This segment primarily comprises  
the operations of Memory Lane Cakes Ltd, Lightbody Group Ltd, Campbells Cake Company Ltd, Johnstone’s Food Service Ltd, Fletchers Bakeries Ltd  
and Nicholas & Harris Ltd. These subsidiaries are aggregated into a single segment as they share similar economic characteristics. The characteristics 
considered are:
• The nature of the products – products are similar in nature and are classed as manufactured bakery products
• The production process – the production processes have the same or similar characteristics
• The economic characteristics – the average gross margins are expected to be similar
Costs of Group operations plus a 10% premium have been allocated across the segments on the basis of their operating profit. The premium has 
been charged to reflect the synergies achieved from obtaining resources centrally giving benefits across the operating segments.
A purchasing premium of 2% is charged from Group operations, and is calculated on materials and packaging spend at segmental level. This charge 
is based on the rationale that Group operations, through its Group buyers, optimises the Group’s procurement spend through leveraging its 
purchasing power. 
This has resulted in a loss from continuing operations of £0.2m (2016: £0.3m loss) being presented within the Group Operations segment.
The Group’s finance income and expenses cannot be meaningfully allocated to the individual operating segments. 47 Finsbury Food Group

4. Significant Non-recurring Items
The Group presents certain items as significant and non-recurring. These relate to items which, in management’s judgement, need to be disclosed 
by virtue of their size or incidence in order to obtain a more meaningful understanding of the financial information. 
The Grain D’Or business has been historically loss making and despite the implementation of a range of initiatives to improve the business including  
strict cost control and new working practices the site remained loss making in the year to 1 July 2017. The Company now proposes to close the site.  
A formal consultation with representatives of the workforce commenced on 1 September 2017 . The consultation is expected to conclude mid October 
2017. Until this consultation period concludes uncertainty remains over the use of the assets. In light of this, a decision has been taken to impair the 
assets used in the business by £4.0 million in the year to 1 July 2017.
A charge of £4.3 million in the previous year relates to impairment of goodwill acquired in 2007. This is included in administrative expenses in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. 51 Finsbury Food Group

8. Taxation (continued) 
The UK corporation tax rate reductions from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.  
An additional reduction to 17% from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. The deferred tax assets and liabilities at 1 July 2017 
have been calculated based on these rates. 
The adjustment of £90,000 for prior year includes, ineligible capital spends offset partially by additional tax relief on qualifying R&D expenditure 
for prior periods.
The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £162,605 (2016: £172,170) relating to capital losses carried forward. This asset has not been 
recognised in the Financial Statements as it is not expected that suitable gains will arise in the future in order to utilise the underlying capital losses. 
9. Earnings Per Ordinary Share
Basic earnings per share for the period is calculated on the basis of profit for the year after tax, divided by the weighted average number of shares 
in issue being 126,979,000 (2016: 126,938,000).  
Basic diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to assume conversion of all 
potential dilutive ordinary shares. At 1 July 2017, the diluted weighted average number of shares in issue was 130,992,000 (2016: 129,206,000). 
An adjusted earnings per share and an adjusted diluted earnings per share have also been calculated for a 52 week period as in the opinion of the 
Board this will allow shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the trading performance of the Group and year on year comparisons. These 
adjusted earnings per share exclude:
• Reorganisation and other significant non-recurring items 
•  IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ fair value adjustment relating to the Group’s interest rate swaps and foreign 
exchange contracts
• IAS 19 (revised) ‘Accounting for retirement benefits’ relating to net income
• The taxation effect at the appropriate rate on adjustments
• Amortisation of intangible assets

The brand and customer relationships recognised were purchased as part of the acquisition of Fletchers Group of Bakeries in October 2014. They are  
considered to have finite useful lives and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of twenty years for brands and fifteen  
years for customer relationships. The intangibles were valued using an income approach, using Multi-Period excess earnings Method for customer 
relationships and Relief from Royalty Method for brand valuation. The amortisation of intangibles has been charged to administrative expenses  
in the Income Statement. There is no amortisation on business systems during the year as the systems are yet to be brought into use.
Goodwill has arisen on acquisitions and reflects the future economic benefits arising from assets that are not capable of being identified individually 
and recognised as separate assets. The goodwill reflects the anticipated profitability and synergistic benefits arising from the enlarged Group 
structure. The goodwill is the balance of the total consideration less fair value of assets acquired and identified. The carrying value of the goodwill 
is reviewed annually for impairment. The carrying value of all goodwill has been assessed during the year. A non-cash impairment of goodwill 
arising from an acquisition in 2007 was made during the previous year.  
The Group tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are the discount rate used for future cash flows and the anticipated future changes in revenue, direct costs and indirect costs.  
The assumptions used reflect the past experience of management and future expectations.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts covering a five year period based on the detailed financial forecasts approved by management for the next 
three years with estimated growth and inflation of 3% (2016: 3%) and 3% (2016: 3%) respectively thereafter. The cashflows beyond this forecast 
are extrapolated to perpetuity using a nil growth rate on a prudent basis, to reflect the uncertainties of forecasting further than five years. 
Changes in revenue and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.  
The revenue growth rate combines volume, mix and price of products. An inflation factor has been applied to costs of sales, variable costs and 
indirect costs and takes into consideration the general rate of inflation, movements in commodities, improvement in efficiencies from capital 
investment and operations and purchasing initiatives.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10% (2016: 10%) has been used in these calculations. The Group has considered the economic environment and higher 
level of return expected by equity holders due to the perceived risk in equity markets when selecting the discount rate. The discount rate used for 
each cash generating unit has been kept constant as the market risk is deemed not to be materially different between the different segments  
of the bakery sector, nor over time. 56 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
10. Intangibles (continued) 
A non-cash impairment of the goodwill arising from the acquisition of Anthony Alan Foods Ltd in 2007 was made during the previous year. 
The impairment reflects the challenging market and changing dynamics of the ‘healthier’ grocery market. The related goodwill has been fully 
impaired and reflected in both the Lightbody of Hamilton and Memory Lane Cakes cash generating units accordingly. The impairment is shown  
as a significant non-recurring item within administrative expenses.
Sensitivity analyses have been carried out by the Directors on the carrying value of all remaining goodwill using discount rates ranging between 
3.5% and 15.0% which would not result in an impairment of any cash generating units. Management believe any increase in discount rates above 
15% to be remote. 
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units or groups of cash generating units as follows:

Investment in Associates
During the year the Group purchased 6.12% of the ordinary share capital of Dr Zak’s Ltd for a consideration of £80,000, taking the Group’s investment 
to 31.12%. The cost of investment is deemed to be the fair value. The Group’s share of profit or loss of equity accounted Associates after tax is presented 
in a single line in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. This is a loss of £22,000 for the current year (2016: £14,000 loss).
Interest Rate Swaps at Fair Value
The Group has a forward dated interest rate swap arrangement to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations:
£20.0 million for five years from 3 July 2017 (fixed) at 0.455%
Two swaps matured during the year:
£3.0 million for four years from 22 May 2013 (fixed) at 1.7% matured 22 May 2017
£6.0 million for three years from 2 June 2014 (fixed) at 1.9% matured 2 June 2017
There was no coverage in place at the year end, (2016: coverage of £9.0 million, equivalent to 46% of total net bank debt at a weighted average 
rate of 1.8%).
A credit of £555,000 (2016: credit £219,000) is shown in finance income for the periods reflecting changes in the fair values of interest rate swaps. 
Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts at Fair Value
The Group has entered into a number of forward foreign exchange contracts to minimise the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. A charge  
of £71,000 (2016: charge £134,000) is shown in administrative expenses for the periods reflecting changes in their fair value.  59 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
13. Pension Schemes
A number of companies within the Group operate defined contribution pension schemes with one company also operating a defined benefit scheme.
Defined Contribution Scheme
The Group made contributions in respect of its defined contribution pension arrangements of £1,257,000 (2016: £1,187,000).  
Defined Benefit Scheme
The Group’s defined benefit scheme is the Memory Lane Cakes Pension Scheme, which is a separately administered plan. At the financial year end,  
the scheme had no active members accruing benefits (2016: nil), 196 deferred pensioner members (2016: 206) and 217 pensioner members (2016: 215).
The scheme was closed to future accrual on 31 May 2010. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company. The amounts 
in the Financial Statements for the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017 relating to defined benefit pension are based on a full actuarial valuation dated  
31 December 2015, which was updated at the end of the scheme’s financial year 2016.
A £200,000 contribution was paid during the financial year by Memory Lane Cakes Limited (2016: £117,000). The Group’s contribution has been 
agreed based on the outcome of the full actuarial valuation dated 31 December 2015. The valuation of the scheme on an equity/bond basis and 
projected unit method, showed that there was a deficit at 31 December 2015 of £2,505,000 equivalent to an 11% deficit of liabilities over assets. 
The valuation was conducted by a qualified independent actuary. This deficit is payable at a rate of £200,000 per annum until September 2020, 
and £100,000 thereafter until September 2023. The next full valuation is due by 31 December 2018, which will challenge the appropriateness  
of this recovery plan taking into consideration the deficit recovery contributions and actual returns realised on the pension scheme assets. 
The present value of the Company’s committed deficit reduction contributions does not give rise to a net pension asset or additional balance sheet 
liability in accordance with IFRIC 14.
Approximately 90% of the assets are held in two diversified growth funds which target 6 month LIBOR +5% and CPI +5% respectively. The scheme’s 
assets are expected to provide real returns over the long-term. The expected return on cash balances held is based on the current Bank of England 
base rate rather than long-term deposit rates as cash is held to cover short-term requirements. 
The full actuarial valuation differs from the financial year end valuation deficit of £10,498,000 (2016: £6,463,000). No allowance is made in the 
financial year end valuation for any outperformance expected from the scheme’s actual asset holding over and above high quality corporate bonds.

Salary inflation assumptions are as determined by the Board with regard to price inflation. The salary inflation from 31 May 2010 when the 
scheme closed to future accrual was assumed to be in line with inflation. 61 Finsbury Food Group

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
13. Pension Schemes (continued) 
The financial assumptions are based on market conditions as at the review date of 1 July 2017 with discount rates based on the yields on long-dated 
high quality corporate bonds. The discount rate is lower than the discount rate used last year reflecting the change in bond yields over this period. 
The rate of return for plan assets is the long-term rate that reflects the yield on high quality corporate bonds as required under changes to IAS 19.  
The rate of return is effectively based on the discount rate with no allowance made for any outperformance expected from the scheme’s actual asset 
holding. The actual return on the scheme’s assets, net of expenses, over the year to the review date was around 6.9% (2016: -3.3%), the negative 
return that occurred in the previous year was impacted by the uncertainty and volatility around the time of the EU referendum vote.
Changing the year end 2017 assumptions to those of 2016 year end listed on the previous page, the deficit would have been £5,755,000 compared 
to the reported deficit of £10,498,000.

Under the mortality tables adopted, the assumed future life expectancy at age 65 is as follows:

Female currently at age 45 26.5 26.4
Male currently at age 65 22.5 22.4
Female currently at age 65 24.6 24.5
Sensitivity Analysis
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above. The following table summarises changes in these 
assumptions and their approximate (decrease)/increase in liabilities.
 2017
Discount rate plus 0.5% (£2.7 million)
Discount rate minus 0.5% £3.1 million
Inflation plus 0.5% £2.9 million
Inflation minus 0.5% (£2.9 million)
Life expectancy plus 1.0 years £0.7 million
Life expectancy minus 1.0 years (£0.7 million)
The above sensitivities are approximate and only show the likely effect of an assumption being adjusted whilst all other assumptions remain the same.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is around 19 years.
Risk Mitigation Strategies
Whilst the scheme does not explicitly hold risk mitigation strategies such as swaps, annuities or liability driven investments, the investment strategy 
is dominated by diversified growth funds which are intended to reduce the investment risk through diversification.
Effect of the Scheme on the Company’s Future Cashflows
The Company is required to agree a Schedule of contributions with the Trustees of the scheme following a valuation which must be carried out at least  
once every three years. The next valuation of the scheme is due as at 31 December 2018. In the event that the valuation reveals a larger deficit than  
expected the Company may be required to increase contributions above those set out in the existing Schedule of Contributions. Conversely, if the  
position is better than expected contributions may be reduced. The total cash cost to the Company for the current financial year is £481,000, this  
includes deficit recovery contributions, pension protection fund levy fees and cost of advisors. The Company expects to pay deficit recovery contributions  
of £200,000 in the year to 30 June 2018. The projected net interest charge to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for the year to 30 June 
2018 is £281,000. This projection assumes cashflows to and from the scheme are broadly unchanged from the current year figures and that there 
will be no events that would give rise to a settlement/curtailment/past service cost.    62 Finsbury Food Group

21. Financial Risk Management 
The main purpose of the Group’s financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. The financial instruments comprise of bank term loans, 
invoice discounting facility, hire purchase, finance leases, interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, cash and liquid resources and various items 
arising directly from its operations, such as trade receivables and trade payables, the main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are 
interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s policies on the management of liquidity, credit, interest rate and foreign currency risks are set out 
below and the main risks are also referred to in the Strategic Report on pages 14 to 15.
a) Fair Values of Financial Instruments
All financial assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost apart from forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, which are held at fair  
value, with changes going through the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The Group has not disclosed the fair values for financial instruments 
such as short-term trade receivables and payables, because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair values. 
The fair values of forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are determined using a market comparison valuation technique. The fair values  
are based on broker quotes. Similar contracts are traded in an active market and the quotes reflect the actual transactions in similar instruments. 
The fair values relating to these instruments represent level 2 in the fair value hierarchy which relates to the extent the fair value can be determined 
by reference to comparable market values. The classifications range from level 1 where instruments are quoted on an active market through to level 3 
where the assumptions used to arrive at fair value do not have comparable market data. 
b) Liquidity
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it has sufficient facilities to cover its future funding requirements. Short-term flexibility is available through the  
existing bank facilities and the netting off of surplus funds. The carrying amounts are the amounts due if settled at the period end date. The contractual  
undiscounted cash flows include estimated interest payments over the life of these facilities. The estimated interest payments are based on interest 
rates prevailing at the 1 July 2017.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
21. Financial Risk Management (continued)
c) Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, 
and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers. These trading exposures are monitored and managed at operating level and 
are also monitored at Group level. Whilst there is a concentration of credit risk arising from the profile of five customers accounting for 57% of 
total revenue, the Group deems this to be low risk due to the nature of these customers. The carrying amount of the financial assets represents 
the maximum credit exposure. Therefore, the maximum exposure to credit risk for the trade receivables at the period end date was £45.2 million 
(2016: £44.9 million) and the ageing of trade receivables at the period end date was:  
2017
£000
2016
£000
Not past due 41,553 42,709
Past due 0-30 days 3,236 1,779
Past due 31-120 days 317 391
Past due more than 120 days 57 21
45,163 44,900
The above numbers are net of impairment provisions. Group policy is to provide in full against all receivable balances whose full recovery is significantly 
in doubt. The provision is netted off the gross receivable.
The Group’s strategy is to focus on supplying UK multiple grocers and foodservice distributors, the nature of these customers is such that there  
is a relatively low risk of them failing to meet their contractual obligations. There is no impairment necessary to the value of trade receivables at the 
period end date over and above the specific credit note provision and bad debt provision held at the year end. The balance of £0.4 million past due 
by more than 30 days is equivalent to less than 1 day sales (2016: £0.4 million, equivalent to less than 1 day). 
d) Market Risk 
i) Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s interest rate risk exposure is primarily to changes in variable interest rates. The Group has entered into three interest rate swap 
arrangements in order to hedge its risks associated with any fluctuations. Details of swaps are given in Note 12.
The profile of the Group’s loans and overdraft at the period end date were split as follows:
2017
£000
2016
£000
Variable rate liabilities 20,497 22,745
There is no swap coverage at 1 July 2017. The Group has entered into a forward dated swap for £20,000,000 (2016: £9,000,000) to limit the risk 
associated with the variable rate liabilities; the interest rate for the forward dated swap is 0.455% (2016: 1.8% weighted average interest rate).
Sensitivity
A 1% increase in the base rate or LIBOR would have the following impact on interest charges and associated net assets for the Group, this sensitivity 
relates to interest-bearing bank borrowings and interest rate swaps only and excludes possible changes in pension financing costs.  
2017
£000
2016
£000
Profit decrease 197 345
Decrease in net assets 197 345
A 1% decrease in the base rate or LIBOR would have an equal and opposite impact to those listed above. 
The above movement is not equal to 1% of interest-bearing loans because of interest rate swap cover that is in place.  
ii) Commodity Prices
Any rises in commodity prices can adversely impact the core profitability of the business. The Group will aim to pass on its increased costs to its  
customers as far as is reasonable in the circumstances whilst maintaining its tight control over overhead costs to mitigate the impact on consumers.  
The Group maintains a high expertise in its buying team and will consider long-term contracts where appropriate to reduce uncertainty in commodity 
prices. Further information on input prices and risks is contained in the Strategic Report.
iii) Foreign Exchange Risk
The Group currently supplies UK manufactured products to Lightbody Stretz Ltd, its 50% owned selling and distribution business trading primarily 
in Europe. The Group also purchases some raw materials in foreign currency. The consequence of this is that the Group is exposed to movement  
in foreign currency rates. Forward foreign exchanges contracts are used to manage the net foreign exchange exposure. 68 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
21. Financial Risk Management (continued) 
e) Debt and Capital Management
The Group’s objective is to maximise the return on net invested capital while maintaining its ongoing ability to operate and guaranteeing adequate 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, within a sustainable financial structure. An interim dividend for the six months to  
31 December 2016 of 1.0p per share was paid on 21 April 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 31 March 2017. Subject to  
shareholder approval at the Company’s AGM on 22 November 2017, the final dividend of 2.0 pence per share will be paid on 22 December 2017 to

The Group manages its capital by monitoring its gearing ratio on a regular basis, there are also covenant tests which are monitored regularly and 
presented to the Group’s banks every six months. There have been no breaches of covenant tests during the year and the gearing ratio stands at 
0.2 (2016: 0.2). The gearing ratio is calculated taking the total net debt including deferred consideration over net assets.
The Group considers its capital to include share capital, share premium and capital redemption reserve.
The Group does not have any externally imposed capital requirements.
22. Capital and Reserves
The reconciliation of movement in capital and reserves is shown as a primary statement: Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 40.

Share Based Payments 
The Group operates both approved and unapproved share option schemes. 
The fair value is calculated at the grant date and ultimately expensed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss over the vesting period, based 
on the best available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest, with a corresponding credit to reserves. Upon exercise of the share 
options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and where appropriate share premium.

28. Post Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Events
Since the period end date, a proposal has been put forward to close our Grain D’Or business. Grain D’Or is a provider of premium baked products 
for the UK pastry sector and based in London. The Company entered into a formal consultation period on 1 September 2017 with circa 250 employees 
concerning the proposal. The business has been historically loss making and despite the implementation of a range of initiatives to improve the 
business including strict cost control and new working practices the site remained loss making in the year to 1 July 2017. Formal consultation  
is expected to conclude mid October 2017.
A formal employee group consultation has concluded at our small Campbells Cake Company factory in Twechar. A rationalisation program had 
decreased the volumes considerably at the site and the overhead cost of running a small remote site was not sustainable in today’s competitive 
market. To retain the site to the required industry standards would take significant investment, which the Group could not justify given the asset 
limitations and small scale site. Following the formal consultation, a decision has been taken to cease production, with product manufacture being 
transferred within the Group and a small amount of rationalisation. The closure will affect 22 employees and site is expected to close by end 
October 2017.

30. Accounting Policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the  
Financial Statements.
Basis of Preparation
The financial year was the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017 (prior financial year 53 weeks ended 2 July 2016). 
These Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”).  
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with 
Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
The Company proposes to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure framework of FRS 101 in its next Financial Statements.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own Profit and Loss Account. The profit  
or loss for the year is set out in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under the standard in relation to the following 
disclosures; 
• Presentation of a Cash Flow Statement and related notes
• Capital management
• Comparative period reconciliations for share capital and tangible fixed assets
• Impairment of assets
• Transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries 
• The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs
• Key management personnel
As the consolidated Financial Statements of Finsbury Food Group Plc include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions 
under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures:
• IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of Group settled share based payments
• Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures
Where required equivalent disclosures are given in the Group accounts of Finsbury Food Group Plc, which are available within this Report.  
The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except where stated at their fair value. The principal accounting policies  
of the Company are as follows:
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any permanent impairment. Any impairment is charged to the profit and loss as it arises. Impairment 
to investments is tested via impairment testing performed over goodwill, as discussed in Note 1 of the Group Significant Accounting Policies.
Foreign Currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the period end date are retranslated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. 
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which 
they were initially recorded are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to Sterling, 
at foreign exchange rates ruling at the period end date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the 
year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. This revaluation is recognised through 
Other Comprehensive Income.
Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Company has derivative financial instruments in respect of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange hedges. The Company does not hold 
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The existing interest rate swaps and foreign exchange hedges used by the Company while 
they function as hedges, do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting set out by IAS 39, and have thus been treated as financial assets and liabilities 
which are carried at their fair value in the Company Balance Sheet. Fair value is deemed to be market value, which is provided by the counterparty 
at the year end date. 
Changes in the market value of interest rate swaps have been recognised through the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as finance income 
or cost. Changes in the market value of foreign exchange hedges have been recognised through the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
within administrative costs.

(forming part of the Financial Statements) 75 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Notes to the Company’s Financial Statements
30. Accounting Policies (continued) 
Non-derivative Financial Instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, 
loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Unless otherwise indicated, the carrying amounts of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
Trade and Other Payables
The value of trade and other payables is the value that would be payable to settle the liability at the period end date.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and which form an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Interest-bearing Borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Share Based Payment Transactions
The value, as at the grant date, of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, 
over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using  
an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
Taxation
The credit for taxation is based on the loss for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the 
treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and 
accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Going Concern
After making enquiries and on the basis of current financial projections and available funds and facilities, the Directors are satisfied that the 
Company has adequate resources to continue in operation for the next 12 months and, therefore, consider it appropriate to prepare the Financial 
Statements on the going concern basis.
Shares held by Employee Share Trusts
Shares held to satisfy options are accounted for in accordance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments’. All differences between the purchase price of 
the shares held to satisfy options granted and the proceeds received for the shares, whether on exercise or lapse, are charged to reserves.
31. Remuneration of Directors
Details of Directors’ remuneration are set out in Note 6 of the Group’s Financial Statements.
32. Staff Numbers and Costs
The average number of persons employed by the Company (including Directors) during the year, analysed by category, was as follows:

33. Share Based Payments
Details of Directors share options are set out in Note 6 of the Group’s Financial Statements and details of all share options issued are set out in 
Note 23 to the Group Financial Statements. During the year 330,301 (2016: 194,404) of the total 544,384 (2016: 423,980) share options granted 
were issued to employees of the Company. The remaining options were granted to employees of the subsidiary companies with corresponding 
charges to the relevant profit and loss accounts. The total charge in the financial year to the Company for all share options relating to current and 
prior years was £1,084,000 (2016: £248,000). Credits relating to options exercised, cancelled or lapsed after vesting have also been passed to the 
subsidiaries during the year. The charge totalled £151,000 (2016: £47,000) and has resulted in an increase (2016: increase) in the total cost  
of investments in the Company balance sheet. Details of Directors’ share options are set out in Note 6 of the Group’s Financial Statements.

The Group has one forward dated interest rate swap for five years from 3 July 2017 with a coverage of £20 million fixed at a rate of 0.455%.
Two swaps expired during the year:
£3.0m for four years from 22 May 2013 (fixed) at 1.7% expired 22 May 2017
£6.0m for three years from 2 June 2014 (fixed) at 1.9% expired 2 June 2017
There was no coverage at year end (2016: coverage of £9.0 million, equivalent to 78% of total net bank debt with a weighted average rate of 1.8%). 
A credit of £555,000 (2016: £219,000) is shown in finance income for the previous year reflecting changes in the fair values of interest rate swaps.
