 Financial Statements Dear Shareholders
2017 was another successful year  
for Vitec, with a good trading performance, 
continued underlying growth and significant 
progress on strategic objectives. Vitec 
delivered a good set of financial results for 
2017, with underlying sales and profit growth, 
and a record level of revenue and profit 
before tax. The Company’s share price rose 
from £6.48 at the start of January 2017  
to £11.30 on 31 December 2017.
As a consequence, the Board recommends  
a final dividend of 20.1 pence per ordinary 
share (2016: 17.3 pence) which, subject to 
approval by shareholders at the 2018 AGM, 
will be paid on Friday 18 May 2018. 
In 2017, we streamlined our portfolio of 
businesses, successfully selling the non-core 
businesses of Haigh-Farr and Bexel, our  
US Services business, for a combined net 
consideration of £33.2 million. We acquired 
the JOBY and Lowepro brands, as well as  
the higher technology business of RTMotion. 
This streamlining of Vitec’s business portfolio 
will in the future deliver enhanced financial 
performance and higher margins for the 
Company and we will continue to explore 
bolt-on investment opportunities in our  
core and adjacent markets.
2018 also promises to be an exciting  
year for Vitec. We have moved to a three 
divisional structure – with Imaging Solutions, 
Production Solutions and Creative Solutions 
addressing our core photographic, broadcast 
and independent content creator customers. 
The Production Solutions Division will relocate 
its Bury St. Edmunds operation into a new 
purpose-built manufacturing site nearby in  
H1 2018, demonstrating our confidence  
in the division. We are making excellent 
progress with the integration of JOBY and 
Lowepro into the Imaging Solutions Division, 
and Creative Solutions now has critical mass, 
growth potential and the talent to stand on  
its own as a separate division.
Martin Green joined the Board on 4 January 
2017 as Group Business Development Director. 
Kath Kearney-Croft joined the Board on  
24 April 2017 as Group Finance Director.  
The Company has a strong executive 
management team to deliver our strategic 
growth plans. Mark Rollins will be leaving  
the Board as an independent Non-Executive 
Director and Senior Independent Director on 
2 April 2018 to focus on his Chairman’s role 
at Carclo plc. Mark has been a valuable 
member of the Board since joining in October 
2013 and the Board wishes him well for the 
future. To ensure that we have a strong 
independent non-executive presence on the 
Board we have searched for a replacement  
to Mark and we are pleased to report that 
Richard Tyson will join the Board on 2 April 
2018 as an independent Non-Executive 
Director. Richard is Chief Executive Officer  
of TT Electronics plc, holding that position 
since 2014. He was formerly President of  
the Aerospace and Security Division of 
Cobham plc from 2008 to 2014 and a 
member of their Executive Committee. 
Christopher Humphrey will become Senior 
Independent Director in addition to his role  
as Chairman of the Audit Committee with 
effect from Mark ceasing to be a director.   
In 2017, the Board conducted an external 
evaluation of its performance and I am 
pleased to report that the performance of 
your Board and its committees were rated 
highly with the right balance of skills and tone 
from the top, along with the experience to 
meet the challenges of growing the business. 
The detail of this evaluation is covered in the 
Governance Report. 
The Board visited the Teradek business in 
California, US in October 2017 and met with 
the Creative Solutions senior management 
team, including the founders of each of the 
constituent businesses of Teradek, SmallHD, 
Paralinx, Wooden Camera and RTMotion.  
This was an exceptionally valuable exercise  
in building the Board’s knowledge and 
understanding of the new division and the 
talent of the divisional team. I am confident 
that with this talent in Creative Solutions,  
as well as the talent in Imaging Solutions  
and Production Solutions, the Company is 
well positioned for further success and to  
be able to deliver further growth in 2018.
Our excellent progress in 2017 and future 
success is down to the hard work and 
dedication of all our employees around  
the Group, and on behalf of the Board I  
thank each one of them for their dedication  
in delivering the Company’s purpose of 
providing vital products and solutions  
that support the capture and sharing  
of exceptional images.
I, and all my Board colleagues, plan to attend 
the AGM on 15 May 2018 and we look 
forward to the opportunity to meet with as 
many shareholders as possible on the day.

 Financial Statements Group Chief Executive’s Review
Vitec operates in the fast-growing, global “image 
capture and sharing” market. Technology and 
social media continue to drive fundamental 
changes to this market. Vitec’s unique heritage, 
the credibility of our premium products, and our 
manufacturing and distribution strengths, provide 
us with exciting opportunities to capitalise on those 
changes. These, coupled with the experience and 
knowledge of our people, enable us to develop 
ground-breaking new products. 
2017 was a transformational year for Vitec as  
we significantly reshaped our portfolio through 
disposals and acquisitions. The Group sold two 
non-core businesses and invested in new markets, 
geographies and technologies. We announced  
that from 1 January 2018 we would move from 
two to three Divisions to reflect a changing 
customer base, to enable us to adapt quickly  
to market and technological changes, and to give 
greater focus to the fast-growing Independent 
Content Creator market. 
Our new three Divisions – Imaging Solutions, 
Production Solutions and Creative Solutions –  
are highly customer-focused and operate in a 
decentralised, entrepreneurial structure, yet share 
capabilities across the Group. 
Although we continued to experience challenging 
market conditions in the more mature US 
broadcast market, this was offset by growth  
in sales of higher technology products  
and acquisitions. 
Vitec has a clear growth strategy which is focused 
on organic sales growth, operational efficiencies 
and corporate development. 2017 saw significant 
progress executing our strategy which is based 
around five priorities.  
1. Corporate development
We supplement our organic growth opportunities 
with carefully targeted acquisitions. Our acquisition 
strategy focuses on finding innovative businesses 
operating within our core, or closely adjacent, 
markets which possess the right product 
development, growth characteristics and  
financial prospects. 
During the year, we streamlined our portfolio by 
disposing of the non-core businesses – Haigh-Farr 
and Bexel, our US Services business, for net 
consideration of £33.2 million. In September 2017, 
we acquired the JOBY and Lowepro brands for our 
Imaging Solutions Division, for cash consideration 
of £8.4 million excluding integration costs and 
investment in working capital. JOBY is best known 
for its patented GorillaPod tripod and Lowepro is the 
leading camera bag brand. This acquisition is an 
excellent strategic fit with Vitec’s existing core 
activities and integration is going well. 
In September 2017, we also announced the 
acquisition of RTMotion for our Creative Solutions 
Division, for up to £3.1 million in net cash. RTMotion 
is a high technology business which gives the Group 
additional high quality camera accessories for the 
expanding Independent Content Creator market. 
This business has been successfully integrated into 
Creative Solutions and its products are being sold 
under the Teradek brand name as Teradek RT.    
2. Improve the core 
We continue to maximise and improve our 
business to better deliver underlying growth, and  
in 2017 Vitec delivered operational efficiencies 
through improvements to purchasing, inventory 
management and manufacturing. We achieved 
further lean manufacturing savings in our Italian 
and Costa Rican facilities, and are currently 
moving our manufacturing operations from 
Shelton, US to Costa Rica. In H1 2018, the 
Production Solutions Division will relocate its  
Bury St. Edmunds, UK facility to a purpose-built 
manufacturing site nearby that will deliver further 
operational improvements. We also expect to 
identify additional operational synergies across  
the Group in the medium-term. 
We continue to demonstrate innovation throughout 
our businesses. In 2017 we launched a range  
of new products, including the revolutionary 
Flowtech carbon-fibre tripod, Internet Protocol 
prompters from Autoscript, Litepanels Gemini  
LED lights and compact tripods from Manfrotto.  
We also celebrated the 100-year anniversary of 
our Gitzo brand. 
In 2018 we will maintain our market leadership  
by focusing on maximising sales of these and 
other new products, and continuing to innovate 
with new products and new technologies.  
In addition, our Production Solutions Division  
is currently supporting the 2018 Winter  
Olympics in South Korea.  
3. New markets and technologies
We have maintained investment in new technology 
and markets to underpin future growth. For 
example, in 2017 we further expanded our product 
offering in Apple stores with our newly acquired 
JOBY brand, and the RTMotion acquisition has 
performed in line with expectations.
We innovate quickly and we released a range  
of high quality products, including SmallHD Ultra 
Bright Monitors, a Wooden Camera Universal 
Follow Focus, a new Teradek Cube HEVC encoder, 
and Teradek Serv Pro, a dedicated iOS monitoring 
solution. We also launched a number of cross-
2017 was a transformational year 
for the Group
Vitec’s transformed 
portfolio of businesses 
and new operating 
structure have 
repositioned the  
Group to deliver  
future progress.
06
The V itec Group plc           Group products, developing synergies between 
Vitec brands. Examples include a SmallHD monitor 
with a built-in Teradek Bolt wireless receiver,  
a SmallHD Focus monitor with an Anton/Bauer 
battery, and a Manfrotto/Wooden Camera Directors 
Cage for DSLR and mirrorless cameras. We remain 
focused on further cross-selling of brands across 
the Group, especially to our Independent Content 
Creator customers. We also continue to identify 
acquisition opportunities to address new areas  
of the content production value chain.  
4. Get closer to our customers
We continue to drive initiatives to get closer to our 
customers by owning more of our distribution and 
optimising our e-commerce activities. Our end 
markets are changing with more independent 
content creators looking to purchase equipment 
online and we are investing in and optimising our 
e-commerce capabilities through working with our 
major customers like Amazon and other specialised 
e-tailers, and by further developing our own online 
platforms. Our Creative Solutions Division has 
invested in a number of “Customer Experience 
Centres”, tying our many Creative Solutions brands 
together to offer bundled products as well as 
educational workshops.  
5. Expand in APAC
Finally, we continue to expand geographically, 
especially in APAC, leveraging our current 
capabilities and footprint. Our Imaging Solutions 
Division has an efficient and widespread distribution 
network throughout the region and deals directly 
with the leading retailers and e-tailers. The 
acquisition of the JOBY and Lowepro brands has 
brought in specialist teams in Hong Kong and China. 
APAC is the fastest growing region for Vitec, and we 
see further growth opportunities in this area.  
We will utilise our current networks to distribute 
other Vitec brands with a specific focus on growing 
our Creative Solutions Division, initially in China.  
2017 Performance Overview
Vitec is pleased to report a record performance, 
with strong growth in revenue and adjusted profit 
before tax*. It has been a transformational year for 
the Group, which saw the acquisition of the JOBY 
and Lowepro brands. 
We launched a record number of market-leading 
new products and made significant progress 
refocusing our portfolio with the disposal of  
two non-core businesses. 
Our Imaging Solutions Division had a strong  
year and continues to outperform the market.  
The integration of the JOBY and Lowepro brands  
is going well. 
The Production Solutions Division benefitted  
from sales of new products, including the 
revolutionary Flowtech tripod, although the  
US studio market continued to experience 
challenging market conditions. 
Our Creative Solutions Division further expanded  
its higher technology products with the acquisition 
of RTMotion. SmallHD, in particular, grew strongly.  
Product Development
We recognise that the markets in which we 
operate are quick to change and evolve, so we 
innovate quickly and invest in new products and 
solutions to add to our already well respected 
range. We are very pleased with the new products 
we launched this year and continue to build on 
those with synergistic efficiencies where possible

Sustained investment 
in new markets and 
technologies
“I’ve been in the imaging industry for over 10 years working 
with the JOBY and Lowepro brands globally. We were 
acquired by the Vitec Group in September 2017. It’s been 
such a positive experience to join a diverse team of talented 
professionals who are dedicated to the same core values 
within the industry we love.” 
Tim Grimmer, Senior Brand Director, JOBY and Lowepro 
The V itec Group plc          
08 RTMotion
The acquisition of RTMotion is in line with 
Vitec’s strategy of offering innovative and 
highly technical solutions to the Group’s 
established independent content creator 
customer base, and will facilitate Vitec’s 
growth in the higher technology area of 
camera accessories.
Based in the UK, RTMotion designs and manufactures lens control 
systems for video cameras used to make feature films and television 
series, for example, “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “Planet Earth II”.
RTMotion has been successfully integrated into our Creative Solutions 
Division. There are significant growth opportunities to sell RTMotion’s 
products through our global sales and distributor network, and the 
business will benefit from Vitec’s marketing, manufacturing and supply 
chain capabilities. 
“We have admired Vitec’s vision 
and breadth of expertise for some 
time, and are extremely excited to 
be joining the Group alongside 
industry leaders such as Teradek 
and SmallHD. This acquisition will 
give us world-leading support in 
marketing, reseller channels and 
strategic management.” 
Kris Bird, Co-founder of RTMotion
As part of Vitec’s strategy to improve our core business and get closer 
to our customers, we acquired the JOBY and Lowepro brands. JOBY 
introduced the patented GorillaPod tripod which has transformed the 
camera accessories market and has a strong presence in Apple 
stores. Lowepro has been a market leader in bags designed to protect 
electronic and camera devices since 1967.
JOBY and Lowepro products are designed by dedicated marketing 
resources located in California, US, and engineered by expert 
innovation teams based in the Far East. All products are manufactured 
by third parties with proprietary tools and sold globally through the 
Vitec Imaging Distribution network.
This acquisition strengthens and complements Vitec’s existing product 
portfolio. It gives us:
•  A leading global position in the new and fast growing iphoneography, 
mobile journalism and vlogging markets, as well as the camera bags 
market, bringing in an expanded product development team and 
technical capabilities with access to new intellectual property;
•  Increased retail presence, particularly in the US, making Vitec 
Imaging Distribution a leading distributor of premium imaging 
accessories in the largest global economies;
•  The opportunity to get closer to customers by consolidating Vitec’s 
strategic relationships with Apple and online retailers such as 
Amazon and T-Mall, the leading consumer electronics retailers,  
B&H and specialist retailers; and
•  A platform to expand further in APAC and strengthen the Group’s 
presence in China and Hong Kong through the JOBY and Lowepro 
teams who are based there. 
Vitec is integrating JOBY and Lowepro into its Imaging Solutions 
Division’s existing organisational structure, under the leadership  
of Marco Pezzana, Divisional Chief Executive, Vitec Imaging Solutions.  
In addition to enabling greater penetration of 
adjacent market segments, stronger retail 
presence and improved innovation capabilities, 
the integration of JOBY and Lowepro into 
Vitec’s Imaging Solutions Division is expected 
to deliver substantial operational synergies  
in procurement, logistics and distribution 
across all divisional brands. 
JOBY and Lowepro
Acquiring the JOBY and Lowepro brands 
demonstrates Vitec’s commitment to 
expanding our portfolio of premium branded 
products for the imaging and Independent 
Content Creator markets. These leading 
brands give us greater access to new 
markets and expand our retail presence, 
especially in the US, by adding high quality, 
complementary products.

Investing in 
manufacturing  
excellence 
Focussed on safety,  
quality, efficiency, cost 
and on-time delivery, 
manufacturing excellence 
is one of Vitec’s core 
competitive strengths. 
Our strategy is to continuously 
improve and optimise our 
manufacturing and assembly 
operations globally to maximise 
quality, service and efficiency, 
while reducing costs. We operate 
manufacturing facilities in the UK, 
Italy and Costa Rica, and assembly 
operations in a number of locations 
in the US. In 2017, we invested 
significantly in our facilities. 
We operate competitive, flexible 
manufacturing operations which 
deliver premium products and 
reliability to our markets. Vitec’s 
facilities follow lean principles and, 
where appropriate, are automated. 
Our supply chain is efficient and 
our people are highly trained, multi-
skilled, and focused on continuous 
improvement. Our “improve the core” 
strategic priority is focused on driving 
further efficiency and investing 
appropriately to support our wider 
growth plans and deliver increasing 
returns to our shareholders.
The provision of a healthy, safe and 
productive work environment for  
all of our employees is a high priority  
for Vitec across all sites. We continue 
to implement initiatives aimed at 
sustainability and protecting the 
environment across all of our locations. 
Feltre, Italy
Vitec Centre of Excellence for high 
volume heads and tripods
Vitec manufactures 80% of the supports for 
its Imaging Solutions Division in our Italian 
facility, across our Manfrotto, Gitzo and 
Avenger brands. The 320,000 ft
2
 site was 
established in 1986 and employs around  
400 people. Vitec is the largest manufacturer 
of branded supports in the world, with over 
three million units produced annually.  
As a result of our investment in people, lean 
processes and automation, our premium 
supports are produced more efficiently in  
Italy than elsewhere. “Made in Italy” is  
a distinct competitive advantage in this 
market and in October 2017 we moved  
the manufacturing of our Manfrotto Befree 
Advanced tripod from China to Italy. Our  
new automatic aluminium tube cutting and 
punching machine is capable of producing 
one tube every four seconds, is seamlessly 
linked to the new assembly lines and gives a 
high throughput of consistently high quality 
products. This tube machine received its 
Industry 4.0 certification at the end of 2017. 
Bury St. Edmunds, UK
Vitec Centre of Excellence for 
robotics and Flowtech
Vitec’s Production Solutions Division will 
relocate its Bury St. Edmunds operation into  
a new, purpose-built site nearby in H1 2018. 
Replacing the 50-year old existing factory, 
the new facility will specialise in advanced 
technology in areas such as robotics, 
automation and broadcast studio equipment 
for our Vinten and Sachtler brands. It will 
include a fully automated, highly efficient  
and proprietary process for the development 
of carbon fibre for the Flowtech tripod, which 
maintains our product differentiation and 
competitive edge. Vitec has invested 
significantly in the new, 66,000 ft
2
 site  
which will house around 180 people across 
manufacturing, engineering, operations and 
other functions, and produces approximately 
20,000 units annually. Our focus on 
continuous improvement has led to 
productivity, work flow and space utilisation 
improvements and resulted in the new site 
having a smaller footprint. 
Ashby-de-la-Zouch, UK
Vitec Centre of Excellence for 
Imaging Solutions lighting controls
Vitec acquired the Lastolite lights business in 
2011 for its Imaging Solutions Division and 
has transformed this factory into its specialist 
centre for the production of lighting controls, 
reflectors, backgrounds, umbrellas, soft boxes 
and flash accessories. With around 60 people 
the 43,000 ft
2
 factory produces 360,000 high 
quality, durable units annually. This business 
has remained highly competitive against 
mainly Far Eastern competitors due to its 
continuous improvement methodology and 
the experienced gained from its sister facility 
in Italy.
Cartago, Costa Rica
Vitec Centre of Excellence for  
low volume heads, tripods  
and batteries
Vitec selected Costa Rica for one of its main 
manufacturing and engineering facilities 
because of its educated workforce, its 
proximity to our largest market (North 
America), its low cost base, and its stable 
government. Our Costa Rica facility 
manufactures heads, tripods and camera 
accessories for the Vinten, Sachtler, OConnor 
and Anton/Bauer brands in our Production 
Solutions Division. The site was established in 
1985 and has approximately 180 employees 
producing over 50,000 products annually,  
in a 65,000 ft
2
 facility. The Costa Rica facility 
has invested heavily in introducing lean 
principals to make it one of the most efficient 
manufacturing facilities in Central America.
We are in the process of consolidating our 
manufacturing operations from Shelton,  
US to Costa Rica.

 Financial Statements Adoption of new 
image capture devices
The growing demand for video 
content, combined with the adoption 
of new image capturing devices, are 
important growth drivers for Vitec.  
As camera technology improves,  
for example, with new 4K and HDR 
recording capabilities, mirrorless 
cameras, OLED viewfinders and  
live streaming of content to  
mobile devices, this creates new 
opportunities for Vitec accessories 
(e.g. LED lights and flexible tripods) 
as well as for our video transmission 
systems as the production of live 
streamed content increases.
These continued technological 
enhancements mean that premium 
mirrorless cameras, drones, action 
cameras and smartphones are 
rapidly being adopted by 
professionals and advanced 
consumers as complementary 
equipment to traditional cameras 
(photo and video). This has opened 
up further opportunities for Vitec  
to develop and commercialise 
innovative, high end accessories that 
enable a competent creative public 
to obtain the best results from new 
image capturing technologies.
Furthermore, the rapid growth in 
smartphone adoption has resulted  
in a sharp increase in the volumes  
of general consumers shooting stills 
and video and uploading them to  
the internet with an increasing  
focus on quality of content  
requiring accessories to assist  
with these shots.
Increase in video 
consumption and 
independent video 
creation
The proliferation of new media, 
coupled with the growth of third  
party streaming applications, has 
resulted in significantly higher 
content generation, engagement, 
reach and measurability (via likes, 
follows, shares and comments). 
Media companies today must  
deliver content to more platforms  
and devices than ever before to  
build brand awareness and retain 
their audience.
Newer online platforms such as 
Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have rapidly 
increased their commissioning of 
original content as opposed to 
re-transmitting programmes 
previously aired on the traditional 
networks. This has led to the 
expansion of independent or owner/
operator production companies set 
up to produce content for those 
networks and those production 
companies purchasing or renting 
equipment to do so. Our products  
are well-suited to meeting the needs 
of these production companies.
These smaller production companies 
require more affordable, portable 
products. Free streaming platforms 
such as Facebook Live and YouTube 
Live allow content creators in the 
field (independent and traditional 
broadcasters) to stream live and 
publish content on mobile devices. 
Vitec provides a wide range of mobile 
equipment (e.g. Manfrotto and JOBY 
compact tripods and monopods, 
Sachtler Flowtech tripod, Litepanels 
portable lights and Manfrotto and 
Lowepro carrying solutions) while 
Teradek’s Live:Air production suite 
offers a comprehensive video mixer 
for mobile devices.
Wireless and cellular 
data transmission, 
and next generation 
compression
We see accelerating growth in the 
use of wireless devices to transmit 
data and images on “connected 
devices”, especially through WiFi. 
The cost-effectiveness, range and 
quality of video data encoders, 
decoders and related components 
allows users to monitor and  
transmit at increasingly lower costs. 
Vitec products, including Litepanels’ 
use of Bluetooth for remote lighting 
management and Teradek’s  
wireless decoders are evidence  
of our innovation in new markets  
and technologies.
With the advent of Ultra High 
Definition the amount of data 
contained in one hour of video  
has dramatically increased.  
This, combined with the growing 
demand to consume video on mobile 
devices, necessitated a new video 
compression paradigm, called HEVC, 
or H.265. Vitec is a leading 
manufacturer of HEVC solutions  
for broadcasters and webcasters.
4K transition 
4K resolution adoption has increased 
rapidly and is becoming more 
mainstream in the US, with Netflix, 
Amazon, Sky and Apple all offering 
4K Ultra HD streaming services.  
As adoption grows around the globe, 
studios and video cameras will need 
to be upgraded with new technology, 
resulting in increased demand for 
our products and software to 
accommodate the new formats. 
Worldwide, even higher resolutions 
have been launched, for example, 
Japan’s pioneering public 
broadcaster NHK has already begun 
the world’s first 8K broadcast trials. 
In addition, the application of 4K 
video technology to both DSLR  
and compact system cameras is 
attracting a growing number of 
content creators who can now 
produce high quality visual content in 
either still or motion picture formats 
Our industry
Market trends and
growth drivers
12
The V itec Group plc           with highly dependable, portable and 
affordable equipment. This positive 
trend is expected to further 
consolidate with the evolution of 4K 
into 8K technology which will enable 
the extraction of high resolution still 
images from video assets. 
Traditional 
broadcasters’ capital 
expenditure
Traditional broadcasters’ ability  
and willingness to incur capital 
expenditure on the construction  
or refurbishment of studios depends 
partly on their financial performance. 
Those broadcasters reliant on 
advertising expenditure continue  
to invest in their capabilities but  
tend to be more susceptible to 
macroeconomic conditions.
Vitec’s ability to offer products that 
reduce the capital expenditure 
requirements of broadcasters and  
in turn reduce their investment risk, 
is increasingly attractive, notably 
through savings offered by our lower 
cost Vinten robotic heads and 
Litepanels LED lighting solutions.  
The savings and efficiencies offered 
by LED lighting compared with 
traditional lighting are significant. 
There is also a focus on mobile 
journalism and portable solutions,  
for example, Vitec’s carbon-fibre 
Flowtech tripod is popular for 
electronic news gathering and with 
independent content creators. It is 
not enough to simply create content 
for broadcast; content must also be 
made for online audiences, whether 
that is live streamed or uploaded as 
“second screen” content, and more 
bonded cellular broadcasts are using 
products such as Teradek’s Bond.
As part of the US broadcast spectrum 
incentive auction, the Federal 
Communications Commission was 
authorised to “repack” the television 
bandwidth by assigning television 
stations to new channels. This 
process has posed significant 
challenges and delays for the 
broadcast industry as television 
stations will need to complete 
channel moves. This project has  
led to unexpected additional capital 
investments in core transmission 
technologies and has led to some 
uncertainty by US broadcasters  
and impacted investment in other 
broadcast technology, including 
Vitec’s US studio products from  
our Production Solutions Division.
Sales of photographic 
cameras with 
interchangeable 
lenses
We are seeing more stability in  
the interchangeable lens cameras 
market, driven by the popularity of 
mirrorless cameras and their 
combined photo/video high resolution 
recording capabilities. The continued 
upgrade in sensors and overall 
specifications of latest generation 
compact system cameras is also 
driving a growing adoption of this 
format by advanced consumers and 
professionals alike. In addition, the 
average price of a photographic 
camera is increasing as consumers 
demand premium camera models to 
differentiate from images captured  
on their smartphones. The camera 
accessories market reflects this trend 
with increased demand for SmallHD 
monitors, Manfrotto high performance 
compact tripods, and Manfrotto and 
Lowepro multi-media bags.
Online distribution 
channels
The continued growth in online 
distribution channels for products for 
photographers, videographers and 
independent content creators has 
stimulated increased demand from 
new customers, particularly in 
emerging economies where 
e-commerce provides easier and 
faster access to a wider range of 
products and tutorial information.
Video for enterprises
There is a growing demand for high 
quality video being produced by a 
variety of non-broadcast enterprises. 
This includes: 
•  Fortune 1000 businesses wanting 
to capture and disseminate 
corporate messages internally,  
as well as training videos and  
new product introductions;
•  Large religious institutions 
increasingly using video to connect 
with congregations;
•  Public addresses and streaming  
of official meetings, court 
proceedings and government 
sessions;
•  Medical institutions wanting to 
record healthcare procedures with 
high quality video; and
•  Sports teams and franchises 
looking to capture and further 
enhance their fans’ experience  
and the team’s brand awareness.
These customers need to light their 
content, use teleprompters to better 
tell their story, deploy stable supports 
to hold and use their cameras, 
equipment to hold their lights and 
even backgrounds for their videos. 
 
Vitec operates in one of the most exciting global markets; that of image 
content creation and sharing. This dynamic market has been transformed 
over the past decade and will continue to change. Driven by new media 
and technological innovation, image capture and sharing has grown 
exponentially, with millions of videos and still images taken and shared 
every day. This drives sustained demand for new and replacement 
products as customers take advantage of new technologies.
Our focus is on supplying a wide range of premium products for broadcasters, 
cinematographers, independent content creators, photographers and videographers  
to enable them to capture and share content. This content can be video footage or  
still images and can be produced in a studio, on location, in an enterprise or at home.
We position our brands at the premium end of the market with technically advanced 
products. We are focused on developing new products to enable our customers to 
think and work differently, to capture and share world-class content in multiple ways.

 Financial Statements Operational Review
Imaging Solutions had a strong year, growing 
revenue by 16.2% to £175.9 million. This included 
£12.6 million of revenue from the transformational 
acquisition of JOBY and Lowepro which completed 
in September 2017 and gives Vitec a leading 
global position in the new and fast growing 
iPhoneography and vlogging accessories market, 
as well as the photographic bags market. The 
integration of these brands is going well. Excluding 
the favourable impact of foreign exchange, as well 
as the impact from JOBY and Lowepro, revenue 
was 3.3% higher. 
Camera and Imaging Productions Association 
(“CIPA”) data has shown a slightly positive trend  
for full year shipments of interchangeable lens 
cameras (“ILC”). Our sales outperformed CIPA 
trends, particularly in APAC where we focused  
on delivering growth. Revenue growth has been 
achieved through investing in and launching new 
products and continued development of our key 
distribution channels. 
We grew our sales of video and photo supports 
and filters and successfully launched a number of 
innovative products including the Manfrotto BeFree 
Advanced tripod and the Manfrotto Nitrotech head. 
Gitzo, our premium brand, celebrated its 100 year 
anniversary and continues to be the favoured 
choice for professional photographers. Our 
decision to move production of the Manfrotto 
BeFree range of tripods, which were previously 
part manufactured in China, back to an automated 
production facility in Italy has been well received 
by our customers, with the “Made in Italy” stamp 
helping to differentiate us from our competitors. 
We significantly increased our presence in Apple 
stores globally through the acquisition of JOBY.  
We also developed our relationship with Amazon, 
with double digit sales growth for the year, driven 
by strong performance in the US. Our owned 
distribution business continued to perform well  
and is a key asset in ensuring that we remain 
close to our end customers. 
Statutory operating profit increased by 15.5% to 
£26.1 million. Adjusted operating profit* margin 
increased by 0.4% pts to 17.0%. This reflects the 
higher volumes as well as the favourable product 
mix from higher sales of video supports, favourable 
channel mix from higher e-commerce sales and 
production efficiencies.  
The Imaging Solutions Division designs, 
manufactures and distributes premium branded 
equipment for photographic and video cameras 
and provides dedicated solutions to professional 
and non-professional image makers. This consists 
primarily of camera supports and heads, camera 
bags, lighting supports, LED lights, lighting controls 
and filters. It also supplies an expanding range of 
premium accessories for smartphones, action 
cameras and drones.

The V itec Group plc           Innovative new 
products
2017 has been a transformational year for Vitec’s 
Imaging Solutions Division with the addition of the 
Lowepro and JOBY brands to our portfolio. We have 
also launched a number of new products to market, 
including more compact and versatile tripods.  
Examples of new products launched in 2017 include:
“I am constantly searching for balance. In my work, life and art. 
I like form as much as I like function and the Gitzo range fits 
that. My bags are as well thought out functionally as they are 
pleasing to look at and this compliments my photography  
and work ethos. Attention to detail, practical and fashionable.”

“The new Nitrotech video head is a beautiful gift 
dedicated to the new generation of filmmakers with 
perfect versatility and precision!”
Sebastien Devaud, Director
Manfrotto Befree 
Advanced “Made in Italy” 
The Befree Advanced tripod is a compact 
and lightweight traveller tripod positioned 
for advanced hobbyist photographers. 
Uniquely, it offers two different models,  
the twist lock and the lever lock to allow 
photographers to choose the locking 
mechanism they feel most comfortable 
with, enabling them to set their gear up 
quickly, and focus on the images they 
want to capture.
Both models are engineered, designed 
and manufactured in Manfrotto’s 
automated Italian plants. In 2017 the 
manufacturing was brought back from 
China and the “Made in Italy” stamp is  
a key competitive differentiator.
Pioneering technology  
in the Manfrotto  
Nitrotech head
This ground-breaking video head combines 
the features from Manfrotto’s Professional 
Video Head with the latest generation 
nitrogen piston mechanism which 
guarantees continuous counterbalance. 
Developed to meet the market trend for 
increasingly light video heads for smaller 
camera body sizes, Vitec collaborated with 
car manufacturers to produce the gas 
piston (nitro) in the head, taken from those 
currently used in vehicle boot doors.  
This pioneering model from Manfrotto is 
designed and manufactured in Italy and 
provides independent content creators with 
optimum counterbalanced weight capacity 
as they work with the latest cameras and 
accessories – in and outside the studio.
Gitzo 100
2017 saw Vitec’s Gitzo brand celebrate its 
100 year anniversary. To commemorate 
the occasion we introduced a Limited 
Edition state-of-the-art Traveller Tripod 
entirely manufactured in carbon fibre,  
a new Fluid Gimbal Head specifically 
developed for birdwatching and wildlife 
applications, and a range of high quality 
leather camera bags.
Professionals throughout the world 
acknowledge Gitzo tripods, monopods, 
heads and accessories as setting the 
industry’s standards for excellence. 
Precision assembly, high quality materials 
and fine control are all qualities that 
represent Gitzo products. 
Manfrotto Xume
2017 saw the launch of Manfrotto’s first 
suite of professional magnetic filters that 
lock onto lenses quickly and easily, 
enabling the photographer to focus  
on their shot and change filters instantly.

Getting closer to our customers
Beyond technology, our Imaging Solutions Division continues to work hard to get closer to our 
customers to enable us to grow across channels and geographies.
Distribution is changing and today over 50% of our global Imaging Solutions sales are sold outside photo 
speciality stores in distribution channels like Apple Stores and Amazon, and other specialised e-commerce 
platforms like B&H.com, T -Mall and JD.com. The vast majority of image makers are highly digitalised 
and the internet is the preferred channel for them to purchase new equipment. We continue to develop 
our online presence by growing sales via direct e-commerce and by working in close partnership with 
leading e-tailers. Our JOBY and Lowepro acquisition means that we have substantially more products and 
experienced people to work with these strategic customers.
Another core asset of Vitec’ s Imaging Solutions Division is our direct distribution network, which provides 
localised expert access to over 3,000 retail customers worldwide and ensures that we remain close to  
our end customers. 
Vitec has a multichannel approach to providing the customer with a seamless shopping experience, 
whether shopping online from a desktop or mobile device, by telephone or in a photo speciality store.
Vitec Imaging Distribution 
Supported by a fully integrated supply chain 
network, Vitec Imaging Distribution cost 
effectively and efficiently delivers all Divisional 
products and brands across major economies. 
•  13 markets served directly
•  20+ brands distributed
•  150 sales and marketing professionals
•  Over 3,000 direct accounts
•  Integrated logistics and customer service 
platform
Apple
The acquisition of JOBY has significantly 
increased Vitec’s presence in Apple stores and  
it is set to grow again in 2018 when a range  
of three new products will go into half of their 
stores. This will bring the total Vitec SKUs ranged 
by Apple to 12, with different variations in each 
store and online.
Amazon
Vitec’s global partnership with Amazon drives 
growth through the customer centric supply of 
our core product range. Double digit sales 
growth with Amazon in 2017 was driven by the 
US. Our dedicated team within Amazon works  
on the six most significant geographies, 
advancing our brands in the consumers’ mind 
through the Manfrotto branded area within the 
Amazon platform. We signpost our customers  
to our products through engaging content, 
search engine marketing, platform specific 
promotions and digital integration. All Manfrotto 
branded stores on Amazon are aligned so 
whether you visit amazon.it, .com or .co.uk you 
have the same level of brand engagement. 
Direct e-commerce
Direct e-commerce is an important growth 
driver for the Imaging Solutions Division, even 
more so with the addition of end users through 
our JOBY and Lowepro acquisition. 
Year-on-year sales through our own platforms 
increased by approximately 50%, driven by 
further investment in developing our online 
platforms and web support. More importantly, 
direct e-commerce brings us even closer to  
our core customers. It enables fast track 
introduction of new products and supports  
a more effective expansion of the brand in 
adjacent product categories via highly targeted 
direct marketing and social media campaigns. 
We continue to work on increasing direct sales, 
average cart value and conversion rate.

This unit goes everywhere with me,  
in my purse, on all of my travels.”
Valentina Dang, Makeup Artist & Hair Stylist,

Expanding in APAC
Vitec’s ability to get closer to customers across 
multiple distribution channels is also the key to our 
successful expansion in APAC.
Over the last four years we have invested significantly to 
develop an efficient distribution network to grow our business 
in APAC and this is proving successful, driven primarily by 
millennials and the growing Chinese middle class. China  
is now Imaging Solutions Division’s fourth largest market.  
The acquisition of the JOBY and Lowepro brands has further 
strengthened the Division’ s engineering and supply chain 
capabilities in Hong Kong and China.
Focus on Japan and China
We deal directly with all leading retailers in Japan as well as the best known imaging 
specialist retailers across first, second and third tier cities in China. Our team of over 
40 dedicated sales and marketing professionals work closely with both physical and 
e-tail customers. With offices in Tokyo, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong, 
Manfrotto has rapidly achieved a leading market position in both supports and bags. 
APAC is the fastest growing region for Vitec’s Imaging Solutions Division and we see 
further opportunities in this area, one example being expanding distribution of Lowepro  
in the region, as well as with Vitec Imaging Distribution soon distributing SmallHD and 
Teradek products, initially in China.

 Financial Statements Operational Review
The Production Solutions Division designs, 
manufactures, distributes and provides 
premium branded products and solutions  
for broadcasters, film and video production 
companies, independent content creators 
and enterprises. Products include video 
heads, tripods, lights, batteries and 
speciality camera systems.  
The non-repeat of the 2016 Olympics and 
continued challenging market conditions in  
the US studio market led to a fall in Production 
Solutions’ revenue from continuing operations  
of £7.4 million to £114.2 million. This included 
£4.5 million from favourable foreign exchange. 
The business remains market leader in the  
core broadcast studio market. Whilst we saw  
an improvement in our US studio business in  
the second half compared with the first half, 
overall sales of large supports declined in the 
year. This included the impact of the spectrum  
“repack” in the US. This was partly offset by 
stronger market conditions in Europe and the 
Middle East and higher sales of robotics and  
LED lighting products. 
We launched a number of new products during 
the year, mainly focusing on the non-studio 
applications for broadcasters and on independent 
content creators. These included Flowtech 
(Sachtler and Vinten versions), a revolutionary 
tripod which utilises state-of-the-art carbon fibre 
technology developed in-house enabling very 
rapid deployment, and Litepanels Gemini to exploit 
growth in the LED lighting market. We also 
launched Autoscript’s Intelligent Prompting, a fully 
Internet Protocol-enabled teleprompting solution. 
These products were well received by the market. 
We continue to improve the core business by 
driving operational efficiencies. We are in the 
process of moving our manufacturing operations 
from Shelton, US to our facility in Costa Rica and 
in H1 2018 the manufacturing operations in Bury 
St. Edmunds, UK will relocate to a new purpose 
built site in the same area which will lead to 
further operational improvements. 
Statutory operating profit increased by £0.4 
million to £14.1 million and adjusted operating 
profit margin* reduced by 0.1% pt to 13.3%

The V itec Group plc           Continued investment in 
new product development
Vitec’s Production Solutions Division has historically 
and primarily sold into the more traditional broadcast 
and cine markets where our premium brands are 
market leaders. These customers are looking for new 
products that reduce capital expenditure and Vitec 
has a sustained programme of investment in new 
product development to respond to customer demand, 
technological innovations and to support growth. 
Examples of award-winning new products include  
the unique, carbon-fibre Flowtech tripod, Litepanels 
Gemini LED lights and Autoscript IP Prompting.
Flowtech carbon-fibre 
tripod
Flowtech is a brand new product with 
revolutionary, patented technology, 
produced in our Bury St. Edmunds factory. 
Dual-branded Sachtler and Vinten, 
Flowtech is a set of two-stage carbon fibre 
tripod legs with quick release brakes.  
A versatile, lightweight tripod, Flowtech  
is easier and faster to deploy and adjust 
than any other tripod on the market, giving 
a camera operator ultimate versatility  
on location. 
Litepanels Gemini  
LED Lighting
Litepanels pioneered LED lighting for 
motion pictures, television and the 
audio-visual industry. We continue to 
expand our suite of products and have 
recently introduced a new light that 
combines daylight, tungsten and 
red-green-blue LEDs to deliver highly 
flexible and precise colour adjustment in a 
lightweight design. The Gemini soft panel 
produces true, full-spectrum white light 
with manual and remote control options.
Autoscript Intelligent 
Prompting
In 2017, Vitec’s Autoscript introduced the 
first Internet Protocol-enabled (“IP”) 
teleprompter. Until now, prompting systems 
have relied on USB, video and cables to 
connect the controller to the prompting 
engine and the monitor. Our engineers 
completely redesigned the prompting 
system around an IP-enabled workflow, 
with a scalable architecture. The new 
hardware is lightweight and uses a 
carbon-fibre hood to reduce weight, as  
well as being quick and easy to install.  
The system is highly flexible and 
cost-effective, with one operator  
controlling the script in multiple locations. 
Camera Corps Rig 
Captures “EasyJet: Inside 
the Cockpit”
Our Camera Corps business created a multi 
mini-camera rig for ITN’s recent three-part 
documentary “Easyjet: Inside the Cockpit”. 
The mini-rig captured broadcast quality 
footage, day and night, of multiple flights 
over a three month period, running for up to 
five hours from its own airline-safe Anton/
Bauer batteries. Camera Corps provided 
training and support for the duration of 
filming. “ITV was sold on the fact that we 
were offering this view of the pilots we 
haven’t seen before,” ITN Productions’ Will 
Smith commented to ‘Broadcast’ magazine.
“When I’m thinking about investing in a 
teleprompting system, I ask three questions: 
1) is it legally compliant with the FCC’s 
regulations, 2) is it reliable, and 3) does it 
function so that the talent can easily see what 
they’re doing without being distracted from 
controlling it? For me, Autoscript achieves all 
three flawlessly.”
Dan Stark, Chief Engineer of NBC station KTVH
“This level of versatility in a tripod’s design 
(Flowtech) is going to disrupt the industry.”

23 Operational Review
Improving the core
The main strategic focus in our Production Solutions Division 
remains to “improve the core” and we have a clear plan to drive 
operational efficiencies and further enhance margins through 
continued improvements to purchasing, inventory management, 
manufacturing and leveraging synergies. 
Our strategy in this Division has been to rationalise all in-house 
manufacturing into two sites - Bury St. Edmunds, UK and Cartago, 
Costa Rica. The UK is our Centre of Excellence for high-end robotics 
and our Flowtech tripods, while Costa Rica focuses on video heads, 
tripods and batteries.
We seek year-on-year productivity improvements across all of our sites.
New manufacturing facility in Bury 
St. Edmunds, UK 
In H1 2018 our Production Solutions Division’s UK 
manufacturing operations will move to a new, purpose-built 
site nearby in Bury St. Edmunds. Replacing the 50-year old 
existing factory, the new facility will specialise in advanced 
technology in areas such as robotics, automation and 
broadcast studio equipment for our Vinten and Sachtler 
brands. It will include a fully automated, highly efficient  
and proprietary process for the development of carbon 
fibre for the Flowtech tripod, which maintains our product 
differentiation and competitive edge. Vitec has invested 
significantly in the new, 66,000 ft
2
 site which will house 
around 180 people across manufacturing, engineering, 
operations and other functions, and will produce 
approximately 20,000 units annually. Our focus on 
continuous improvement has led to productivity, work  
flow and space utilisation improvements, and resulted  
in the new site having a smaller footprint. 
Continuous improvement in 
Cartago, Costa Rica
Vitec has been manufacturing in Costa Rica since 1985 
and has 180 employees producing 50,000 products 
annually, including heads, tripods and camera accessories 
for our Vinten, Sachtler, OConnor and Anton/Bauer brands. 
In Costa Rica, the locally developed operations system  
is based upon lean tools and techniques to improve 
productivity and reduce inventory levels, and the factory 
has achieved overall productivity improvements of  
6% year-on-year since 2014. The recent Sachtler Ace 
assembly line process improvement resulted in a 35% 
productivity improvement and a 40% reduction in space 
used. We are in the process of moving our manufacturing 
operations from Shelton, US to Costa Rica.

24 Growth in 
APAC
Our Production Solutions 
Division has strategic plans 
to grow further in APAC, 
particularly in India, China 
and South Korea. We will 
leverage the Group’s  
current distribution  
footprint and capabilities 
where appropriate.
OConnor
The film industry in China is growing and in 2017 big 
budget films such as “Wolf Warrior II” saw significant  
commercial success and it is the highest grossing  
Chinese film ever released. The government approval 
needed to produce a film has been decentralised, and  
this, coupled with a growing middle class, has provided 
conditions for growth.
As a result, many brands, like Vitec’s OConnor, who makes 
heads and tripods for high end films and dramas, are 
seeing growth in China. 
OConnor’s unparalleled fluid head performance makes it 
the number one choice for the leading cinematographers 
on most feature films and high end dramas around the 
world. In China, OConnor revenue in 2017 doubled, making 
it now the biggest single market for OConnor products.  
This high level is expected to continue in the medium-term.

SmallHD, Wooden Camera, Paralinx, 
Offhollywood and RTMotion.  
Operational Review
Creative Solutions further expanded its offering  
of higher technology products to the Independent 
Content Creator segment in 2017. This market  
has shown continued strong growth with drivers 
including the proliferation of online platforms such 
as Netflix which have generated a need for original 
content. Revenue for 2017 was £63.2 million,  
an increase of 37.7% on the prior year. At constant 
exchange rates, and after excluding the impact 
from acquisitions including the 2016 acquisition  
of Wooden Camera, revenue grew by 20.0%. 
We have continued to invest in new product 
development in line with the changing nature  
of the image capture and sharing market. New 
products launched in the year include HEVC 
encoders, daylight viewable on-camera monitors 
and Serv Pro, a dedicated iOS monitoring solution. 
Our businesses have also worked together during 
the year to develop new products, including a 
SmallHD monitor with built-in Teradek Bolt wireless 
receiver, a SmallHD Focus monitor with an Anton/
Bauer battery for DSLR cameras, and a Manfrotto/
Wooden Camera Directors Cage for DSLR and 
mirrorless cameras. 
Our higher technology offering was further 
enhanced by the acquisition of RTMotion in 
September 2017. This complements our existing 
activities and provides the Division with additional 
high quality camera accessories for the expanding 
Independent Content Creator market. The business 
has been integrated into Teradek and is performing 
in line with expectations. 
Creative Solutions now has “Customer Experience 
Centres” in Los Angeles and Irvine, California and 
in Brooklyn, New York where our knowledgeable 
sales people demonstrate and sell our latest 
products across the brands. These centres help us 
to refine our products to improve user experience,

The V itec Group plc          
26 Given the similar target audience served by Teradek, SmallHD, Wooden 
Camera, Offhollywood and RTMotion, we have created a separate division 
for these businesses. This will also enable us to leverage the Division’s 
market knowledge and products focused on this market, to further grow, 
both organically and through acquisition, in adjacent areas.
We have a strong leadership team in Creative Solutions, led by the original 
founders and entrepreneurs, and supported by key operational roles.  
We are further building the team and developing a common culture across 
the Division for product design, channel strategy, promotional activities and 
operational processes, whilst retaining the entrepreneurial focus, which  
is one of the key strengths for the Division’s end user.
Corporate development
Vitec’s Creative Solutions Division comprises 
five entrepreneurial companies which mainly 
serve the rapidly growing Independent 
Content Creator market with higher 
technology products. This market is growing 
well, driven by the sharp rise in original 
content creation (e.g. scripted television 
shows and web-streaming) viewed on 
platforms such as Amazon, Netflix, HBO, BBC, 
Sky, Facebook, YouTube and Livestream.

27 Operational Review
“The SmallHD FOCUS is a great 
monitor that is bright enough for  
all conditions and super easy to 
use. It pairs beautifully with any 
camera setup I have and it’s so 
lightweight you can hardly feel the 
difference when you’ve mounted  
it on your camera setup.  
It is always in my gear bag.”
Zach Lower, DIT/Director of Photography
“As a Steadicam Operator with over 
20 years experience, I’m always  
on the lookout for reliable daylight 
viewable monitors. The SmallHD 
703 Ultra Bright is an amazingly 
lightweight, durable monitor with 
enough horse power to be seen in 
the harshest of daylight conditions.”
Alec Jarnagin, SOC, Director of Photography
“If we’re filming in a room with tight 
spaces, instead of the director 
coming into the room and 
interfering, he could just watch from 
his phone outside. We wouldn’t be 
able to do that without Teradek’s 
Serv Pros. The freedom they give us 
means we’re always ready to shoot, 
and for a documentary on student 
athletes for Netflix, capturing in the 
moment is what we’re all about.”
Terry Zumalt, Director of Photography
“The Bolt 3000 allows me to have 
cable free monitoring on all my shots 
that often could not be viewed via  
a traditional cable connection because 
of camera set up. It also gives me 
freedom of movement to move around 
the set or location and view images 
privately, giving me the head space  
I need to create the shot.”
Brett Danton, Director
“From a rental house perspective, 
Wooden Camera always finds a way 
to make our lives easier by creating 
intelligent and durable products that 
seamlessly integrate with every 
camera system we have in our 
inventory. They hold up to the use  
that equipment in a rental house  
is subjected to and consistently  
meet the needs of camera  
assistants working in the field.”
Mario Deas, President Mar Media  
Digital Cinema Rentals
New markets and  
technologies
Cheaper production tools have enabled a much larger population of video 
creators to emerge and our strategy is to capitalise on this exciting market  
by maintaining and expanding our current market leadership by innovating 
quickly and creating high quality products with regular upgrades.  
Our emphasis is on product design, quality and customer experience.
We are also developing product synergies between Vitec brands, for example,  
a SmallHD ultra-bright monitor with a T eradek Bolt wireless receiver, a SmallHD Focus 
monitor with an Anton/Bauer battery for DSLR cameras, and a Manfrotto/Wooden 
Camera Director’ s Cage for DSLR and mirrorless cameras.
We are focused on acquisition opportunities in adjacent markets and with new products 
to address new areas of the content production value chain.
Teradek
Teradek launched several products  
in 2017, including new Cube HEVC 
encoders with the next generation 
video compression technology, and 
Serv Pro, their first dedicated iOS 
monitoring solution that allows 
directors and producers to watch 
what is being shot in real-time on 
their iPhones and iPads.
Teradek also launched Live:Air Action, 
a video production application for iOS 
that allows users to stream 
professional looking live video to 
Facebook, YouTube, Twitch, and more. 
Lastly, Teradek released the Bond 
Backpack, a completely new bonded 
cellular streaming solution for 
network broadcasters that combines 
cutting edge HEVC video compression 
with Teradek’s own Node LTE 
modems, all packed in an ergonomic, 
lightweight pack. 
SmallHD Monitors
SmallHD launched a range of new 
products during 2017, including  
the Ultra Bright Monitors in both 5 
and 7-inch formats. These daylight 
viewable monitors are classed as  
the brightest and most fully-featured 
on-camera monitors in the world, 
while maintaining low power 
consumption.
Early in 2018, SmallHD also launched 
its first touchscreen, high-definition 
video monitor for use with small,  
low profile cameras like DSLRs and 
mirrorless. The 5-inch FOCUS is  
an out-of-the-box monitor for under 
$500 and has received critical 
acclaim for its daylight-viewable 
display and outdoor brightness.  
It is lightweight, has an Anton/Bauer 
centre-mounted battery and attaches 
securely atop the camera with the 
included Tilt Arm.
This year, SmallHD and Teradek 
joined forces to create a wireless 
monitoring device for directors.  
The 703 Bolt is equipped with a 
SmallHD monitor, a Teradek Bolt 
built-in wireless receiver and an 
Anton/Bauer battery, as well as 
cutting-edge software tools.
Wooden Camera 
Accessories
Wooden Camera also launched a 
series of new accessories. Major  
new products included a Directors’ 
Monitor Cage, Universal Follow Focus 
and a manual Follow Focus.
Wooden Camera and Manfrotto joined 
forces in a cross-Group project to 
develop a series of Camera Cages  
for customers who shoot video with 
mirrorless and DSLR cameras. The 
cages are available in small, medium 
and larger options and are compatible 
with Sony, Panasonic, Canon, Nikon 
and Olympus cameras. Developed  
by Wooden Camera, and compatible 
with all of their accessories, the  
Cage sits on all Manfrotto video 
tripods. Solid and well-constructed, 
the minimalist design and lightweight 
structure is branded Manfrotto and 
sold globally via our extensive  
Vitec Imaging distribution and 
e-commerce network.

The V itec Group plc           “The team at CSLA helps 
me stay in step with the 
latest technology and is a 
great place to network 
with other members of 
the industry.”
John Tanzer, Director of 
Photography
“I can always count on 
CSNY to have the latest 
and greatest in stock and 
I love the white glove 
service and cutting  
edge info.”
Charlie Anderson, DIT/Director

Getting 
closer to our 
customers
We have begun to develop our 
Creative Solutions Division as a 
customer-facing brand, tying our 
many brands together to develop  
a “curated, branded customer 
experience” in order to get closer 
to our customers.
We currently have two stores in California and one in 
New York and over the next few years are looking to 
expand the reach of these “Customer Experience 
Centres” both physically and online.
There are opportunities to develop synergies across 
the customer-facing aspects of the Creative Solutions 
Division. New centres and online stores will be 
carefully designed and branded to offer product 
displays and a consistent experience. Our sales people 
will be knowledgeable, well trained and certified, and 
will assist with bundling Vitec products. We will offer 
global support for all of our products from any location 
and regular educational workshops with presentations 
from third parties as well as Vitec brands.

Our three Divisions create value by:
Understanding customer needs
Our Divisions continually obtain feedback on market trends, competitors and 
their products from customers as well as from research. As we are market 
leaders, this enables us to remain close to our customers, anticipating and 
responding to developments to ensure that our brands remain at the forefront 
of the industry, renowned for their premium offerings.
Focused new product development and market  
leading brands
Our experienced, specialist engineers apply new technologies, products and 
materials to develop high quality, high performance solutions. Our innovative 
products are protected by patents and trademarks and marketed under our 
world renowned brands. We produce the majority of our products in-house 
and work with selected, market leading partners for specialist solutions.  
We supplement in-house developments with carefully selected acquisitions  
in new markets and technologies.
Efficient supply chain 
We procure materials from reputable suppliers and produce our products  
in efficient and environmentally friendly operations and, where appropriate, 
manufacture or source from lower cost countries such as Costa Rica and 
China. The majority of our operations are relatively low-volume, small-batch 
processes and our continuous improvement culture enables us to drive 
productivity in our core businesses.
Global distribution 
We market our products and services through our own sales and marketing 
teams. The majority of our sales are conducted via a global network of 
distributors, dealers and retailers who sell on to customers. We are expanding 
our e-commerce capabilities through working closely with our customers  
to develop our online presence and have a particular focus on expanding  
in APAC. The breadth of products and our strong brand heritage means  
that our network of channel partners is unrivalled in the markets we serve.  
We also engage with a number of leading logistics partners to ensure 
responsive and timely delivery of our products to the relevant geography.
Vitec designs, manufactures and distributes high quality, high 
performance, premium branded products and services in the 
growing “image capture and sharing” market. Our business 
model is focused on achieving five main strategic priorities.

At the Group level we create value by:
Strategy
The Board and Operations Executive set Group and Divisional strategy, 
focusing on markets served, customer segments and products supplied.
Budgeting and monitoring
Vitec sets Group and Divisional budgets annually and regularly reviews  
Group and Divisional performance during the year. This includes regular 
forecasts to ensure that the financial performance is clearly understood  
and appropriate targets are set.
Investor relations
We communicate our strategy, performance, outlook and governance with  
our investors on a regular basis.
Treasury and tax
Vitec manages its financing, hedging and tax planning activities centrally to 
ensure that the Group has an appropriate structure and funding to support  
its geographically diverse business.
Acquisitions and disposals
We buy businesses that provide a good return with clear synergies such as 
extending our technological, product or geographic footprint. We dispose of 
those businesses that do not fit strategically or do not offer scope to deliver 
attractive returns.
Governance
Vitec ensures that an effective Group wide governance framework and policies 
are in place to ensure a strong culture of governance and ethical behaviour. 
Risk management
We set an overall framework for reviewing and assessing risk and taking 
mitigating actions as part of the execution of our strategy. 
Health and safety
Vitec sets policies to ensure a healthy, safe and productive work environment 
for all our employees, and ensures they are complied with.
Talent management
We work across the Group to ensure that we have consistent policies, 
processes and initiatives for acquiring, engaging and retaining our best talent.

Our focus Strategic Priorities
We leveraged our premium brands and strong market 
positions to continue to improve and strengthen our 
traditional business. We focused on developing  
innovative products and solutions while maximising 
operational efficiencies.
We invested resources into faster growing markets and 
technologies to underpin future growth, launching 
products for independent content creators, filmmakers 
and enterprises.
Vitec has strong relationships with its customers and end 
users. We continue to enhance our distribution channels  
and collaborate with key market players to form more  
durable and strategic relationships that are less susceptible 
to commoditisation. Direct e-commerce is an important 
growth driver for our Imaging Solutions Division.
Geographical expansion is another key focus, especially  
in APAC, which we believe is a particularly attractive 
medium-term growth market with good opportunities.
We continue to supplement organic growth with carefully 
targeted acquisitions. We have a strong track record in making 
and integrating acquisitions and we will continue to look for 
opportunities that meet our criteria for financial returns and 
strategic fit. Our people are our most important asset and  
we aim to recruit suitable talent to support the business.

 Strategic Report
 Corporate Responsibility
 Corporate Governance
 Financial Statements Principal risks and uncertainties 
Specific Risk Mitigation
Demand for Vitec’s products
Demand for our products may be adversely affected by many factors, including changes  
in customer and consumer preferences and our ability to deliver appropriate products or to 
support changes in technology. The Group increasingly produces and sells products that are 
more technologically advanced, including encoders, transmitters and on-camera monitors. 
These products have a shorter life cycle than our historical products, and continuous 
investment in new product development is needed to keep up with the changing demand. 
Demand may also be impacted by competitor activity, particularly from low-cost countries.
We value our relationships with our customers and to mitigate this risk we monitor closely our 
target markets and user requirements. We maintain good relationships with our key customers 
and make significant investments in product development and marketing activities to ensure 
that we remain competitive in these markets. In support of our new product launches, we have 
completed appropriate market analyses before developing new products to ensure that they are 
appropriately designed for our target markets. We monitor closely the demand for new products 
and phase out old product lines. We are actively pursuing growth in selected emerging markets.
New markets and channels of distribution
As we enter new markets and channels of distribution we may achieve lower than  
anticipated trading volumes and pricing levels or higher costs and resource requirements.  
This may impact the levels of profitability and cash flows delivered. 
We continue to increase our online presence and our investment in new innovative products 
which address the needs of independent content creators. We are also increasing our presence 
and investment in APAC. 
To mitigate these risks, we have a thorough process for assessing and planning the entry into 
new markets and related opportunities. This includes marketing and advertising strategies for 
our products and services. We continuously assess our performance and the related 
opportunities and risks in these markets. We adapt our approach taking into account our actual 
and anticipated performance. We review our channels of distribution to make sure that they 
remain appropriate. Our increased online presence creates IT security and compliance 
challenges which the Group is continually addressing. 
Acquisitions
In pursuing our business strategy we continuously explore opportunities to enhance our 
business through development activities such as strategic acquisitions. This involves a number 
of calculated risks including: acquiring desired businesses on economically acceptable terms; 
integrating new businesses, employees, business systems and technology; and realising 
satisfactory post-acquisition performance. In 2017, we acquired the JOBY and Lowepro brands, 
and RTMotion. These acquisitions are performing to plan. 
We mitigate these risks by having a clear acquisition strategy with a robust valuation model. 
Thorough due diligence processes are completed including the use of external advisers where 
appropriate. The post-acquisition performance of each business is closely monitored and a plan 
is developed to integrate the acquired businesses in an effective way.  
Pricing pressure
Vitec provides premium branded products and faces a number of competitors.  
The strength of this competition varies by product and geographical market. 
We continue to face price pressure from new market entrants, which we are responding to 
through the launch of new competitive product ranges. We continually review our production 
activities for cost saving opportunities. We have also faced issues relating to parallel trades / 
price arbitrage particularly in our Imaging Solutions business which led us to enforce  
“Minimum Advertised Price” where this is permitted. 
Price competition from Chinese low-cost producers is becoming stronger in some of the more 
technologically advanced segments, particularly in respect of wireless transmitters. 
To mitigate this risk, we ensure that our product and service offering remains competitive by 
investing in new product development and in appropriate marketing and product support,  
and by improving the management of supply chain costs. This, and working closely with our 
suppliers and managing our expenses and cost base appropriately, allows us to support price 
increases when required. We are rationalising our product range to reduce complexity which 
will also allow us to achieve some cost savings on production. Most of our products and 
services have a premium or niche differentiation which commands a price point that is higher 
than that of the competition. With the recent currency fluctuations, we continue to monitor  
our pricing across the main currencies.  
Dependence on key suppliers
We source materials and components from many suppliers in various locations and in  
some instances are more dependent on a limited number of suppliers for particular items.  
If any of these suppliers or subcontractors fail to meet the Group’s requirements, we may not 
have readily available alternatives, thereby impacting our ability to provide an appropriate level 
of customer service. Our overall dependence on key suppliers has increased as a result of  
the Group’s decision to reduce its costs by outsourcing some manufacturing and assembly 
activities. For several of our products we are heavily dependent on a specific supplier for the 
provision of core elements of the products; such vendors may decide to compete with Vitec. 
The recent acquisition of JOBY and Lowepro has further increased the dependence on  
external sourcing.  
To address this risk we aim to secure multiple sources of supply for all materials and 
components and develop strong relationships with our major suppliers. We review the 
performance of strategically important suppliers and outsourced providers globally on  
an ongoing basis. Where economical we look to source materials closer to the  
manufacturing facilities to reduce lead times and improve control over the supply chain.
Increased risk
Constant risk
Decreased risk
Change in risk profile 
during 2017
Vitec is exposed to a number of risk factors which may 
affect its performance. The Group has a well-established 
framework for reviewing and assessing these risks on a 
regular basis, and has put in place appropriate processes 
and procedures to mitigate against them. However, no 
system of control or mitigation can completely eliminate  
all risks. The Board has determined that the following are 
the principal risks facing the Group.
34
The V itec Group plc           Specific Risk Mitigation
Dependence on key customers
While the Group has a wide customer base, the loss of a key customer, or a significant 
worsening in their success or financial performance, could result in a material impact on the 
Group’s results. Vitec’s largest customer accounted for 11.9% of revenue from continuing 
operations which is marginally higher than in previous years. The business also works with  
a variety of customers on large sporting events and the extent of these activities varies 
year-on-year.
We mitigate this risk by monitoring closely our performance with all customers through 
developing strong relationships, and we monitor the financial performance of our key 
customers. We continue to expand our customer base including entering into new channels  
of distribution to expand our portfolio of customers.
People
We employ around 1,700 people and are exposed to a risk of being unable to retain or  
recruit suitable diverse talent to support the business. We manufacture and supply products 
from a number of locations and it is important that our people operate in a professional and 
safe environment. 
We recognise that it is important to motivate and retain capable people across our businesses 
to ensure we are not exposed to risk of unplanned employee turnover. We fairly reward our 
people and have appropriate recruitment, appraisal, talent management and succession 
planning strategies to ensure we recruit and retain good quality people and leadership across 
the business. We take our employees’ health and safety very seriously and have appropriate 
processes in place to allow us to monitor and address any issues appropriately.
Laws and regulations
We are subject to a comprehensive range of legal obligations in all countries in which we 
operate. As a result, we are exposed to many forms of legal risk. These include, without 
limitation, regulations relating to government contracting rules, taxation, data protection regimes, 
anti-bribery provisions, competition, and health and safety laws in numerous jurisdictions around 
the world. Failure to comply with such laws could significantly impact the Group’s reputation and 
could expose the Group to fines and penalties. We may also incur additional cost from any legal 
action that is required to protect our intellectual property.  
Recent political developments in the US and Europe may have implications for several areas  
of regulations including but not limited to: the customs and import tariffs our businesses  
will be subject to; corporation tax rates; employment laws and regulations; and other  
business regulation.
More specifically, the UK’s exit from the European Union may have a significant impact on rates 
of duties and other taxes applied to our UK entities’ exports and imports, which would have a 
material effect on the Group’s results. There may be other legal, regulatory and commercial 
ramifications, the likely impact of which are difficult to measure given the uncertainties 
surrounding the outcome of the current negotiations between the UK Government and the EU. 
We address this risk by having resources dedicated to legal and regulatory compliance 
supported by external advice where necessary. We monitor and respond to developments in  
the regulatory environment in which our companies operate, including the effect of tax changes. 
We enhance our controls, processes and employee knowledge to maintain good governance 
and to comply with laws and regulations. The Group has processes in place, including senior 
management training, to ensure that its worldwide business units understand and apply the 
Group’s culture and processes to their own operations. We actively protect our intellectual 
property, and will legally pursue any party that infringes our intellectual property rights.  
With regards to Brexit, we have established an executive-led steering group to develop 
contingency plans whilst closely monitoring developments in the negotiations between the  
UK Government and the EU. 
Reputation of the Vitec Group 
Damage to our reputation and our brand names can arise from a range of events such as  
poor product performance, unsatisfactory customer service, and other events either within or 
outside our control. 
We manage this risk by recognising the importance of our reputation and attempting to identify 
any potential issues quickly and address them appropriately. We recognise the importance of 
providing high quality products, good customer service and managing our business in a safe 
and professional manner. This requires all employees to commit to, and comply with, the Code 
of Conduct.
Exchange rates 
The global nature of the Group’s business means it is exposed to volatility in currency  
exchange rates in respect of foreign currency denominated transactions, and the translation of 
net assets and income statements of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments. 
The Group is exposed to a number of foreign currencies, the most significant being the US 
Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen. The uncertain outcome of Brexit negotiations may increase 
Sterling’s volatility in the next few years, which in turn may a material impact on the Group’s 
translated results.
We regularly review and assess our exposure to changes in exchange rates. We reduce the 
impact of sudden movements in exchange rates with the use of appropriate hedging activities 
on forecast foreign exchange net exposures. We do not hedge the translation effect of exchange 
rate movements on the Income Statement or Balance Sheet of overseas subsidiaries.  
However, the Group does finance overseas investments partly through the use of foreign 
currency borrowings in order to provide a net investment hedge over the foreign currency  
risk that arises on translation of its foreign currency subsidiaries.
Business continuity 
There are risks relating to business continuity resulting from specific events such as  
natural disasters including earthquakes, floods or fires. These may impact our manufacturing 
plants or supply chain, particularly where these account for a significant amount of our trading 
activity. We are also dependent on our IT platforms continuing to work effectively in supporting 
our business and therefore there is a cyber security risk for the Group.
We address this risk with Business Continuity Plans and Disaster Recovery Plans at our key 
sites, and by carrying out periodic IT and cyber security vulnerability assessments. We have 
global insurance schemes in place which provide cover for business interruption. We review 
coverage annually to determine whether adjustments are needed. 
Effectiveness and impact of restructuring projects 
In 2015/16 we conducted a number of restructuring projects to streamline the business,  
and to deliver cost savings. There is a risk that the restructuring activity could have been  
poorly executed and that the objectives might not be achieved. The main restructuring projects 
are now substantially complete, and have already started to generate year-on-year savings.  
We have also sold our Bury St. Edmunds site and will move these activities to a lean,  
modern manufacturing facility in H1 2018.  
To address this risk, projects were monitored closely by senior operational management with 
regular updates provided to the Board. We anticipate that there will be significant year-on-year 
savings. In addition, we continually aim to identify and implement operational synergies between 
the different business units.

Group Finance Director  
Kath Kearney-Croft reviews performance
Revenue from continuing operations increased by 
10.8% to £353.3 million (2016: £318.9 million) and 
adjusted operating profit* from continuing operations 
was 9.2% higher at £45.2 million (2016: £41.4 
million). At constant exchange rates, revenue from 
continuing operations was 6.4% higher and adjusted 
operating profit* from continuing operations was in 
line with the prior year. Lower broadcast activity in  
the more mature US studio markets, higher corporate 
costs and non-repeat of the 2016 Olympics were 
offset by acquisitions and growth in sales of higher 
technology and photographic products. 
Imaging Solutions’ revenue grew by 16.2% to 
£175.9 million and adjusted operating profit* 
increased by 18.7% to £29.9 million. Revenue 
growth included a £12.6 million benefit from the 
acquisition of JOBY and Lowepro and £6.6 million 
from foreign exchange. At constant exchange rates 
and excluding the impact of the acquisition, revenue 
increased by 3.3% and adjusted operating profit* 
grew by 10.4% driven by higher sales of video and 
photo supports, as well as favourable channel mix 
and production efficiencies. 
Production Solutions’ revenue from continuing 
operations declined by 6.1% to £114.2 million and 
adjusted operating profit* from continuing operations 
declined by 6.7% to £15.2 million. This was partly 
due to non-repeat of the Olympics, and the 
spectrum “repack” in the US which led to our key 
broadcast customers focusing their expenditure  
on transmission rather than studios. At constant 
exchange rates revenue from continuing operations 
fell by 9.6% and adjusted operating profit* from 
continuing operations was 21.1% lower than  
the prior year. 
Revenue in the Creative Solutions Division increased 
by 37.7% to £63.2 million, driven by continued 
strong growth in the Independent Content Creator 
market, a particularly strong performance for 
SmallHD and the acquisition of Wooden Camera in 
2016. Adjusted operating profit* increased by 36.8% 
to £13.0 million. At constant exchange rates revenue 
increased by 31.9% and adjusted operating profit* 
grew by 31.3%. 
Adjusted Group gross margin* from continuing 
operations at 44.3% was higher than the prior  
year (2016: 42.6%) reflecting growth in higher 
technology sales and favourable sales mix. 
Adjusted operating expenses* from continuing 
operations were £16.8 million higher than 2016  
at £111.3 million. This mainly reflects investments  
in our Creative Solutions and Imaging Solutions 
businesses to drive sales and future growth, 
including higher investment in new product 
development at 4.6% of Group product sales from 
continuing operations (2016: 4.4% on continuing 
operations), and higher corporate costs. This also 
reflects an adverse currency impact of £3.5 million. 
This year corporate costs of £12.9 million have been 
reported separately rather than being allocated to 
the Divisions. 
Adjusted profit before tax* from continuing operations 
of £42.4 million was £5.0 million higher than the prior 
year (2016: £37.4 million). There was a net foreign 
exchange benefit versus 2016 of £3.4 million on our 
adjusted profit before tax* from continuing operations 
mainly due to a stronger Euro and US Dollar. 
Adjusted earnings per share* from total operations 
increased by 11.1% to 68.1 pence per share (2016: 
61.3 pence per share).

The V itec Group plc           Statutory profit before tax of £27.4 million (2016: £26.4 million) was after £15.0 
million charges associated with acquisition of businesses (2016: £7.6 million) 
and £nil restructuring costs (2016: £3.4 million).
Free cash flow* of £23.5 million (2016: £44.6 million) includes a working capital 
outflow of £9.4 million (2016: £12.0 million inflow). This reflects the anticipated 
investment in working capital following the acquisition of JOBY and Lowepro,  
as we have started to transition these businesses from a third party distributor 
model to using Vitec’s own distribution business. Excluding the impact from  
this acquisition, working capital would have reduced. The significant reduction  
in working capital in 2016 was driven by the business right-sizing its inventory 
which, as expected, was not repeated this year. 2016 free cash flow also 
included £3.9 million from the sale of the Bury St. Edmunds manufacturing  
site as well as the benefit of the Olympics. 
Net debt at 31 December 2017 was £42.9 million (31 December 2016: £75.1 
million). The decrease in net debt resulting from cash flows was £29.0 million 
(2016: £12.8 million). This was after: £12.4 million cash outflow on acquisitions 
being made up of net payments of £10.8 million relating to the acquisitions  
of the JOBY and Lowepro brands and RTMotion and a £1.6 million earnout 
payment on Wooden Camera in respect of their strong 2016 performance,  
a net cash inflow on disposals of £32.4 million arising from the disposals  
of Bexel and Haigh-Farr (£32.6 million) partly offset by £0.2 million of rent 
payments relating to the prior disposal of IMT, £12.4 million of dividend 
payments (2016: £11.1 million), and a net favourable foreign exchange impact  
of £3.2 million principally driven by US Dollar denominated debt. Vitec repaid its 
$50 million private placement facility in full in the year, funded by the Revolving 
Credit Facility. The Group’s balance sheet remains strong with a year-end net 
debt to adjusted EBITDA* ratio of 0.7 times (31 December 2016: 1.2 times).  
Adjusted operating profit* for total operations in 2017 was £3.3 million higher 
than the prior year. This reflects an increase in adjusted gross profit* of £5.5 
million, favourable foreign exchange impact of £3.8 million and a £3.3 million 
contribution from acquisitions. This was partly offset by investment in operating 
expenses of £8.8 million to drive sales and future growth in our higher 
technology and photographic businesses as well as higher corporate costs linked 
to our strong financial performance, and £0.5 million lower adjusted operating 
profit* from discontinued operations. The statutory operating profit for continuing 
operations of £30.2 million was £0.2 million lower than prior year.   
 
Management’s estimate of these drivers is summarised in the following table: 
Net financial expense 
Net financial expense of £2.8 million was lower than the prior year (2016: 
£4.0 million) mainly due to lower overall debt levels, the benefit from repaying 
the $50 million private placement in May 2017 and lower rates of interest on 
the debt facility that was put in place in July 2016. Interest payable was £2.6 
million (2016: £4.2 million) and was covered 23 times (2016: 14 times)  
by adjusted EBITDA*. 
Profit before tax 
Adjusted profit before tax* for total operations increased by £4.5 million to 
£42.0 million (2016: £37.5 million). Statutory profit before tax for continuing 
operations increased from £26.4 million to £27.4 million. 
Taxation 
The effective taxation rate on adjusted profit before tax* was 27% in 2017 
(2016: 27%). Vitec’s tax charge is higher than the UK statutory rate because 
the majority of our profits arise in overseas jurisdictions with higher tax rates 
than the UK. 
Earnings per share 
Adjusted earnings per share* for total operations was 68.1 pence per share 
(2016: 61.3 pence per share). Basic earnings per share for total operations 
was 61.4 pence per share (2016: 20.2 pence per share).

Acquisitions 
On 22 September 2017, the Group acquired the trade and certain assets 
(primarily comprising the JOBY and Lowepro brands) of the DayMen Group 
S.a.r.l. including 100% of the share capital of the subsidiary companies in 
Hong Kong and China (“JOBY and Lowepro”), through a business combination 
for a cash consideration of £8.4 million, expected integration and deal costs 
of £4.4 million and expected investment in working capital of £10.9 million. 
The fair value of the net assets acquired was £4.4 million resulting in  
goodwill of £4.0 million. 
JOBY and Lowepro products are designed and developed in Hong Kong  
and California respectively. JOBY’s patented GorillaPod has transformed the 
camera accessories market while Lowepro has been a market leader in bags 
designed to protect electronic and photographic devices since its inception  
in 1967. The acquisition is an excellent strategic fit with the Group’s existing 
core activities and gives the Group greater access to the fast growing 
iPhoneography and vlogging consumer accessories market.  
On 20 September 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital 
of RT Motion Systems Ltd (“RTMotion”), a private company based in the UK, 
for a cash consideration of £2.5 million (£1.9 million net of cash acquired). 
The fair value of the net assets acquired was £1.6 million resulting in goodwill 
of £0.9 million. Under the terms of the acquisition, there is a potential deferred 
payment of up to £1.2 million payable in cash. This is dependent on the 
achievement of non-financial targets, including integration milestones,  
being met over the period to 31 December 2019, and is not contingent 
consideration. In 2017 an amount of £0.2 million was provided for and 
charged to the Income Statement in relation to milestones met in 2017. 
RTMotion is a high technology business which provides wireless motor  
lens control systems for broadcast, cine and video cameras. The acquisition 
complements the Group’s existing activities in the expanding Independent 
Content Creator market and its products will be marketed through the Group’s 
global distribution network.   
Disposals 
On 9 May 2017, the Group sold Haigh-Farr Inc (“Haigh-Farr”), a defence 
antennas business based in the US, for a cash consideration of $15.8 million 
(£12.2 million), of which $0.8 million (£0.6 million) is deferred for twelve 
months from disposal date. A profit of £3.2 million arose on disposal after 
taking into account £0.5 million costs of disposal, £17.3 million net assets 
disposed and the previously recorded foreign exchange gain of £8.8 million 
that has been recycled to the Income Statement. 
On 1 August 2017, the Group sold Bexel for a net cash consideration of $32.1 
million (£24.3 million). A profit of £11.3 million arose on disposal after taking 
into account £2.8 million costs of disposal, £18.7 million net assets disposed 
and the previously recorded foreign exchange gain of £8.5 million that has 
been recycled to the Income Statement.  
Restructuring costs 
In 2017 the restructuring charge was £nil (2016: £5.2 million). The prior year 
charge relates to actions to streamline operations with lower growth prospects 
and was mostly made up of redundancy costs. 
Charges associated with acquisition of businesses
The 2017 charges relate to the Group’s acquisition activities and amortisation 
of previously acquired intangible assets.
The amortisation of acquired intangible assets for continuing operations  
of £7.4 million (2016: £5.8 million) relates to the JOBY and Lowepro brands 
and RTMotion acquisitions in 2017, and other businesses acquired by the  
Group since 2011.
Transaction costs of £1.3 million (2016: £0.6 million) and integration costs  
of £2.2 million (2016: £nil) were incurred in relation to acquisitions.
Earnout payments of £4.1 million were accrued during the year (2016: £1.2 
million). £3.9 million related to Wooden Camera on its strong performance  
in 2017 following its acquisition in the prior year and £0.2 million related  
to RTMotion following its acquisition in the current year.
Impairment of goodwill 
There was £nil impairment of goodwill in the year (2016: £12.1 million).
Cash flow and net debt 
Cash generated from operating activities for total operations was £48.7 
million (2016: £64.8 million). 
The Group uses a number of key performance indicators to manage cash 
including cash conversion
+
, the percentage of working capital to sales, 
inventory days, trade receivable days and trade payable days. Inventory, trade 
receivable and trade payable days are stated at year end balances; inventory 
and trade payable days are based on Q4 cost of sales (excluding exchange 
gains/losses) while trade receivable days are based on Q4 revenue. 
Cash conversion
+
 was 90% for 2017 (2016: 155%). This includes the impact 
of working capital investment following the acquisition of JOBY and Lowepro 
to move from a third party distributor model to using Vitec’s own distribution 
business. After excluding the impact of the JOBY and Lowepro acquisition, 
cash conversion was 119%. 
The working capital to sales metric was in line with prior year at 15.7% and 
overall working capital increased by £9.4 million (2016: £12.0 million 
decrease). 
Trade receivable days increased slightly to 45 days (2016: 43 days)  
and remain well controlled with a good ageing profile. 
On a cash flow basis, trade and other receivables increased by £5.6 million 
(2016: £4.5 million). The reported carrying value of trade receivables at year 
end of £52.5 million includes £1.5 million favourable foreign exchange 
compared to the prior year. 
On a cash flow basis, inventory increased by £9.9 million (2016: £11.2 million 
decrease). The reported carrying value of inventory at year end includes £2.5 
million favourable foreign exchange compared to the prior year. Inventory days 
increased to 106 days (2016: 83 days) partly driven by the buy-back of 
inventory in November 2017 relating to the acquisition of JOBY and Lowepro.   
 
38
The V itec Group plc           Trade payable days increased to 54 days (2016: 38 days). On a cash flow basis, 
there was a £6.1 million increase in trade and other payables (2016: £5.3 
million) including bonus and commission accruals and timing of payments.  
The reported carrying value of trade payables at year end of £35.1 million 
includes £0.1 million adverse foreign exchange compared to the prior year. 
Capital expenditure for total operations, including £4.3 million of software  
and capitalised development costs (2016: £3.4 million) totals £15.1 million 
(2016: £16.8 million). Overall capital expenditure was equivalent to 1.1  
times depreciation (2016: 0.9 times). 
We monitor Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”), calculated as adjusted 
operating profit* divided by average total assets less current liabilities 
excluding the current portion of interest-bearing borrowings. This has 
increased from 17.5% in 2016 to 19.6% in 2017 for total operations. 
The net tax paid in 2017 of £11.0 million was £3.8 million higher than  
the amount paid in 2016 due to the timing of tax payments. 
As a result free cash inflow* was £23.5 million (2016: £44.6 million).  
There was a £12.4 million net cash outflow relating to acquisitions during  
the year (2016: £20.3 million). 
There was a £32.4 million net cash inflow from disposals, which mainly 
related to the disposals of Haigh-Farr and Bexel during the year  
(2016: £1.5 million outflow). 
Dividends paid to shareholders totalled £12.4 million (2016: £11.1 million) 
and there was a net cash outflow in respect of shares purchased and issued 
of £2.1 million (2016: £1.1 million net inflow). The net cash inflow for the 
Group was £29.0 million (2016: £12.8 million) which, after £3.2 million 
favourable foreign exchange (2016: £11.6 million adverse), decreased  
net debt to £42.9 million (2016: £75.1 million).  
Treasury 
Vitec manages its financing, hedging and tax planning activities centrally  
to ensure that the Group has an appropriate structure to support its 
geographically diverse business. It has clearly defined policies and procedures 
with any substantial changes to the financial structure of the Group, or to its 
treasury practice, referred to the Board for approval. The Group operates strict 
controls over all treasury transactions including clearly defined currency 
hedging processes to reduce risks from volatility in exchange rates. 
The Group is hedging a portion of its forecast future foreign currency 
transactions to reduce the volatility from changes in exchange rates.  
Our main exposure relates to the US Dollar and the table below  
summarises the contracts held as at 31 December 2017:   
The Group does not hedge the translation of its foreign currency profits.  
A portion of the Group’s foreign currency net assets are hedged using  
the Group’s borrowing facilities.

Financing activities  
In July 2016, a five year £125.0 million committed multi-currency Revolving 
Credit Facility with five relationship banks was renegotiated. This is due to 
expire on 5 July 2021. At the end of December 2017, £53.4 million (2016: 
£48.9 million) of the facility was utilised. In May 2017 the Group repaid its 
US$50 million private placement facility in full.
The average cost of borrowing for the year which includes interest payable, 
commitment fees and amortisation of set-up charges was 3.2% (2016: 3.9%) 
reflecting an interest cost of £2.6 million (2016: £4.2 million). 
The Board has maintained an appropriate capital structure without exposing 
the Group to unnecessary levels of risk and Vitec has operated comfortably 
within its loan covenants during 2017.
Foreign exchange 
2017 adjusted operating profit* included a £3.8 million net favourable foreign 
exchange effect after hedging, mainly due to favourable £/m and £/$ rates 
when compared to 2016. Should exchange rates remain at current levels 
($1.40, m1.13), we would expect a headwind from foreign exchange in 2018 
in the order of £0.8 million.
Viability Statement
In accordance with the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors 
have assessed the viability of the Group over a three year period, taking 
account of the Group’s current financial and trading position as summarised  
in this Annual Report, the principal risks and uncertainties set out on pages  
34 and 35 and the three year Group and Divisional strategic plans which  
are reviewed annually by the Board. Based on this assessment, the Directors 
confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able  
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
from the date of this Annual Report to 31 December 2020. 
The Directors believe that a three year period is an appropriate period over 
which a reasonable expectation of the Group’s longer-term viability can be 
evaluated and is aligned with the Group’s business and strategic planning 
time horizon. It reflects the nature of the Group’s key markets, its investment 
profile, its businesses and products and its limited order visibility. Whilst the 
Directors have no reason to believe that the Group will not be viable over a 
longer period, they believe that the three year period presents readers of the 
Annual Report with a reasonable degree of confidence while still providing  
a longer-term perspective. 
The Group’s strategic and financial planning process reflects the Directors’ 
best estimate of the future prospects of the Group, but they have also 
considered the resilience of the Group across a number of severe but 
plausible scenarios, taking into account the principal risks facing the Group 
as detailed on pages 34 and 35, and the likely effectiveness of any mitigating 
actions. The Board reviews these risks in detail throughout the year, and the 
Audit Committee has a structured programme for the review of risks and 
mitigating actions. The following scenarios were applied to the most  
recent Strategic Plan which was reviewed by the Board in June 2017: 
• Loss of significant amounts of revenue and gross margin; 
• Additional working capital requirements; 
• Significant adverse movements in foreign exchange rates. 
The Directors’ assessment considered the potential impacts of these 
scenarios, both individually and in combination on the Group’s business 
model, future performance, solvency and liquidity over the period. The results 
of the sensitivity analysis which also included stress testing of the Strategic 
Plan, demonstrated that as a result of the Group’s strong cash generation  
it was able to maintain sufficient headroom within its net debt covenant  
to accommodate the above scenarios, both individually and in combination. 
This is supported by the fact that the Group sells a wide portfolio of different 
products, has a global distribution network, and has well-established 
relationships with its customers. 
Mitigation actions considered as part of this stress testing included further 
cost reductions, tight control of working capital, and reduction in non-essential 
capital expenditure. The Directors consider that under each of the scenarios, 
the mitigating actions would be effective and sufficient to ensure the 
continued viability of the Group. 
The Directors have also considered the Group’s capacity to remain viable 
after consideration of future cash flows, expected debt service requirements, 
undrawn facilities and access to capital markets. The primary element of 
the Group’s committed borrowing facilities is the £125.0 million five-year 
Revolving Credit Facility that expires in July 2021. As at 31 December 2017, 
the Group had utilised £53.4 million (43%) of the facility.
Dividend  
The Directors have recommended a final dividend of 20.1 pence per share 
amounting to £9.0 million (2016: 17.3 pence per share, amounting to  
£7.7 million). The final dividend, subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 
Annual General Meeting, will be paid on Friday 18 May 2018 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on Friday 20 April 2018. This will  
bring the total dividend for the year to 30.5 pence per share (up 12.1%).  
A dividend reinvestment alternative is available with details available from  
our registrars, Link Asset Services.

looks at how we do business, how we operate  
as an employer, a supplier to our customers,  
a partner to the communities that host us, as  
well as a supply chain manager. This strategy is 
reflected by our employees who understand the 
importance of the right values and behaviours 
when carrying out their roles at Vitec. Our 
employee Code of Conduct underpins our Business 
Model to ensure Vitec’s long-term success.
In early 2018 we refreshed and re-issued our 
Code of Conduct, as well as our Health and Safety 
and Diversity Policies – all critical aspects of the 
Company’s ethical approach to business. In 2017, 
we issued for the first time our Statement on the 
UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 which confirms  
our zero-tolerance approach to ensure our supply 
chain is free from slavery and human trafficking. 
In terms of our strategic approach to corporate 
responsibility, we look for opportunities to invest  
in projects where the power of images specifically, 
or the creative arts more generally, can be used  
to positively impact the communities and 
environment in which we operate.
In particular we aim to support those projects 
which enable the young or under-privileged to 
learn new skills to improve their own lives and 
forge their careers.
The Vitec Mindset 
We have a clear purpose that is supported by  
five values, namely:
   Enabling the capture and  
sharing of exceptional images
 >  Exceptional product 
performance 
We set the highest standards of  
technical performance
 >   Customer focus  
We are nothing without our 
customers 
 >  Leading a fast changing market 
We apply our creativity and 
harness our diversity to engineer 
innovative new products and 
solutions
 >  Global capability 
We share knowledge, pool 
resources, test ideas and learn 
from each other
 >  Transparency, integrity, 
respect 
We hold to the highest professional 
and corporate standards
In the past year, a number of key activities have 
taken place around Vitec which have demonstrated 
these values.
•  Our Imaging Solutions Division’s Picture of Life 
Programme offers disenfranchised young people 
the chance to learn professional photography 
skills. Now in its fourth year, we celebrated the 
programme’s achievements with a global 
exhibition tour that will continue into 2018.
•  Wooden Camera, part of our Creative Solutions 
Division, contributed specialist skills and 
equipment to the North Texas University  
film school. 
•  Our Production Solutions facility in Costa Rica 
was honoured with an Award for our export 
efforts which was presented by the President  
of Costa Rica.
•  All over the world our people have given their 
time and money for people in need – from 
earthquake victims, to the homeless,  
to blood donations.
You can read about these initiatives and more  
in the coming pages.

Ethics
Our vision
To ensure our employees 
have a clear understanding 
of what is expected of them 
in conducting business 
ethically, with a common 
set of values. We expect  
our business partners to  
act in a manner which 
aligns with our approach. 
Our approach
Vitec’s Code of Conduct 
sets out our values, beliefs 
and behaviours and has 
been communicated to  
all employees and  
business partners.  
We train our employees  
on business ethics.

Our management of corporate 
responsibility
The Board has overall responsibility for corporate 
responsibility. It considers and approves our  
key policies, including our Code of Conduct, 
Environmental Policy and Health and Safety Policy. 
These policies set a standard for all divisions and 
employees worldwide, are available on our 
website, and are central to our approach  
to corporate responsibility.
The Board has delegated the coordination of our 
corporate responsibility efforts to Stephen Bird  
and together with the Operations Executive and 
senior management, focuses his efforts on the 
areas outlined above. 
The Board and Operations Executive regularly 
consider the Group’s reputation and measure 
progress against our corporate responsibility 
objectives. Examples include: monthly health  
and safety performance reviews; whistleblowing 
reports; and regular training of employees 
ensuring the right corporate culture and  
good governance.
Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct (“Code”) forms the backbone 
of our culture, and provides clear guidance to our 
employees on how they are expected to behave 
towards colleagues, suppliers, customers, 
shareholders and on our wider responsibility  
to the communities within which we operate.
Our Code sets out our approach to business 
integrity including an express prohibition on 
bribery, kickbacks and political donations, along 
with guidance on gifts and hospitality, conflicts  
of interest, books and records, competition,  
share dealing, respect for the UN Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, compliance with 
anti-slavery legislation, respect for the individual  
and privacy, diversity, health and safety, 
environmental sustainability, business  
partners and charitable donations.
Our Code has been communicated to all employees, 
including new employees joining the Group, and is 
available on the company website translated into 
several languages. All newly acquired businesses 
receive the Code as part of their induction. In 2017, 
this included employees of the JOBY and Lowepro 
brands and RTMotion.
We require all senior management to undertake  
an online training module covering good corporate 
governance including issues such as share 
dealing, conflicts of interest, legal duties and  
other reputational issues. 
In early 2018 we re-launched the Code to all 
employees and partners to reflect new branding 
and values and to ensure it remains visible. 
Anti-bribery
We have continued with the development of our 
employees’ understanding of anti-bribery and 
corruption as reflected in our Code.
Agents and distributors have agreements in place 
which clearly prohibit bribery and set out our 
expectation on behaviour and values. We carry  
out due diligence on major customers and 
suppliers with a more detailed screening of 
backgrounds using a third party provider  
focusing on reputational risk. 
Modern slavery statement
In May 2017 we adopted our modern slavery  
and human trafficking statement, setting out  
our processes to ensure that this issue is not  
in existence in our operations or supply chain.  
The statement can be viewed on our website.
Whistleblowing service 
We operate an independent whistleblowing service 
in conjunction with EXPOLINK. This enables any 
employee or third party who feels that the normal 
reporting channels through line management  
are not appropriate, to confidentially report on  
any issues around alleged wrongdoing or other 
Code contraventions.
In accordance with a documented procedure,  
all reports are notified to the Group Company 
Secretary, the Group Chief Executive and the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, and are 
investigated independently by senior management 
who are not connected to the report. The outcome 
of investigations is reported to the Chairman of  
the Audit Committee and remedial action taken 
where necessary. 
This service is communicated to all employees 
with posters prominently visible at all sites, and  
a letter sent explaining the service to ensure that  
it remains visible and understood. The documents 
are also available on the Company website with all 
communications translated into several languages.

 Financial Statements Our people are a key asset  
for the Group
Our employees are the best in the sector, our 
greatest single asset and critical to our success. 
Passionate, motivated and skilled employees  
in safe working environments directly contribute  
to our strategy, performance and reputation.
In 2017, we continued to focus time and resources 
on engaging, motivating and developing our 
employees, executing initiatives designed to 
improve the working environment, increase 
diversity, expand skillsets, and ensure health  
and wellbeing.
The Group runs a decentralised approach to 
operational management ensuring the individual 
cultures and needs of the brands can be met at a 
Divisional level where managers are closest to the 
needs of the people and the business. Maintaining 
the entrepreneurial essence of our brands is 
central to our ethos and ongoing success. 
However, we believe that the value the Group can 
bring is in facilitating a culture of best practice, 
sharing and ensuring that policies and procedures 
are elevated to a high international standard. 
In October 2017, 60 senior leaders from the three 
Divisions and Head Office met in the UK to input 
into the Company’s strategic plan. Plenary and 
workshop sessions were held, where the 
Operations Executive shared the Group’s strategy 
and vision, and agreed with the team what 
success would look like. The group explored how 
Vitec was organised and what needed to change  
to optimise our performance. The attendees also 
refreshed the Group’s purpose and values, and 
agreed Divisional plans to implement the strategy, 
and communicate and engage all employees 
across the Group.
In October, we also held a Divisional HR 
Conference – sharing best practice, making sure 
there were robust processes in all Divisions,  
and agreed shared priorities for the coming year. 
Employee engagement 
We aim to provide our employees with an 
engaging and stimulating environment where  
they are encouraged to learn and develop.  
We communicate with our employees on a  
regular basis, keeping them informed of business 
performance at a Group and Divisional level. 
Reflecting the diverse global nature of our 
employees we use multiple channels and a  
variety of media to communicate. 
Business overviews, focusing on results and key 
events, are shared with all employees via global 
communication videos presented by the Group 
Chief Executive which are uploaded to the Group 
intranet, with translations available. 
Alongside Group-wide communications, employees 
receive briefings on performance and business 
issues on a regular basis from Divisional senior 
management. 
More informal communications also take place 
around the various divisions: breakfast with the 
CEO is an informal opportunity for employees in 
our Imaging Solutions Division to exchange ideas 
and express opinions on current business 
strategies; in our Production Solutions US office, 
“Time Out” is a monthly activity combining social 
time including quizzes and food with Vitec updates.
>>PHOTO OF THE TIME OUT IN THE US<<
A number of other initiatives to keep employees 
engaged in the workplace and provide a chance  
to relax with colleagues were undertaken at sites 
around the world. These included Thanksgiving 
and Christmas lunches, wellness fairs, on-site 
massages, meditation coaching, sporting classes 
and competitions, and cooking contests.
Health and Safety
The provision of a healthy, safe and productive 
work environment for all of our employees and  
third parties on our sites is a priority for Vitec,  
for which all of our management and employees 
are responsible. It is an important part of our 
culture to ensure that all our colleagues are  
able to work in a safe and secure environment. 
We promote the need for excellent health and 
safety procedures in compliance with the Group’s 
Health and Safety Policy, which is available on our 
website. This policy sets Group-wide guidelines  
for the prevention of accidents and work-related 
ill-health, and provides guidance for the adequate 
control of health and safety risks arising from 
work-related accidents. 
Employee 
Engagement
Our vision
To be the preferred 
employer for the very  
best people in our  
sector by providing  
an entrepreneurial 
environment that offers 
opportunities for our 
people to develop 
and thrive.
Our approach
To attract, retain and  
grow a talented workforce, 
providing equal 
opportunities for all,

The V itec Group plc           All accidents and near misses, whether they result 
in absence from work or not, are reported, with 
remedial action identified and implemented to 
prevent repeat occurrences. Reporting is prompt 
and any accident resulting in over three days’ 
absence is reported to senior management as  
well as the Group Chief Executive within 24 hours.
Our five-year accident record is shown below, and 
details the number of accidents resulting in over 
three days’ absence from work across the Group. 
There were seven such accidents in 2017 
compared to four in 2016. Each of these accidents 
has been fully investigated and key issues 
identified to try to ensure it is not repeated. 
There have been no work-related fatalities since 
the Group began collating health and safety 
statistics in 2002.
All major sites have Health and Safety Committees 
who hold regular meetings to review safety, ensure 
that operating practices are safe and address 
potential safety concerns. At the Imaging Solutions 
manufacturing sites in Feltre, Italy and Ashby-de-
la-Zouch, UK, daily observation procedures have 
been set up to observe employees’ health and 
safety behaviour in the workplace. In 2017, a total 
of 66,000 work actions were observed at both 
sites with an average of 99.9% compliance with 
safe working practices. 
The Production Solutions sites in Cartago, Costa 
Rica and Bury St. Edmunds, UK as well as the 
Imaging Solutions sites in Cassola and Feltre, Italy, 
have had their OHSAS 18001 occupational health 
and safety accreditations confirmed again for 
2017. Our sites in Cassola and Feltre in Italy 
continue to promote the “Are you working safely?” 
campaign which provides regular tips on health 
and safety. 
Health and Well-Being
The Company continues to prioritise the provision 
of healthy working environments for our staff.  
The new site at Bury St. Edmunds, UK, which  
is due to open in H1 2018, has been developed 
following a detailed consultation with staff.  
It provides upgraded facilities, including a new, 
open-plan office environment, on-site catering, 
which will form the hub of the site, access to car 
share and bike schemes to make travelling to  
work easier.
Various Vitec locations are now providing free  
or subsidised healthy eating facilities onsite,  
and workplace health and gym memberships.  
The Production Solutions business in Costa Rica 
supports the Vitec Runners – a group of 15 
employees who participated in ten fundraising 
running events in 2017. 
Benefits
We employ around 1,700 people in ten countries 
who are managed in accordance with local 
employment legislation, policies and our 
organisational values. Attracting the talent we need 
and retaining their commitment to our organisation 
in all of the territories where we operate, has 
required the organisation to adopt comprehensive 
benefits packages to support our employees and 
remain competitive in a global market where talent 
is in short supply.
Employees in the UK, Italy, US, Costa Rica, Japan, 
France, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Netherlands 
and Germany are given the opportunity to join  
an all-employee Sharesave scheme on an annual 
basis, enabling the employee to save to purchase 
shares in the Company at a discounted rate. 
Employees save a fixed monthly amount of up  
to £350 (or foreign currency equivalent in other 
territories) over a fixed term (usually three years 
but two years in the US) with the option to 
purchase a fixed number of shares at a discount  
of up to 20% on the prevailing share price at  
the time of the offer. In 2017, over 450 employees 
shared in the maturity of the 2014/2015 Sharesave 
Scheme making an average gain of £5 per share. 
As an all-employee share scheme, this rewards 
employees at all levels in the organisation.  
Over 600 employees currently participate in  
the Sharesave scheme across these territories.

 Financial Statements In the US, our employees participate in a 
consolidated Health Benefits Plan that provides  
a valued level of healthcare. Employees at the 
Cassola and Feltre sites in Italy benefit from the 
new Benefit Salute health care plan which has 
been promoted to provide an increasing number  
of services in line with our policies in terms of 
health, welfare and support of the individual 
employee. Similar plans are offered to  
employees in other territories. 
Employees are also given the option to join pension 
plans appropriate to local markets. In the UK this 
involves a Company approved pension plan with 
minimum employer and employee contributions, 
and in the US a 401k plan. Since April 2014 in  
the UK, all employees except for those who have 
expressly opted out, are auto-enrolled into a 
qualifying pension plan. 
Vitec offers a flexible work environment and is 
supportive of all employees enjoying a good work 
life balance. Flexible working policies are in place 
in most of our locations around the world, and a 
positive impact can be seen. For example, in our 
Production Solutions Division, recent changes 
introduced have meant several employees were 
able to reduce the time of their daily commute  
to work. Another aspect of creating a balance is  
an inclusive attitude towards employees’ family 
life. In Italy, Imaging Solutions hosted two Summer 
Camps for children of employees offering a range 
of sports and training activities. These camps 
proved popular with employees with school-aged 
children as they helped to make life a little easier 
for parents to continue working during the 
European summer holiday period. 
Training and development
Vitec aims to offer a comprehensive training and 
development programme, linked to performance 
reviews and development plans, for all employees. 
These are arranged at a Divisional level to ensure 
the needs of the relevant Division are met. In 
addition, in 2018 the Operations Executive will be 
reviewing its leadership and succession plans to 
ensure there is a structured approach to growing 
and developing the Company’s future leaders. 
All employees receive training on health and safety 
procedures that are appropriate to their line of 
work and environment. This may, for example, 
involve training in warehouse operations, working 
at heights, fire safety or more general initiatives  
to make employees aware of the dangers that  
can be encountered in the execution of their 
various duties. 
To meet our goal of linking the performance 
management system with training and 
development needs, our Imaging Solutions Division 
also set up the MyTalent Academy to offer both 
soft and technical skills for around 300 employees 
that was linked to training needs identified in the 
appraisal process. 
Much of Vitec’s strength lies in the expert 
knowledge of our people. It is vital that our 
employees understand, and are passionate about, 
our products and technologies. In 2017, Imaging 
Solutions ran the “Shoot and Share” training 
programme - offering camera craft and technical 
training on the Divisions’ products.
All Divisions within the Vitec Group continually 
review and expand training options for staff;  
for example in Costa Rica, Production Solutions 
offered over 500 training days in 2017. 
Employee volunteering 
We encourage a culture of active participation  
in the communities in which we operate and staff 
around the world give their time and money to 
various social programmes in their local 
communities. In 2017 both the Costa Rica and 
Shelton, US, teams within Production Solutions 
participated in the Red Cross Blood Drive, with 
over 65 staff opting to give blood on site during 
work hours at a time of severe shortages. In Costa 
Rica the team volunteered in a teenage community 
centre where Vitec participates annually in 
organising the Christmas lunch where gifts  
are donated by employees.
Diversity and inclusion 
Vitec has an equal opportunities culture with an 
express prohibition on discrimination of any kind.
The Board continues to monitor progress on 
equality and the Group Chief Executive is 
responsible for developing diversity throughout  
the Group. The organisation’s gender breakdown 
as at the end of 2017 was as follows:
 
We recognise the importance of diversity 
throughout our workforce and the human 
resources teams continue with efforts to attract 
women to Vitec and encourage them to apply  
for promotions. 
Vitec’s approach to diversity has always followed  
a strict policy of sourcing the best person for the 
role irrespective of race, gender, age, religion, 
sexual preference or disability. We are keen to 
develop further the recruitment of talented women 
to the organisation at all levels and are developing 
policies and procedures across the Group to 
achieve this. Recruitment processes have been 
reviewed to ensure a diverse mix of candidates  
is reviewed and shortlisted for interviews, where 
appropriate, with a view to increasing the number 
of women in senior roles. 
It is Vitec’s policy that applications for employment 
by disabled persons are always fully considered, 
bearing in mind the respective aptitudes and 
abilities of the applicant concerned. In the event  
of employees becoming disabled, all reasonable 
effort is made to ensure that their employment 
within the Group continues. It is our policy that  
the training, career development and promotion  
of disabled persons should be, as far as possible, 
identical to that of all other employees.

Our vision
T o strengthen, support

communities and economies 
where we operate. 
Our approach
We invest in projects that 
align with our values and look 
for opportunities to contribute 
our specialist skills in the 
creative arts or engineering, 
using our products and core 
skills to create a positive 
impact in our local 
communities.
The positive power of images 
As a leading player in the image capture and 
sharing market, we believe in the positive power  
of images to convey ideas, create wealth and 
positive social and environmental value.  
Our employees are experts in photography, 
videography, engineering and technology, and  
we aim to share this knowledge constructively  
to enable positive social and environmental 
outcomes. In particular we focus on ways in  
which our products and skills can benefit those  
who are disadvantaged.
Supporting and strengthening 
our communities 
The following are a few examples of positive 
contributions we made in 2017 in the communities 
in which we operate:
Investing in future industry talent
Vitec often donates or lends its professional 
photographic, TV and cinematic equipment to 
educational institutions around the world in order 
to assist with the upskilling of future talent in the 
image capture and sharing industry. 
Production Solutions regularly donates to technical 
schools in the local communities where they 
operate in Shelton, US and in Costa Rica; in 2017  
in Japan, Imaging Solutions’ products were given 
as prizes in a photography competition held 
between 500 high schools across the country; 
Creative Solutions’ Teradek loaned equipment  
to film a local high school surf competition. 
Wooden Camera, part of Creative Solutions, has  
a long-standing affiliation with The University of 
North Texas (“UNT”) ever since co-founder Ryan 
Schorman graduated from there in 2006. Wooden 
Camera supports the development of talent in the 
Independent Content Creator market by providing 
technical support in the optimisation of the 
cameras and accessories in the University’s film 
programme. In addition, the company donated 
specialist equipment to the University to the 
equivalent value of $10,000 in 2017. As a 
passionate proponent of independent film content 
creation, Ryan sits on the Media Arts Executive 
Board at UNT, where he advises on the film 
programme, judges film contests and contributes  
to scholarships.

The V itec Group plc           In the UK, Vitec has been a long-time supporter of 
The Vinten Trust which was set up by the original 
founder of the company that became Vitec, William 
Vinten. The Trust is a charitable foundation whose 
aim is to pursue initiatives which increase interest 
from students at schools and colleges in the Bury 
St. Edmunds area in science and technology 
subjects. As part of this support provided to the 
Trust, the UK Production Solutions team hosted 47 
local students at their site in Bury St. Edmunds 
during half term holidays to help them learn about 
careers in engineering. 
Picture of Life
Imaging Solutions’ Picture of Life project, now in 
its fourth year, is a photography education initiative 
comprising a three-month training programme for 
young people who have faced hardship and 
disenfranchisement. Starting out as a collaboration 
between Vitec and the Italian Justice Ministry in 
2014, photographers from the Manfrotto School  
of Xcellence teach techniques, lighting and street 
photography. The course is a way of rehabilitating 
and re-energising these young people. 
Vitec supports the project by donating and setting 
up a permanent photography studio in the project 
centres, by providing participants with the 
photographic equipment they need for the duration 
of the programme, and by organising all aspects  
of the course. 
Since its initial launch in Italy, the initiative has 
proved so successful that it has been replicated  
in New York, US, Shanghai, China, and the UK.  
In 2017, an international competition took place 
resulting in a touring exhibition to showcase some 
of the most impressive photographs from students 
around the world. The exhibition, which was 
launched in Rome in December, and will move  
to London, New York and other cities in 2018,  
has already been visited by hundreds of people.
“As with everything else in life, you need to feel  
it is your own, love it and then apply yourself and 
study. Otherwise you cannot learn. I feel like a 
richer person now. For me, photography is really 
important.” Mohamadou, 18 year old participant  
in the 2017 Picture of Life programme.
Contributing to the local economy
In December 2017, Production Solutions was 
honoured to receive an Award from the Costa 
Rican Chamber of Exporters (“CADECXO”) which 
recognised our outstanding contribution to export 
efforts in industrial manufacturing in the country. 
The Award was presented to Julio Lizano, Vice 
President Global Operations, Vitec Production 
Solutions Division, by the President of Costa Rica, 
Luis Guillermo Solís. 
A significant player in terms of export volumes in 
the country and an employer of nearly 200 local 
jobs, Vitec was also recognised for its strong 
contribution in the local supply chain: 50% of its 
components used in manufacturing come from 
local suppliers, thereby creating a further 300  
jobs with more than 30 Costa Rican suppliers.
Apprenticeships and work experience 
initiatives
Around the world, Vitec businesses have continued 
to offer work placements and internships for 
students of engineering and film studies. In the US, 
Production Solutions hosts engineering students 
within their team at Shelton, who assist with the 
design, implementation and support of new and 
existing products whilst gaining real world 
experience. In Costa Rica, a total of 15 students 
had placements at the Production Solutions site  
for two months; some of these students were 
offered full time roles at the end of the period.

 Financial Statements Vitec’s products and 
processes
We continue to implement initiatives aimed at 
sustaining and protecting the environment in  
the areas of energy efficiency, reducing carbon 
emissions, water use and waste; and sustainable 
use of materials, packaging and waste disposal. 
We also encourage a culture of environmentally 
sustainable behaviour at work and ensure that our 
employees understand how they can contribute.
Our products and services have a low impact on 
the environment. We use low hazard materials, 
minimise the use of resources during the 
manufacturing process and search for materials 
that are sustainable and can be recycled or 
reused. Our efforts and environmental awareness 
have continued to evolve, not only to comply with 
regulations but also to make our business better.
In H1 2018, a new centre will open in Bury St. 
Edmunds to house Production Solutions 
manufacturing and engineering plant, as well  
as many of the Division’s operational functions in 
the UK. Replacing the 50-year old existing factory, 
the new centre is purpose-built for modern 
manufacturing, and will specialise in advanced 
technology in areas such as robotics, automation 
and broadcast studio equipment. It will include a 
unique manufacturing process for the development 
of carbon fibre for the Flowtech tripod.
The site will house up to 200 staff, comprising 
engineers, sales and marketing, operational 
support and manufacturing personnel.  
The facility’s main challenge is to meet the needs 
of this diverse group, whilst improving work flow, 
efficiency, productivity and space utilisation.  
A cross-functional design team was engaged 
to meet this challenge.
The new site is 66,000 square feet and is one 
third smaller than the previous location, making 
effective space utilisation imperative. The goal is  
to reduce the use of electricity by 30% and gas by 
60% through a combination of factors including: 
the introduction of LED lighting throughout; no 
requirement for heating in the factory due to 
improved thermal properties; and three new 
compressors that will deliver further electrical  
use savings and a new, more efficient paint oven. 
Another key change will be the improved flow of 
materials from the assembly area to the shop floor; 
this will reduce travel time thereby cutting energy 
and improving efficiency. We will report more fully 
on this in the 2018 Annual Report. 
Energy use
We monitor and track our usage of electricity,  
gas and water across our manufacturing, 
warehouse and administrative sites and make 
efforts, where possible, to reduce our usage. 
Many buildings within the Group have timer and 
motion sensors for lighting to save on electricity 
usage. Our new site at Bury St. Edmunds, UK  
and our Production Solutions site in Costa Rica 
now have LED lighting throughout, which will 
significantly cut their electricity usage. Other 
buildings have programmable thermostats that 
are centrally managed to optimise the building’s 
heating and cooling needs.
The electricity contracts with Green Certificates  
at our two main sites in Italy were renewed last 
year until 2021, confirming Vitec’s commitment  
to use energy generated by renewable sources. 
Sites in Italy and Costa Rica continue to maintain 
their ISO 14001 compliance which were renewed 
in 2017.
Greenhouse gas reporting 
In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions (Directors’ Reports) Regulations  
and the requirement to report on greenhouse  
gas emissions, we have developed processes  
to accurately capture and report all material 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions as defined by the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol as of 31 December 
2016. We have applied the financial control basis 
for our reporting boundary. These emissions have 
been recorded at 20 of our operating sites in the 
12 months to 30 September 2017, and arise 
from on-site energy use and any fugitive 
emissions, and transport from owned vehicles.
We have identified the following major operating 
sites as the material sites for the Group for this 
requirement: Feltre, Italy; Bury St. Edmunds, UK; 
Cartago, Costa Rica; Ashby-de-la-Zouch, UK; 
Irvine, US; and Shelton, US. These sites account 
for over 95% of the Group by revenue. We have 
excluded our smaller sites as their size and scale 
of operations are not material with respect to 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
Environmental 
Sustainability 
Our vision
To ensure we limit our 
negative impact on the 
environment and protect 
the natural resources we 
rely on, creating long-term 
sustainability for the 
business.
Our approach
We adopt technologies, 
materials and processes 
that ensure we minimise 
our impact on the 
environment and 
maximise our use of 
sustainable resources.

Our most significant emissions arise from the use 
of electricity which makes up all our Scope 2 
emissions. Approximately two thirds of our Scope 
1 emissions arise from the use of natural gas, 
with the remainder mostly arising from transport 
fuel. All of our emissions have been calculated 
using the latest Defra conversion factors available 
at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/
greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversionfactors-2016.
We have selected a reporting date of 30 
September each year to enable accurate data  
to be collated to compile the Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions disclosure in time for inclusion in  
this Annual Report. 
Sustainable resource 
management 
Various initiatives around the Group took place in 
2017 to build on our work to reduce the amount 
of waste created in our operations. We sort waste 
for recycling at our sites in Italy, the UK and Costa 
Rica using colour coded bins to improve 
segregation. At our factory in Bury St. Edmunds, 
UK, the improved waste stream segregation and 
labelling, combined with employee engagement 
in the process has resulted in 91% of all solid 
waste being diverted away from landfill, as well 
as a rebate for metal recycling from the site. 
Water free urinals and sensors for use of water 
for irrigation at our Costa Rican plant have also 
reduced water consumption. The introduction  
of print management software in Italy has 
significantly reduced paper wastage. 
Environmental awareness 
Green Week events took place at our sites in both 
Italy and Costa Rica in 2017 to raise awareness 
amongst employees and share ideas on how to 
improve environmental impact. In Italy this took 
the form of a “Green to Work Week”, during which 
employees were encouraged to consider 
alternative ways to get to work, using either 
public transport, cycling or car sharing.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
 Strategic Report
 Corporate Responsibility
 Corporate Governance
 Financial Statements I am pleased to introduce my governance report for 2017 
which sets out our culture and governance. Under my 
Chairmanship, the Board is responsible to all Vitec’s 
stakeholders for the continued success of the Group. 
Culture and governance are critical to this.
Were there any Board changes in 2017? 
Martin Green joined the Board on 4 January 2017 as Group Business 
Development Director and on 24 April 2017 Kath Kearney-Croft joined as Group 
Finance Director, succeeding Paul Hayes who left the Company on 28 April 2017. 
Both Martin and Kath bring excellent skills to the Board. Martin has been with the 
Group for over ten years and brings strong commercial insight into the Group’s 
core markets and will be particularly focused on growth in APAC and opportunities 
in the Creative Solutions businesses as well as responsibility for corporate 
development and HR. Kath has undergone a thorough induction visiting our major 
operations and has made an excellent start during a period of significant change. 
On 22 February 2018 we announced that Mark Rollins would leave the Board as 
a Non-Executive Director with effect from 2 April 2018. We also announced that 
Richard Tyson will join the Board as a Non-Executive Director with effect from  
2 April 2018. I discuss the recruitment process later in this report. Christopher 
Humphrey will be taking on the role of Senior Independent Director following 
Mark’s departure. I would like to thank Mark for his thoughtful insight into Board 
matters over the last five years and wish him well for the future. At the same time I 
welcome Richard Tyson to the Board and look forward to working with him.
Biographical details for each Board member as at 31 December 2017 can be 
found on pages 52 and 53 of the Annual Report and details for Richard Tyson 
can be found in the 2018 AGM notice circular.
How does the Board set the right culture and tone from 
the top?
We strongly believe in doing business in the right way. Our Code of Conduct 
sets out our expectations around behaviours and is given to all employees  
and is available to all our stakeholders including customers and suppliers.  
Our Code of Conduct was re-communicated to all employees in early 2018 
and is available on our website. The Vitec Mindset sets out our values which 
remain unchanged and can be found on page 42. Health and Safety is a key 
performance indicator for our business with management focused on safe 
working conditions and accurate reporting of any near misses and accidents 
along with root cause investigations. Reports are provided to the Board on  
a monthly basis to track incidents and remedial actions taken as necessary.  
Our online governance training module has been completed by all new senior 
joiners during 2017, notably newly acquired businesses. In 2017 we also 
re-issued our independent whistleblowing service run by EXPOLINK.  
This enables employees or third parties to confidentially raise any  
concerns especially if they feel unable to do so through normal line 
management channels.
The Board and Operations Executive visited a number of our businesses in 
2017 to meet with employees, share key messages and promote the right 
culture and behaviours. The right business culture and tone from the top can 
only be promoted with proactive steps and leadership. The Board will continue 
to visit our operations and meet with our people in 2018 to further embed  
our values.
What has the Board done in terms of strategy and its 
implementation?
During 2017 the Board undertook a detailed review of the Group’s strategy.  
As a result of the strategy review, we announced in November 2017 that we 
would be moving to a three divisional structure with effect from 1 January 
2018 and this is set out in Stephen Bird’s Group Chief Executive’s Review. 
Coupled with this, the Board visited the Creative Solutions business in 
October, meeting that Division’s senior management team and the Teradek 
business site in Irvine, California. The Board has further communicated  
with shareholders on strategy and business priorities, including results 
presentations, an investor visit to Italy and several one-to-one meetings  
with major shareholders to hear first-hand their views on the strategy and 
business performance. With clear focus on the core broadcast and 
photographic markets, the Board also took the decision in 2017 to sell the 
non-core businesses of Bexel, the US Services business, and Haigh-Farr and 
acquire the JOBY and Lowepro brands and RTMotion.
Does the Board have the right structure and skills, and 
which directors will be standing for reappointment at  
the AGM?
The Board currently comprises eight directors with three executive directors, 
four independent non-executive directors and myself as chairman. As noted 
above, there will be a change to the Board and I believe we have the right 
sized Board with the correct balance of skills given the scale of our operations. 
Each Director has skills in the areas of strategy, finance, technology, human 
resources and global commercial experience to assist with the implementation 
of our strategy. They also enhance our diversity in terms of gender,

element to ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are reflected in the 
running of the Company.
All Directors will stand for reappointment at the 2018 AGM.
Is the Annual Report fair, balanced and understandable?
The Board considers that the Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, 
and has retained this power for itself. To achieve this we asked the Executive 
Directors and the Operations Executive to provide us with clear documentary 
evidence around the content and process of the 2017 Annual Report at our 
February 2018 Board meeting. The February 2018 Audit Committee 
confirmed to us that: the 2017 financial statements are true and fair; the work 
of the external auditor was effective; and the process supporting the Viability 
Statement was robust. As a consequence we are able to confirm that the 
2017 Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
through reliance on management and knowledge of the following processes:
•  detailed planning including drafting guidance and coordinated project 
management;
•  a verification process dealing with the factual content of the Annual Report;
•  comprehensive reviews undertaken at different levels in the Group to ensure 
consistency and overall balance; and
•  a comprehensive review by the senior management team.
Has the Company complied with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code?
My governance review has taken into account the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (“Governance Code”) as published in April 2016, and explains how we 
applied its main principles, supporting principles and provisions. Each was 
complied with throughout 2017, as required by the Listing Rules. The Board is 
aware that the Financial Reporting Council is consulting on a new Governance 
Code that is likely to come into effect for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2019 and will adopt any new requirements as appropriate as  
and when the new Code is published. 
Leadership 
How do you lead the Board and how are decisions made 
by the Board?
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the creation and delivery  
of sustainable performance and long-term shareholder value. There are 
separate roles for each member of the Board and we have a clear division of 
responsibilities between the Chairman and Group Chief Executive. Full details  
of our respective roles and responsibilities can be found on our website.
It is my responsibility to manage the Board and to ensure that it is effective.  
I work closely with the Group Chief Executive and Group Company Secretary 
to achieve this by ensuring that all Directors: are kept advised of key 
developments; receive accurate, timely and clear information; and actively 
participate in the decision making process. Board agendas are reviewed and 
agreed in advance to ensure each Board meeting utilises the Board’s time 
most efficiently. I encourage all Board members to openly and constructively 
challenge the proposals made by executive management led by the Group 
Chief Executive. I ensure that each Director properly exercises the power 
vested in them and in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, 
relevant law and any directions as provided by the Company in general 
meeting. Apart from the remuneration of Directors or Directors’ fees there 
were no instances when a Director had to abstain from voting on a matter  
due to a conflict of interest during 2017. The Board has a clear policy for 
dealing with any such conflicts or potential conflicts of interest.
How does your role interact with the Group  
Chief Executive?
The Group Chief Executive is responsible for managing the business.  
The Operations Executive supports the Group Chief Executive in this duty,  
the members of which are shown on page 17. The Group Chief Executive  
and I have an excellent working relationship, meeting and speaking regularly 
outside of scheduled Board meetings to discuss strategy and performance, 
and to ensure that Board meetings cover relevant matters. Our relationship 
and regular dialogue helps to underpin the working of the Board, providing  
a forum in which matters are discussed openly and robustly.
Who is the Senior Independent Director?
Mark Rollins acted as Senior Independent Director throughout 2017 and  
until he ceases to be a director on 2 April 2018. Notably in this role, Mark  
led the evaluation of my performance as part of the 2017 Board evaluation, 
information on which is provided later in this report. With Mark ceasing to  
be a director, the Board has decided that Christopher Humphrey will be 
appointed Senior Independent Director with effect from 2 April 2018.  
The Board considers that Christopher Humphrey is clearly independent  
and has the right experience and background to fill this important role. 
What is the Board responsible for?
The Board has a Schedule of Matters Reserved to it which includes: the  
Group strategy; setting of annual operating budgets; review of progress 
against strategy and budgets; financial results; dividends; changes in Board 
composition including key roles; acquisitions and disposals; material litigation; 
capital structure; risk management strategy; and various statutory and 
regulatory approvals. The Board meets regularly throughout the year to receive 
updates on business performance and consider proposals within its remit.  
The Schedule of Matters Reserved to the Board is reviewed annually and is 
available on our website.
What are the Board’s Committees responsible for?
The Board has delegated certain items of business to its principal 
Committees. This ensures the Board has sufficient time to deal with strategic 
matters while retaining oversight on salient points by virtue of its Committees. 
The Board’s principal committees are the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees. Each Committee has terms of reference, copies of 
which are available on our website. Each Committee can seek any information 
it requires from any employee of the Company in order to perform its duties 
and to obtain, at the Company’s expense, outside legal or other professional 
advice on any matter within its remit. Each Committee annually reviews its 
performance, constitution and terms of reference to ensure it is operating 
effectively and recommends any changes it considers necessary to the  
Board for approval. Each Committee’s responsibilities and activity in  
2017 are set out later in this report.

The V itec Group plc           Did all Directors attend meetings in 2017? 
Details of Directors’ attendance at Board and Committee meetings is shown  
in the table on page 60. All Directors attended each scheduled Board meeting 
and the five called at short notice, with the exception of Lorraine Rienecker 
who could not attend the short notice meeting in July due to prior commitments. 
When any Director is unable to attend they continue to receive the necessary 
papers and I contact them in advance of the meeting to obtain their input. 
Did the Board visit any of the Group’s sites during the year? 
In October 2017 the Board visited the Creative Solutions business operations 
in California, US. The visit included management presentations on market 
trends, product development, innovation and operations. The Board intends  
to hold a meeting at an operational site each year to deepen its knowledge 
and understanding of the Group. In 2018 this will be at our new Bury St. 
Edmunds facility in the UK. Each Director is encouraged to visit our operations 
at their own convenience to further build on their understanding of the Group.
Did the Board meet outside of scheduled meetings, 
including Non-Executive Director only meetings?
We continue to spend time together outside of Board meetings to learn not 
only about the business but each other’s skills and personalities, which  
helps ensure an effective Board. We hold a dinner for the Board before each 
scheduled Board meeting to enable Directors to informally discuss current 
business matters. It also gives an opportunity for the Operations Executive, 
other senior management or external advisors to attend to give updates on  
the business. This is a very useful and effective format.
We also hold Non-Executive Director only meetings, scheduled around the 
February and August Board meetings. These enable the Non-Executive 
Directors to raise any issues without executive management present.  
As Chairman, I feed back to the Executive Directors on these discussions  
and take any actions necessary to address matters raised.
How is the Board supported by executive management?
The Operations Executive which is led by the Group Chief Executive meets 
regularly to discuss ongoing business performance and enables the Group 
Chief Executive to manage the business with his direct reports. I receive an 
update from the Group Chief Executive on any salient matters resulting from 
each meeting. The Board regularly meets with members of the Operations 
Executive around its scheduled Board meetings. This attendance allows the 
Board to directly question senior management responsible for the business  
and to gain a better understanding of their respective technologies, market, 
products, customers and competitors. 
Effectiveness
How do you measure the effectiveness and performance  
of the Board?
The Board annually sets itself clear objectives and monitors progress against 
each throughout the year. The Board rigorously challenges itself on delivery of 
strategy, financial performance measured against budgets, governance and 
operational performance issues. During 2017 we conducted an externally 
facilitated Board evaluation and the detail of this is set out later in this report. 
In compliance with the Governance Code we conduct an external Board 
evaluation every three years to ensure that we independently measure the 
effectiveness and performance of the Board. In years where we do not have  
an external Board evaluation, we conduct an internal evaluation to ensure that 
we continue to challenge the Board on its effectiveness and performance. 
Are the Non-Executive Directors independent?
Each of the Non-Executive Directors bring independent character and 
judgement to bear on strategic matters, the performance of the Group,  
the adequacy of resources and standards of conduct. The Board considers 
that Christopher Humphrey, Lorraine Rienecker, Caroline Thomson and Mark 
Rollins are independent in accordance with the recommendations of the 
Governance Code. Each of these Non-Executive Directors’ tenure on the Board 
is less than five years and I lead the process of ensuring that each year the 
performance of each Director is objectively appraised. Each Director is also 
required to declare any conflict of interest arising on any matter and I confirm 
that no such conflicts arose in 2017. Each Director brings a complementary 
set of skills and diversity to the Board, having served in companies of varying 
size, complexity and market sector. When combined, these skills give your 
Board the comprehensive skill set required to deliver the strategic objectives 
of the Group and to ensure its continued success. We have also appointed 
Richard Tyson as Non-Executive Director with effect from 2 April 2018 and 
Mark Rollins will cease to be a Director with effect from 2 April 2018.  
We consider that Richard Tyson is independent.
Do new Directors receive an induction?
On appointment, we provide each Director with a tailored and extensive 
induction to the Group. The induction programme for Kath Kearney-Croft 
included meetings with: senior colleagues internally; the Group’s key advisors 
from KPMG, Investec, Rothschild, Slaughter and May and our relationship 
banks, including regular reviews with the KPMG Audit Partner; and the Audit 
Committee Chairman. Kath visited our businesses in Costa Rica, Bury St. 
Edmunds, UK, various locations in the US and Italy during 2017 to learn more 
about operations in each location and meet our employees. She attended all 
Board meetings and the strategy day held in June, allowing her to gain an 
in-depth understanding of the Group, as well as a senior management 
conference in October attended by over 60 of our senior employees.  
As part of the Board meetings she received presentations on the products  
and services we offer and how each business operates in its chosen markets 
and segments, along with the internal governance processes and procedures 
that exist to support our operations. Martin Green’s induction was more finely 
tailored on account that he has been with the Group for over ten years.  
Each induction process is tailored to the individual and would be adjusted  
if it related to a Non-Executive Director. Each Director is encouraged to 
continue visiting the Group’s operations as their schedule permits.

 Financial Statements Does the Board receive ongoing training?
Ongoing training for new and existing Directors is available at the request  
of the Director. Each Director receives details of relevant training and 
development courses from both the Group Company Secretary and from  
the Company’s appointed advisors. The requirement for training is discussed 
at meetings of the Board and Committees and I ensure that each Director  
has the required skills and knowledge to enable them to operate efficiently  
on the Board. The Group Company Secretary maintains a register of training 
undertaken by Directors to facilitate this discussion. During the year the Board 
collectively received training sessions on product technology, investor relations 
and the broadcast and photographic markets. The Board regularly receives 
written updates on governance, regulatory and financial matters as they  
are published.
What if a Director needs to take independent  
external advice?
All Directors, having notified me in the first instance, are able to take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in furtherance  
of their duties. During 2017 no Director took such advice. They also have 
access to the advice and services of the Group Company Secretary, who is 
responsible for advising the Board, through myself, on all governance matters.
How do you ensure that Board meetings run effectively?
Working with the Group Chief Executive and Group Company Secretary,  
I ensure that Directors receive papers for consideration at Board meetings  
so that it gives all Board members adequate time to read, prepare and,  
where appropriate, ask questions prior to the meeting. The information 
includes detailed budgets, forecasts, strategy papers, reviews of the Group’s 
financial position and operating performance, and annual and half yearly 
reports. Each Board member receives a detailed monthly report from the 
Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Business Development 
Director, Group Company Secretary and Group Legal Counsel, plus a Health 
and Safety Report covering the ongoing performance of the business. The 
Board receives further information from time to time as and when necessary.
All Board and Committee meetings are minuted by the Group Company 
Secretary. In the first instance, minutes are reviewed by the Chairman of that 
meeting before being circulated to all Directors in attendance and then tabled 
for approval at the next meeting.
What is the Board’s policy on appointing Directors?
Under the Company’s Articles, the Board has the power at any time, and  
from time to time, to appoint any person to be a Director, either to fill a  
casual vacancy or as an addition to the existing Board, subject to a maximum 
number of 15 Directors. Any Director so appointed shall hold office only until 
the next AGM and shall then put himself or herself forward to be reappointed 
by shareholders.
The Chairman and the other Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an 
initial period of three years which, with the approval of the Nominations 
Committee and the Board, would normally be extended for a further three 
years. If it is in the interests of the Company to do so, appointments of the 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors may be extended beyond six years, 
with the approval of the Nominations Committee, the Board and the individual 
Director concerned. 
Under the Company’s Articles, each Director is required to stand for annual 
reappointment at every AGM. The table below sets out the Chairman’s and 
Non-Executive Directors’ appointment dates and scheduled renewal of terms. 
Mark Rollins will cease to be a director on 2 April 2018 and has not been 
included in the table below. Having served on the Board for six years, the 
Chairman’s term of appointment was renewed at the February 2018 Board 
meeting and he will be standing for re-election at the 2018 AGM. 
The annual renewals of terms for a Non-Executive Director will take into 
account ongoing performance, continuing independence and the needs and 
balance of the Board as a whole.
Richard Tyson has been appointed as a Non-Executive Director with effect 
from 2 April 2018 and will be standing for re-election at the 2018 AGM.

The V itec Group plc           What is the Board’s policy on diversity?
The Board considers the issue of diversity for every appointment. As part  
of this the Board has adopted a policy on diversity as set out below:
Vitec recognises the importance of a fully diverse workforce in the successful 
delivery of its strategy. The effective use of all the skills and talents of our 
employees is encouraged and this extends to potential new employees.  
It is essential that the best person for the job is selected regardless of race, 
gender, religion, age, sexual orientation, physical ability or nationality. Vitec is 
fully committed to equal opportunity where talent is recognised. The Board will 
keep under regular review the issue of diversity including at Board level, senior 
management level and throughout the entire workforce, taking into account 
among other things Lord Davies’ review Women on Boards, the Hampton-
Alexander review FTSE Women Leaders, the Parker and McGregor-Smith 
reviews on Ethnic Diversity. We will report upon this issue annually in our 
Annual Report.
The Employees section of the Corporate Responsibility Report contains further 
information on diversity, including the disclosure of gender diversity statistics 
in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What format did the Board’s evaluation take in 2017?
In 2017 we conducted an external Board evaluation that was facilitated by 
Lintstock, who previously conducted our last external evaluation in 2014. 
The process entailed individual meetings held with myself, Stephen Bird, Kath 
Kearney-Croft and the Group Company Secretary, where the performance of 
the Board and business were discussed. Following this, the Group Company 
Secretary and I worked with Lintstock to develop two bespoke questionnaires 
that focused on the work completed by the Board during 2017 including the 
strategy review held in June and the Board visit to the US in October along 
with general Board matters. These were issued to all Directors and the  
Group Company Secretary, and also covered reviews of the Board, the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees, and the Chairman. Lintstock 
collated the findings from both questionnaires into five separate reports which 
were presented to the Board by Lintstock at the December 2017 Board 
meeting. I also met with each Director individually, allowing for a discussion  
to take place around any areas for improvement. Mark Rollins, as Senior 
Independent Director, coordinated the process for my own evaluation.  
The outcomes have helped to shape the Board and Committee  
objectives for 2018. 
What was the outcome of the 2017 evaluation?
I am pleased to report that Lintstock concluded that your Board was 
performing well, with its dynamic rated highly, reflecting a collegiate and 
transparent approach during meetings. The Board’s composition, skills  
and expertise were also rated favourably, with strong governance processes 
underpinning its performance. The relationship between the Chairman and 
Group Chief Executive continued to work well. The strategy review process 
had improved on the prior year and the Board’s oversight of the resulting 
actions was effective. Visiting the US operations in California had allowed 
Directors to understand more about the Creative Solutions business and  
its people. 
Each Committee was deemed to be effective along with individual Directors 
contributing time and effort both during and outside of meetings. Non-
Executive Directors demonstrated a willingness to devote sufficient time  
and effort to understand the Company and its businesses and provided 
independent, rigorous and constructive challenge on strategy and operational 
performance. Board and Committee materials and papers are comprehensive, 
clear, appropriately detailed and circulated in good time, allowing for meetings 
to be managed efficiently.
What actions has the Board taken as a result of the 2017 
evaluation? 
The 2017 Board evaluation has been used as a basis to set Board objectives 
for 2018 and these focus on the areas of: strategy; governance and culture; 
financial performance; customers, technology and competitors; key 
performance indicators; and risk. The Board will track progress against each 
during 2018 and I will report on these objectives in the 2018 Annual Report.
Each of the Board Committees were reviewed with individual outputs and 
actions created. As with the Board, the output helped set the 2018 objectives 
that will be reported on by each Committee in the 2018 Annual Report. For 
the Audit Committee, 2018’s focus will be on: reviewing the risk management 
of strategic objectives; a successful handover to the new external auditor; an 
overview of IT strategy and processes; oversight of treasury arrangements and 
tax strategy; the successful induction of the new Non-Executive Director and 
continued training on financial and governance matters. The Remuneration 
Committee’s objectives for 2018 include: ensuring the Remuneration Report 
takes into account best practice and receives significant shareholder support 
at the 2018 AGM; ensuring remuneration structures for senior management 
remain appropriate and aligned to delivery of our Group strategy; preparing  
for changes concerning executive remuneration as a consequence of new 
legislation and a revision to UK Corporate Governance Code; and ensuring  
the Committee continues to receive appropriate ongoing training. 
Finally, my review led by Mark Rollins highlighted that I have a good 
relationship with the Group Chief Executive, Board members and major 
shareholders, and my performance was rated highly by every Board member.

The V itec Group plc           What is the purpose of the Nominations Committee? 
The Board has appointed the Nominations Committee to oversee the 
composition of the Board (including skills, knowledge, experience and 
diversity), senior executive recruitment and succession, and the process for 
appointments of Directors. 
Current Committee members are set out below and all served throughout 2017. 
Other members of the Board attend Nominations Committee meetings by invitation 
and where there is no conflict.
What did the Nominations Committee do in 2017 and what 
are its plans for 2018? 
During 2017 the Nominations Committee focused its attention on executive 
management, receiving presentations on talent development and succession 
planning for the Executive Directors, Operations Executive and senior 
management. In the early part of 2017, the Committee was principally 
focussed on the recruitment process for a new Group Finance Director that 
culminated in Kath Kearney-Croft’s appointment on 24 April 2017. In the latter 
part of 2017, the Committee commenced a search for a new Non-Executive 
Director following Mark Rollins’ indication that he would wish to stand down 
as a Director in 2018. The Committee managed this search for his successor 
and made a recommendation on this to the Board at the February 2018 
meeting. In 2018 the Committee will focus in detail on succession planning 
and talent development for the direct reports of the Executive Directors and 
senior management within each of the Group’s divisions. 
What is the process for the appointment of a new Director?
Once the Board has identified the need for a new Director, the Chairman 
would, except where the search relates to his role, engage the support of an 
external executive search consultant where necessary to facilitate the search. 
The Chairman would work with the consultant to draft a clear brief on the role, 
skills and personal attributes that the Board was looking for, taking into 
account Board diversity, and follow this up with a search process to identify 
suitable candidates. Initial interviews would be held with candidates with both 
the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive, where appropriate, following 
which a shortlist would be created taking into account the skills of each 
candidate and perceived fit with the Board and senior management. Following 
further meetings a preferred candidate would be chosen and each member  
of the Board would then meet with, or speak to, the preferred candidate 
individually to ensure that a person with the right skills, diversity and dynamic 
fit with the Board was appointed. This same process would occur whether the 
role was executive or non-executive in nature. However, should the search be 
for the role of Chairman, it would be conducted by the Senior Independent 
Director with the support of the Board. Subject to the outcome of each search,  
a formal recommendation on an appointment is made by the Nominations 
Committee to the Board for approval. 
The Nominations Committee used the services of JCA Group in 2017 as part 
of the process for the recruitment of a new Non-Executive Director. 
Does the Board have the right mix of Directors?
I am confident that we have the necessary mix and balance of skills, 
personalities and diversity on the Board to meet the challenges the Group 
faces, deliver on strategy, monitor ongoing performance and exercise good 
corporate governance. During 2017 each Board member assessed the  
current mix of the Board and skills of directors to identify potential areas for 
improvement. This has helped to support the recruitment of new Directors as 
we move forward. The recruitment of a new Non-Executive Director has taken 
into account the current mix of the Board and the need to ensure continued 
diversity of experience and background. I will remain mindful of the need to 
have the right balance on the Board and future Board changes will take this 
into consideration. The Nominations Committee will continue to monitor Board 
structure and succession plans, including talent and succession plans of 
senior management below Board level.

Accountability
How does the Board oversee internal control and  
risk management? 
The Board has delegated responsibility to the Audit Committee for oversight  
of the Group’s system of internal controls to safeguard shareholders’ 
investments and the Company’s assets. As part of its responsibility, the Audit 
Committee formally reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls 
twice a year. There are systems and procedures in place for internal controls 
that are designed to provide reasonable control over the activities of the Group 
and to enable the Board and Audit Committee to fulfil their legal responsibility  
for the keeping of proper accounting records, safeguarding the assets of  
the Group and detecting fraud and other irregularities. This approach  
provides reasonable assurance against material misstatement or loss, 
although it is recognised that as with any successful company, business and 
commercial risks must be taken and enterprise, initiative and the motivation  
of employees must not be unduly stifled. It is not our intention to avoid all 
commercial risks and commercial judgements in the course of the 
management of the business.
The Board has adopted a risk-based approach to establishing the system  
of internal controls. The application and process followed by the Board in 
reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal controls during the  
year were as follows:
•  Each business unit is charged with the ongoing responsibility for identifying 
the risks it faces and for putting in place procedures to monitor and manage 
those risks.
•  The responsibilities of senior management at each business unit to  
manage risks within their businesses are periodically reinforced by  
the Operations Executive.
•  Major strategic, operational, financial, regulatory, compliance and 
reputational risks are formally assessed during the annual long-term 
business planning process around mid-year. These plans and the attendant 
risks to the Group are reviewed and considered by the Board.
•  Large financial capital projects, property leases, product development 
projects and all acquisitions and disposals require advance Board approval.
•  The process by which the Board reviews the effectiveness of internal 
controls has been agreed by the Board and is documented. This involves 
regular reviews by the Board of the major business risks of the Group, 
together with the controls in place to mitigate those risks. In addition, every 
business unit conducts a self-assessment of its internal controls. Every year, 
the results of these assessments are reviewed by the Group Risk Assurance 
Manager who provides a report to the Group Finance Director and the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Board is made aware of any 
significant matters arising from the self-assessments. The risk and control 
identification and certification process is monitored and periodically 
reviewed by Group financial management.
•  A register of risks facing the Group, as well as each individual business,  
and an evaluation of the impact and likelihood of those risks is maintained 
and updated regularly by the Group Risk Assurance Manager. The Group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties and mitigation for them are set out on 
pages 34 and 35 of this Annual Report.
•  The Board has established a control framework within which the Group 
operates. This contains the following key elements:
   -  an organisational structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility, 
delegation of authority and reporting requirements;
   -  defined expenditure authorisation levels;
   -  an operational review process covering all aspects of each business 
conducted by Group executive management on a regular basis  
throughout the year;

 Strategic Report
 Corporate Responsibility
 Corporate Governance
 Financial Statements    -  a strategic planning process identifying key actions, initiatives and risks  
to deliver the Group’s long-term strategy; and
   -  a comprehensive system of financial reporting including weekly flash 
reports, monthly reporting, quarterly forecasting and an annual budget 
process. The Board approves the Group budget, forecasts and strategic 
plans. Monthly actual results are reported against prior year, budget and 
latest forecasts and are circulated to the Board. These forecasts are 
revised where necessary but formally at least once every quarter. Any 
significant changes and adverse variances are reviewed by the Group 
Chief Executive and Operations Executive and remedial action is taken 
where appropriate. Group tax and treasury functions are coordinated 
centrally. There is regular cash and treasury reporting to Group financial 
management and monthly reporting to the Board on the Group’s tax and 
treasury position.
This system has been in place for the year under review and up to the date  
of approval of the Annual Report.
The Group’s internal audit function, led by the Group Risk Assurance Manager, 
conducted a number of internal audits and additional assurance reviews 
during 2017, the details of which were presented to the Audit Committee.  
The audits included reviews of the appropriateness and effectiveness of 
controls within the Group including, but not limited to: purchasing and 
payments; sales and cash collection; inventory management; accounting  
and reporting; and IT processes. An internal audit plan for 2018 was prepared 
and agreed with the Audit Committee at its February 2018 meeting.
What publications has the Board reviewed in 
consideration of compliance with internal control and  
risk matters?
The Board considers that this report accords with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s (“FRC”) Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and related 
Financial and Business Reporting, as issued in 2014, and has reported 
against the recommendations in this Annual Report.
Relations with shareholders
How does the Board ensure it has a continued dialogue 
with its major shareholders? 
Maintaining regular contact with our shareholders remains an important part 
of our activities and is fundamental to good corporate governance. During 
2017, the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director held face-to-face 
meetings with each of our major shareholders tied into the publication of our 
full year and half year results and also periodically as requested by existing 
and potential shareholders. I also make myself available to shareholders as 
required to discuss the Group’s strategy, governance and remuneration 
matters. In May 2017 we took some of our major shareholders and analysts  
to visit our facilities in Italy. The visit included a tour of our operations and 
allowed them to meet with more of our employees. We plan to run a similar 
visit to our new facility in Bury St. Edmunds that will open in 2018. We aim  
to ensure that our business, strategy, governance and remuneration policies 
are clearly understood and that any concerns are addressed through 
constructive engagement.
How does the Board use the AGM to communicate with 
all shareholders?
I was pleased to meet some of our shareholders at the 2017 AGM and look 
forward to meeting shareholders again at the 2018 AGM. This offers an 
opportunity for you to meet with our Directors and to hear more about the 
Group’s strategy. Shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM and to  
ask questions about the business. The Group Chief Executive gives a short 
business update to the AGM. I confirm that all Board members will attend the 
forthcoming AGM, including each of the Committee Chairmen. Details of the 
AGM are included in the Notice of Meeting that accompanies this Annual 
Report and which is available on our website.
How do shareholders vote at the AGM?
All resolutions are voted on by way of a poll. This reflects best practice and 
ensures that all the views of all shareholders who submit proxy forms are taken 
into account in terms of the actual voting at the general meeting. The outcome 
of the voting at the AGM will be announced by way of a Stock Exchange 
announcement and full details will be published on the Company’s website 
shortly after the AGM. At the 2017 AGM, over 80% of our issued shares were 
voted by way of proxies submitted. Separate resolutions are proposed for each 
substantive issue upon which shareholders are asked to vote.
Shareholders attending the AGM have the opportunity to ask questions at the 
meeting. In the event that a resolution is opposed by a significant proportion  
of shareholders, the Company will endeavour to explain, as soon as practically 
possible following the meeting, the actions it intends to take to understand 
shareholders’ concerns and how best to address the concerns being raised. 
The Board considers that a vote in excess of 20% of shareholders voting  
to be significant.
What about other types of shareholder communication?
We publish an Annual Report each year usually in March following the end of 
the financial year on 31 December. To allow shareholders to review the Annual 
Report in advance of the AGM and create an informed view of the Group,  
we comply with the requirement set out in the current Governance Code in 
respect of shareholder meetings to send the Notice of Meeting and related 
papers at least 20 working days before the meeting and we will continue to 
comply with this requirement. The Board communicates with its shareholders 
via a combination of public announcements through the London Stock 
Exchange, analyst briefings, roadshows and press interviews at the time of the 
announcements of the half year and full year results and, when appropriate,  
at other times in the year.
Regular updates from the Executive Directors at Board meetings keep  
the Board advised of the views of major shareholders. We also receive  
monthly reports on market and investor sentiment along with a full 
shareholder analysis.
Our website contains information on the Group including financial results, 
presentations, investor relations and products and services. Shareholders and 
other stakeholders are encouraged to view the website to receive up-to-date 
information about us.

The V itec Group plc           Corporate Governance 
Report from Christopher Humphrey, 
Chairman of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring the 
effective financial integrity of the Group through the regular 
review of its financial processes and performance. It is also 
responsible for ensuring that the Group has appropriate 
risk management and internal controls, and that internal 
and external audit processes are robust. I will explain the 
Committee’s activities in more detail in my report.
The Audit Committee at the date of this report comprises four independent 
Non-Executive Directors. During 2017 the members were:
The Audit Committee provides effective governance over external financial 
reporting, risk management and internal controls and reports its findings  
and recommendations to the Board. As Chairman of the Audit Committee,  
I am pleased to report on the operations of the Committee during 2017,  
with emphasis on the specific matters we considered, including compliance 
with the Governance Code and associated Guidance on Audit Committees.  
We fully comply with the requirements of the Governance Code as issued  
in April 2016. 
What qualifications and skills do you possess as Audit 
Committee Chairman? 
I was appointed as Chairman of the Audit Committee on 12 May 2015.  
The Board believes I continue to have the necessary recent and relevant 
financial experience, along with financial competence, as required by the 
Governance Code. I am a Chartered Management Accountant and a Fellow  
of CIMA, and most recently held the role of Chief Executive Officer and 
previously Group Finance Director of Anite plc, formerly a UK listed company. 
In my earlier career I held senior positions in finance at Conoco, Eurotherm 
International plc and Critchley Group plc. I continue to maintain an up-to-date 
understanding of financial and corporate governance knowledge and best 
practice by attending training sessions and updates presented by major 
accounting firms. The Board also considers that the other members of the 
Committee have a broad range of appropriate skills and experiences covering 
financial, commercial and operational matters, along with competence of the 
manufacturing and technological aspects of the industry in which Vitec 
operates, and their biographies are summarised on pages 52 and 53.
What did the Committee do in 2017?
In 2017 I chaired four scheduled meetings of the Committee and I worked 
closely with both Group Finance Directors, the Group Risk Assurance Manager 
and the Deputy Company Secretary to ensure the Committee is provided with 
the necessary information it requires to discharge its duties. We operate with  
a rolling agenda programme, taking into account our terms of reference 
(which can be found on our website), the Group’s annual reporting 
requirements and any other matters which arise on an ad-hoc basis.  
The Committee sets aside appropriate time for the review of financial  
reporting and the risk assurance process to ensure they both receive robust 
consideration and challenge. A priority in 2017 was to ensure the smooth 
handover to Kath Kearney-Croft as the new Group Finance Director and  
full details of her induction are contained earlier in this report. Her induction 
has been extremely thorough and she provides detailed input to the Audit 
Committee. The Committee also undertook in the latter part of 2017 a tender 
for the services of the external auditor. This was earlier than expected due to  
a number of business changes that I explain in more detail below. Full details 
of the work we completed during 2017 is set out in the table on page 68.
How long has KPMG been the Group’s Auditor?
KPMG has been the Company’s auditor since 19 July 1995 and we comply with 
the requirement to rotate the audit partner every five years. Adrian Wilcox was 
appointed as Audit Partner in 2016 and was in attendance at the 2017 AGM. 
How did the Committee review the effectiveness  
of KPMG?
Before I explain about the tender process for the external auditor, I will explain 
how we formally assessed the effectiveness of the external auditor during 
2017. Alongside collecting verbal feedback from each business unit on 
KPMG’s performance, every three years we issue a feedback questionnaire  
to employees who had interaction with KPMG during the 2016 audit.  
The questionnaire was issued in mid-2017 and covered areas of: leadership 
and team structure; planning, approach and scope; execution and process; 
risks; communication; independence and objectivity; adding value; and cost 
effectiveness. The results of the questionnaire showed that KPMG was 
performing adequately and highlighted areas for improvement during  
the 2017 audit process.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
 Strategic Report
 Corporate Responsibility
 Corporate Governance
 Financial Statements The aggregated results of the questionnaires were shared with KPMG and 
allowed the Audit Committee to conclude that the KPMG audit process was 
robust, effective and in accordance with auditing standards. We also took into 
account publications made by the FRC, including the Audit Quality Practice  
Aid for Audit Committees as published in May 2015. These provided the 
Committee with comfort that an external and independent review of the  
quality of KPMG’s overall audit work had taken place. 
Why did you tender the external auditor?
In the 2016 Annual Report we reported that we expected to tender the 
external auditor in 2020, to coincide with the rotation of the audit partner,  
or earlier, if KPMG’s performance fell short of the Audit Committee’s 
expectations. In late 2017 we decided to accelerate the tender of the external 
auditor due to a number of factors, including: the appointment of a new Group 
Finance Director; the change to a three Divisional reporting structure; material 
changes to the composition of the Group following the sales of Bexel and 
Haigh-Farr and the acquisitions of the JOBY and Lowepro brands and RTMotion.
What process was undertaken in selecting a new  
external auditor? 
Following a decision by the Audit Committee to put the external audit to 
tender, a number of firms were invited including Deloitte, EY, PwC and BDO. 
BDO declined to participate due to their limited knowledge of our business.  
Initial meetings were held with each firm and the Group Finance Director, 
following which a number of due diligence documents were shared with  
each firm to allow them to gain a better understanding of our business.  
Formal tender meetings were held with each firm where they presented  
their proposals and met with a number of head office and divisional finance 
colleagues. The proposed lead audit partners also met with myself as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Group Finance Director. All three 
firms presented to the Audit Committee in December 2017 on a blind fee 
basis, and were rated on a pre-defined list of criteria before fees were 
disclosed. Two firms were shortlisted and a recommendation made to the 
Board. Following further discussion, the lead audit partner from the preferred 
firm met with the Board Chairman and Group Chief Executive. A final decision 
on the appointment of a new external auditor was made by the Board on  
21 February 2018. 
Which audit firm is being recommended to shareholders 
to be appointed as the external auditor at the 2018 AGM 
and why? 
As a result of the tender process, the Audit Committee recommended to  
the Board that Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”) be appointed as the Group’s external 
auditor. KPMG will not seek re-appointment at the 2018 AGM and therefore 
the Board recommend to shareholders for approval at the 2018 AGM, the 
appointment of Deloitte, to succeed KPMG as the external auditor for the 
financial year commencing 1 January 2018. As outgoing auditor, KPMG  
will provide the Company with a statement of the reasons for ceasing to  
hold office as the Company’s external auditor and a copy will be circulated  
to shareholders attached to the 2018 AGM Notice of Meeting.
Deloitte was the strongest candidate firm and had built up a strategic 
relationship with the Group over a number of years. Its audit team impressed 
the Group head office and Divisional finance functions with their technical 
knowledge and its senior team was felt to have the best fit with the Group. 
Deloitte is currently the Group’s tax advisor and due to independence issues 
will step down from this role at the commencement of the audit engagement. 
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the 2018 AGM to recommend the 
appointment of Deloitte as auditor of the Group. A separate resolution for the 
approval of the external auditors remuneration will also be put to shareholders 
at the 2018 AGM. 
We will review Deloitte’s performance during 2018 and provide a summary  
in the 2018 Annual Report. 
How do you keep on top of matters outside meetings? 
I meet regularly with the Group Finance Director and external Audit Partner  
to provide necessary support to their roles, and also individually with the 
Group Risk Assurance Manager to discuss the findings of his work and to 
maintain an open line of communication.
Was the Company subject to any reviews by the FRC 
during 2017?
The Company was not subject to any FRC reviews during 2017. Should this 
occur in future, we will advise shareholders in the subsequent Annual Report.
How has the Committee assessed the content of the 
Annual Report?
As already explained by the Chairman, the Board takes responsibility for 
determining that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders  
to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. At the 
request of the Board, the Audit Committee concentrated its review of the  
full year results on the financial statements only and the process which 
underpinned the drafting of the Viability Statement. The process for 
determining content of the financial statements and the Viability Statement 
was reviewed by the Audit Committee who recommended to the Board at its 
meeting on 19 February 2018 the adoption of the financial statements as at 
31 December 2017 and that they provide a true and fair view of the financial 
performance of the Group.
What were the significant accounting issues considered 
by the Committee?
The Committee considered several significant accounting issues, matters and 
judgements in relation to the Group’s financial statements and disclosures  
for the year ended 31 December 2017. As part of the half year and full  
year reporting process, management present an accounting paper to the 
Committee, and the external auditor is asked to also comment on the key 
significant areas of accounting judgement and disclosure, specifically 
inventory and tax provisions. The information presented is used by the 
Committee to critically review and assess the key policies and judgements 
that have been applied, the consistency of policy application and the 
appropriateness of key disclosures made, together with compliance with  
the applicable accounting standards. The significant issues arising and a 
description of how each was addressed is shown in the following table.
Corporate Governance 
66
The V itec Group plc           Who else attends Committee meetings? 
The Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Risk 
Assurance Manager, Group Company Secretary and Deputy Company 
Secretary attend meetings by invitation and other members of the senior 
management team attend as required. I invite the audit partner from the 
Company’s external auditor to attend meetings of the Committee on a regular 
basis and during 2017 he attended three of the four scheduled meetings, 
either in whole or for part of the meeting. At two of the meetings the Executive 
Directors and senior management were not present for part of the meeting  
so that members of the Committee could meet with the external auditor in 
private. The Committee will continue with the practice of meeting in private 
with the external auditor in the future.
What is the policy on non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor?
We have a policy on the use of the external auditor for non-audit services 
which is reviewed annually. During 2017 the policy was refined to include  
only two classes of work (previously three): services from which the external 
auditor is excluded and services for which the external auditor may be 
considered, which better represented how the policy was being applied in 
practice. There were no changes to the items of work covered by the policy 
except for being covered under two categories instead of three. An express 
provision was included in the policy that written permission must be obtained 
from the Group Finance Director before the external auditor is engaged for any 
non-audit work. The use of the external auditor is determined by their 
demonstrable competence, knowledge of the Group, and competitive pricing, 
and monetary thresholds for the approval of non-audit work by KPMG have 
been set by the Committee. The policy ensures that the non-audit work 
provided by KPMG does not impair their independence or objectivity and  
is divided into two parts:
•  Work from which the external auditor is excluded: This includes but is not 
limited to: internal accounting or other internal financial services, design, 
development or implementation of financial information or internal controls 
systems, internal audit services or their outsourcing, forensic accounting 
services, executive or management roles and functions, IT consultancy, 
litigation support services and other financial services such as broker, 
financial adviser or investment banking services.
•  Work where use of the external auditor may be deemed appropriate 
– subject to pre-approval from the Group Finance Director and Chairman  
of the Audit Committee: This includes accounting advice in relation to 
acquisitions and divestments, corporate governance and risk management 
advice, defined audit related work and regulatory reporting, reporting 
accountant services, compliance services, transaction work (mergers, 
acquisitions and divestments), valuation and actuarial services, fairness 
opinions and contribution reports.
I confirm that during 2017 the policy was followed without exception. A report 
on the level of non-audit work provided by KPMG is given to the Committee 
half-yearly and the Committee is satisfied that the advice they received from 
KPMG has been objective and independent. During 2017, £0.1 million was 
paid to KPMG in respect of non-audit work compared to an audit fee of £0.7 
million. This non-audit work mainly comprised the review of the half-yearly 
financial statements. The policy on non-audit services provided by the external 
auditor will continue to apply to Deloitte going forward from their appointment 
as external auditor.
Significant issue How it was addressed
Working capital 
management
The Committee critically reviewed the carrying 
value of the Group’s working capital. This took 
into account management’s assessment of 
the appropriate level of provisioning including 
collectability of receivables and inventory 
obsolescence. Management presented to the 
Committee the experience of bad debts during 
the year, and the debtor concentration and days 
outstanding. With regard to inventory the gross 
levels held by inventory type, the provisions recorded 
against obsolescence, and inventory days analysis 
were also presented to the Committee. In addition, 
the external auditor presented their findings with 
regard to the key audit testing over working capital 
covering all the major locations. The Committee 
concurred with management’s assessment of the 
Group’s working capital position.
Provisions and 
other liabilities
The Committee considered the judgemental 
issues relating to the level of provisions and other 
liabilities. The more significant items include 
post-employment and taxation. For each area 
management presented to the Committee the 
key underlying assumptions and key judgements 
and, where relevant, the range of possible 
outcomes. The external auditor also presented 
on each of these areas and their assessment 
of these judgements. The Committee has used 
this information to review the position adopted in 
terms of the amounts charged and recorded as 
provisions, acknowledging the level of subjectivity 
that needs to be applied.

price in January 2017 of £6.48 per share to a closing share price at  
31 December 2017 of £11.30. In addition to growth in revenues and adjusted 
profit* , management successfully carried out strategic corporate activity 
including the disposals of the non-core businesses of Haigh-Farr and Bexel, 
the US Services business, as well as the acquisitions of the JOBY and Lowepro 
brands and RTMotion. The Group delivered a strong cash performance and has 
reduced Group net debt. The Group’s Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) 
performance was also strong in 2017. The Group is well positioned for future 
growth in its core markets with a robust balance sheet.
Committee activities in 2017
The Remuneration Committee in 2017 dealt with the following matters:
•  The Committee sought approval from shareholders at the 2017 AGM for  
a new Remuneration Policy following a detailed shareholder consultation in 
2016. The policy is similar to that approved by shareholders in 2014 except 
for two changes: 
 -  Firstly, under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) a re-balancing in the 
performance conditions from a 50%/50% split between Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) and Earnings per Share (“EPS”) to a 33%/67% split 
respectively. Vesting is underpinned by Committee discretion that will  
take into account, in particular, ROCE performance over the performance 
period for the EPS element of awards.
 -  Secondly, under the pension contribution, a reduction in the Company 
contribution for Executive Directors appointed from 2017 onwards from 
20% of salary to 15% of salary. 
   The Policy Report was approved by over 99% of shareholders voting at  
the 2017 AGM giving a clear mandate on Directors’ remuneration for the 
next three years.
•  The Committee approved an increase in the Group Chief Executive’s,  
Group Finance Director’s and Group Business Development Director’s 
salaries with effect from 1 January 2018 of 2.5%, reflecting pay increases 
within the Group’s workforce and current market conditions. The fees paid 
to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have also been increased by 
the same percentage. 
•  Bonus payments for 2017 were 88.4%, 87.9% and 88.4% respectively of 
the maximum potential award for the Group Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director and Group Business Development Director. The 2017 Annual Bonus 
Plan paid out against the adjusted profit and operating cash* performance 
measures at 84.2% and 100% respectively as well as an individual 
assessment against personal objectives for each Executive Director.  
Each of the Executive Directors is required to defer half of their earned 2017 
bonus (after taxes) into the Deferred Bonus Plan (“DBP”) for three years, 
ensuring focus on long-term growth for the Company.

The V itec Group plc           •  The Committee approved the remuneration packages for Kath Kearney-Croft 
upon her appointment as Group Finance Director with effect from 24 April 
2017, Martin Green upon his appointment as Group Business Development 
Director with effect from 4 January 2017, and also approved the leaving 
arrangements for Paul Hayes upon his departure as Group Finance Director 
on 28 April 2017.
•  LTIP awards made in 2015 to Executive Directors partially achieved their 
performance conditions based upon TSR and adjusted basic earnings per 
share* growth with 100% of the TSR performance condition achieved and 
35% of the EPS growth performance condition achieved. As a consequence 
a blended level of 67.5% of the 2015 LTIP will vest to Executive Directors 
(and other participants) on the third anniversary of the award on 8 April 
2018. As part of the calculation of EPS the Committee exercised a 
discretion around the treatment of acquisitions and disposals made  
in the performance period. The detail is set out on page 82.
•  The Committee made LTIP awards to Executive Directors and senior managers 
on 28 February 2017 with performance conditions based on TSR and EPS 
growth with a discretionary ROCE underpin. Share awards made to Executive 
Directors under the LTIP are subject to a further two year holding period 
following a three year performance period.
•  The 2017 AGM approved the Company’s 2016 Annual Report on 
Remuneration with over 99% of shareholders voting in favour of the Report 
which was in accordance with the Remuneration Policy approved by 
shareholders in 2014.
•  The Remuneration Committee approved the structure of the 2018 Annual 
Bonus Plan to ensure that it motivates Executive Directors to deliver against 
challenging financial targets for 2018. Its structure is the same combination 
of both financial targets (Group adjusted profit before tax* and operating 
cash flow* generation) and personal objectives as was used in 2017.  
We will disclose financial targets for the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan against 
actual performance in the 2018 Remuneration report along with a 
commentary on our assessment of the personal objectives element.
Committee priorities for 2018  
The Committee in 2018 will focus on the following matters:
•  Securing shareholder approval at the 2018 AGM for the Annual Report  
on Remuneration. 
•  Granting LTIP awards in 2018 to support our strategic growth targets with 
appropriately stretching performance conditions based on the Company’s 
EPS and TSR performance and with a ROCE underpin.
•  Ensuring that the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan is structured to drive performance, 
with stretching financial performance targets, and to reward growth in  
the Company. 
•  Considering the impact and actions necessary to address proposed changes 
to the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to Directors’ remuneration 
and other matters that is currently under consultation by the Financial 
Reporting Council and that is likely to be implemented for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual Remuneration Report will be put to the Company’s shareholders  
for an advisory vote at the AGM to be held on Tuesday 15 May 2018.  
I encourage all shareholders to vote in favour of this resolution and I look 
forward to the opportunity to meet with shareholders at the 2018 AGM.

Base 
salary
Base salary is set at 
a level to secure the 
services of talented 
Executive Directors 
with the ability to 
develop and deliver 
a growth strategy.
Fixed contractual cash amount 
usually paid monthly in arrears.
Normally reviewed annually, with 
any increases taking effect from  
1 January each year, although the 
Committee may award increases 
at other times of the year if it 
considers it appropriate.
This review is dependent 
on continued satisfactory 
performance in the role of  
an Executive Director.
It also includes a number of other 
factors, including experience, 
development and delivery of 
Group strategy and Group 
profitability, as well as external 
market conditions and pay 
awards across the Company.
The Committee has not set a maximum level 
of salary and the Committee will usually award 
salary increases in line with average increases 
awarded across the Company.
Larger increases may, in certain 
circumstances, be awarded where the 
Committee considers that there is a genuine 
commercial reason to do so, for example:
•  where there is a significant increase in the 
Executive Director’s role and duties;
•  where an Executive Director’s salary falls 
significantly below market positioning;
•  where there is significant change in the 
profitability of the Company or material 
change in market conditions; and
•  where an Executive Director was recruited 
on a lower than market salary and is being 
transitioned to a more market standard 
package as he or she gains experience.
Not applicable.
Benefits To provide Executive
Directors with
ancillary benefits
to assist them in
carrying out their
duties effectively.
Executive Directors are entitled 
to a range of benefits including 
car allowance, private health 
insurance and life assurance.
Other ancillary benefits may also 
be provided where relevant, 
such as expatriate travel or 
accommodation allowances.
Executive Directors are entitled 
to participate on the same 
terms as all UK employees in 
the Sharesave Plan or any other 
relevant all-employee share plan.
There is no maximum level of benefits 
set, given that the cost of certain benefits 
will depend on the individual’s particular 
circumstances. However, benefits are set at 
an amount which the Committee considers 
to be appropriate, based on individual 
circumstances and local market practice.
Executive Directors’ participation in the UK 
all-employee Sharesave Plan is capped by the 
rules of the Sharesave Plan (currently £350 
per month maximum).

Annual 
bonus
To provide a 
material incentive 
to drive Executive 
Directors to deliver 
stretching strategic 
and financial 
performance and 
to grow long-
term sustainable 
shareholder value.
Half of any earned 
annual bonus is 
deferred into the 
Deferred Bonus Plan 
and focuses the 
Executive Director 
on long-term value 
delivery and growth.
Paid annually based on performance in 
the relevant financial year. The amount is 
determined based on published full year 
results after the financial year end.
Award levels and performance measures are 
reviewed annually. The Committee ensures 
that performance measures remain aligned 
to the Company’s business objectives and 
strategic priorities for the year.
Half of the annual bonus paid after tax is 
deferred into awards under the Deferred 
Bonus Plan for a period of three years on 
a mandatory basis unless the Committee 
determines an alternative deferral period is 
appropriate.
After a period of three years, the awards are 
paid out to Directors in the form of shares in 
the Company.
The Committee retains full discretion to amend 
the bonus payout (upwards or downwards), 
if in its opinion any calculation of payout does 
not produce a fair result for either the individual 
or the Company, taking into account the 
overall business performance of the Company. 
Any such use of discretion will be clearly 
reported in the next published  
Remuneration Report.
Participants may also receive the value of 
any dividends which would have been paid 
on shares in respect of which the award 
vests, which may be calculated assuming 
reinvestment of the dividends in the 
Company’s shares on a cumulative basis.
In the event of any material misstatement of 
the Company’s financial results or serious 
reputational damage to the Company caused 
by a breach of the Company’s Code of Conduct 
or otherwise, the Committee may reduce, 
cancel or impose further conditions on awards.
An absolute 
maximum of 125% 
of base salary to be 
paid in each year.
Measures and targets for the 
annual bonus are set annually 
by the Committee.
Currently, half of the annual 
bonus is based on the 
achievement of annual targets 
set against the Group’s 
adjusted profit before tax*,  
with the remainder based on 
the achievement of annual 
personal objectives and 
achievement of annual targets 
set against the Group’s 
operating cash flow* generated 
as a percentage of adjusted 
operating profit*.
The Committee reserves the 
right to vary these proportions 
and also the measures annually 
to ensure the annual bonus 
remains appropriate and 
challenging.
Targets are measured over a 
one year period. Payments 
range between 0% and 125% 
of base salary for threshold and 
maximum performance.
Awards granted under the 
Deferred Bonus Plan are not 
subject to any performance 
conditions.

Long Term 
Incentive 
Plan  
(“LTIP”)
To provide a long- 
term performance 
and retention 
incentive for the 
Executive Directors 
involving the 
Company’s shares.
To link long-term 
rewards to the 
creation of long-
term sustainable 
shareholder value 
by way of delivering 
on the Group’s 
agreed strategic 
objectives.
Under the LTIP , awards are made over a fixed 
number of shares, which will vest based on 
the achievement of performance conditions 
over a performance period of, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise, at least 
three years. The performance conditions 
are set by the Committee at the start of the 
performance period. Awards can take the 
form of a conditional award of shares,  
a nil-cost option or similar rights.
Awards may be settled in cash.
Participants may also receive the value of 
any dividends which would have been paid 
on shares in respect of which the award 
vests, which may be calculated assuming 
reinvestment of the dividends in the 
Company’ s shares on a cumulative basis. 
Awards made since 2015 are subject to a 
mandatory two year holding period for any 
shares that vest for an Executive Director.
In the event of any material misstatement of 
the Company’ s financial results or serious 
reputational damage to the Company caused 
by a breach of the Company’ s Code of 
Conduct or otherwise, the Committee  
may reduce or impose further conditions  
on awards.
The maximum value of 
shares over which awards 
may be granted in respect 
of each year is 150% of 
base salary (although 
200% is permitted in 
exceptional circumstances 
determined by the 
Committee).
Awards to Executive 
Directors in 2018 will be at 
a level representing 125% 
of base salary.
LTIP awards may be based on both financial and 
share price based performance conditions as 
determined from time to time by the Committee. 
LTIP awards from 2017 onwards have 33% of the 
award subject to the Company’s TSR compared 
to a comparator group measured over a three 
year performance period and 67% of the award 
subject to targets set against growth (adjusted by 
the Committee as it considers appropriate) in the 
Company’s adjusted basic earnings per share* 
over the same performance period. However 
the Committee reserves the right to change the 
balance of the measures as it deems appropriate, 
such that no measure accounts for less than 25% 
of the total award. For LTIP awards from 2017 
onwards the Remuneration Committee has also 
adopted a discretionary underpin on vesting of 
the LTIP , whereby the Committee will assess the 
Group’s underlying performance in finalising vesting 
outcomes. In particular the Committee will assess 
the Group’s ROCE performance when approving 
outcomes under the EPS element of awards.
At threshold, 25% of the award will vest, increasing 
on a straight-line basis up to 100% for performance 
in line with maximum. Below threshold none of the 
award will vest.
There is no re-testing of any performance measure.
Pension 
contribution
To provide 
a benefit 
comparable with 
market rates, 
helping with 
the recruitment 
and retention of 
talented Executive 
Directors able 
to deliver a 
long-term growth 
strategy.
Usually paid monthly in arrears.
Executive Directors may receive a 
contribution into the Company’s Defined 
Contribution Plan, a personal pension 
arrangement and/or a payment as a  
cash allowance.
Executive Directors 
appointed before 2017 
receive a pension 
contribution of 20% of 
base salary. Executive 
Directors appointed from 
2017 onwards receive a 
pension contribution of 
15% of base salary.
Salary is the only 
pensionable element 
of Executive Director 
remuneration.
Not applicable.
Notes to the remuneration policy table for Executive Directors
Under the Company’s share plans the Committee may: (1) in the event of any variation of the 
Company’s share capital, demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event which may affect the 
price of shares, adjust or amend awards in accordance with the terms of the plan; and (2) amend 
a performance condition if an event occurs which causes it to consider an amended condition 
would be more appropriate and not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Legacy plans
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of 
office notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out above where the terms of the 
payment were agreed: (1) before the policy came into effect; or (2) at a time when the relevant 
individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment 
was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes 
payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an 
award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
Performance measures
The Annual Bonus Plan is based on both personal and financial measures. Typically, the majority  
of the bonus will be based on financial measures such as Group adjusted profit before tax*.  
The measures have been chosen to provide a balance between incentivising the delivery of the 
Group’s key financial priorities in any particular year and important individual strategic objectives. 
The Committee may vary the specific measures and targets year-on-year to ensure that they 
reflect the key financial and strategic priorities for the Company in any given year.
LTIP awards from 2017 onwards are based 67% on adjusted basic earnings per share* growth 
and 33% on TSR performance against a specific comparator group. The Committee considers 
these to be important measures of Company performance over the longer term. While TSR links  
a portion of the LTIP to the creation of value for shareholders, adjusted basic earnings per share* 
growth is a key performance indicator for the Group with the combination providing an appropriate 
balance between growth and returns. For LTIP awards from 2017 onwards, the Committee has 
adopted a discretionary underpin on vesting of the LTIP , whereby the Committee will assess the 
Group’s underlying performance in finalising vesting outcomes. In particular the Committee will 
assess the Group’s ROCE performance when approving outcomes under the EPS element of 
awards. While we will not be disclosing a formulaic target in advance, the Committee will ensure 
that it provides full retrospective disclosure around our decision-making process, including a 
summary of the ROCE trajectory over the performance period. The Committee will measure ROCE 
using a standard definition of adjusted operating profit* divided by average total assets less current 
liabilities excluding the current portion of interest-bearing borrowings, calculated on an average 
monthly basis at constant currency. Any changes to these measures will be aligned with the 
long-term strategy of the Group.
Provisions for the withholding and recovery of sums from the Directors are as set out in the table 
above and on page 89.

The V itec Group plc           Role Purpose Operation
Chairman To recruit and retain an independent Non-Executive 
Chairman reflecting the responsibilities and time 
commitment for the role. To lead an effective Board 
enabling the delivery on the Group’s growth strategy 
and creation of long-term sustainable shareholder value.
While the Board has not set a maximum level of fee payable to the Chairman, the Board 
will review the level of fee paid usually on an annual basis and determine whether that is 
sufficient in terms of market conditions and also the time commitment for the role.
The Chairman’s fee is an all-inclusive consolidated amount. It is paid in cash, not shares, 
usually on a monthly basis in arrears.
Fees are benchmarked against FTSE-listed companies of a similar size and complexity to 
Vitec. Any future increases will take into account the need to ensure that the fee remains 
competitive and reflects the time commitment for the role.
The Chairman’s remuneration also covers his chairmanship of the Nominations Committee.
Non-
Executive 
Director
To recruit and retain independent Non-Executive 
Directors reflecting the responsibilities and time 
commitment for the role to contribute to an effective 
Board and to deliver on the Group’s growth strategy 
and creation of long-term sustainable shareholder value.
Fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of the Company consist of the following:
• A base fee;
• An additional fee for the role of the Senior Independent Director; and
• An additional fee for chairing the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
Fees are usually reviewed annually and are benchmarked against FTSE-listed companies 
of a similar size and complexity to Vitec. Fees are typically increased in line with annual 
salary increases for the Executive Directors. All fees are paid in cash, not shares, usually 
on a monthly basis in arrears.
Any future increases will take into account the need to ensure that the fee remains 
competitive and reflects the time commitment for the role. The Board has not imposed a 
maximum level of fee payable.
Benefits To reimburse Non-Executive Directors for reasonable 
expenses incurred and bear any costs associated with 
tax, where relevant.
Expenses are reimbursed as and when incurred relating to the Company’s business 
(including travel and hotel accommodation).
Remuneration policy table for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The table below sets out a description of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration for the period through to the 2020 AGM.

The V itec Group plc           Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere  
in the Company
The Committee, when determining Executive Directors’ remuneration, takes 
into account remuneration and employment terms and conditions, including 
levels of pay for all employees of the Company. The Committee is kept 
informed of:
• Salary increases for the general employee population
•  Company-wide benefits including pensions, share incentives, bonus 
arrangements and other ancillary benefits
• Overall spend on annual bonus
• Participation levels and outcomes in the annual bonus plan and the LTIP 
When setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Committee  
has regard to general employment terms and conditions within the Company 
as set out above. However, it is recognised that the roles and responsibilities 
of Executive Directors are such that different levels of remuneration apply,  
with a greater proportion of remuneration tied to the financial performance of 
the Company. The Committee did not consult with the Company’s employees 
when drawing up the Directors’ Remuneration Policy set out in this report.
Policy on outside appointments
The Committee believes it is beneficial both for the individual and the 
Company for an Executive Director to take up one external non-executive 
appointment. Remuneration received by an Executive Director in respect of 
such an external appointment would be retained by the Director. Stephen Bird 
is an independent Non-Executive Director of Dialight plc. In this role he 
receives a basic fee of £42,000 per annum, an additional £5,100 per annum 
in the role of Senior Independent Director and £5,100 as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. Under the terms of their service contracts, Kath 
Kearney-Croft and Martin Green, with the agreement of the Chairman and 
Group Chief Executive, may take up one external non-executive appointment 
of a listed company. As of the date of this report neither Kath Kearney-Croft 
nor Martin Green had taken up any such external non-executive appointment.
Executive Directors’ service contracts
The Executive Directors’ service contracts are as follows: 
Details of the Committee’s approach and policy on payment for loss of 
office are given in full in the 2016 Remuneration Policy Report and are 
available on the Company’s website.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts 
but serve under letters of appointment.
The initial period of their appointments is three years but their 
appointments may, by mutual consent and with the approval of the 
Nominations Committee and the Board, be extended for a further three 
years. Appointments may be extended beyond six years by mutual consent 
and with the approval of the Nominations Committee and the Board, if it is 
in the interest of the Company to do so. Under the letters of appointment 
notice can be given by either party upon one month’s written notice. Apart 
from the disclosure under the Remuneration Policy table for the Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors there are no further obligations which could 
give rise to a remuneration or loss of office payment under the letters of 
appointment. All the Non-Executive Directors and Chairman (as well as  
the Executive Directors) are subject to annual reappointment by the 
shareholders at the AGM.
Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts, Chairman’s and each 
Non-Executive Director’s letters of appointment are available on our website.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee has continued to take into account the views of its 
shareholders concerning the policy on remuneration of Directors.
The Company received over 99% support for the 2016 Remuneration Policy 
Report and over 99% support for the 2016 Annual Report on Remuneration  
at the 2017 AGM indicating a strong level of support for the structure of 
Directors’ remuneration.
During 2017, the Committee continued to take into account the views of the 
Company’s major shareholders on the structure of the Remuneration Policy 
with a view to the Policy being submitted to shareholders for approval at the 
2017 AGM. This entailed a consultation letter setting out the structure and 
several face-to-face meetings with major shareholders to review the detail  
in the latter part of 2016 and early 2017. This consultation was on the basis 
that the current policy was fit for purpose and achieved the objectives of 
incentivising management in the delivery of the Company’s growth strategy.  
A summary of the Policy is set out earlier in this Report and the strong level  
of support from shareholders indicates that the Committee and shareholders 
are aligned on the issue of Directors’ remuneration.
The Committee further took into consideration the views of shareholders in  
its treatment in connection with the resignation of Paul Hayes, particularly  
the lapsing of LTIP awards and also in the recruitment and remuneration 
packages of both Martin Green and Kath Kearney-Croft, appointed in 2017.

Notes: 
1. Benefits includes car allowance, healthcare cover and income protection.
2.  Stephen Bird receives a pension contribution of 20% of base salary. Both Kath 
Kearney-Croft and Martin Green receive a pension contribution of 15% of base 
salary. Each Executive Director currently takes this contribution in the form of  
a cash payment.
3.  For the Annual Bonus 2017, Stephen Bird and Martin Green’s bonus potential was 
125% of base salary. Kath Kearney-Croft’s bonus potential was also 125% of base 
salary but pro-rated from her start date of 24 April 2017. Further details are set out 
in the “Further notes” section on the following page.
4.  Long-term incentives comprise LTIP awards. Awards made in 2015 achieved in  
part performance conditions based on TSR and growth in adjusted basic earnings  
per share*. Long-Term Incentives – 2015 LTIP to vest at 67.5%, share price  
as at 31 December 2017 of £11.30 and associated dividend shares paid  
on shares vesting (76.9 pence per share). The 2018 Remuneration Report will  
reflect updated final values. Awards made in 2014 did not achieve their performance 
conditions also based on the same performance conditions and therefore lapsed. 
Further details on the vesting of the 2015 LTIP awards are set out in the “Further 
notes” section on the following pages.
5.  Each Director has confirmed in writing to the Company that the information in the 
single figure remuneration table is correct and that they have not received from  
the Company any other items of remuneration other than disclosed.

remuneration table (audited)
(1) Base salary
The table below shows base salaries for 2017: 
(2) Benefits
The single figure of total remuneration table sets out the total value of benefits 
received by each Executive Director in 2017. Details are as follows: 
(3) Pension allowance
The table below sets out the value of the cash payment in lieu of pension for 
each Executive Director in 2017: 
(4) Annual bonus
In 2017, each Executive Director was entitled to receive, subject to performance, 
a maximum bonus of up to 125% of base salary, half of which is deferred into 
the Deferred Bonus Plan. Kath Kearney-Croft’s bonus potential was pro-rated 
from her appointment date of 24 April 2017. Paul Hayes was not entitled to  
any bonus payment for 2017 due to his departure on 28 April 2017.
The financial elements of the annual bonus plan for each Executive Director 
were based upon actual financial results achieved for Group adjusted profit 
before tax* and Group conversion of adjusted operating profit* into operating 
cash flow* (over a quarterly and full year average target) measured against 
financial targets set by the Board. The Group adjusted profit before tax* 
financial element represents 50% of the maximum bonus that could be 
earned and the Group conversion of adjusted operating profit* into operating 
cash flow* represents 25% of the maximum bonus that could be earned.
Under the rules of the annual bonus plan there is a link between the two 
financial performance conditions so that the conversion of adjusted operating 
profit* into operating cash flow* element will only pay out if the Group adjusted 
profit before tax* element has at least achieved threshold performance.
The Remuneration Committee considered that these two financial 
performance conditions are key financial measures for the Group driving the 
right behaviour in terms of achieving adjusted profit before tax* and operating 
cash flow* generation and had the most direct impact upon shareholder value 
for the year ended 31 December 2017.

The V itec Group plc           A straight line sliding scale operates between each of the above trigger points 
for both financial targets. The Remuneration Committee considered that these 
trigger points were appropriate and sufficiently stretching for 2017 given the 
uncertain macroeconomic environment, challenging markets that the Group 
faced, strategic objectives and performance in the prior year.
For the conversion of adjusted operating profit* into operating cash flow* 
element of annual bonus, trigger points and performance are measured  
over a quarterly and full year average. The table above shows the full year 
performance and equivalent trigger points only.
Under the rules of the Annual Bonus Plan the Remuneration Committee  
retains a full and absolute discretion as to whether a bonus is payable or not, 
and that discretion may only be used in exceptional circumstances, taking into 
account the overall financial performance of the Company. Any use of this 
discretion in connection with an Executive Director will be clearly explained in 
the Remuneration Report. For the 2017 Annual Bonus Plan the Remuneration 
Committee determined the following treatment of disposals and acquisitions 
made during 2017:-
Group Adjusted PBT Element
•  For the disposals of Haigh-Farr and the US Services business (Bexel) 
– actual and budgeted results from 1 January 2017 to the respective 
 dates of disposal were excluded from the financial targets.
•  For the acquisition of the JOBY and Lowepro brands and RTMotion – their 
actual results and base case financials for the acquisitions were included in 
the financial results from the dates of acquisition until 31 December 2017.
•  JOBY and Lowepro integration costs were excluded from both actual results 
and base case for the 2017 Annual Bonus Scheme.
Group conversion of adjusted operating profit* into operating cash flow*
•  For the disposals of Haigh-Farr and Bexel, the US Services business –  
their actual and budgeted cash conversion was excluded from  
financial targets.
•  For the acquisition of the JOBY and Lowepro brands and RTMotion –  
excluded the businesses from measurement of Group cash conversion given 
that there was only three months left of the year and that the calculation 
involves an average of annual and quarterly cash conversion measures.
Half of the 2017 annual bonus will be deferred into the Deferred Bonus Plan. 
The 2017 deferred bonus will be used to purchase core award shares to be 
held in trust for a three year period. No matching award shares can be earned 
under the Deferred Bonus Plan. After three years, the core award shares plus 
any dividends accrued on the core award are released from the Trust to the 
Executive Directors. 
The Committee determined the treatment as detailed above was merited as  
the acquisitions and disposals were strongly in line with agreed Group strategy 
and executed well. The Committee considered that the best interests of the 
Company performance overall were served by ensuring that the executives were 
incentivised to deliver the restructuring savings resulting from the acquisitions 
as quickly as possible and that therefore they should be removed from the 
calculations. The Committee, as part of this decision, took into account share 
price growth, growth in adjusted PBT and dividends paid, reduction in Group  
Net Debt and improvement in the Group’s ROCE performance.
2017 Annual Bonus Outcome 
The table below sets out the annual bonus awards made to Executive Directors in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017 including the financial trigger 
points used in determining whether a bonus was payable. Paul Hayes did not receive any bonus for 2017 due to leaving the Company on 28 April 2017.

(5) Long-term incentives – Long Term Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”) and Deferred Bonus Plan (“DBP”)
The long-term incentive awards value shown in the single figure of total 
remuneration table relate to the following awards:
Awards made in 2015 and vesting in respect of performance to  
31 December 2017
These relate to awards made in 2015 under the LTIP . Awards are measured 
based 50% upon the Company’s TSR measured against a comparator group 
and 50% subject to growth in the Company’s adjusted basic earnings per 
share*. Each performance condition is entirely independent from the other 
performance condition and there is no retesting of either performance 
condition. The detail of each performance condition for each award is  
set out below.
For that part of an LTIP award made in 2015 measured against TSR, if the 
Company’s TSR performance is at the median of the comparator group at the 
end of the three year performance period, 25% of that element of an award 
may vest. The full element of an award may vest if the Company’s TSR 
performance is in the top 25% of the comparator group. There is a pro-rata 
straight line vesting between these two points. The comparator group 
comprises the constituents of the FTSE 250 index (excluding financial services 
companies and investment trusts) over a three year performance period.  
The Remuneration Committee considered that this index has a greater level  
of complexity and internationality and was most comparable to Vitec’s 
business operations where approximately 90% of revenues are  
generated outside of the UK.
For that part of an LTIP award made in 2015 measured against EPS growth,  
if the percentage growth in the EPS of the Company exceeds 6% per annum 
(Compound Average Annual Growth Rate), 25% of that element of an award 
may vest. Full vesting of an award occurs if the growth in EPS over the 
performance period exceeds 12% (Compound Average Annual Growth Rate) 
or greater. There is a pro-rata straight line vesting between these two points.
An award lapses if the lower point under both performance conditions is not 
achieved during the performance period.
The Remuneration Committee also considered the underlying financial 
performance of the Company before it confirmed vesting.
Performance out-turn
The table below summarises the value of awards vesting for the 2015 award.
TSR is calculated on the basis of growth in the Company’s share price over  
a three year performance period plus dividends paid during that period and  
is expressed as a percentage of average compound annual growth. Share 
price performance is averaged over three months at the start and end of  
a performance period to eliminate volatility that may result in anomalous 
outcomes. The TSR performance is independently verified by Mercer on behalf 
of the Committee and is ranked against the comparator group companies’ 
TSR performance to determine the outcome.
EPS is determined in accordance with note 2.5 of the Financial statements  
on page 114. As part of the assessment of EPS performance the Committee 
adopted a policy of:- (i) including disposed businesses in all years during the 
performance period up until the date of disposal; (ii) including all acquisitions 
of businesses during the performance period from the date of their acquisition; 
(iii) excluding integration costs for JOBY and Lowepro incurred in 2017; and (iv) 
excluding integration costs for JOBY and Lowepro entirely in 2018 on the basis 
that they are excluded from adjusted earnings (see page 150). While other 
treatments were possible, the Committee considered that this treatment  
was appropriate, consistent with past treatment and best reflected the  
true underlying performance of the business.
The Remuneration Committee has confirmed that 2015 awards will therefore 
vest at a level of 67.5% on the third anniversary of the awards on 8 April 
2018. Indicative values for vesting awards for the Executive Directors are 
shown in the Remuneration Table on page 78. Final values will be reported  
in 2018’s Remuneration Report.
Awards made in 2014 and vesting in respect of performance to  
31 December 2016
These relate to awards made in 2014 under the LTIP and DBP . The 
performance conditions for these awards are the same as those made in 
2015. The EPS growth targets were 6% growth per annum (Compound 
Average Annual Growth Rate) for 25% of that element of an award to vest  
and 12% or more growth per annum for full vesting respectively. The 
Remuneration Committee also considered the underlying financial 
performance of the Company before it confirmed vesting.
As disclosed in last year’s report, both performance conditions were measured 
to 31 December 2016 and the final outcome resulted in 0% of the TSR and 
EPS elements vesting. As a consequence the 2014 LTIP awards lapsed on 2 
April 2017 and the DBP matching award shares lapsed on 31 March 2017.

The V itec Group plc           Other outstanding awards made in 2016 and vesting in respect of 
performance to 31 December 2018
For awards made in 2016, 50% of an award is subject to TSR with the 
Company’s TSR performance ranked against the constituents of the FTSE 250 
index (excluding financial services companies and investment trusts) over  
a three year performance period. Threshold performance for the TSR 
performance condition will be at the median point of the comparator group 
and will result in 25% of an award vesting. Full vesting for the TSR element 
will be at the upper quartile point of the comparator group. A straight line 
sliding scale will operate between each of the above points. Below threshold 
performance none of the award will vest.
50% of the award will be subject to EPS growth over a three year performance 
period. For awards made in 2016 the adjusted EPS* growth figures were set at 
5% compound average per annum for 25% vesting and 12% plus compound 
average per annum for full vesting. A straight line sliding scale will operate 
between each of the above points and below 5% adjusted EPS* compound 
average growth none of the award will vest. Subject to satisfaction of performance 
conditions to 31 December 2018, these awards will vest in March 2019.
Awards made in 2017 and vesting in respect of performance to 31 
December 2019
The table below provides details of the awards made under the LTIP on 28 
February 2017 to Stephen Bird and Martin Green. Kath Kearney-Croft’s LTIP 
award was made on 15 May 2017 following her appointment as Group 
Finance Director on 24 April 2017. Performance for these awards is measured 
over the three financial years from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019.  
As reported to shareholders in the 2016 Annual Report while the performance 
conditions of TSR and EPS growth targets remain, awards in 2017 and in the 
future have been re-balanced so that the split in performance conditions is 
changed to 33%/67% between TSR and EPS respectively. Vesting will be 
underpinned by Remuneration Committee discretion that will take into 
account, in particular, Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) performance  
over the performance period for the EPS element of the award.
Under the EPS element the performance required for threshold vesting (25%  
of this part of the award) is adjusted EPS* growth of 6% per annum. Full vesting  
of this part of the award required adjusted EPS* growth of 14% plus per annum,  
with a straight line sliding scale between these two points. None of this part of  
the award will vest for adjusted EPS* absolute growth lower than 6% per annum.
TSR is calculated on the basis of growth in the Company’s share price over  
a three year performance period plus dividends paid during that period and  
is expressed as a percentage of average compound annual growth. Share 
price performance is averaged over three months at the start and end of a 
performance period to eliminate volatility that may result in anomalous 
outcomes. The TSR performance is independently verified by Mercer on behalf 
of the Committee and is ranked against the comparator group companies’ 
TSR performance to determine the outcome. The same targets apply for 
vesting under TSR as in 2016 and 2015.
Dividends that would have been paid on shares vesting under the LTIP during 
the performance period are reinvested in additional shares for each of the 
above awards. There is no retesting of any performance condition under any 
of the above awards.

fees in 2017:
Fees for the Chairman, Non-Executive Directors, Committee Chairmen and 
Senior Independent Director roles are reviewed annually by the Board with  
the support of Mercer providing market data to ensure that fees remain 
appropriate given time commitment and the need to attract the right 
experience for the role. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do  
not receive any other benefits from the Company.
Directors’ Shareholding Requirements and  
Share Interests (audited)
The Board has determined that Executive Directors of the Company are 
required to build up, over a reasonable period of time, a substantial holding of 
shares in the Company of at least one times base salary. A reasonable period 
is considered to be the life of a performance period tied to an award vesting 
under the Company’s LTIP or DBP . Stephen Bird and Martin Green met this 
requirement throughout the whole of 2017 and up to the date of this report. 
Kath Kearney-Croft having been appointed Group Finance Director on 24 April 
2017 is building a shareholding towards this requirement. Other members of 
the Operations Executive are encouraged to do the same up to a level of 50% 
of base salary.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors of the Company have no such 
requirement and have discretion as to whether to hold shares in the Company 
or not. The following table sets out the interests in the ordinary shares of the 
Company held by each Director (or connected persons) of the Company during 
the year ended 31 December 2017.
Executive Director’s shareholdings as at 31 December 2017 
(audited)
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ shareholdings as 
at 31 December 2017 (audited)
1.  The closing mid-market share price on 31 December 2017 was £11.30 and the 
calculation of the percentage shareholding requirement achieved for the Executive 
Directors is based on this closing mid-market share price.
2.  The shares shown in the beneficial holdings table above were acquired by the 
Directors using their own funds and not through any share incentive scheme (or 
similar) with the exception of the following disclosures in notes 3,4 and 5 below.

Long Term Incentive Plan (audited)
Each year the Executive Directors are made a conditional award of shares in the Company. Up until 2015 this had been at a level representing 100% of annual 
base salary, based on the three day average closing mid-market share price of the Company in the period just prior to the award. From 2015, awards to 
Executive Directors have been increased to a level representing 125% of annual base salary to partly compensate for the removal of the matching share award 
element under the Deferred Bonus Plan (as disclosed in the 2014 Annual Report). The Executive Directors at that time agreed to waive this increase in 2015. 
The award is subject to satisfaction of performance conditions over a three year performance period. The following table sets out the outstanding awards under 
the LTIP as at 31 December 2017 for the Executive Directors:
(1)
  The LTIP award made on 2 April 2014 did not achieve either of its performance conditions based on adjusted EPS* growth and TSR performance compared to a comparator 
group. As a consequence the award lapsed on its third anniversary of 2 April 2017.
(2)
  The LTIP award made on 8 April 2015 has achieved 100% of the TSR performance condition and 35% of the Adjusted EPS* growth performance condition, resulting in a blended  
level of vesting of 67.5%. As a consequence 67.5% of this award, plus associated dividend shares, will vest on its third anniversary of 8 April 2018. Details of the estimated  
associated value are shown in the remuneration table for the year ended 31 December 2017 on page 78.
(3)
 The LTIP awards to Martin Green for 2014, 2015 and 2016 were made before he was appointed a director on 4 January 2017 and are reported for completeness.

The V itec Group plc           Deferred Bonus Plan (audited)
Each year, Executive Directors are required to defer a proportion of their annual bonus into the DBP . No matching awards can be earned on deferred shares 
since 2014. Kath Kearney-Croft having been appointed on 24 April 2017 does not currently participate in the Deferred Bonus Plan.
(1)
  The DBP award made on 31 March 2014 did not achieve either of its performance conditions based on EPS growth and TSR performance compared to the comparator group.  
As a consequence the matching award lapsed on its third anniversary of 31 March 2017.
(2)  
The DBP core award made on 16 April 2015 will vest on its third anniversary of 16 April 2018. The core award plus associated dividend shares will be paid out to the participant 
on this anniversary.
(3)  
Martin Green’s DBP award relates to a bonus period prior to his appointment as an Executive Director of the Company.

Annual Report on Remuneration
Performance graph of the Company’s ordinary  
shares compared to comparator group 
Since 2013, the Company is required to include a line graph showing the 
Company’s ordinary share performance compared to an appropriate index 
initially over a five year period, but building up to a ten year performance 
period. The graph below illustrates the Company’s annual Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) (share price growth plus dividends that have been declared, 
paid and reinvested in the Company’s shares) relative to the FTSE 250 for  
the preceding eight year period, assuming an initial investment of £100.  
This index has been chosen since it is the comparator group (excluding 
financial services companies and investment trusts) for one of the 
performance conditions tied to awards under the LTIP . The Committee  
notes that the FTSE 250 index is a recognised broad market equity index, 
relatively complex and international in nature and is comparable to the 
Company’s business operations where approximately 90% of revenues  
are generated outside the UK.
Each point is a 30 trading day average of the indices. TSR data is taken  
from Datastream.
Percentage change in remuneration of the Group   
Chief Executive 
The table below sets out a comparison of the following elements of remuneration 
paid to the Group Chief Executive, Stephen Bird, in the year ended 31 December 
2017 compared to the year ended 31 December 2016 and compared to that of 
UK based employees: Annual Salary; Taxable Benefits; and Annual Bonus. The 
Remuneration Committee has selected this comparator group on the basis that 
the Group Chief Executive is UK based and this provides a local market reference, 
is a sizeable population and a fair representation of the Group’s employee base.

The V itec Group plc           Statement of Implementation of Remuneration Policy  
in the Year Ending 31 December 2018
This section provides an overview of how the Committee is proposing to 
implement the Remuneration Policy in 2018.
(1) Base salary
The table sets out the 2018 base salary for each Executive Director, together  
with the percentage increase from 2017:
In determining the increases for 2018, the Committee took into account a 
number of factors, including Company and individual performance, the 
executive’s responsibilities and experience, pay increases for the Company’s 
employees, market rates for Executive Director remuneration, the need for 
retention of a talented executive team and prevailing economic conditions.
(2) Benefits
The car allowance taxable benefit has been increased in line with base salary 
increases for 2018. The other taxable benefits of private healthcare and 
income protection are respectively premium and contractually based. 
(3) Pension allowance
Pension allowances paid to Executive Directors are set out in the table below. 
Stephen Bird’s allowance represents 20% of his base salary. For any 
Executive Director appointed since 1 January 2017, the pension allowance 
has been set at 15% of base salary.
(4) Annual Bonus
The maximum opportunity remains unchanged at 125% of base salary. Half of 
any net after tax annual bonus earned for the year ended 31 December 2018 
will be deferred into the DBP for a period of three years and held in the form 
of shares in the Company. There will be no matching award that can be 
earned on this deferred bonus. The table below provides information on the 
performance measures against which performance for the 2018 annual  
bonus plan will be measured:
The performance measures selected reflect the strategic and operational 
objectives of the Group. The Committee considers that the specific targets and 
personal objectives for 2018 are commercially sensitive and therefore has not 
disclosed them. The Committee will disclose these targets and objectives once 
a bonus has been paid and subject to the Committee considering that they are 
no longer commercially sensitive.
(5) Long Term Incentive Plan
Stephen Bird, Kath Kearney-Croft and Martin Green will each receive an award 
of shares under the LTIP equivalent to 125% of base salary in 2018. These 
awards will be made in the 42 day period following the announcement of the  
full year results for the year ended 31 December 2017 that will be announced 
on 22 February 2018. The performance conditions for the LTIP awards to be 
granted in 2018 will be as follows: 67% of the award will be subject to adjusted 
basic earnings per share* growth over a three year performance period. The 
Remuneration Committee has determined that the EPS targets for threshold and 
maximum vesting levels for 2018 will be 81.1 pence and 100.9 pence to be 
achieved in the year ending 31 December 2020, equivalent to 6% and 14%  
per annum growth over the three year performance period. The remaining 33% 
of the award will be subject to TSR with the Company’s TSR performance ranked 
against the constituents of the FTSE 250 index (excluding financial services 
companies and investment trusts) over a three year performance period. Vesting 
will be underpinned by Committee discretion that will take into account, in 
particular, ROCE performance over the performance period for the EPS element 
of the award. Any awards vesting under the LTIP 2018, after deduction of taxes, 
will be subject to a further two year holding period, thereby more closely aligning 
their interests with the long-term interests of shareholders.
Malus and clawback
Under the rules of the Annual Bonus Plan, LTIP and DBP , awards are subject to 
a malus rule whereby the Remuneration Committee has the power to reduce, 
cancel or impose further conditions upon a bonus or award in circumstances 
that the Committee determines such action is appropriate including 
circumstances where a material misstatement of the Company’s audited 
financial results has occurred or serious reputational damage to the Company 
has occurred as a result of a participant having breached the Company’s Code 
of Conduct. In addition, any award made since February 2015 under the 
above plans includes a clawback provision where in the same circumstances 
as for malus, any future award that is paid out can be clawed back from a 
participant for a period of up to three years from it vesting or being paid out.

(6) Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
The fee structure for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors for 2018  
is set out in the table below:
(1)
  The Chairman’s and Non-Executive Director’s base fee was increased by 2.5% with 
effect from 1 January 2018.
(2)
  The Chairman of the Audit Committee, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
and Senior Independent Director fees are reviewed annually to ensure that they 
remain appropriate taking into account the nature of each role, the time commitment, 
performance of the respective individuals, market conditions for the complexity of the 
roles and the calibre of individuals. The last increases for each of these roles were with 
effect from 1 January 2014.
The Board has agreed that the Chairman’s and basic Non-Executive Director 
fee will typically be increased in line with the level of salary increases given  
to Executive Directors on an annual basis in future years. The fees paid to the 
Senior Independent Director and Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees will be reviewed annually to ensure that they remain appropriate.
Voting at Annual General Meeting
At the Company’s last AGM held on 17 May 2017, shareholders were asked to 
vote on the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report and an advisory vote on the 
Directors’ Annual Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2016. 
The Policy Report set out the policy towards Directors’ remuneration for a three 
year period from the date of the 2017 AGM until 2020. Both the Policy Report 
and Annual Remuneration Report resolutions were approved by shareholders 
on a poll. The table below sets out the proxy votes voted for, against and 
withheld against each resolution.
 
As at the date of the Company’s AGM on 17 May 2017 the Company had 
44,744,200 ordinary shares in issue. The Remuneration Committee considers 
that an against or withheld vote of 20% or more of the votes cast is deemed  
to be significant in connection with a resolution on Directors’ remuneration. Based 
on the level of support at the 2017 AGM, the Committee did not consider that 
there were any significant issues of concern. In the event that a significant level  
of concern is raised at future AGMs, both the Chairman of the Board and the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee will contact the Company’s major 
shareholders following an AGM to understand the precise detail of the concern 
being raised. Subject to that, the Committee and the Board as a whole will 
consider how best to address the concern being raised. This may involve a 
revision to the Company’s Policy on Directors’ Remuneration at a subsequent 
AGM or some other change which can be implemented without further 
shareholder consultation. The Committee and the Board are committed to an 
open and transparent dialogue with shareholders on material matters of concern.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprised the following members during  
2017: Caroline Thomson – Chairman, Mark Rollins, Lorraine Rienecker and  
Christopher Humphrey.
All of the Committee members are independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines the policy, base salaries, 
annual cash bonus arrangements, participation in incentive schemes, pension 
arrangements and all other benefits received by the Executive Directors.
The Committee also oversees the framework of remuneration for the 
Operations Executive, including terms of service, pay structure, annual cash 
bonus, pensions, share incentive arrangements and all other benefits.
The Committee invites individuals to attend meetings, as it deems necessary,  
to assist with consideration of remuneration matters. The Chairman, John 
McDonough, the Group Chief Executive, Stephen Bird, the Group Finance 
Director, Kath Kearney-Croft, the Group Company Secretary, Jon Bolton and 
the Group Business Development Director, Martin Green, attended meetings 
by invitation in the year ended 31 December 2017. The Executive Directors  
or members of the Operations Executive are not present when their own 
remuneration is being considered.
The remuneration of the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors is 
determined by the Board as a whole, with the Chairman or the relevant 
Non-Executive Director abstaining when his or her remuneration is considered.
For further information regarding governance for the Remuneration Committee 
see pages 70 and 71 of this Annual Report.
External advisors
The Committee received independent advice from Mercer (formerly Kepler) as 
the Committee’s appointed remuneration advisor during 2017. During 2017 the 
level of fees paid to remuneration advisors totalled £19,565 (2016: £53,085) 
and this fee covered advice relating to disclosures in the 2016 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, measurement of performance conditions associated with 
long-term incentive arrangements, preparation of the 2017 Policy, consultation 
exercise with shareholders on the 2017 Policy and general remuneration 
advice. Mercer is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and 
operates under that group’s voluntary code of practice for remuneration 
consultants in the UK. The Committee is satisfied that the advice it received 
from Mercer during 2017 was objective and independent. The Committee also 
received advice and administrative support during 2017 from the Group 
Company Secretary, Jon Bolton, and the Group Business Development Director, 
Martin Green.

 Corporate Governance
 Financial Statements Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association set out the rights of shareholders 
including voting rights, distribution rights, attendance at general meetings, 
powers of directors, proceedings of directors as well as borrowing limits  
and other governance controls. A copy of the Articles of Association can  
be requested from the Group Company Secretary.
Conflicts of interest
During the year no Director held any beneficial interest in any contract 
significant to the Company’s business, other than a contract of employment. 
The Company has procedures set out in the Articles of Association for 
managing conflicts of interest. Should a Director become aware that they,  
or their connected parties, have an interest in an existing or proposed 
transaction with the Group, they are required to notify the Board as soon  
as reasonably practicable.
Political donations
Further to shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM empowering the Directors  
to make political donations, it is confirmed that no such donations were made 
in the year ended 31 December 2017. The Company’s policy is not to make 
political donations.
Financial instruments
The financial risk management objectives and policies of the Group and the 
exposure of the Group to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity 
risk are outlined in note 4.2 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 
129 and 130.
Going concern
The Directors have made appropriate enquiries and consider that the  
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future, which comprises the period of at least 12 months from  
the date of approval of the financial statements. There are no material 
uncertainties that would prevent the Directors from being unable to make  
this statement. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of the 
Annual Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group 
and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required  
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that 
period. In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;
•  for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable  
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial 
statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the 
parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets  
of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible  
for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and Corporate Governance statement that complies with that law  
and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
In addition, each of the Directors considers that the Annual Report, taken as  
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and that it provides all the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position  
and performance, business model and strategy.
Disclosure of information to the auditor 
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ Report 
confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (as defined in Section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006) of which 
the Company’s auditor is unaware; and each Director has taken all the steps 
that they ought to have taken as a Director to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware 
of that information.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The 2018 AGM will be held at 11.00am on Tuesday 15 May 2018 at  
The Academy of Medical Sciences, 41 Portland Place, London W1B 1QH.
The Company will be making use of the electronic voting facility provided by its 
registrars, Link Asset Services. The facility includes CREST voting for members 
holding their shares in uncertificated form. For further information, please refer 
to the section on online services and electronic voting set out in the notes to 
the Notice of Meeting.
The notice of the AGM and an explanation of the resolutions to be put to the 
meeting are set out in the Notice of Meeting accompanying this Annual Report. 
The Board fully supports all the resolutions and encourages shareholders to 
vote in favour of each of them as they intend to in respect of their own 
shareholdings.
Auditor
KPMG LLP will not be standing for reappointment at the 2018 AGM. The Board 
has recommended the appointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor and a resolution 
concerning their appointment shall be put to the 2018 AGM. A separate 
resolution will also be put to the AGM authorising the Board to agree  
the auditor’s remuneration.

The V itec Group plc           Independent auditor’s report to the members of 
The Vitec Group plc only
1. Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of The Vitec Group plc (“the 
Company”) for the year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position,  
the Company Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement  
of Changes in Equity, Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes, including  
the accounting policies included therein. 
In our opinion:
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the 
Group’s profit for the year then ended;  
•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the  
European Union;  
•  the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework; and  
•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities are 
described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a 
sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent 
with our report to the Audit Committee.  
We were appointed as auditor in 1995. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is for the 23 financial years ended 31 December 2017. We have 
fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the 
Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical 
Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. No non-audit services 
prohibited by that standard were provided.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters,  
in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required 
for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the 
context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental  
to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
The risk Our response included the following audit procedures: 
Net realisable value 
of inventory
(Provision for 
obsolescence included 
as a deduction within 
the carrying value of 
£69.8 million; 2016: 
£57.9 million)
Refer to note 3.3 
of the financial 
statements
Refer to page 65 
(Audit Committee 
Report) and page 119 
(accounting policy and
financial disclosures)
Subjective estimate
The inventory held at the year end 
covers a wide range of products in 
different geographical regions and the 
demand for these and the ability of 
the Group to sell this inventory in the 
future may be adversely affected by 
many factors including changes in 
customer and consumer preferences, 
competitor activity including pricing 
and the introduction of new products 
and technology. This variability 
introduces an element of judgement 
into the estimation of the net 
realisable value of, and the level of 
provision held in relation to, inventory.
Our procedures included:
•  Reperformance: Inspecting the ageing of inventory, the accuracy of which 
was tested, to identify any slow moving inventory lines and assessing that 
these inventories have been provided for;
•  Our sector experience: Critically assessing whether appropriate 
provisions have been established for slow-moving and obsolete items 
based on our knowledge of the business and discontinued product lines;
•  Tests of details: Comparing recent sales prices for a sample of inventory 
items to their carrying values to identify carrying values in excess of sales 
prices, and in such instances checking that a suitable provision was in place;
•  Methodology implementation: Comparing the methodology and 
assumptions used by the Group in calculating the inventory provisions to 
those used in the prior years having first considered whether we would 
expect a change to the methodology and assumptions to reflect changes 
in the demand factors highlighted opposite;
•  Historical comparisons: Assessing the historical accuracy of provisions 
recorded by examining the utilisation or release of previously recorded 
provisions; and
•  Assessing transparency: Considering the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in relation to inventory.
Our results
 We found the estimated net realisable value of inventory, and the related level 
of provisioning, to be acceptable (2016 results: acceptable). 
Tax provisioning
(Included within 
Current Tax Liability 
£4.4 million; 2016: 
£8.1 million)
Refer to note 2.4 of the 
financial statements
Refer to page 65 
(Audit Committee 
Report) and page 109 
(accounting policy and
financial disclosures)
Dispute outcome
Tax provisions require the Directors 
to make judgements and estimates in 
relation to tax issues and exposures 
given the Group operates in a number 
of tax jurisdictions, the complexities of 
transfer pricing and other international 
tax legislation and the time taken for 
tax matters to be agreed with the tax 
authorities. The complexity is increased 
as a result of acquisitions and 
disposals undertaken by the Group.
Our procedures included:
•  Our tax expertise: Use of our own tax specialists to assess the Group’s 
tax positions, its correspondence with the relevant tax authorities, and to 
analyse and challenge the assumptions used to determine tax provisions 
based on our knowledge and experiences of the application of the 
international and local legislation by the relevant authorities and courts;
•  Assessing transparency: Assessing the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of tax and uncertain tax positions.
Our results
We found the level of tax provisioning to be acceptable (2016 results: 
acceptable).
Recoverability of 
parent company’s 
investment in 
subsidiaries
(£329.6 million; 2016: 
£364.6 million)
Refer to note h of 
the parent company 
financial statements
Low risk, high value
The carrying amount of the parent 
company’s investments in subsidiaries 
represents 83% (2016: 89%) of 
the company’s total assets. Their 
recoverability is not at a high risk of 
significant misstatement or subject to 
significant judgement, with only 2% of 
investments supported by cash flow 
forecasts (2016: 2%). The impairment 
losses recognised during the year are 
non-judgemental and relate to Group 
reorganisation.
However, due to their materiality in the 
context of the parent company financial 
statements, this is considered to be the 
area that had the greatest effect on our 
overall parent company audit.
Our procedures included:
•  Tests of detail: Comparing the carrying amount of a sample of the highest 
value investments, representing 99% (2016: 99%) of the total investment 
balance with the relevant subsidiaries’ draft balance sheet, that we tested, 
to identify whether their net assets, being an approximation of their 
minimum recoverable amount, were in excess of their carrying amount and 
assessing whether those subsidiaries have historically been profit-making;
•  Our sector experience: For the investments where the carrying amount 
exceeded the net asset value, comparing the carrying amount of the 
investment with the expected value of the business based on a suitable 
cash flow forecast.
Our results
 We found the Group’s assessment of the recoverability of the investment in 
subsidiaries to be acceptable (2016 results: acceptable).

The V itec Group plc           3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit  
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £1.45 
million (2016: £1.45 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of 
Group profit before tax from continuing operations normalised to take an 
average of earnout costs for the last 3 years, of £28.9m, of which it 
represents 5% (2016: 5% of Group profit before tax normalised to exclude 
restructuring costs, impairment of goodwill and business acquisition charges, 
of £29.5m).
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set  
at £0.4m (2016: £1.1m) by reference to component materiality. This is lower 
than the materiality we would otherwise have determined by reference to 
company net assets, and represents 0.1% (2016: 0.3%).
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected 
identified misstatements exceeding £72,500 (2016: £72,500), in addition to 
other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Of the Group’s 52 (2016: 51) reporting components, we subjected 13 (2016: 
19) to full scope audits for Group purposes and 5 (2016: 6) to specified 
risk-focused audit procedures over inventory and revenue. The components 
within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages of the Group’s 
results as detailed in the table below.
*  Group revenue and profit before tax are from continuing and discontinued operations.
Components for which specified risk focused audit procedures were 
performed were not individually financially significant enough to require an 
audit for Group reporting purposes, but did present specific individual risks 
that needed to be addressed. The remaining 11% of total Group revenue, 
16% of Group profit before tax and 6% of total Group assets is represented  
by 34 reporting components, none of which individually represented more 
than 5% of any of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax or total  
Group assets. For these residual components, we performed analysis at  
an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were  
no significant risks of material misstatement within these.
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant 
areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the 
information to be reported back. The Group team approved the component 
materialities, which ranged from £0.05m to £1.1m (2016: £0.2m to £0.8m), 
having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the 
components. The work on 8 (2016: 7) of the 18 (2016: 25) components  
was performed by component auditors and the rest, including the audit of  
the parent company, was performed by the Group audit team. The Group  
team performed procedures on the items excluded from normalised Group 
profit before tax.
The Group audit team visited 14 (2016: 15) reporting components in the 
following locations: UK, US and Italy. Telephone conference meetings were 
also held with these component auditors and all others that were not 
physically visited. At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to  
the Group audit team were discussed in more detail, and any further work 
required by the Group audit team was then performed by the component 
auditor.
4. We have nothing to report on going concern
We are required to report to you if:
•  we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to the 
directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements on the use of the 
going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may 
cast significant doubt over the Group and Company’s use of that basis for  
a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements; or  
•  the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 92 is 
materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge.  
We have nothing to report in these respects.  
5. We have nothing to report on the other information in 
the Annual Report
The directors are responsible for the other information presented in the 
Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion on the 
financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly,  
we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below,  
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein 
is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified material 
misstatements in the other information.  
Strategic report and directors’ report  
Based solely on our work on the other information:  
•  we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and 
the directors’ report;  
•  in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year  
is consistent with the financial statements; and  
•  in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.  
Directors’ Remuneration Report  
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
During the audit we continued to perform procedures over the carrying value of goodwill. However, due to the disposal of the US broadcast services and Haigh 
Farr CGUs during the year and the headroom on remaining CGUs, the inherent risk of material misstatement is considered to have reduced to the extent we 
have not assessed this as one of the risks that had the greatest effect on our audit and therefore is not separately identified in our report this year. Restructuring 
is no longer considered a key audit matter given the completion of the restructuring plan.

The Vitec Group plc only
Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability  
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit, 
we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:  
•  the directors’ confirmation within the Directors’ Viability Statement on page 
40 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency and liquidity;  
•  the principal risks disclosures describing these risks and explaining how 
they are being managed and mitigated; and  
•  the directors’ explanation in the Directors’ Viability Statement of how they 
have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have  
done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their 
statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures 
drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ Viability 
Statement. We have nothing to report in this respect.  
Corporate Governance disclosures  
We are required to report to you if:
•  we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we 
acquired during our financial statements audit and the directors’ statement 
that they consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken  
as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position  
and performance, business model and strategy; or  
•  the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee does 
not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance Statement  
does not properly disclose a departure from the eleven provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review.  
We have nothing to report in these respects.  
6. We have nothing to report on the other matters on 
which we are required to report by exception  
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in  
our opinion:  
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company,  
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or  
•  the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or  
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.  
We have nothing to report in these respects.  
7. Respective responsibilities  
Directors’ responsibilities  
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 92, the directors 
are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing 
the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the 
Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.  
Auditor’s responsibilities  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or other irregularities (see below), or error, and to issue our opinion in an 
auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does 
not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually  
or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.  
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities  
Irregularities – ability to detect
Our audit aimed to detect non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations 
(irregularities) that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  
In planning and performing our audit we considered the impact of laws  
and regulations in the specific areas of intellectual property legislation, 
recognising the significance of this to the Group. We identified this area 
through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by 
auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group’s legal correspondence.  
In addition we had regard to laws and regulations in other areas including 
financial reporting, and company and taxation legislation.
We considered the extent of compliance with those laws and regulations that 
directly affect the financial statements, being taxation legislation and financial 
reporting (including related company legislation), as part of our procedures on 
the related financial statement items. For the remaining laws and regulations, 
we made enquiries of directors and other management (as required by 
auditing standards) and inspected relevant legal correspondence.
We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and 
remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit.  
This included communication from the Group to component audit teams of 
relevant laws and regulations identified at Group level, with a request to report 
on any indications of potential existence of irregularities in these areas,  
or other areas directly identified by the component team.
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of 
irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. 
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters  
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body,  
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that 
relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an 
accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is 
described in the note to which it relates. 
The Vitec Group plc (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in the United 
Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for 
the year ended 31 December 2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as the “Group”).
As required by EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002) the Group financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“IFRS”), and have been approved  
by the Directors.
The financial statements are principally prepared on the basis of historical cost. 
Areas where other bases are applied are identified in the accounting policy 
outlined in the relevant note.
In reporting financial information, the Group presents alternative performance 
measures (“APMs”) which are not defined or specified under the requirements  
of IFRS. The Group believes that these APMs, which are not considered to  
be a substitute for or superior to IFRS measures, provide stakeholders with 
additional helpful information to better reflect the underlying business and  
enable more meaningful comparison over time. A glossary on page 150 provides  
a comprehensive list of APMs that the Group uses, including an explanation of 
how they are calculated, why they are used and how they can be reconciled  
to a statutory measure where relevant.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements 
in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (“FRS 101”).
Going Concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its  
future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic 
Report. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review. In addition, note 
4.2 “Financial instruments” includes the Group’s financial risk management 
objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and its 
exposure to foreign currency risks, interest rate risks and liquidity risks.
The Group has considerable financial resources, including undrawn borrowing 
facilities at the end of the year of £82.6 million (see note 4.2 “Financial 
instruments”). The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage  
its business risks. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
next twelve months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial 
statements. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. 
Control exists when the Group has the rights to variable returns from its 
involvement with an entity and has the ability to affect those returns through  
its power over the entity. The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired during the 
year are included in the accounts up to, or from, the date that control exists.
Foreign Currencies
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling with the 
reporting currency of the Group’s subsidiaries generally being that of the  
local country.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on  
that day.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the year end 
exchange rate. Where there is a movement in the exchange rate between the 
date of the transaction and the year end, a currency translation gain or loss  
may arise. Any such differences are recognised in the Income Statement. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated  
at the exchange rate on the day of the transaction, unless they are stated at  
fair value in which case they are translated at the exchange rate of the day  
the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of overseas companies, including goodwill and fair 
value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated at the year end 
exchange rate.
The revenues and expenses of these companies are translated at the weighted 
average exchange rate for the year. Where differences arise between these 
rates, they are recognised in the translation reserve within equity and other 
comprehensive income. 
The cash flows of these companies are translated at the weighted average 
exchange rate for the year. 
In the consolidated financial statements, currency translation gains and losses 
on external loans and borrowings and on long-term inter company loans that 
form part of the net investment in the subsidiaries are recognised directly in  
the translation reserve within equity and other comprehensive income.
In respect of all overseas companies, only those translation differences arising 
since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate 
component of equity. On disposal of such a company, the related translation 
reserve is released to the Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates
The following provides information on those policies that the Directors consider 
critical because of the level of judgement and estimation required which often 
involves assumptions regarding future events which can vary from what is 
anticipated. The Directors review the judgements and estimates on an ongoing 
basis with revisions to accounting estimates recognised in the period in which 
the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. The Directors 
believe that the consolidated financial statements reflect appropriate judgements 
and estimates and provide a true and fair view of the Group’s performance and 
financial position.
Working capital
Judgement is applied to assess whether a trade receivable is recoverable or 
not, and whether the level of provision required to write down the value of the 
receivable to its recoverable amount is appropriate.
Judgement is applied to assess the level of provisions required to write down 
slow-moving, excess and obsolete inventory to its net realisable value.
See note 3.3 “Working Capital”.
Pension benefits
The actuarial valuations associated with the pension schemes involve making 
assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, future pension 
increases and mortality rates. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting 
date. Further details about the assumptions used are set out in note 5.2 
“Pensions”.
Acquisitions
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method, based on the 
fair value of the consideration paid. Assets, liabilities and assumed contingent 
considerations are measured at fair value and the purchase price is allocated to 
assets and liabilities based on these fair values. Judgement is applied in relation 
to the estimation of the provisional fair values and useful lives of acquired assets 
and liabilities at the date of acquisition. Details concerning the acquisitions made 
in the year are set out in note 3.4 “Acquisitions”.
Tax
The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions. Management 
is required to make judgements and estimates in determining the provisions 
for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements. Tax benefits are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available in the future against 
which temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised.  Details on 
the tax charge and assets and liabilities recorded are set out in note 2.4 “Tax”.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations will 
become effective for the Group in future years. 
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” is effective from 1 January 2018. The initial 
application of IFRS 9 is not expected to have a material impact on these results or 
the Balance Sheet reported in the consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” is effective from 1 January 
2018. This standard requires the separation of performance obligations within 
contracts with customers and the contractual value to be allocated to each of 
the performance obligations. Revenue is then recognised as each performance 
obligation is satisfied. This standard will replace existing revenue recognition 
standards. The Group will apply the standard from the transition date using the 
cumulative effect method. The Directors do not consider that the application 
of IFRS 15 will have a material impact on these results or the Balance Sheet 
reported in the consolidated financial statements. For the sale of goods, where 
revenue is currently recognised when both the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership have been transferred to the customer, and for the rental of assets, 
where revenue is recognised over the duration of the rental contract on a straight 
line basis at the amount billed to the customer, no adjustments are expected 
under IFRS 15. For goods sold with a right to return, and service warranties  
over an extended period, the adjustments are not material.
IFRS 16 “Leases” was revised on 13 January 2016 and is effective from  
1 January 2019 and will require all leases to be recognised on the Balance 
Sheet. Currently, IAS 17 “Leases” only requires those categorised as finance 
leases to be recognised on the Balance Sheet, with leases categorised as 
operating leases not recognised and expensed through the Income Statement. 
The impact of IFRS 16 will be to recognise a lease liability and a corresponding 
asset in the Balance Sheet for leases currently classified as operating leases. 
The Directors are continuing to evaluate the full impact of the adoption of this 
standard. The actual impact in the period of initial application will depend on 
the composition of the Group’s lease portfolio at that date, the Group’s latest 
assessment of whether it will exercise any lease renewal options and the extent  
to which the Group chooses to use practical expedients and exemptions.  
The Group expects to disclose its transition approach and quantitative 
information before adoption.
Other standards
Other amended standards and interpretations are not expected to have  
a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Section 1 – Basis of preparation 105

2.1 Profit before tax (including segmental information)
This shows the analysis of the Group’s profit before tax by reference to its three Divisions. Further segmental  
information and an analysis of key operating expenses are also shown here.
Accounting policies
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is stated exclusive of sales tax and consists of sales to third parties after an allowance for returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. 
Revenue recognition policies for material revenue streams are detailed below. 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when both the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer  
and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. This is typically on delivery when legal title transfers to the customer.  
Revenue from the rental of assets is recognised over the duration of the rental contract, on a straight line basis, at the amount billed to the customer.
Section 2 – Results for the Year  106

Segment reporting
In the year, the Group reorganised its business into three Divisions (Imaging Solutions, Production Solutions and Creative Solutions) to reflect a changing customer base, 
to enable the Group to adapt quickly to market and technological challenges, and to give greater focus to the fast-growing Independent Content Creator market. These 
reportable segments reflect the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker on a regular basis to assist in making decisions on capital allocated to  
each segment and to assess performance. Further details on the nature of these segments and the products and services they provide are contained in the Strategic Report.
The US broadcast services business and the Haigh-Farr defence antennae business, both part of the previous Broadcast Division, have been classified as discontinued 
operations in the current year. Their performance in this year and the comparative year is therefore part of discontinued operations as presented in note 3.5 “Disposals 
and discontinued operations” and is excluded from segmental performances below.

2.4 Tax
This note sets out the tax accounting policies, the total tax charge or credit in the Income Statement, and tax assets  
and tax liabilities in the Balance Sheet. This includes amounts relating to deferred tax.
Accounting policies
Income tax
The tax expense in the Income Statement represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.     
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation  
or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.   
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carried forward unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it  
is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax  
losses, can be utilised.      
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and increased or reduced to the extent of the probable level of  
taxable profit that would be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.      
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised for the following temporary differences:  
 -  Goodwill not deductible for tax purposes on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and,  
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss; and     
 -  Differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the timing of the reversal is controlled by the Company and they will probably  
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
US Tax Reform
On 22 December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in the United States. The Act is complex and wide ranging and in these financial statements  
the impact has been estimated and may be further refined as more clarity and guidance becomes available.     
The legislation includes a reduction in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% and also contains increased restrictions on the deductibility of interest expense.  
As a consequence of these changes, the remeasurement of the deferred tax asset for both the change in tax rate and forecast utilisation of the deferred tax  
asset has resulted in a one-off deferred tax charge of £7.9 million which is excluded from adjusted earnings.     
The Group expects that the effective tax rate on adjusted profits will be reduced by two percentage points, from 27% to 25%, in 2018 as a result of the  
reduction in federal tax rate.      110

from 19% to 17% (effective 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge accordingly.  
The UK deferred tax asset at 31 December 2017 has been calculated based on these rates.     
The US deferred tax charge of £6.4 million includes a one-off exceptional charge of £7.9 million in relation to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a

Tax - Balance Sheet 
Current tax 
The current tax liability of £4.4 million (2016: £8.1 million) represents the amount of income taxes payable in respect of current and prior periods, including a 
provision in relation to uncertain tax positions. The current tax asset of £1.2 million (2016: £0.7 million) mainly relates to income tax receivable in the UK, the US,  
Italy and France.     
In October 2017, the European Commission opened a state aid investigation into the Group Financing Exemption in the UK controlled foreign company (“CFC”) rules. 
The Group Financing Exemption was introduced into the UK tax legislation in 2013. In common with other UK based international companies whose arrangements 
are in line with current CFC legislation, Vitec may be affected by the outcome of this investigation and continues to monitor developments. If the preliminary findings 
of the European Commission’s investigation are upheld, Vitec calculates its maximum potential liability to be £6.3 million. The detailed arguments of the European 
Commission are not yet available and it is unlikely that a decision will be made within the next 12 months. No provision has been made in the financial statements  
as the outcome of the investigation cannot be determined at this time.     
The international tax environment has received increased attention and seen rapid change over recent years, both at a US and European level, and by international 
bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”). In light of this, Vitec has been monitoring developments and continues to 
engage transparently with the tax authorities in countries where Vitec operates, to ensure that the Group manages its tax arrangements on a sustainable basis.
As for most multinationals, the current tax environment is creating increased levels of uncertainty and the Group is potentially subject to tax audits in many jurisdictions. 
By their nature these are often complex and could take a significant period of time to be agreed with the tax authorities. The Group estimates and accrues taxes that 
will ultimately be payable when reviews or audits by tax authorities of tax returns are completed. These estimates include Management judgements about the position 
expected to be taken by each tax authority, primarily in respect of transfer pricing as well as in respect of financing arrangements and tax credits and incentives.
Management estimates of the level of risk arising from tax audit may change in the next year as a result of changes in legislation or tax authority practice or 
correspondence with tax authorities during a specific tax audit. It is not possible to quantify the impact that such future developments may have on the Group’s  
tax positions. Actual outcomes and settlements may differ significantly from the estimates recorded in these consolidated financial statements.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Deferred tax assets have been offset against liabilities where assets and liabilities arise in the same jurisdiction and there is a legal right of offset. Deferred tax 
relating to cashflow hedges was an asset at 31 December 2016 and a liability at 31 December 2017. 
The deferred tax credit of £1.5 million (2016: charge of £1.7 million) recognised in reserves relates to the following: £1.6 million credit recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in relation to cashflow hedges, £0.1 million credit recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income in relation to defined benefit pension obligations and £0.3 million charge reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity in relation to share 
options. There is also a £0.1 million credit reflected in goodwill in relation to the acquisition of RTMotion.
Deferred tax assets totalling £10.2 million (2016: £17.5 million) have been recognised in the US on the basis that future profits are expected to be made across  
all of the US businesses such that it is probable that these assets will be utilised in the foreseeable future. This also reflects a reduction in the level of deferred tax 
assets by £7.9 million to reflect the changes introduced as part of US tax reform.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised of £16.3 million, comprising £3.9 million in relation to losses, £2.3 million in relation to intangibles and £10.1 million  
in relation to other timing differences (2016: £17.3 million) because it is not sufficiently probable that these assets will reverse in the foreseeable future.
No taxes have been provided for liabilities which may arise on the distribution of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries on the basis of control, except where distributions of 
such profits are planned. Cumulative unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries totalled approximately £54.2 million at 31 December 2017 (2016: £40.8 million). 
As dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries to the UK should be exempt from additional UK tax, no significant tax charges would be expected. 114

2.5 Earnings per share
Earnings per share (“EPS”) is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each share.
Basic EPS is calculated on the profit for the year divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 
during the year.      
Diluted EPS is calculated on the profit for the year divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 
during the year, but adjusted for the effects of dilutive share options. The key features of share option contracts are 
described in note 5.3 “Share-based payments”.  
The adjusted EPS measure is used by management to assess the underlying performance of the ongoing businesses,  
and therefore excludes charges associated with acquisition of businesses, impairment of goodwill, restructuring costs, 
material non-operating events and profit on disposal of businesses, all net of tax.
The calculation of basic, diluted and adjusted EPS is set out below:

This shows the non-physical assets used by the Group  
to generate revenues and profits. These assets include  
the following:   
 - Goodwill    
 - Acquired intangible assets    
 - Software    
 - Capitalised development costs    
Accounting policies
Goodwill 
The goodwill recognised by the Group has all arisen as a result of acquisitions and 
is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated 
on acquisition to cash-generating units (“CGU”) that are anticipated to benefit 
from the combination, and is not subject to amortisation but is tested annually 
for impairment. Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount 
of the CGU to which the goodwill relates. This estimate of recoverable amount is 
determined at each Balance Sheet date. 
The estimate of recoverable amount requires significant assumptions to be made 
and is based on a number of factors such as the near-term business outlook for 
the CGU, including both its operating profit and operating cash flow performance. 
Where the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount, an 
impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
All acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2010 are accounted for by 
applying the acquisition method. Goodwill on these acquisitions represents the 
excess of the fair value of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of the 
identifiable net assets acquired, all measured at the acquisition date. Subsequent 
adjustments to the fair values of net assets acquired can be made within twelve 
months of the acquisition date where original fair values were determined 
provisionally. These adjustments are accounted for from the date of acquisition. 
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with an acquisition,  
such as legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional and consulting  
fees, are expensed as incurred.
Other intangible assets
The other intangible assets are either acquired or internally generated  
(such as capitalised development costs).
Acquired intangible assets
Other intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are shown 
at fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation at the rates 
indicated below:
Order backlog up to 2 years
Brand 3 to 15 years
Customer relationships 3 to 10 years
Technology 3 to 10 years
Software 
The cost of acquiring software (including associated implementation and 
development costs where applicable) is classified as an intangible asset.  
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and  
unique software products controlled by the Group, and that are assessed  
as likely to generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year,  
are also capitalised and recognised as intangible assets. Costs associated  
with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense  
as incurred. Software expenditure is amortised over its estimated useful life  
of between three to five years, and is stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses.
Capitalised development costs
Research and development costs are charged to the Income Statement in the 
year in which they are incurred unless development expenditure meets the 
criteria for capitalisation. Once detailed and strict criteria have been met that 
confirm that the product or process is both technically and commercially feasible 
and the Group has sufficient resources to complete the product, any further 
expenditure incurred on the project is capitalised, typically up to two to three 
years. The capitalised expenditure includes the cost of materials, direct labour 
and an appropriate portion of overheads. Capitalised expenditure is amortised 
over the life of the product, and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses.
Impairment tests for cash-generating units (CGUs) 
containing goodwill
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36, “Impairment of Assets”,  
goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs which are identified by the way goodwill 
is monitored for impairment. The Group’s total consolidated goodwill of £58.0 
million at 31 December 2017 is allocated to: Production Solutions: £28.9 million 
(2016: £30.1 million); Imaging Solutions: £18.8 million (2016: £15.4 million); and 
Creative Solutions: £10.3 million (2016: £10.3 million). Each CGU is assessed for 
impairment annually and whenever there is a specific indication of impairment.

As part of the annual impairment test review, the carrying value of goodwill has 
been assessed with reference to value in use over a projected period of five years 
together with a terminal value. This reflects the projected cash flows of each CGU 
based on the actual operating results, the most recent Board approved budget, 
strategic plans and management projections.
The key assumptions on which the value in use calculations are based relate to 
business performance over the next five years, long-term growth rates beyond 
2022 and the discount rates applied. The key judgements are the level of revenue 
and operating margins anticipated and the proportion of operating profit converted 
into cash flow in each year. Forecasts are based on past experience and take into 
account current and future market conditions and opportunities.
Growth rates for the period beyond 2022 are assumed to be 1.5% to 2.0% (2016: 
1.0% to 2.0%), which is considered to be at or below long-term market trends for 
significant CGUs.
The cash flow projections have been discounted to present value using the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital adjusted for economic and CGU-specific risk 
factors including markets and size of business. Pre-tax rates of 13% to 17% 
(2016: 13% to 15%) reflecting different geographies have been used for 
impairment testing (13% (2016: 13%) applied to the Production Solutions CGU,  
14% (2016: 13%) applied to the Imaging Solutions CGU and 17% (2016: 15%) 
applied to the Creative Solutions CGU).
The following specific individual sensitivities of reasonable possible change have 
been considered for each CGU in relation to the weighted average cost of capital 
used in the value in use calculations, resulting in the carrying amount not 
exceeding the recoverable amount for each CGU:
 - a 10% increase in unlevered equity beta; 
 - a 1% increase in alpha; 
 - a 10% decrease in gearing; 
 - a 1% increase in the pre-tax cost of debt; and
 - a 10% reduction in forecast cashflows over the next five years.

3.2 Property, plant and equipment
This shows the physical assets used by the Group to generate revenues and profits. These assets include the following: 
 - Land and buildings
 - Plant, machinery and vehicles
 - Equipment, fixtures and fittings
Accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  
Rental assets are recorded as plant and machinery.
Depreciation 
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less estimated residual value, on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives.  
The annual depreciation charge is sensitive to the estimated useful life of each asset and expected residual value at the end of its life. The major categories of property, 
plant and equipment are depreciated as follows:

3.3 Working capital
Working capital represents the assets and liabilities the Group generates through its trading activities. The Group therefore 
defines working capital as inventory, trade and other receivables, accruals, trade and other payables.
Careful management of working capital is vital as it ensures that the Group can meet its trading and financing obligations 
within its ordinary operating cycle.
Accounting policies
Inventories 
Inventories and work in progress are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventory acquired as part of business combinations is valued at fair 
value. Cost represents direct costs incurred and, where appropriate, production or conversion costs and other costs to bring the inventory to its existing location 
and condition. In the case of manufacturing inventory and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating 
capacity. Inventory is accounted for on an average cost or first-in, first-out method as appropriate. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Provisions for inventories are recognised when the book value exceeds its net 
realisable value.   
In the ordinary course of business, judgement is applied to assess the level of provisions required to write down slow-moving, excess and obsolete inventory to  
its net realisable value.
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are recognised at the invoice value less provision for impairment. The carrying value of trade receivables is considered to approximate  
fair value.   
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that amounts due will not be collected according to the original terms of the receivables. 
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.  
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in trade receivables and represent revenue recognised in excess of payments on account.
Trade and other payables 
Trade payables are recognised at the value of the invoice received from a supplier.

3.4 Acquisitions
This note outlines how the Group has accounted for businesses that it has acquired.    
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. As part of the acquisition accounting the Group 
has adopted a process to identify the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, including contingent considerations 
assumed. This includes the separate identification of intangible assets and the allocation of the consideration paid. This 
process continues as information is finalised, and accordingly the fair value adjustments presented in the tables below  
are provisional. In accordance with IFRS 3 until the assessment is complete the allocation period will remain open up to  
a maximum of 12 months from the acquisition date so long as information remains outstanding. Acquisition-related costs  
are recognised in the Income Statement as incurred in accordance with IFRS 3.    
A detailed exercise is undertaken to assess the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the use of third-
party experts where appropriate. The valuation of intangible assets requires the use of assumptions and estimates,  
including future growth rates, expected inflation rates, discount rates used and useful economic lives. 
Acquisitions provide opportunities for further development of the Group’s activities and create enhanced returns.  
Such opportunities and the workforces inherent in each of the acquired businesses represent much of the assessed  
value of goodwill.
Acquisition of JOBY and Lowepro 
On 22 September 2017, the Imaging Solutions Division of the Group acquired the trade and certain assets (primarily comprising the JOBY and Lowepro brands) 
of the DayMen Group S.a.r.l. including 100% of the share capital of the subsidiary companies in Hong Kong and China (“JOBY and Lowepro”), through a business 
combination for a cash consideration of £8.4 million. The fair value of the net assets acquired was £4.4 million resulting in goodwill of £4.0 million.
JOBY and Lowepro products are designed and developed in Hong Kong and California respectively. JOBY’s patented GorillaPod has transformed the camera 
accessories market while Lowepro has been a market leader in bags designed to protect electronic and photographic devices since its inception in 1967.  
The acquisition is an excellent strategic fit with the Group’s existing core activities and gives the Group greater access to the fast growing iPhoneography  
and vlogging consumer accessories market. 
A summary of the effect of the acquisition of JOBY and Lowepro is detailed below:

The V itec Group plc          
Acquisition of RTMotion 
On 20 September 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of RT Motion Systems Ltd (“RTMotion”), a private company based in the UK, for a cash 
consideration of £2.5 million (£1.9 million net of cash acquired). The fair value of the net assets acquired was £1.6 million resulting in goodwill of £0.9 million. 
Under the terms of the acquisition, there is a potential deferred payment of up to £1.2 million payable in cash. This is dependent on the achievement of non-financial 
targets, including integration milestones, being met over the period to 31 December 2019 and is not contingent consideration. In 2017 an amount of £0.2 million 
was provided for and charged to the Income Statement in relation to milestones met in 2017.    
RTMotion is a high technology business which provides wireless motor lens control systems for broadcast, cine and video cameras. The acquisition complements the 
Group’s existing activities in the expanding Independent Content Creator market and its products will be marketed through the Group’s global distribution network. 
RTMotion operates within the Creative Solutions Division.

3.5 Disposals and discontinued operations
On 9 May 2017 the Group sold Haigh-Farr, Inc. (“Haigh-Farr”), a defence antennae business based in the US for a cash consideration of $15.8 million  
(£12.2 million), of which $0.8 million (£0.6 million) is deferred for twelve months from disposal date. A profit of £3.2 million arose on disposal after taking into 
account £0.5 million costs of disposal, £17.3 million net assets disposed and the previously recorded foreign exchange gain of £8.8 million that has been recycled  
to the Income Statement.
On 1 August 2017 the Group sold its US broadcast services business based in the US for a net cash consideration of $32.1 million (£24.3 million). A profit of  
£11.3 million arose on disposal after taking into account £2.8 million costs of disposal, £18.7 million net assets disposed and the previously recorded foreign 
exchange gain of £8.5 million that has been recycled to the Income Statement. 
The property lease of the IMT business which was disposed in 2014 came to an end in the year. At 31 December 2016 there was a provision of £0.7 million  
in relation to onerous lease contracts and potential exit costs. The Group made a payment of £0.2 million and the remaining provision of £0.5 million was  
released to the Income Statement.
Both Haigh-Farr and the US broadcast services business, which were included in the previous Broadcast Division, have been classified as discontinued operations  
in the current year in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations”. The disposals enable management to place greater 
focus on opportunities in its core activities.
The tables below show the results of the discontinued operations which are included in the Group Income Statement and Group Statement of Cash Flows respectively.

A provision is recognised by the Group where an obligation exists, relating to events in the past, and it is probable that an 
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle it.
Accounting policies
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised in the Balance Sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that  
an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle it. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows  
at an appropriate discount rate.       
Provisions for warranties, based on historical warranty data, are recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.     
Obligations arising from restructuring plans are recognised when detailed formal plans have been established and the restructuring has either commenced or  
has been announced.       
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected  
to be received under it.

Warranty provisions
Warranties over the Group’s products typically cover periods of between one and five years. The provision represents management’s best estimate of the  
Group’s liability based on past experience.      
Onerous lease contracts and other   
The onerous lease contracts provision of £0.1 million is in relation to non-cancellable leases on vacant property and a provision of £0.4 million relates to potential dilapidation 
costs on the termination of leases on occupied property that the Group entered into in previous years.       
The other provisions are in relation to costs associated with the integration of JOBY and Lowepro (£1.2 million), off-market contracts on the disposal of the US broadcast 
services business (£1.2 million), fair value adjustments relating to acquisitions made in the year (£1.2 million), transfer of manufacturing from the US to Costa Rica  
(£0.8 million) and severance and legal claims (£0.7 million). 
Earnout and deferred payment
Of the £3.9 million earnout and deferred payment provision at 31 December 2017, £3.7 million (US$5.0 million) after currency translation adjustments is in respect 
of Wooden Camera’s earnout (acquired in 2016) and £0.2 million in respect of RTMotion’s deferred payment. (See note 2.2 “Charges associated with acquisition of 
businesses, impairment of goodwill and restructuring costs” and note 3.4 “Acquisitions”). 128
The V itec Group plc          
This section outlines the Group’s capital structure. The Group defines its capital structure as its equity and non-current  
interest bearing loans and borrowings, and aims to manage this to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern,  
so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group manages the  
capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the 
underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, it may return capital to shareholders, through dividends 
and share buy backs, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. The Group considers its dividend policy at least twice  
a year ahead of announcing results in the context of its ability to continue as a going concern and deliver its business plan.  
The Group focuses on leverage, credit ratings and interest cost, particularly when considering investment.
On the following pages there are disclosures concerning the following:
 4.1 Net debt

4.1 Net debt
The Group’s net debt comprises the following:
 - Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
 - Cash and cash equivalents (cash on hand and demand deposits at banks)
 - Bank overdrafts that are payable on demand
Accounting policies
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet represent cash on hand and at banks.    
Cash and cash equivalents in the Statement of Cash Flows include bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these transaction 
costs are recognised in the Income Statement over the term of the related borrowings.

4.2 Financial instruments
This provides details on:
 - Financial risk management 
 - Derivative financial instruments 
 - Fair value hierarchy 
 - Interest rate profile 
 - Maturity profile of financial liabilities
Financial risk management
The Group’s multinational operations and debt financing 
expose it to a variety of financial risks. In the course of its 
business, the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk, 
interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way 
the Group is managed. Financial risk management policies 
are set by the Board of Directors. These policies are 
implemented by a central treasury department that has 
formal procedures to manage foreign currency risk, interest 
rate risk and liquidity risk, including, where appropriate,  
the use of derivative financial instruments. The Group  
has clearly defined authority and approval limits built  
into these procedures.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk arises both where sale or purchase transactions are 
undertaken in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of  
Group companies (transactional exposures) and where the results of overseas 
companies are consolidated into the Group’s reporting currency of Sterling 
(translational exposures).     
The Group has businesses that operate around the world and accordingly 
record their results in a number of different functional currencies. Some of these 
operations also have some customers or suppliers that transact in a foreign 
currency. The Group’s results which are reported in Sterling are therefore exposed 
to changes in foreign currency exchange rates across a number of different 
currencies with the most significant exposures relating to the US Dollar (USD),  
Euro (EUR) and Japanese Yen (JPY). The Group proactively manages a proportion 
of its short-term transactional foreign currency exposures using derivative financial 
instruments, but remains exposed to the underlying translational movements  
which remain outside the control of the Group.    
The Group manages its transactional exposures to foreign currency risks through 
the use of forward exchange contracts including the US Dollar, Euro and Japanese 
Yen. Forward exchange contracts are typically used to hedge approximately 75% 
of the Group’s forecasted foreign currency exposure in respect of forecast cash 
transactions for the following 12 months. Forward exchange contracts may also  
be used to hedge a proportion of the forecast cash transactions for the following 
13 to 24 months. The forward exchange contracts currently have maturities of  
less than two years at the Balance Sheet date.    
The Group’s translational exposures to foreign currency risks relate to both the 
Income Statement and net assets of overseas subsidiaries which are converted 
into Sterling on consolidation. The Group does not seek to hedge the translational 
exposure that arises primarily from changes in the exchange rates of the US  
Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen against Sterling. However the Group does finance 
overseas investments partly through the use of foreign currency borrowings  
in order to provide a net investment hedge over the foreign currency risk that 
arises on translation of its foreign currency subsidiaries.   
The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign denominated cash balances 
is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates 
when necessary to address short-term imbalances. In addition the Group manages 
the denomination of surplus cash balances across the overseas subsidiaries to 
allow natural hedging where effective in any particular country.
It is estimated that the Group’s adjusted operating profit for the year ended 31 
December 2017 would have increased/decreased by approximately £1.6 million 
from a ten cent stronger/weaker US Dollar against Sterling, by approximately £1.9 
million from a ten cent stronger/weaker Euro against Sterling and by approximately 
£0.4 million from a ten Yen stronger/weaker Japanese Yen against Sterling. 
This reflects the impact of the sensitivities to the translational exposures and to 
the proportion of the transactional exposures that is not hedged. The Group, in 
accordance with its policy, does not use derivatives to manage translational risks. 
During 2017 the Group’s operating profit included a net loss of £2.3 million (2016: 
£5.0 million) in relation to the crystallisation of forward exchange contracts as 
described later in this note.
It is estimated that the statutory operating profit for the year ended 31 December 
2017 would have increased/decreased by approximately £0.7 million from a ten 
cent stronger/weaker US Dollar against Sterling, by approximately £1.7 million 
from a ten cent stronger/weaker Euro against Sterling and by approximately  
£0.4 million from a ten Yen stronger/weaker Japanese Yen against Sterling.
Interest rate risk      
Interest rate risk comprises the interest cash flow risk that results from borrowing 
at variable rates.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, it is estimated that a general increase/
decrease of one percentage point in interest rates, would decrease/increase the 
Group’s profit before tax by approximately £0.8 million.
Liquidity risk     
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial 
obligations as they fall due.
In 2011, the Group drew down US$50 million from a Private Placement shelf 
facility. This was repaid on 11 May 2017 funded by the Multicurrency Revolving 
Credit Facility. 
The Group has a five year £125 million Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility 
Agreement with a syndicate comprising five banks: two UK banks, two American 
banks, and one European bank, that expires in July 2021. The Group was  
utilising 43% of the £125 million Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility at  
31 December 2017. 130
The V itec Group plc          
Credit risk     
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to meet its obligations. The 
Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets such as trade receivables, 
cash balances and derivative financial instruments. The Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial 
asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the Group Balance Sheet.
a) Trade receivables 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. Trade 
receivables are subject to credit limits, and control and approval procedures 
in the operating companies. Due to its large geographic base and number of 
customers, the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk  
on its trade receivables.
b) Cash balances and derivative financial instruments 
Credit risk associated with cash balances is managed by transacting with a 
number of major financial institutions worldwide and periodically reviewing their 
credit worthiness. Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are 
managed centrally. These are only with banks that are part of the Group’s £125 
million Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Accordingly, the Group’s 
associated credit risk is limited. The Group has no significant concentration of 
credit risk.
Derivative financial instruments
This is a summary of the derivative financial instruments that 
the Group holds and uses to manage transactional exposure. 
The value of these derivatives changes over time in response 
to underlying variables such as exchange rates. They are 
carried in the Balance Sheet at fair value.   
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined 
by estimating the market value of that contract at the 
reporting date. Derivatives with a positive fair value are 
recorded as assets and negative fair values as liabilities, 
and presented as current or non-current based on their 
contracted maturity dates.
Accounting policies 
Derivative financial instruments
In accordance with Board approved policies, the Group uses derivative financial 
instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure 
to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arising from operational activities. These 
are designated as cash flow hedges. It does not hold or use derivative financial 
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Cash flow hedge accounting 
Cash flow hedges are used to hedge the variability in cash flows of highly  
probable forecast transactions caused by changes in exchange rates.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated in a cash flow hedge 
relationship with a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any 
change in fair value arising is deferred in the cash flow hedging reserve within 
equity, via the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The gain or loss relating to  
the ineffective part is recognised in the Income Statement within net finance 
expense. Amounts deferred in the cash flow hedging reserve are reflected in  
the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised  
in the Income Statement.
If a hedging instrument expires or is sold but the hedged forecast transaction is  
still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity 
and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction 
occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the 
cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised  
immediately in the Income Statement.
If a derivative financial instrument is not formally designated in a cash flow hedge 
relationship, any change in fair value is recognised in the Income Statement.

A net loss of £2.3 million (2016: £5.0 million) relating to forward exchange contracts was reclassified to the Income Statement, to match the crystallisation  
of the hedged forecast cash flows which affect the Income Statement.
Fair value hierarchy
The following summarises financial instruments carried at fair values and the major methods and assumptions used  
in estimating these fair values.
The different levels of fair value hierarchy have been defined as follows:
Level 1 
Fair value measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 
Fair values measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices)  
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3
Fair values measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The table below shows the carrying values and fair values of financial assets and liabilities:
       Carrying  Carrying  
       value Fair value value Fair value 
       2017 2017 2016 2016

          (36.1)  (36.1)  (69.3) (70.0)
The fair value of floating rate borrowings approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are at floating rates where payments are reset to market  
rates at intervals of less than one year.     
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using appropriate yield curves, to the net present values. 
All financial instruments are deemed Level 2.  132

Interest rate profile 
The table below analyses the Group’s interest rate exposure arising from bank loans by currency.
Accounting policies 
Net investment hedge accounting
The Group uses US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen denominated borrowings as a hedge against the translation exposure on the Group’s net investment  
in overseas companies.
Where the hedge is fully effective at hedging the variability in the net assets of such companies caused by changes in exchange rates, the changes in value of the 
borrowings are recognised in the translation reserve within equity, via the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The ineffective part of any change in value caused  
by changes in exchange rates is recognised in the Income Statement.      
The effective portion will be recycled into the Income Statement on the sale of the foreign operation.

5.2 Pensions
This note explains the accounting policies governing the Group’s treatment of the pension schemes, followed by an 
analysis of these schemes.
Accounting policies
Defined contribution schemes
The assets are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The costs of providing pensions for employees under defined 
contribution schemes are expensed as incurred.
Defined benefit schemes 
The Group operates pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.  
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is 
deducted. The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the Balance Sheet date on high quality corporate bonds.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they  
arise in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.     
The Group recognises the ongoing service cost, past service costs and any cost or income relating to the curtailment or settlement of a pension scheme in operating 
expenses in the Income Statement. The unwinding of the discount (above) is recognised as part of net financial expense.
Pension schemes
The Group has defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, Italy, Germany, Japan and France. The UK defined benefit scheme was closed to future benefit accrual 
with effect from 31 July 2010. All UK employees of the Group are now offered membership of the defined contribution pension scheme. Other overseas subsidiaries  
have their own defined contribution schemes.

UK defined benefit pension scheme
The UK defined benefit pension scheme, being significant, is disclosed below.      
The nature of the UK scheme is a funded final salary scheme closed to future benefit accrual with effect from 31 July 2010. As a result, since that date, no 
contributions are payable in respect of future accrual of benefits. As the 5 April 2016 funding valuation of the scheme disclosed a funding surplus, no recovery plan  
is required under the Pensions Act 2004. As such, member and employer contributions to the scheme over the year to 31 December 2018 are expected to be £nil.  
The scheme is subject to all legislation and regulations that apply to UK occupational pension schemes.
The main risk to which the Group is exposed by the scheme is that the cost of the benefits provided by the scheme is greater than expected, for example due to lower 
than expected investments returns or members of the scheme living longer than expected, which may result in additional contributions being required from the Group.
In accordance with UK trust and pensions law, the pension scheme has a corporate trustee. Although the Group bears the financial cost of the scheme, the 
responsibility for the management and governance of the scheme lies with the trustee, which has a duty to act in the best interest of members at all times.  
The assets of the scheme are held in trust by the trustee who consults with the Group on investment strategy decisions. 138

5.3 Share-based payments
Group employees participate in a number of employee incentive schemes including a Sharesave Scheme, a Long Term 
Incentive Plan and a Deferred Bonus Plan.      
This note explains the accounting policy governing share-based payments and the impact of various share schemes 
operated by the Group.
Accounting policies
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of share-based incentive schemes. The fair value of the equity-settled employee share option grants is calculated at grant date and 
charged to the Income Statement over the vesting period of the schemes, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect 
expected and actual levels of options that will vest, except where forfeiture arises from share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
The fair values of options are calculated using Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo simulation models. Vesting conditions are limited to non-market based conditions  
such as service conditions and performance conditions (adjusted earnings per share targets).      
Any potential employer’s Social Security liability on options granted is calculated based on the intrinsic value of the options and charged to the Income Statement  
over the vesting period of the schemes.    
Exercises of share options granted to employees can be satisfied by market purchase or issue of new shares. Shares purchased in the market are held in the 
Company’s Employee Benefit Trust.    
A description of each type of share-based payment arrangement that existed at any time during the period, including the general terms and conditions of each 
arrangement, such as vesting requirements, the maximum term of options granted, and the method of settlement (for example whether in cash or equity) is set  
out in the Remuneration Report.
Share-based payments expense
The amount recognised in the Income Statement for share-based payment transactions with employees for the year ended 31 December 2017 was £2.9 million  
(2016: £1.9 million), of which £0.7 million (2016: £0.3 million) related to employers’ tax liability.      
The outstanding employers’ tax liability recognised in the Balance Sheet for UK awards was £1.0 million (2016: £0.3 million).
Share options outstanding at the end of the period
Options outstanding under the 2002 UK Sharesave Scheme, 2002 International Sharesave Plan, 2011 UK Sharesave Scheme and 2011 International Sharesave Plan

The 2017 LTIP awards were issued on 2 dates - 28 February 2017 and 15 May 2017.      
(2)  
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility determined by the analysis of daily share prices over a period commensurate with the expected lifetime of the award and ending on the date of grant 
of the award. Due to significant fluctuations in Vitec’s share price during the year a uniform rate has been used for all the Sharesave options as a reasonable estimate of volatility going forward.
(3)  
As mentioned above, the 2017 LTIP awards were issued on 2 dates 28 February and 15 May 2017. The first figures (£7.00/£9.23) represents fair value of awards subject to adjusted EPS growth 
criteria and the second figure (£3.14/£4.14) represents fair value of awards subject to TSR criteria.      
(4)  
For the 2014 LTIP , a Monte Carlo simulation has been used. Under this valuation method, the share price for Vitec is projected at the end of the performance period as the TSR for Vitec and the 
companies in the comparator group. Based on these projections, the number of awards that will vest is determined. Thousands of simulations are run and the fair value of the award is calculated  
as the product of the vesting probability and the share price at the date of grant. 142

Company Statement of Changes in Equity 146
The V itec Group plc          
a) Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”).
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRSs), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006, and has set out below 
where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions have been taken.
Under Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account. 
b) Exemptions taken by the Company under FRS 101
The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
• Cash Flow statement and related notes; 
• Comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets and intangible assets;
• Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;
• Disclosures in respect of capital management; 
• The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs; and 
• Disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel. 
As the consolidated financial statements of The Vitec Group plc include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under  
FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: 
• IFRS 2 “Share-Based Payments” in respect of Group settled share-based payments; and
• Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement” and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”.
c) Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to these financial statements.
Property, plant and equipment 
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Leasehold improvements    over the remaining period of the lease
Equipment, fixtures and fittings    three to ten years
Intangible assets
The cost of acquiring software (including associated implementation and development costs where applicable) is classified as an intangible asset. Costs associated 
with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. Software expenditure is amortised over its estimated useful life of 
between three and five years, and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at historical cost, less provision for any impairment in value.  
Pensions
The Company participates in the Group’s defined benefit scheme operated in the UK, which was closed to future benefit accrual with effect from 31 July 2010.  
All UK employees of the Company are now offered membership of the defined contribution scheme. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of  
the Company. The Company has a very small proportion of the scheme’s total members. As such, the Group has adopted a policy to recognise the full net pension 
cost, and hence pension deficit, in its subsidiary Vitec Videocom Limited’s financial statements prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
Details in respect of the UK defined benefit pension scheme are disclosed in note 5.2 “Pensions” of the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Dividends receivable
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the Company’s Income Statement.
