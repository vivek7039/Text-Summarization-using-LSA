Strategic report | Highlights
“The UK public has once again moved 
with Rightmove, spending 11.7 billion 
minutes on Rightmove platforms in 
2017. Our focus and innovation 
continue to make us the place that 
consumers turn to first and that 
property professionals turn to  
most often.
Our customer numbers increased to a 
record high of nearly 20,500, testament 
to our aim to provide customers with 
the most effective marketing exposure 
and the highest quality leads, as well as 
helping to drive efficiencies within their 
businesses through tools and support.
As the industry becomes more digital 
our software has become even more 
valuable to our customers with 90% of 
our Agency members making use of it 
each month. Our market leading 
position, our culture of restlessness, 
and our ambition to make our 
marketplace even more efficient 
means there are many reasons to be 
excited by the opportunities ahead for 
Rightmove, and the Board remains 
confident of making further progress  
in 2018.”

only a series of personal home moving experiences, but also 
reflects our focus on the end game. We make home search 
simple. The quality and clarity of user experience across 
desktop, smartphone and tablet is testament to our 
developers and designers who seek to achieve this outcome. 
It was a proud year of achievement serving property 
professionals and home hunters. We are committed to 
continue that effort with the same level of energy , innovation 
and sensitivity to the needs and demands of all our 
stakeholders in 2018.
Financial results
The strength of our business model and core value 
proposition once again underpins our robust financial results 
in 2017. Underlying operating profit
(1)
 was up 11% to £184.4m 
(2016: £166.2m) and operating profit was up 10% at £178.3m 
(2016: £161.6m) driven by  revenue growth of 11% to 
£243.3m (2016: £220.0m) and a disciplined approach to  
cost control. Underlying basic earnings per share

 and  
basic earnings per share were both up 14% at 163.3p  
(2016: 142.8p) and 156.8p (2016: 137.9p) respectively , even 
greater than the percentage increase in profits and in part as a 
result of 2.2m shares bought back during the year at a cost of 
£90.8m as part of our policy of returning cash to shareholders.
Returns to shareholders and dividend
Our commitment to return excess cash promptly to investors 
continues to be as strong as ever and in 2017 we returned a 
further £140.4m (2016: £131.3m) to shareholders through 
dividends and share buybacks. Operating cash conversion
(3)
 
was again very strong and remains in excess of 100% of 
operating profit.
The Board increased the interim dividend to 22.0p  
(H1 2016: 19.0p) per ordinary share, which was paid on  
3 November 2017. We are confident in our ability to deliver 
I am pleased to present Rightmove plc’s results for the year 
ended 31 December 2017.
Throughout our history we have enabled our property 
industry partners to be more informed, make better and faster 
decisions and realise efficiencies both during robust and 
quieter housing market cycles. Perhaps the most notable 
feature of 2017 was our continued innovation of digital 
solutions for the UK housing market. We have also continued 
to be the only place where consumers can see almost the 
entire UK property market, giving our customers access to an 
unrivalled audience for their brands and exposure for their 
sales and rental properties. 
Rightmove’s higher value Optimiser product package is a 
perfect example of the changing and improved nature of our 
digital product suite. It gives our customers the ability to select 
the tools and advertising that best strengthen their marketing 
plans and achieve their business goals after discussion with 
and insight from Rightmove account managers. 
Notable new products in 2017 include Rightmove Discover , 
which leverages Artificial Intelligence to assist estate agents 
with identifying instruction opportunities which are the raw 
material for our customers’ businesses. Property data  
has always been at the core of our business and we are  
excited about continuing to harness the power of our data  
to drive further efficiency in the property market, predict 
market opportunities and drive success for our customers 
and consumers.  
Rightmove’s culture is to remove complexity and our  
ambition is to make home moving easier and more  
efficient. Our attachment to our homes and the  
emotional experience of moving house over a lifetime  
is not lost on us. That recognition is underscored in our  
recent television advertising campaign that captures not

Chairman rightmove.co.uk 4
Andrew Findlay to the Board in advance of the retirement of 
our current Audit Committee Chairman, Ashley Martin, in  
May 2018. Andrew brings a wealth of financial expertise, 
commercial experience and a strong consumer-centric 
background and will be appointed Chair of the Audit 
Committee in May 2018. Ashley leaves Rightmove after  
nine years of providing sage advice during a period in  
which our business, financial systems and controls have 
evolved significantly. The Board has benefited from his 
valuable contributions and I am personally grateful for  
his wise counsel. 
Following the year end, we announced the appointment of 
Lorna Tilbian as a Non-Executive Director with effect from  
1 February 2018. Lorna has had a distinguished career in the 
media sector and I am delighted to welcome her to the Board. 
Lorna’s addition to the Board is also notable in that from  
May 2018, this will bring our female Board representation to 
50% overall with a 50:50 representation of men and women  
at both executive and non-executive director level.
Looking forward 
The Board and I are grateful for the confidence and support  
of all our customers and for the talent and dedication of our 
employees. We are clear that our goal is to continue to work 
together to position Rightmove as the essential marketplace 
for home hunters and for property advertisers to reach by far 
the widest possible audience. 
 
Scott Forbes
Chairman
sustainable returns to shareholders and consistent with our 
policy of increasing the total dividend for the year broadly in 
line with earnings per share, the Board recommends a final 
dividend of 36.0p (2016: 32.0p) per ordinary share. This brings 
the total dividend for the year to 58.0p (2016: 51.0p), an 
increase of 14%. The final dividend, subject to shareholder 
approval, will be paid on 1 June 2018 to all shareholders on  
the register on 4 May 2018.
Corporate governance
One of the Board’s responsibilities is ensuring that the Group 
applies good governance to facilitate effective management  
of a high growth business. As the Company’s Chairman I am 
pleased to note that the Group is continuing to foster an 
environment of entrepreneurial leadership and innovation in a 
framework of responsible governance and risk management as 
set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 32 to 45.  
Board changes 
In May 2017, after 16 years of leadership, Nick McKittrick 
retired from the Board. Nick had led the Company as Chief 
Executive Officer since April 2013 and together with his 
management team helped deliver an outstanding financial 
performance with revenues growing by over 50% and a strong 
share price rise during that period that reflected our delivery 
of continued improvements in value provided to customers 
and consumers alike.
Nick passed the baton to Peter Brooks-Johnson, our  
Chief Operating Officer and Board director since 2011,  
and I am pleased to say , that as anticipated, the transition  
has been seamless with the strong results in 2017 and 
continued positive outlook being testament to this.
Having completed three full terms, Colin Kemp retired from 
the Board as a Non-Executive Director in May 2017. In June 
2017 as part of our Board succession plans, we welcomed 
It was a proud year of achievement serving 
property professionals and home hunters.

Strategic report | Business model
The UK housing market, both in 
sales and rentals, is complex and 
often inefficient. Moving home can 
be a stressful and time consuming 
experience for consumers and an 
inefficient, frustrating process for 
professionals often with elements 
of wasted effort and unavoidable 
manual processes. We believe  
by creating a simpler and more 
efficient marketplace we can make 
home moving in the UK easier.  
A better marketplace which 
empowers consumers and 
property professionals alike 
creates a better housing market. 
By creating value for , and building 
long-term partnerships with,  
both consumers and property 
professionals we are able to grow 
our revenue. Our continued 
growth allows us to innovate  
to create more value for all.
Our aim is to create a more efficient housing  
marketplace and make home moving easier
What we do 
Rightmove is the UK’s number  
one property portal and the UK’s 
largest property marketplace.  
We bring the UK’s largest and most 
engaged property audience and 
the largest inventory of properties 
together in one place. We benefit 
from strong network effects as  
our property audience and the 
properties our customers 
advertise create a ‘virtuous circle’ 
enhancing the Rightmove value 
proposition. 
Our customers are primarily  
estate agents, letting agents  
and new homes developers 
advertising properties for  
sale and to rent in the UK.
Rightmove is free to consumers,  
and it is the only place where home 
buyers and renters can see almost 
the entire UK property market in one 
place. The ease of accessing the  
UK property market through fast, 
always available digital platforms 
means Rightmove has become the 
place consumers turn to first when 
they think about moving home.
The simplicity Rightmove brings can 
reduce the stress of finding your  
next home. The carefully designed 
website avoids distractions in 
pursuit of simplicity , putting home 
hunters in control of their search and 
research. Rightmove takes some of 
the effort out of the home search by 
bringing suitable properties to home 
hunters, and in 2017 we sent more 
than half a billion instant alerts to 
over two million people. Knowing the 
moment a new property comes to 
market allows a home hunter to stay 
abreast of the market wherever they 
are. Combined with our near whole  
of market view , consumers need not 
fear missing their dream property 
when it comes to market.  
Rightmove uses its unrivalled data to 
create well-designed features which

(1) Property Academy - Home Moving T rends Survey 2017
By creating the UK’s largest 
property marketplace we have 
brought together virtually all the 
audience our customers want to 
attract. We are able to offer the 
most significant and effective 
exposure for their brands and 
properties resulting in the largest 
source of high quality leads, 
thereby significantly increasing our 
customers’ marketing efficiency. 
We also help drive efficiencies 
within our customers’ businesses 
by providing best in class software 
that delivers data, market insight 
and tools to help them inform their 
decisions. 90% of our Agency 
customers now use our software 
each month. 
We continue to innovate to create 
value for our customers. In 2017 we 
significantly enhanced our market 
intelligence software, known as 
Rightmove Intel, for agents. 
Rightmove Intel focuses on the key 
information a business owner 
wants to know: how they measure 
up against their competition and 
where they can win new business. 
Previously , many of our customers 
would have manually gathered 
valuation and comparable data or 
paid a third party to count ‘For Sale’  
and ‘Sold’ advertising boards for 
market share information. This was 
quickly out of date whereas today 
this is available in real time as part  
of their membership subscription. 
Winning new business is a resource 
intensive activity for our customers. 
Rightmove Intel now highlights

How we make the market more efficient  
for industry professionals
help people make more informed 
decisions. Finding the place to  
move to, that is affordable, meets 
ones commuting criteria and fulfils 
ones property dreams can prove 
challenging. This year we launched 
the innovative ‘Where can I live?’ 
feature which helps home hunters 
work through the bewildering array 
of location choices in the initial 
stages of their property search and 
opens up possibilities to find the 
next home which is right for them. 
Rightmove is compelling to home 
sellers and landlords too. It’s no 
wonder , when home sellers and 
landlords are so much more likely  
to find their buyer or tenant on 
Rightmove compared to any other 
portal, that 85%
(1)
 of people selling 
their home rank Rightmove as the 
most important site for marketing 
their property.
Beyond finding a buyer or tenant,  
the tools we provide for researching 
the market bring simplicity and 
confidence to sellers and landlords  
as they consider one of the largest 
transactions of their lives and 
choose an agent to help them on 
their home moving journey.

Our principal sources of revenue 
are the monthly subscription fees 
paid by customers to advertise  
all of their properties and the fees 
paid for our additional advertising 
products and packages. Our 
additional advertising products 
increase a customer’s share of 
voice and competitiveness.  
These are critical factors for our 
customers and particularly for  
an agent to help to win the 
instruction opportunity to sell or 
rent a home, which remains the 
lifeblood of their business. 
In 2017 our Average Revenue Per 
Advertiser was again driven by our 
customers adopting our higher 
value packages and products.  
We now have over 45% of 
independent agency customers 
spending over £1,000 per month 
on Rightmove, up from 36% a  
year ago.
As the property industry becomes 
more digital, Rightmove’s market 
leading audience and best in class 
software is becoming even more 
valuable to customers. Average 
Revenue Per Advertiser growth 
will continue to be driven by 
increased product penetration, 
pricing and innovation and is 
underpinned by the value of our 
audience and data, our substantial 
product inventory and our culture 
and track record of innovation.
We also continue to develop  
a number of smaller adjacent 
businesses such as advertising 
overseas and commercial 
properties and providing  
property related data and 
valuation services.

opportunities meaning agents can 
spend more of their time on the 
most valuable opportunities.
The value of our unrivalled whole  
of market view extends beyond 
property search and research, it 
also helps make the process of 
valuing properties for mortgage 
applications simpler and more 
efficient. In 2017 we released the 
latest version of our market leading 
‘Surveyors Comparable T ool’.  
The tool is used by surveyors to 
support their valuations in the 
majority of all successful mortgage 
applications. The new version 
supports our surveyor customers’ 
increasingly mobile ways of working 
both on and offline giving them 
flexible access to key data and 
allowing them to have more choice 
on where and when they work.

Rightmove Intel homepage rightmove.co.uk 8
We continue to achieve this by providing consumers with the 
most up to date, engaging and comprehensive property 
content together with search, research and home moving 
tools to support their home moving journey. In addition to  
the hundreds of updates to our platforms each month,  
recent improvements and innovations include: redesigning 
map-based search and the introduction of ‘Where can I live?’ 
discovery-based search functionality which helps consumers 
find homes in areas which are affordable and convenient for 
them. Innovation requires experimentation, and in 2017 we 
piloted an experimental app, ‘RentLondon’, which explored 
trends in search to make the process of finding a rental 
property more efficient. It incorporated a ‘messenger bot’ to 
enable renters to conduct their entire search using natural 
language via Facebook Messenger. The future is exciting as 
we take the learnings from RentLondon and apply them to  
our core search functionality in 2018.
We continued to invest in our brand in 2017, concentrating on 
two market sectors: renters, and those looking to find the right 
home near the right school. We launched the latest iteration 
of our ‘find your happy’ television campaign on Christmas Day. 
This next phase brings to life strong emotional stories which 
many home hunters connect with. The stories all relate to why 
people move, not just the search process. Our first critically 
acclaimed advert in the series addresses downsizing and 
growing families. It not only created a bit of a stir on social 
media but reflects our position at the heart of home moving 
for all generations. Brand building will continue to focus on 
national television through our partnership with Channel 4 
supported by online video on demand. We will also continue  
to add further presence in London with 400 branded taxis, 
additional outdoor media and our exclusive partnerships  
with the Evening Standard and Time Out. 
Rightmove, the UK’s number one property portal, has 
delivered another year of record results. Our number of 
advertisers grew by 2% to reach an all-time high of nearly 
20,500 and with advertisers spending more on our products, 
data and services, our revenue increased by 11% to £243.3m 
with underlying operating profit
(1)
 up 11% to £184.4m and 
operating profit up 10% to £178.3m.
Home movers visited Rightmove over 1.5 billion times in 
2017, an increase of over 4% on 2016 and they spent nearly  
a billion minutes on Rightmove every month.
Our continued progress is testament to our restless focus  
on the UK property advertising market and the huge effort 
‘Rightmovers’ have made to build our business in partnership 
with our industry customers. This restless innovation was 
recognised by Forbes in 2017, ranking Rightmove as the 
world’s most innovative growth company for the second year 
in a row. Our innovation is focused on making our marketplace 
simpler and more efficient, creating even more reasons to be 
excited by the opportunities ahead for Rightmove.
Our Strategy – making home moving easier
The place consumers ‘turn to first’ and engage with most 
At the core of our strategy is a relentless focus on continual 
improvement and innovation to create the most compelling 
experience for consumers so that they turn to us first. With 
our focus on doing the right thing for both consumers and 
customers, Rightmove is a trusted and valuable source of 
property information. We provide support for home movers 
enabling them to feel confident, inspired and in control.  
This not only results in more consumers turning to Rightmove 
first and engaging with us, but importantly it generates more 
and better quality leads for our customers than anywhere  
else, leading to better outcomes and greater value for them.

data and technology to run a market leading automated 
valuation model for some of the largest lenders and help the 
surveying industry to drive efficiencies in their businesses.  
For example, our Surveyors Comparable T ool saves surveyors 
preparation time, improves valuation accuracy and provides 
documentary proof of the process making it the go-to tool  
for the industry. During 2017 the tool assessed and scored 
over 1.7 billion comparable property records to create over 
two million compatible reports for surveyors. 
Unrivalled exposure, leads and products for our customers
With visits to our platforms growing for the 16th consecutive 
year we continued to increase the exposure for our 
customers’ brands and properties. This exposure generated 
43.6 million leads for our customers, seven percent down on 
2016. The surge in lettings stock following the stamp duty 
increase for second properties in April 2016 meant for most 
of 2017 the lettings market was less frenetic giving potential 
tenants more choice. In these market conditions each tenant 
typically sends fewer leads as they are more assured of 
securing the property they want. In addition, this takes 
account of the full year impact of changes we made to the 
search flow in the second half of 2016 to further increase the 
quality of our leads. In order to help agents become more 
efficient every lead sent through Rightmove is now about a 
specific property.
More consumers than ever turned to Rightmove in 2017 with 
over 1.5 billion visits across all our platforms. Time spent on 
the Rightmove platforms was unchanged year on year at a 
record equalling 11.7 billion minutes. Against the backdrop of  
a new, faster site infrastructure rolled out during 2016, a less 
frenetic lettings market and the increase in use of mobile 
devices, which typically have lower average time per visit,  
this demonstrates the continued popularity and importance 
of our platforms. Our market share of traffic across both 
desktop and mobile was 73%
(2)
 with the mobile component 
even higher at 79%
(2)
.
The tools we provide for researching the market bring 
simplicity and confidence to sellers and landlords. T raffic to  
our research tools also grew significantly in 2017 as sellers  
and landlords turned to Rightmove first to help inform their 
decisions. Our research tools, such as sold prices data, are  
by far the most widely used in the UK and provide the unique 
benefit of access to our catalogue of one million currently 
listed properties and 45 million historical property records. 
Consumers spent over 420 million minutes using our research 
tools in 2017 which is up by over 15% on the previous year.
Visits to our Overseas property site remained consistent  
with levels seen in 2016, suggesting the dream of owning a 
property abroad for many of the British public continues to  
be a popular one, despite the fall in Sterling and uncertainty 
around the UK’s relationship with Europe. Given the 
environment, it is testament to the value of our advertising 
platform that the number of overseas properties we 
advertised increased by 6% on average despite the  
number of overseas estate agent and developer  
customers advertising falling by 7%. 
Our Commercial property advertising business continues  
to gain momentum with commercial property professionals 
and occupiers spending over 11 million minutes per month 
Home movers visited Rightmove over  
1.5 billion times in 2017 and they spent

Average Revenue Per Advertiser increased by 10% to

Innovation to create a simpler and more  
efficient marketplace 
Combining our software and whole of market dataset whilst 
supported by our dedicated account management teams, we 
help customers drive operational efficiencies and inform their 
business decisions. Our focus is in the areas our customers 
value most, which in the case of our agents is identifying 
potential business and winning and retaining that business. 
Whilst our software tools are already recognised as being  
best in class and widely adopted with 90% of our Agency 
customers using our tools each month, it is not in our DNA  
to stand still and we have continued to innovate our market 
intelligence software for agents, Rightmove Intel. Winning  
new business is a resource intensive activity for our customers 
and 2017 saw the introduction of a number of reports which 
highlight both new and secondary business opportunities 
meaning agents can spend more of their time on the most  
valuable opportunities.
These innovations have been warmly received by customers. 
For example in November 2017 our customers ran over two 
million reports, a remarkable 67,000 reports per day and more 
than double the number in November 2016.
Rightmove Intel also helps customers more efficiently 
communicate the marketing performance of properties to 
their vendors. The Marketing Report, which shows the interest 
a property is generating compared to similar properties on the 
market, launched at the end of 2016, was run on over 400,000 
different properties for sale in 2017, covering nearly a third of 
all properties listed in the year. 
2018 will see us continue on this path. We will be releasing a 
number of new tools to help agents become more efficient 
including a tool to help prioritise vendor enquiries from 
Rightmove and a solution to better manage the process  
of referencing rental tenants in advance of the looming  
tenant fee ban. 
Our  focus on the quality of our leads continues to stand us in 
good stead as they convert far more often to instructions, 
sales and lets for our customers. In fact, we generate 86%
(3)
  
of the sales and lets from portals for our Agency customers, 
our fourth year of consecutive growth. No wonder , when 
home sellers and landlords are so much more likely to find 
their buyer or tenant on Rightmove compared to any other 
portal, that 85%
(4)
 of people selling their home rank Rightmove 
as the most important site for marketing their property. 
Winning the right to an instruction to sell or let a property is 
critical to an agent’s success. Over a million of the email leads 
sent by home movers to agents highlighted that they had a 
property to sell, each one creating an instruction opportunity 
for a customer. These were in addition to the instruction 
opportunities that came via our telephone leads, which 
accounted for around 60% of all leads. We also delivered 
175,000 leads from people asking for a valuation on their 
home, for those customers who bought our popular Local 
Valuation Alert product. 
Following the acquisition of the Outside View in 2016 we 
launched our new ‘Rightmove Discover’product in July 2017. 
Using our combined knowhow and Rightmove’s unique 
dataset, Rightmove Discover uses predictive analytics to 
identify the most likely potential sellers in a local area within the 
next six months and markets to them on behalf of an agent. 
The early success of Rightmove Discover is encouraging and 
since launch, we have delivered nearly 16,000 high quality email 
leads to our customers in 750 areas. Customers also report an 
increase in potential vendors contacting them via telephone 
and their own websites. Our customers who have purchased 
the product have benefitted from exclusive, early contact from 
vendors of an equivalent of 5% of resale properties which 
came to market in the second half of the year.
There is significant headroom to grow product revenue as we 
leverage data to increase the penetration of existing products, 
evolve their value and pricing, and continue to innovate and 
introduce new products as customers look to invest more to 
drive their brand exposure and gain market share. This year

In parallel with these new events we continue to run our ever 
popular webinar series which allows estate agency teams to 
learn how to make the most of the Rightmove platforms  
while also covering industry topics and more general business 
practices. In 2017 we ran 170 webinars attended by over 
16,500 people.
Build great teams with a culture to innovate
Rightmove is people and our people define Rightmove. 
Rightmove has a culture which is both restless and focused. 
We strive to create one team of Rightmovers with as few 
barriers as possible to rapid growth and innovation. We believe 
that this comes from a process-light, highly connected 
organisation with little constraining hierarchy and bureaucracy. 
It is about employing the right people, giving them the 
freedom and authority to innovate and lead, and then guiding 
them to succeed. In order to hear the symphonies produced 
by a well-functioning team we need every Rightmover to be  
both individually empowered and accountable. 
A diverse Rightmove is important to us. We recognise that a 
diverse team will provide a wide range of perspectives that 
promote innovation and business success. Drawing on what  
is unique about individuals adds value to the way we do 
business and helps us anticipate and provide what our 
customers want from us and what home hunters want  
from the Rightmove platforms.
Foremost in the design of our expanded London home,  
we have taken care to create a physical environment that 
encourages open and honest discussion, including social 
spaces for the teams to enjoy each other’s company.  
Our workplace is free from offices and the usual trappings  
of hierarchy.
We believe in sharing often and early and reinforce this 
through events such as ‘townhalls’ which share progress, 
successes and challenges. In June 2017 the whole of 
Rightmove spent a day and a summer night under canvas 
together building and reinforcing cross team connections. 
Beyond Rightmove Discover our data continues to provide 
the basis for a rich seam of innovation. Following successful 
experiments during 2017, we intend to launch Rightmove 
Active Display in 2018, which will allow our New Homes 
customers to target their potential audience on Rightmove 
based on the home hunter’s usage of Rightmove over time, 
not just their current search criteria.
The digitalisation of the property industry and the efficiencies 
our software and tools bring help to reduce the cost per 
Agency office and have also enabled the growth in the 
number of customers. Over the last 12 months our 
membership base has grown to close to 20,500 customers.
We care about our customers’ business success and building 
strong partnerships is vital to support their ambitions, 
especially in light of the significant digital changes that are 
taking place. T o that end we are spending more time with 
customers than ever before and making sure that more  
of our conversations lead to recommendations that our 
customers truly value.
In 2017 we evolved our event programme with the 
introduction of ‘Rightmove Live’. These events brought 
together speakers from a range of industries covering content 
applicable to all small and medium sized businesses, with an 
objective of inspiring and motivating. Speakers included  
Dr David Lewis, ‘father of neuromarketing’; Nicky Moffat CBE, 
British Army highest-ranking female officer and Andrew 
McMillan, Head of Customer Service at John Lewis. In keeping 
with an online culture these events are now hosted on an ‘on 
demand’ platform, meaning our customers can benefit from 
this content irrespective of whether they were able to attend 
on the day. 
We also recognise our role in helping our customers keep up 
to date with a changing industry. Bringing together industry 
experts covering a range of changes facing agents in 2018, 
including the General Data Protection Regulation and lettings 
legislation, ‘Legislation Live’ was attended by over 250 agents 
from around the country with a further 600 watching a live 
stream of the event.
We care about our customers’ business 
success and building strong partnerships 
is vital to support their ambitions. rightmove.co.uk 12
Investing in our  
market leading brand
Our marketing connects with the strong positive 
emotions that moving home often generates and 
reaffirms that the UK public moves with Rightmove. 
The place consumers ‘turn to first’ and engage with most
With the focus on doing the right thing for both consumers 
and customers, Rightmove is a trusted and valuable  
source of property information.

Our culture is not solely built on events like these, but  
also from the everyday small gestures, including sending 
employees monkey puzzle tree seeds to celebrate National 
T ree week or a ‘Rightmove-versary’ card to mark their first 
anniversary at Rightmove. Everything together creates a 
unique and driven environment that we believe results in 
people feeling a sense of belonging and a passion to perform. 
By striving to make Rightmove a great place to work we can 
attract and retain the best talent and provide the best service 
for consumers and customers.  
Great talent and passion to perform is not enough to make  
a great Rightmover; the way in which we behave towards  
each other , our customers and consumers is vital. We expect 
the very highest standards of ethical behaviour from all 
employees. How we go about our work is central to our 
recruitment, feedback and personal development processes. 
We also have a scheme to allow Rightmovers to recognise 
their peers who embody the behaviours we aspire to. 
The biggest influence on our culture, of course, comes from  
our people. Their actions and behaviours create the sense of 
belonging and connection and allow the business to continue  
to thrive and attract great people. In our 2017 ‘Have Your Say’ 
people survey , 90% of Rightmovers responded that they think 
‘Rightmove is a great place to work’. Whilst this is a very strong 
result, it is below the record high level of 95% achieved in 2016. 
T o celebrate those employees who have been part of the 
Rightmove journey for more than ten years we have continued 
with our well known, although not widely replicated, practice of 
creating a gnome in their image. In the fast moving world of 
today , long tenures with single organisations are becoming  
rarer so I’m pleased that we have expanded our ‘gnome tree’  
to accommodate an ever growing collection of gnomes. 
Our culture sets us apart from many organisations and is 
defined by everyone of the nearly 500 people who are proud 
to call themselves Rightmovers. I would like to thank them  
all for creating a culture which continues to drive our  
business success.
Current trading and outlook
We believe the outlook for the UK online property advertising 
market remains positive, despite the continuing uncertainties 
stemming from the result of the EU referendum. Consumers 
and customers are becoming increasingly digital and therefore 
spend continues to transition from traditional advertising 
channels. 
Our clear market leadership coupled with the value of  
our products and data positions us well for the future.  
With Average Revenue Per Advertiser continuing to  
grow from a stable membership base the Board remains 
confident of making further progress in 2018.

Our Agency business was the main driver of the overall  
revenue growth increasing by £16.9m year on year to 
£185.2m (2016: £168.3m). Agency continues to be our 
largest business, contributing 76% (2016: 77%) of our total 
revenue. The majority of the revenue increase came from 
ARPA growth as a result of the further adoption of additional 
advertising products together with increases to core 
membership prices. Spending by agents increased across our 
range of additional advertising products due to increased 
segmentation of our customer base and continued adoption 
of higher value packages. 
The number of Agency offices was up 1% since the start of 
the year to a record high of 17,626 (2016: 17,462), with the 
growth attributable to an increase in resale branch numbers 
(including growth in the number of branch equivalents for 
members operating an online or a hybrid model).
Revenue from our New Homes business grew strongly to 
£39.5m (2016: £33.9m), an increase of 16% driven by the  
sale of additional advertising products and by increases to  
core membership prices, together with healthy growth in 
development numbers, up 5% year on year to 2,801

activities of £150.5m (2016: £141.2m).
Capital expenditure of £2.2m (2016: £1.8m) includes 
capitalised leasehold improvements and works in relation  
to our London office refit together with investment in  
new servers. 
Proceeds of £0.7m (2016: £0.4m) were received on the 
exercise of share-based incentives and £0.8m (2016: £0.8m) 
was applied to purchase shares to fund the Rightmove Share 
Incentive Plan. 
During 2017, £90.8m was spent on the repurchase of  
our own shares (2016: £88.1m) whilst a further £49.6m  
(2016: £43.2m) was paid in dividends reflecting the increased 
final dividend for 2016 and the 3p increase in the interim 
dividend this year. This brings the total cash returned to 
shareholders in the year to £140.4m (2016: £131.3m).
The closing Group cash and money market deposit balance  
at the end of the year was £25.0m (2016: £17.8m).
Dividends
Consistent with our policy of growing the dividend broadly  
in line with the increase in underlying earnings per share,  
the directors are recommending a final dividend of 36.0p 
(2016: 32.0p) per ordinary share, which together with the 
interim dividend makes a total dividend for the year of 58.0p 
(2016: 51.0p), an increase of 14%. The final dividend, subject 
to shareholder approval, will be paid on 1 June 2018 to all 
shareholders on the register on 4 May 2018.

Share-based payments and National Insurance (NI)
In accordance with IFRS 2, a non-cash charge of £4.9m  
(2016: £4.1m) is reflected in the income statement 
representing the amortisation of the fair value of  
share-based incentives granted.
NI is being accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8% on the 
potential employee gain on share-based incentives granted. 
Based on a year on year increase in the closing share price 
from £39.03 at 31 December 2016 to £45.00 at 31 December 
2017 in respect of the outstanding share-based incentives 
granted, together with the realised NI cost on share-based 
incentives exercised in the year , there was a charge of £1.2m 
(2016: £0.5m).
T axation
The consolidated tax rate for the year ended 31 December 
2017 was 19.1% (2016: 19.8%). The effective tax rate was 
slightly lower than the UK enacted rate of 19.3% due to 
research and development relief claimed in relation to the 
prior year. 
We are committed to being a responsible tax payer acting in a 
straightforward and open manner in all tax matters. The total 
tax payable in respect of 2017 was £96.6m (2016: £78.5m). 
£38.6m (2016: £31.6m) related to corporation tax and 
employer’s NI and apprenticeship levy borne by the Group 
while the remaining £58.0m (2016: £46.9m) was collected in 
respect of payroll taxes and VA T. The Company currently has 
no open tax authority enquiries in respect of any tax and there 
are no known material tax risks based on the positions 
adopted. The Company has therefore not recognised any 
uncertain liabilities in relation to estimates of additional tax 
which may be pursuant to enquiries. 
Earnings per share (EPS)
Underlying basic EPS

 increased by 14% to 163.3p  
(2016: 142.8p). Basic EPS also increased by 14% to 156.8p 
(2016: 137.9p). The growth in EPS was mainly attributable  
to the increase in profitability in the year together with the 
benefit of our continued share buyback programme which 
reduced the weighted average number of ordinary shares  
in issue to 91.9m (2016: 94.0m).
Balance sheet
Rightmove’s balance sheet at 31 December 2017 showed 
total equity of £17.2m (2016: £8.0m) reflecting growth in 
profit and retained earnings less the continued return of 
capital to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and 
dividends during the year.

Risk management is reinforced by the Group’s continuous 
process to design and embed strong internal controls across 
the business as we grow , particularly in relation to smaller 
breadth business areas. The Group’s internal control 
framework is aligned to a ‘three lines of defence’ model. 
Operational management is the organisation’s first line of 
defence as they are primarily responsible for the direct 
management of risk and ensuring that appropriate mitigating 
controls are in place and that they are operating effectively. 
The second line is formed by the Group’s internal compliance 
and oversight functions such as company secretariat, finance, 
tax, treasury and legal. The third line includes both internal and 
external audit  reporting to the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee receives and analyses regular reports 
from management and the outsourced internal audit function 
on matters relating to risk and control and reviews the 
timeliness and effectiveness of corrective action taken by 
management. The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board 
also considers the findings and recommendations of its 
external auditor throughout the year to design and implement 
effective financial controls. Further detail of these activities are 
included within the Audit Committee report on pages 38 to 43.

Approach to risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that risk is 
effectively managed across the Group. The primary method 
by which risks are monitored and managed is through the 
monthly Executive Committee meetings. The subject of risk 
is included on each monthly agenda and any significant new 
risks or change in status to existing significant risks is 
discussed and actions taken as appropriate.
The Group operates a cautious approach to risk and its ‘risk 
appetite’ is relatively low. The open culture which is embedded 
throughout Rightmove is such that objective views are made 
when assessing risks and internal controls, dialogue is 
encouraged, and decisions are not made until risks have  
been appropriately considered.
On a bi-annual basis, risk is reviewed by operational 
management across each business area. This review includes  
a detailed assessment of new and existing identified risks, the 
likelihood of each risk occurring and the potential impact, 
together with controls and mitigating procedures in place.  
This information is combined to form a consolidated risk 
register which is reported to the Executive Committee for 
review and challenge, ahead of final review and approval by the 
Board. A nominated director has responsibility for each risk.  
The Board reviewed the risk register at both the February 2017 
and November 2017 Board meetings, with a particular focus  
on the principal risks identified and any new or emerging risks.

Macroeconomic environment 
The Group derives almost all its 
revenues from the UK and is therefore 
dependent on the macroeconomic 
conditions surrounding the UK housing 
market and consumer confidence 
which impacts on property  
transaction levels. 
Specific considerations resulting from 
the UK’s decision to leave the European 
Union have been outlined on page 24.
Substantially fewer housing transactions 
than the norm may lead to a reduction  
in the number of Agency branches or  
New Home developments, a major 
determinant of the Group’s revenue.
In addition, a contraction in the volume 
of transactions in the UK housing market 
could lead to a reduction in advertisers’ 
marketing budgets which could reduce 
the demand for the Group’s property 
advertising products.
•  Monitoring of housing market 
including leading indicators and trends 
in Rightmove membership
•  Continuing to provide the most 
significant and effective exposure for 
customers’ brands and properties, be 
the largest source of high quality leads 
and offer value-adding products and 
packages and help drive operational 
efficiencies for our customers, 
thereby embedding the value of  
our membership
•  Communicating the effectiveness  
of digital media versus alternative 
mediums such as print
•  Maintaining a flexible cost base that 
can respond to changing conditions
 
 
 2
Competitive environment
The Group operates in a competitive 
marketplace with attractive margins 
and low barriers to entry. This may 
result in increased competition from 
existing competitors or new entrants 
targeting the Group’s primary revenue 
markets.
This may impact on Rightmove’s ability to 
grow revenue due to the potential loss of:
• Audience
• Advertisers
•  Demand for additional  
advertising products
•  Communication of the value of 
Rightmove membership to advertisers
•  Continued investment in our account 
management teams to ensure we stay 
close to our customers and local 
markets and help our customers run 
their businesses more efficiently
•  Sustained marketing investment in 
the Rightmove brand
•  Sustained investment and innovation 
in serving both home hunters and our 
customers

New or disruptive technologies and 
changing consumer behaviours
Rightmove operates in a fast-moving 
online marketplace. Failure to innovate 
or adopt new technologies or failure to 
adapt to changing customer business 
models and evolving consumer 
behaviour may impact the Group’s 
ability to offer the best products and 
services to its advertisers and the best 
consumer experience.
Under-performance and impact on 
Rightmove’s ability to grow revenue 
due to the potential loss of:
• Audience engagement
• Advertisers
•  Demand for additional  
advertising products
•  Continual improvements to our 
platforms including ongoing investment 
in mobile and tablet platforms
•  Developing our product proposition to 
meet our customers’ needs and 
evolving business models
•  Large in-house technology team  
with culture of innovation 
•  Innovation lab to develop emerging 
models and technologies
•  Ongoing monitoring of consumer 
behaviour and annual ‘Hackathons’ 
which allow employees to spend time 
during work hours to develop their 
own online property related ideas
•  Regular contact with the start-up and 
prop-tech communities to stay abreast 
of innovations in the marketplace
 
A description of the principal risks and uncertainties faced by 
the Group in 2017, together with the potential impact and 
monitoring and mitigating activities is set out in the table below.
We recognise that the Group is exposed to risks wider than 
those listed, however we have disclosed those that we believe 
are likely to have the greatest impact on the Group delivering its 
strategic objectives and those that have been the subject of 
discussion at recent Board and Audit Committee meetings. Strategic report Governance Financial statements

Cyber security and IT systems
The Group has a high dependency on 
technology and internal IT systems.
In today’s digital world there are 
increased risks associated with external 
cyber attacks which could result in 
unavailability of our platforms.
A security breach such as corruption  
or loss of key data may disrupt the 
efficiency and functioning of the 
Group’s day to day operations.
Potential reputational damage and 
financial losses arising from penalties 
and fines due to loss of consumer and 
customer confidence in the Rightmove 
brand and platforms. 
•  Disaster Recovery and Business 
Continuity Plans in place, subject  
to regular review and testing
•  Use of three data centres to load 
balance and ensure optimal 
performance and business continuity 
capability
•  Regular backups of key data
•  Regular testing of the security of the 
IT systems and platforms including 
penetration testing and distributed 
denial of service attack procedures
•  Ongoing investment in security 
systems
•  Ongoing monitoring of external 
threats through updates from external 
specialists and collaboration with 
other online organisations
•  Regular internal security training and 
‘spearphishing’ tests to minimise risk 
of social engineering attacks

Securing and retaining the  
right talent
Our continued success is dependent on 
our ability to attract, recruit, retain and 
motivate our highly skilled workforce.
The inability to recruit and retain talented 
people could impact our ability to 
maintain our financial performance and 
deliver growth.
When key staff leave or retire, there is a 
risk that knowledge or competitive 
advantage is lost.
•  Ongoing succession planning and 
development of future leaders
•  Payment of competitive reward, 
including a blend of short and  
long-term incentives for senior 
management and the ability for all 
employees to participate in the 
success of the Group through the SIP
•  Regular staff communication and 
engagement
•  Maintaining the culture of the Group, 
which generates significant staff 
loyalty

improve the gender balance across

Strategic report | The EU referendum
Strategic report | Viability statement
The result of the UK’s EU referendum in 2016 increased the 
level of macroeconomic uncertainty and could increase the 
likelihood of the housing market macroeconomic risks set 
out on page 22.
During 2017 the Board has continued to assess the impact 
of the EU referendum result on the Group and its potential 
implications and has concluded that there has been no 
material change to the severity of this risk. In particular , the 
directors considered the following:
•  The Rightmove business is largely subscription based and 
is therefore less susceptible to short-term shocks or 
variations in the property market or wider economy;
In accordance with provision C.2.2. of the Code, the directors 
have assessed the viability of the Group over a three-year 
period, taking into account the Group’s current position and 
the potential impact of the principal risks and uncertainties 
set out on pages 22 to 23. Based upon the robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity , the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company will 
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three-year period to 31 December 2020.
The directors have determined that a three-year period  
to 31 December 2020 constitutes an appropriate period 
over which to provide its viability statement, as the Group 
operates within the online digital marketplace, and 
projections looking out further than three years become 
significantly less meaningful in the context of the fast 
moving nature of the market. Three years is also the period 
considered under the Group’s current three-year strategic 
plan. The three-year plan is reviewed by the directors and is 
developed on a segment by segment basis using a bottom 
up model. The three-year plan makes certain assumptions 
about Agency and New Homes customer numbers, Average 
Revenue Per Advertiser (ARPA) growth and other breadth 
•  Around two-thirds of our estate agency customers also 
provide lettings services which may mitigate the impact of 
any downturn in the property market on their business; and
•  A reduction in housing market activity increases the 
propensity for advertisers to evaluate their marketing 
spend both offline and on other portals and we remain 
confident in the strength of the Rightmove value 
proposition.
The directors believe that our strong market position and 
relationships with our customers, and the value embedded 
in our membership continue to position us well providing 
that housing transaction volumes do not take a sharp 
downward turn.
revenue streams and considers the Group’s profitability, 
cash flows and dividend cover over the period. 
The plan is subject to robust downside sensitivity analysis 
which involves flexing a number of the main assumptions 
underlying the plan. Where appropriate, analysis is carried 
out to evaluate the potential financial impact over the  
period of the Group’s principal risks actually occurring. 
Specific scenarios that have been modelled include 
downside scenarios in relation to the key drivers of revenue 
being customer numbers and ARPA together with the 
impact of a plausible combination of these scenarios. 
Furthermore, our business model is structured so that the 
Group is not overly reliant on a small customer base with no 
single customer constituting more than 3% of Group sales.
Also, given our significant free cash flow and our ability  
to adjust our discretionary share buyback programme  
provides long-term comfort around viability in the face  
of adverse economic or competitive conditions. 
Whilst this review does not consider all the risks that the Group 
may face, the directors consider that this stress-testing based 
assessment of the Group’s prospects is reasonable in the 
circumstances of the inherent uncertainty involved. Strategic report Governance Financial statements

Our people
We believe that our people are the key to Rightmove’s success 
and our most valued asset. We have always strived to make 
Rightmove a great place to work and embedded this into our 
strategic management objectives. We are proud of the energy , 
talent and experience our people bring to the business.  
Our culture is open and supportive, with an encouraging  
and restless yet focussed approach which fosters innovation 
and dedication to excellent customer service. 
Recruitment 
Recruiting the right people with capability and experience  
to drive growth is vital to our business plan. The highly 
competitive market for technology and customer centric 
skills means that we are strongly focussed on maintaining a 
happy, collegiate working environment and the top benefits 
to attract and retain the best people. 
Referrals from existing employees are a valuable source of 
new recruits, typically ensuring a higher quality candidate 
with a better cultural fit. All new vacancies are advertised 
internally first to give our colleagues an opportunity to apply 
or recommend someone. In 2017, 8% of new employees 
were introduced to Rightmove by an existing employee. 
We also believe that long-term commitment from 
Rightmove employees is key to our culture and success.  
For a relatively young company we are proud to have  
67 people who have celebrated ten or more years’  
service, which represents over 14% of our employees  
and contributes to our strong people survey results. 
We continue to support Milton Keynes College in preparing 
students for their future careers. During the year we 
welcomed six students completing their Level 3 Higher 
National Diplomas in our design studio and offered two 
students internships. In addition, our designers have offered 
support and mentoring to students on campus. We have 
continued to expand our intern programme across 
Rightmove. Our technology teams took on four computer 
and data science interns from University College London.
People development and training 
Every new employee attends two office based ‘How 
Rightmove fits together’ days to introduce them to the 
business and our customers. They also attend an off-site 
residential induction course to introduce them to 
Rightmove’s culture and values. 
T o ensure our colleagues can work to the best of their ability ,  
we continue to invest in extensive training and leadership 
programmes, designed to equip them with all the necessary 
skills to provide exceptional service to our customers and 
consumers. We have also developed a suite of internal 
development courses for our employees covering both 
technical and non-technical skills to improve their performance 
through continual professional and personal development.
Employee benefits 
Whilst we believe that being a great place to work helps us 
attract the best talent we also reward our employees with  
a range of additional and competitive benefits.
Rightmove contributes towards a group stakeholder pension 
plan. Opt out rates are low and currently 95% of employees 
are members of the pension plan. We also offer private 
healthcare complemented by a cash plan scheme for all  
our employees’ medical needs. 
It is important that our people can directly benefit from their 
contribution to the success of Rightmove and we offer two  
all-employee share plans. Every employee can join the 
Group’s Save As You Earn Scheme (Sharesave), which allows 
employees to save money from their salary with the option to 
purchase shares at a discount after three years. In November 
2017, the Group’s ninth Sharesave contract matured allowing 
employees to benefit from the Group’s success and strong 
share price growth over the last three years. 67% of our 
employees currently participate in Sharesave.
The Rightmove Share Incentive Plan was launched in 2015 
with an award of 100 free shares for all employees. Those 
shares were available to sell from January 2018, with those 
employees benefiting from the Rightmove share price more 
than doubling over that period. Further awards of 50 free 
shares have been made annually in subsequent years to all 
qualifying employees.

An employee engagement score will again form part of the 
senior management bonus criteria in 2018, demonstrating 
the importance of employee management to the continuing 
success of Rightmove.
The management team continues to work hard to improve 
the employee experience at Rightmove. In 2017, we took on 
additional space and refurbished our London office, taking 
employee preferences into account; the result being a 
creative and welcoming space.
Equality and diversity 
Rightmove has a firm commitment to equality of opportunity 
in all our employment policies and practices. Our recruitment 
and selection processes focus on selecting the best 
candidate for a role, regardless of their age, gender , sexuality , 
full-or part-time status, disability and marital status.
We recognise that a diverse workforce reflects Rightmove’s 
broad consumer base and our many customers. Our people 
have a wide range of experience and perspectives that we 
believe promote innovation, constructive challenge and 
success. Drawing on a wide variety of personal attributes 
drives value in the way we do business and helps us 
anticipate and provide what our customers need from  
us and what home hunters want from Rightmove.
At 31 December 2017, female representation on the Board 
was 38% and with the appointment of Lorna Tilbian in 
February 2018 that proportion has risen to 44% of Board 
members. Following the retirement of Ashley Martin in  
May 2018, we are delighted that female representation on 
the Board will rise to 50%.
The Board continues to focus on succession planning and 
developing potential within the senior management team  
to enable us to promote internal candidates to the Board. 
The Group succession plan also identifies individuals with 
potential to join the senior management team in the wider 
organisation.  As at 31 December 2017, 26% (2016: 21%)  
of our leadership team
(1)
, were female. The Board is keen to 
strengthen female representation in senior roles and has 
been a contributor to the Hampton-Alexander Review, a 
Government sponsored initiative which aims to increase 
female leadership within the FTSE350. In line with the 
Hampton-Alexander Review, Rightmove has set a target  
for 33% female leadership by 2020.  
We offer flexible working arrangements, fully support part-
time working and reduced hours to allow our employees to 
balance their work and family commitments. In 2017, we also 
introduced a flexible holiday scheme to operate from 2018, 
allowing employees to buy or sell up to five days (or the  
part-time equivalent) of holiday each year to suit their 
personal circumstances. 
Engagement
We encourage employee involvement and keep colleagues 
informed of the Group’s activities through ‘townhalls’, 
business performance updates with senior management 
and quarterly sales conferences. 
We have an employee recognition scheme, based on the 
‘Rightmove behaviours’ which allow us to focus on how we 
work not just on what we achieve. It is an opportunity to 
nominate colleagues who have demonstrated the best 
behaviours in action and it continues to prove popular with 
awards presented every two months at our ’townhalls’. 
We conduct an annual ‘Have your Say’ people survey to 
gauge what our employees think and how they feel about 
working for Rightmove. The survey results are followed up  
by every manager and we are never complacent about the 
importance of acting on colleagues’ feedback. We are proud 
of another set of strong results from the survey with 
highlights including:
•  90% of respondents think Rightmove is a great place  
to work;
•  90% are proud to tell people they work for Rightmove; and
•  92% enjoy working in their teams.

Balance for all
•  We have developed maternity and paternity workshops to 
support Rightmovers through the changing dynamic of 
family and work responsibilities and their return to work 
after a career break; and
•  We recognise that balancing work and life commitments 
can make people shy away from taking the next step in  
their career. New flexible working arrangements have  
been rolled out for all employees.
Addressing imbalance
•  We are developing a mentoring programme to support 
career development. We aim to exceed the Hampton-
Alexander review target of 33% of the leadership team 
being female by 2020; 
•  We are creating an internal talent pipeline to promote  
the next generation of leaders;
•  We have launched a graduate programme in technology  
to attract the best new talent to help create balance in  
our technology teams over the longer term; and
•  We have reviewed all job specifications and updated the 
format of our recruitment days to guarantee universal 
appeal and attract the best talent.
Human rights
Rightmove does not have a specific human rights policy,  
we have a framework of policies and statements covering 
equal opportunities, dignity at work, disability, anti-slavery 
and anti-bribery that adhere to internationally recognised 
human rights principles. 
A breakdown by gender of the number of persons as at  
31 December 2017 by various classifications as required  
by the Companies Act, is set out below:
Gender Pay
Rightmove has reported its gender pay gap for 2017 and  
full details can be found on the Company’s website at plc.

We are confident that all Rightmove employees are paid 
equally for working in the same jobs and we are pleased to 
report that men and women are almost equally represented 
in our wider workforce. The main contributor to Rightmove’s 
gender pay gap is the mix in Rightmove communities 
comprising the highest and lowest quartile salaries. Women 
are underrepresented in the higher paid senior management 
and technology teams and men are underrepresented in the 
customer experience team. 
T echnology is a sector blighted by a lack of gender diversity, 
but accepting the status quo is not in our DNA. Below is our 
gender pay gap as at April 2017, together with a description 
of some of the initiatives that we have underway for 
improving our gender balance going forward.

to that objective. We are committed to a number of actions to

The quality of property information available on Rightmove 
also reduces the amount of time home hunters waste in 
visiting inappropriate properties, usually by car. We have 
worked hard to improve the functionality of our platforms 
with better photographs and property floor plans to 
comprehensive map searches and aerial photographs,  
which helps to identify the specific location of a property.  
We continue to add information to help home hunters 
customise their property search on Rightmove including 
School Checker and broadband speeds. All these 
innovations have helped to reduce the carbon footprint 
generated by prospective buyers and renters making 
unnecessary journeys to visit unsuitable properties.
The Rightmove platforms enable our customers to display 
Energy Performance Certificates which allow prospective 
buyers to evaluate the energy efficiency of a property before 
buying and to identify opportunities to improve the energy 
efficiency once they have purchased the property.
As an internet-based business with most staff employed in 
two office locations, our environmental footprint is small.  
We continue to encourage our employees to minimise their 
use of resources and recycle materials wherever possible. 
There are no individual waste bins in our London and  
Milton Keynes offices to encourage and increase the  
amount of recycling. 
As an operator of an online property portal, our main 
environmental impact is from the power usage of our data 
centres. Our procurement policy is to purchase hardware 
with the best computational performance which uses the 
least electrical power. 
We encourage our employees to use public transport rather 
than driving between our two office locations in London and 
Milton Keynes. We encourage participation in our Cycle to 
Work scheme and have many keen cyclists. We have also 
introduced the option for staff entitled to a company car to 
select hybrid electric cars as an alternative to petrol or diesel 
engines. In 2017, our fuel card provider Allstar , again partnered 
with Forest Carbon to capture the CO
2
 emissions from our 
fleet of company cars and turn them into new UK woodlands.
As an online business, we tend towards a paperless 
environment. However , we recognise that our responsibilities 
do not stop with how we operate internally and we encourage 
all our customers, business partners and suppliers to use 
online records and reduce printing, especially emails. 
Wherever possible we have replaced paper-based services 
and communications with online alternatives, including 
e-communications for shareholders, online customer 
membership forms, management information and  
marketing reports and product documentation. 
Charitable activity
We continue to encourage our employees to raise funds for 
their chosen charities. In 2017 we match funded £24,000 
(2016: £18,000), supporting charities including The Stroke 
Association, The Carers T rust, Scope and many more. From 
breakfast mornings to running marathons we are delighted 
that so many of our colleagues devote their time and energy 
to such good causes. For the second year running we have 
supported food banks at Christmas; this year we delivered a 
car packed full of food to the Milton Keynes Food Bank.
In 2017, we contributed £56,000 (2016: £49,000) via Agents 
Giving to support our customers’ charitable initiatives, which 
ranged from a Mount Everest trek to T ough Mudders, 
triathlons and fun runs. We contribute to the costs of setting 
up the fundraising activity , which allows more of the money 
raised by our customers to go directly to charities through a 
charitable sponsorship fund we set up with Agents Giving.  
We are very proud that the fund has raised over £1 million 
since 2014 for charitable causes supported by our customers. 
Looking ahead to 2018 we are pleased to be partnering with  
the Milton Keynes marathon as headline sponsor in 2018 (the 
home of Rightmove) in aid of Meningitis Now and Winter Night 
Shelter. These two causes are very important to our employees 
and fund raising efforts are well underway as part of our ‘On The 
Move’ campaign, with over £1,200 raised in the last four weeks 
of 2017. We have set our employees a target of raising £26,000, 
to be split equally between both charities and Rightmove will 
make a significant additional contribution. Over 50 employees 
will be volunteering their time, training and being creative with 
their fundraising efforts to support these charities.
We will be sponsoring the Milton Keynes College Football 
Academy again in 2018. We have worked closely with the 
college over the last few years, enabling the academy to 
create more opportunities for their students to study for  
off-pitch roles in sport.
Environment
We are conscious of playing our part in tackling climate 
change and always encourage the efficient use of resources 
that contribute to environmental damage. 
Rightmove has changed the way people search for  
property , reducing the reliance on printed media and the 
environmental impact that goes with it. Our platforms are 
designed to optimise the information available to home 
hunters, giving our customers the ability to advertise high 
quality photographs, floor plans and property particulars and 
reducing the need for paper copies of property particulars.

Rightmove plc annual report 2017 29
Emissions have also been calculated using an ‘intensity 
metric’, which will enable the Group to monitor how well we 
are controlling emissions on an annual basis, independent of 
fluctuations in the levels of their activity. As Rightmove is a 
‘people’ business, the most suitable metric is ‘Emissions per 
Employee’, based on the average number of employees 
during the year. The Group’s emissions per employee are 
shown in the table below.

Scope 2 Electricity  0.5 0.7
Scope 3 Outsourced – data centres 0.5 0.7
T otal  2.0 2.4
(1)  Based on 479 (2016: 469) employees taken as the average number of 
employees in the Group throughout the year.  
Scope 2 and 3 emissions per employee have declined year on 
year due in part to an increase in average headcount which has 
not had a proportionate impact on emissions from running 
our offices or the outsourced data centres. We will continue  
 to monitor and look for ways to improve energy efficiency.
Methodology 
We have reported on all of the emission sources required 
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. We have used the 
GHG’s Protocol’s Operational Control consolidation 
method. We do not have responsibility for any emission 
sources that are not included in the above information. 
Health and safety
The Group’s policy on health and safety is to provide 
adequate control of the health and safety risks arising from 
work activities. This is delivered through consultation with, 
and training of, employees, the provision and maintenance of 
plant and equipment, safe handling and use of all substances 
and the prevention of accidents and causes of ill health. At 
Rightmove, our approach to the effective management of 
health and safety is to treat it as an integral part of business 
management. During the year , we continued our fire safety, 
first aid and work place safety training.
Greenhouse gas reporting
The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013 requires all UK quoted companies 
to report on their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which 
are classified as either direct or indirect and which are divided 
further into Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions.
Direct GHG emissions are emissions from sources that are 
owned or controlled by Rightmove. Indirect GHG emissions 
are emissions that are a consequence of the activities of the 
Group but that occur at sources owned or controlled by 
other entities. 
Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions controlled by the 
Group arising from Company cars. Whilst the cars are leased, 
we are responsible for the emissions and therefore we report 
these under Scope 1.
Scope 2 emissions: Indirect emissions attributable to the 
Group due to its consumption of purchased electricity.
Scope 3 emissions: Other indirect emissions associated  
with activities that support or supply the Group’s operations, 
we include emissions arising from our third party run  
data centres.
The Group is required to report Scope 1 and 2 emissions for 
its reporting year to 31 December 2017. Scope 3 is not 
mandatory , however , the Group has again chosen to report 
Scope 3 emissions as it relates to electricity used in data 
centres, in which the Group rents space to house and 
operate various servers, which host our platforms.

T otal  1,007  1,087
(1)  UK emissions factors have been used for all data. All emission factors have 
been selected from the emissions conversion factors published annually  
by Defra. www.gov.uk/measuring-and-reporting-environmental-impacts-
guidance-for-businesses.
Higher fuel consumption was due to increased business 
mileage by employees entitled to Company cars.  
The reduction in electricity use is partly due to closing one 
floor of our London office for refurbishment during 2017  
and lower electricity consumption on the two new floors.  
We expect Scope 2 emissions to return to historic levels  
in 2018.   rightmove.co.uk 30

Introduction 
The following sections explain how the Company applies  
the main provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code  
(the Code) issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC),  
as required by the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) and meets the relevant information provisions 
of the Disclosure and T ransparency Rules of the FCA.
The statement of corporate governance covers:
• the structure and role of the Board and its committees;
•  relations with the Company’s shareholders and the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM); and
•  the reports of the Audit Committee and Nomination 
Committee including Board effectiveness and evaluation.
The report of the Remuneration Committee is set out 
separately in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on  
pages 50 to 51.
The Group’s risk management and internal control 
framework and the principal risks and uncertainties are 
described on pages 21 to 23. The Directors’ Report on  
pages 46 to 48 also contains information required to be 
included in this statement of corporate governance.
Statement of compliance
The Code sets out the principles and provisions relating to 
good governance of UK listed companies and can be found 
on the FRC’s website at frc.org.uk.
We are pleased to confirm that, for the year under review,  
the Company has complied fully with the principles and 
provisions of the Code.
The Board’s role
The Board is collectively responsible to shareholders for the 
overall direction and control of the Group and has the powers 
and duties set out in the Companies Act and the Company’s 
Articles of Association. The Board delegates certain matters to 
the Board committees and delegates the day to day operational 
aspects of the business to the executive directors. 
The schedule of matters requiring Board approval includes:
• Rightmove’s business strategy;
• the annual business plan;
• changes to the Group’s capital structure; 
• the capital management and dividend policies;
•  the annual and half year results and shareholder 
communications;
• major acquisitions and disposals;
• appointment and removal of officers of the Company; and
• the system of internal control and risk management.

consideration of the Group’s strategy. Additional meetings 
can be arranged at short notice at the request of any 
director , if required. In addition to scheduled Board meetings, 
there is regular informal dialogue between the directors.
Directors receive Board papers well in advance of meetings 
to allow sufficient time for review and consideration. If any 
director raises a concern or challenges any aspect of the 
business conducted at a Board meeting, the Company 
Secretary will ensure their comments are appropriately 
recorded in the Board minutes. In addition to formal Board 
papers, directors receive monthly management and financial 
reports on the operational and financial performance of the 
business, setting out actual and forecast financial 
performance against approved budgets and other key 
performance indicators. The Board also receives copies of 
broker reports and market reviews relating to Rightmove. 
Board committees
The Board has established three principal committees,  
the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and 
the Nomination Committee, to assist it in the execution  
of its duties. The Chairman of each Committee reports on 
the respective Committee’s activities at the subsequent 
Board meeting.
The Committees’ terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s corporate website, plc.rightmove.co.uk or by 
request from the Company Secretary.
Each of the Committees is authorised, at the Company’s 
expense, to obtain legal or other professional advice to 
assist in carrying out its duties. No person other than a 
Committee member is entitled to attend the meetings  
of these Committees, except by invitation of the  
Chairman of that Committee. 
Current membership of the Committees is shown on

Rightmove plc annual report 2017 35
Division of responsibilities
The posts of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate and there are clear written guidelines to support their 
division of responsibilities. The key responsibilities of the Board members are summarised below:
Chairman Responsible for the leadership and governance of the Board, including:
•  ensuring its effectiveness by creating and managing constructive relationships between the 
executive and non-executive directors;
•  ensuring there is ongoing and effective communication between the Board and its key 
stakeholders; and
•  with the assistance of the Company Secretary , setting the Board’s agenda and ensuring that 
adequate time is available for discussion and effective decision making, and that directors receive 
sufficient, relevant, timely and clear information. 
Chief Executive Officer Responsible for the day to day management of the Group, including:
• the operational and financial performance of the Group;
•  developing the Group’s objectives and strategy and following Board approval, the successful 
execution of strategy;
• effective and ongoing communication with stakeholders; and
• chairing the Executive Committee. 
Non-executive directors The role of the non-executive directors is to:
• constructively challenge the executive directors; and
• monitor the delivery of the strategy within the risk and control framework set by the Board.
The non-executive directors bring wide and varied commercial experience and independent 
judgement to the Board and the Committees’ deliberations. 
The breadth of management, financial and listed company experience of the non-executive directors 
is described in the biographical details on pages 30 to 31 and demonstrates a range of business 
expertise that provides the right mix of skills and experience given the size of the Group.
Senior Independent Director The role of the Senior Independent Director is to:
• act in an advisory capacity to the Chairman;
• deputise for the Chairman if required;
• serve as an intermediary for other directors when necessary;
•  be available to shareholders if they have concerns which they have not been able to resolve 
through the normal channels of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or other executive 
directors for which such contact is inappropriate; and
•  conduct an annual review of the performance of the Chairman and, in the event it should be 
necessary , convene a meeting of the non-executive directors. 
Company Secretary The Company Secretary:
• monitors compliance with appropriate Board procedures; 
• advises the Board on corporate governance matters;
•  assists the Chairman in ensuring that all the directors have full and timely access to relevant 
information; and
• assists the Chairman by organising directors’ induction and training programmes.
The Company Secretary also acts as Secretary to the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees.
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for Board approval.
Board diversity and experience
We are committed to a Board comprised of directors from 
different backgrounds with diverse and relevant experience, 
perspectives, skills and knowledge. We believe that diversity, 
including gender diversity , amongst directors contributes 
towards a high performing and effective Board and business, 
so we strive to maintain the optimal balance. We endorse 
both a meritocratic Board appointment process and 
balanced gender representation on the Board. 
At 31 December 2017, 38% of Board members were female 
and following the appointment of Lorna Tilbian, that 
proportion has risen to 44% of Board members.  Following 
the retirement of Ashley Martin in May the proportion of 
female Board members will rise to 50%. We remain 
committed to recruiting the best people and appropriate 
talent for the business whilst seeking to maintain as near 
50:50 gender balance on the Board as possible. rightmove.co.uk 36

(1)  Rakhi Goss-Custard was a member of the Audit Committee until 9 May 2017 
and attended two further meetings as a guest.
(2)  Rakhi Goss-Custard and Jacqueline de Rojas joined the Nomination Committee 
on 9 May 2017 and attended all meetings after that date. Rakhi attended one 
meeting before that date as a guest.
(3)  Jacqueline de Rojas joined the Remuneration Committee on 9 May 2017 and 
attended all meetings after that date.
(4)  Andrew Findlay joined the Board, Audit and Nomination Committees on

The range of skills and experience the Board considers 
necessary to deliver Rightmove’s business strategy , and 
which were identified in the Board Strategy Review, includes: 
• Finance and governance
• Voice of the customer and property market
• T echnology and innovation
• Voice of the consumer and retail
• Digital marketing and online media, and
• Corporate transactions.
Board independence 
The Code provides that the Board should identify in the 
Annual Report each non-executive director that it considers 
to be independent. That is, to determine whether the 
director is independent in character and judgement and 
whether there are relationships or circumstances  
which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect,  
the director’s judgement.
The Board reviews non-executive director independence  
on an annual basis taking into account such factors as their 
contribution to unbiased and independent debate during 
meetings. The Board considers that there is an appropriate 
balance between the executive and non-executive directors 
and that all non-executive directors are fully independent of 
management and independent in character and judgement. 
Ashley Martin will have completed nine years’ service as a 
non-executive director in June 2018 and will retire from the 
Board following the 2018 AGM. The Nomination Committee 
carefully considered the independence of Lorna Tilbian 
before her appointment to the Board and details of that 
process is set out in the Nomination Committee report  
on page 45.
T o safeguard their independence, a director is not entitled to 
vote on any matter in which they may be conflicted or have a 
personal interest. Where necessary, directors are required to 
absent themselves from a meeting of the Board while such 
matters are being discussed. In cases of doubt, the 
Chairman of the Board is responsible for determining 
whether a conflict of interest exists. 
The Chairman is also the Chairman of two other publically 
listed companies. The executive directors do not hold any 
other non-executive directorships or commitments 
requiring disclosure under the Code.
Governance | Corporate governance report continued Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Rightmove plc annual report 2017 37
In addition to the above meetings, the Chairman conducts 
meetings with the non-executive directors without the 
executive directors being present when required.  
Peter Williams, the Senior Independent Director , chaired a 
meeting in December 2017 of the non-executive directors 
at which the performance of the Chairman was also 
reviewed, without the presence of the Chairman.
Indemnification of directors
The Articles of Association of the Company allow for a 
qualifying third party indemnity provision between the 
Company and its directors and officers, which remains in 
force at the date of this report. The Group has also arranged 
directors’ and officers’ insurance cover in respect of legal 
action against the directors. Neither our indemnity nor the 
insurance provides cover in the event that a director is 
proven to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently.
The Group has a Dealing Code setting out the process  
and timing for dealing in shares, which is compliant with  
the Market Abuse Regulation. The Dealing Code applies  
to all directors, who are persons discharging managerial 
responsibility , and other insiders.
Shareholder relations
The Board is accountable to shareholders for the 
performance and activities of the Group and welcomes 
opportunities to engage with shareholders.
Within the terms of the regulatory framework, the directors 
have conducted regular and open dialogue with 
shareholders through ongoing meetings with institutional 
investors and research firms to discuss strategy and 
operational and financial performance. Contact in the UK is 
principally with the Chief Executive Officer and the Finance 
Director. The Chairman attends selected investor meetings 
in the UK and the USA. The Senior Independent Director is 
also available to shareholders if they wish to supplement 
their communication, or if contact through the normal 
channels is inappropriate.
The Remuneration Committee proactively engaged with  
the Company’s top shareholders ahead of setting the 
Remuneration Policy, which was approved at the 2017 AGM 
and again in late 2017 when setting executive director base 
salary levels for 2018.
The Board is kept informed of the views and opinions of 
those with an interest in the Company’s shares through 
reports from the Chief Executive Officer and the Finance 
Director , as well as reports from the Company’s brokers,  
UBS and Numis.
Shareholders are also kept up to date with the Group’s 
activities through the half year results statement and  
Annual Report and the investor relations section of its 
website, at plc.rightmove.co.uk, which provides details of  
all the directors, the financial calendar , latest news including 
financial results, investor presentations and Stock Exchange 
announcements. 
Annual General Meeting
The AGM provides an opportunity for shareholders to  
vote on aspects of the Company’s business, meet the 
directors and ask them questions. The AGM will be held  
on 4 May 2018 at the offices of UBS Limited at 5 Broadgate, 
London EC2M 2QS.
The Company will arrange for the Annual Report and related 
papers to be available on the Company’s corporate website 
at plc.rightmove.co.uk or posted to shareholders (where 
requested) at least 20 working days before the AGM. 
The Company continues to comply with the Code, with  
the separation of all resolutions put to shareholders.  
The Company proactively encourages shareholders to  
vote at general meetings by providing electronic voting for 
shareholders who wish to vote online and personalised proxy 
cards to shareholders electing to receive them ensuring that 
all votes are clearly identifiable. The Company presently 
takes votes at general meetings on a show of hands on the 
grounds of practicality , owing to the limited number of 
shareholders in attendance. All proxy votes are counted and 
the level of proxy votes, including votes witheld for each 
resolution are reported after each resolution and published 
on the Company’s website. rightmove.co.uk 38
Audit Committee report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the 2017 report of the Audit 
Committee (the Committee). 
This report provides an overview of the principal activities  
of the Committee and details how it has discharged its 
responsibilities during the year.
The Committee is an essential part of Rightmove’s 
governance framework to which the Board has delegated 
oversight of the accounting, financial reporting and internal 
control processes, the outsourced internal audit function 
and the relationship with the external auditors. The key 
responsibilities are set out on page 34 of the Corporate 
Governance Report.
The Committee has overseen a detailed programme of work 
in 2017 in relation to its remit, including agreeing the scope 
of work delivered by the PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(PwC) outsourced internal audit function, known as 
Rightmove Assurance. The role of Rightmove Assurance has 
become well established throughout the organisation and 
continues to provide insight and value in both core financial 
control areas and the broader business operations. 
The Committee has given particular focus this year to the 
readiness of the Group to meet the requirements of the 
forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 
which becomes effective in May 2018. The business  
has established a comprehensive GDPR programme, 
coordinated by a full-time project manager , and is on  
track to be substantially compliant by May 2018. There has 
also been continued focus on the progress of the Disaster 
Recovery and Business Continuity Plans, including a planned 
closure of the Milton Keynes office which took place during 
December 2017. The oversight of financial controls 
continues to be a key area of work of the Committee.  
As a result of the breadth of the reviews this year , the 
Committee has had the benefit of exposure to the broader 
organisation, which has brought added insight to the topics 
under discussion.
Looking forward to the next 12 months, the Committee will 
continue to focus on the audit, assurance and risk processes 
within the Group, including a review of the control 
effectiveness of key billing processes, a counter fraud 
workshop and an update on the progress towards GDPR 
compliance.
I have greatly enjoyed my time as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee over the last nine years, and thank my fellow 
Committee members for their wisdom and support over  
this period. Andrew Findlay will succeed me as Chairman  
of the Audit Committee at the end of the 2018 Annual 
General Meeting.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions about 
the work of the Committee.
Written terms of reference that outline the Committee’s 
authority and responsibilities are published on the investor 
relations section of the Group’s website at plc.rightmove.
co.uk and are available in hard copy form from the  
Company Secretary.

(1)  Andrew Findlay was appointed to the Committee on 1 June 2017.
(2)  Rakhi Goss-Custard retired from the Committee on 9 May 2017 and attended 
two further meetings as a guest.
The Committee met five times in 2017 and attendance of 
the members is shown above. In order to maintain effective 
communication between all relevant parties, the Committee 
invited the Finance Director and Head of Finance, together 
with appropriate members of the management team, and 
the external and internal auditors, to meetings as necessary. 
The Committee sets aside time periodically to seek the 
views of the external auditor , in the absence of management. 
The external auditor has direct access to the Chairman to 
raise any concerns outside formal Committee meetings. 
The Committee also meets separately with the internal 
auditor during the year , and in between meetings the 
Chairman keeps in touch with the Finance Director and 
external audit partner as well as other members of the 
management team. 
After each meeting, the Chairman reports to the Board on 
the main issues discussed by the Committee and minutes  
of the Committee meetings are circulated to the Board  
once approved. 
Audit Committee effectiveness
The effectiveness of the operation of the Committee was 
reviewed in December 2017 through a questionnaire 
completed by all members of the Committee, which focused 
on areas such as the appropriateness of the focus of the 
Committee, how it operates and professional development 
of the members. This was supplemented with responses 
from the effectiveness review of the Board and its 
committees where each Board member responded to key 
questions on Board performance and commented generally 
on the performance of Board Committees. The feedback  
on the Committee was positive and confirmed that the 
Committee is effective and provides appropriate challenge. 
Financial reporting
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the 
appropriateness of the Group’s half-year reporting and 
annual financial statements. The Committee does this by 
considering, among other things, the accounting policies 
and practices adopted by the Group; the correct application 
of applicable reporting standards and compliance with 
broader governance requirements; the approach taken by 
management to the key judgemental areas of reporting and 
the comments of the external auditor on management’s 
chosen approach.
Significant issues
The key significant issue in the context of the 2017 
Consolidated Financial Statements is revenue recognition. 
The Committee considers this area to be significant taking 
into account the level of materiality and degree of focus 
given by management, and discussed the issue in detail to 
ensure that the approach taken was appropriate. In relation 
to the Company Financial Statements, the key significant 
issue is the recoverability of the investment by the Company 
in Rightmove Group Limited, due to its materiality in the 
context of the total assets of the Company. rightmove.co.uk 40
The Committee also reviewed and considered the following 
areas due to their materiality and the application of 
judgement. However , it considered them to be stable in 
nature and therefore did not classify them as significant 
issues in the context of the 2017 financial statements.
Governance | Corporate governance report continued
Issue Committee review
Revenue
As more fully described on page 17 
and 93 the majority of the Group’s 
revenue is derived from subscriptions 
for core listing fees and advertising 
products on Rightmove’s platforms. 
The Group recognises this revenue 
over the period of the contract or the  
point at which advertising products 
are used.
During the year , management performed data analytics procedures on the amounts billed  
to the two largest customer groups (Agency and New Homes, together 92% of revenue).  
This included investigating anomalies and outliers identified and reporting to the Committee  
in this regard. 
Revenue is a prime area of audit focus and KPMG evolved their approach in this area this year 
as a result of management performing  the revenue data analytics procedures that had 
previously been part of the audit approach. KPMG designed and performed new  data 
analytics procedures which covered all revenue streams matching customer billings to cash, 
and results of this work were reported to the Committee.
The Committee discussed any anomalies with management and with KPMG in relation to  
the data analytics work they performed. The Committee was satisfied with the explanations 
provided and conclusions reached.
The approach to data analytics performed by KPMG expands their audit coverage to 100%  
of revenue, which together with the data analytics performed by management has led to 
increased overall assurance in this area.
The data analytics work above is supplemented by a detailed analytical review by 
management of margins, and ARPA together with a comprehensive analysis on the 
treatment of discounted and free member offers.
Investment by Rightmove plc in 
Rightmove Group Limited (RMGL)
The investment by the Company  
in RMGL is carried at cost, adjusted for 
subsequent additions to the 
investment. Cost was initially assessed 
as at 28 January 2008 being the date 
that Rightmove plc became the parent 
company of RMGL. Share-based 
payment awards to RMGL employees 
are accounted for as a deemed capital 
contribution by Rightmove plc to 
RMGL of the value of the share-based 
payment charge for those awards, 
increasing the value of the investment. 
Further details are provided in  
note 15 to the financial statements. 
The investment is not considered at 
risk of material misstatement or 
subject to significant judgement, 
however it is considered a significant 
risk due to its size in relation to the 
Company balance sheet.
The Committee reviewed the assumptions made by management, including the strong  
track record of profitable growth and cash generation by RMGL. Furthermore, the  
Rightmove plc share price has increased significantly since 2008, resulting in a current  
market value of c.£4 billion, significantly in excess of the investment carrying value of 
£0.5 billion. As RMGL is the main trading entity of Rightmove plc, we therefore see no 
evidence of impairment. The Committee was satisfied with the assumptions made.
Issue Committee review
Share-based payment charges and 
related deferred tax asset
The Committee reviewed the judgements, assumptions and estimates made by management 
as part of the review of the financial statements to ensure that they were appropriate.  
The Committee also obtained the external auditors’ assessment of the calculations.  
The results of this review were that the Committee was satisfied with the calculations made.
Going concern and viability 
statements
In assessing the validity of the statements detailed on pages 24 and 89, the Committee 
reviewed the work undertaken by management to assess the Group’s resilience to the 
Principal Risks under various scenarios. The Committee gained appropriate assurance that 
sufficient rigour was built into the process to assess going concern and viability over the 
designated periods. Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Rightmove plc annual report 2017 41
Following its review, the Committee is of the opinion that the 
2017 Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair , balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy.
External audit
The Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the 
relationship with, and performance of, the external auditor. 
The Committee approves the terms of engagement and fees 
of the external auditor , ensuring they have appropriate audit 
plans in place and that an appropriate relationship is 
maintained between the Group and the external auditor.
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board in relation to the appointment of the external 
auditor. KPMG LLP was re-appointed as the Group’s auditor  
in 2013 following an audit tender , and in accordance with the 
EU Audit Directive implemented in 2016, the Group will be 
required to put the external audit contract out to tender by 
2023. The external auditor is required to rotate the audit 
partner responsible for the Group audit every five years in 
order to ensure independence. The lead audit partner ,  
Karen Wightman, has been in place for five years, and 
therefore in accordance with the FRC’s Ethical Standard 3 
(Revised), Anna Jones will take over from Karen Wightman  
for the financial year ending 31 December 2018.
The Committee approved the fees of KPMG for the year as 
set out in Note 6 of the financial statements.
Independence and non-audit services
The Committee has policies and procedures in place in 
relation to the provision of non-audit services by the external 
auditor and the non-audit fee policy was reviewed by the 
Committee during the year. The non-audit fee policy ensures 
that the Group benefits in a cost-effective manner from the 
cumulative knowledge and experience of its auditor , whilst 
also ensuring that the auditor maintains the necessary degree 
of independence and objectivity.
When forming its opinion, the Committee reflected on the information it had received and its discussions throughout the year. 
In particular , the Committee considered:
Is the report fair? •  Is the whole story presented and has any sensitive material been omitted that should  
have been included?
•  Are key messages in the narrative aligned with the KPIs and are they reflected in the 
financial reporting?
•  Are the KPIs being reported consistently from year to year?
•  Is the reporting on the business areas in the narrative reporting consistent with the 
financial reporting in the financial statements?
Is the report balanced? •  Do you get the same messages when reading the front end and back end of the  
Annual Report independently?
•  Are threats identified and appropriately highlighted?
•  Are the alternative performance measures explained clearly with appropriate prominence?
•  Are the key judgements referred to in the narrative reporting and significant issues 
reported in this Committee Report consistent with disclosures of key estimation 
uncertainties and critical judgements set out in the financial statements?
•  How do these judgements compare with the risks that KPMG are planning to include  
in their Auditors’ Report?
Is the report understandable? •  Is there a clear and cohesive framework for the Annual Report?
•  Are the important messages highlighted appropriately throughout the Annual Report?
•  Is the Annual Report written in easy to understand language and are the key messages 
clearly drawn out?
•  Is the Annual Report free of unnecessary clutter?
Fair balanced and understandable
One of the key governance requirements is for the Annual 
Report and the financial statements, taken as a whole, to be 
fair , balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy.  
The Committee was provided with an early draft of the 
Annual Report in order to assess the strategic direction  
and key messages being communicated. Feedback was 
provided by the Committee in advance of the February 
Board meeting, highlighting any areas where the 
Committee believed further clarity was required. The draft 
report was then amended to incorporate this feedback 
prior to being tabled at the Board meeting for final 
comment and approval. rightmove.co.uk 42
The level of non-audit fees as a proportion of the audit  
fee has typically been low at Rightmove. During the year , 
KPMG charged the Group £30,000 for non-audit services, 
representing less than 21% of the 2017 audit fee. Of this, 
£18,000 relates to the half-year review, and £10,000 for a 
review of the Group’s gender pay gap calculations and 
methodology. Further details of these services can be  
found in Note 6 to the financial statements. 
Effectiveness and reappointment
The Committee considered the quality and effectiveness of 
the external audit process, in light of the FRC’s Practice Aid 
for Audit Committees (May 2015). The effectiveness of the 
external audit process is dependent on a number of factors. 
These include the quality , continuity , experience and training 
of audit personnel, business understanding, technical 
knowledge and the degree of rigour applied in the review 
processes of the work undertaken, communication of key 
accounting and audit judgements, together with appropriate 
audit risk identification at the start of the audit cycle. 
The Committee reviewed the report of the FRC’s Audit 
Quality Review team relating to KPMG as a firm and 
discussed the actions taken by KPMG in light of the 
recommendations, including in relation to the firm’s 
approach to the audit of revenue.
The Committee evaluated the effectiveness of the audit 
process together with input from management. Areas the 
Committee considered in this review included the quality  
of audit planning and execution, engagement with the 
Committee and management, quality of reporting, and 
capability and experience of the audit team. For the 2017 
financial year , the Committee was satisfied that there had 
been appropriate focus and challenge on the primary areas 
of audit risk and concluded that the performance of KPMG 
remained efficient and effective.
Internal audit
The Group has an Internal Audit function, known as 
Rightmove Assurance, which is fully outsourced to PwC.  
The aim of Rightmove Assurance is to provide independent 
and objective assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness 
of internal control, risk management and governance 
processes. This includes assurance that underlying financial 
controls and processes are working effectively, as well as 
specialist operational and compliance reviews that focus on 
emerging risks in new and evolving areas of the business. 
The Rightmove Assurance plan for 2017 was approved by 
the Audit Committee and covered a broad range of core 
financial and operational processes and controls, focusing 
on specific risk areas. Specialist reviews were undertaken in 
the following areas:
•  Data privacy, including a readiness assessment in relation 
to GDPR;
•  Cyber maturity assessment, covering technical, process 
and people controls. The review also included particular 
focus on data loss management, Bring Your Own Device 
(BYOD) and end point management, corporate network 
management and identity and access management;
•  Employment taxes;
•  Procure to pay cycle and cash management;
•  Pre-implementation review of a new HR system; and a
•  Payroll controls review.
Reports setting out the principal findings of the Rightmove 
Assurance reviews and agreed management actions were 
discussed by the Committee. The Committee also reviewed 
open actions from previous reviews, together with 
monitoring the progress by management in completing 
these actions.
Governance | Corporate governance report continued
Non-audit service Policy
Assurance-related services directly related to the audit for 
example, review of the half-year financial statements.
The half year review is approved by the Committee as part of the 
annual Audit Plan. Management is given the authority to incur 
additional non-audit services of up to £15,000 in any financial 
year without prior approval of the Committee.
Thereafter all additional fees are to be referred to the Audit 
Committee in advance, subject to a cap on permitted non-audit 
fees of 70% of the average audit fees over the three preceding 
financial years.
Permitted non-audit services
Including but not limited to: accounting advice, work related to 
mergers, acquisitions, disposals, joint ventures or circulars; and 
corporate governance advice.
Prohibited services
In line with the EU Audit Reform, these are services where the 
auditor’s objectivity and independence may be compromised. 
Prohibited services are detailed in the FRC Revised Ethical 
Standard 2016 and include tax services, accounting services, 
internal audit services and valuation services. 
Prohibited, in accordance with the EU Audit Reform. Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Rightmove plc annual report 2017 43
Effectiveness of the internal audit process 
The work of Rightmove Assurance provides a key additional 
source of assurance and support to management and the 
Audit Committee on the effectiveness of internal controls as 
well as providing guidance and recommendations to further 
enhance the internal control environment, and provide 
specialist insight into areas of change in the business. 
During the year , the Audit Committee undertook a review  
of the effectiveness of the Rightmove Assurance function. 
The evaluation was led by the Committee Chairman and 
involved issuing tailored evaluation questionnaires which 
were completed by Rightmove management, the external 
auditors, KPMG, the Committee and PwC themselves.  
The evaluation concluded that the Rightmove Assurance 
function had an appreciation of the key issues facing the 
business, was realistic and robust with audit suggestions  
and added value to the business. It included a number of 
recommendations which were incorporated into the 2017 
Rightmove Assurance plan.
Whistleblowing
The Group has a whistleblowing process which enables 
employees of the Group to raise concerns on an entirely 
confidential basis. The Committee receives reports on the 
communication within the business of the whistleblowing 
policy and external confidential reporting arrangements,  
and the use of the service including any whistleblowing 
incidents and their outcomes.
Internal controls 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal controls and has established a framework of 
financial and other controls, which is periodically reviewed  
in accordance with the FRC Internal Control: Guidance to 
Directors publication for its effectiveness.
The Board has taken, and will continue to take, appropriate 
measures to ensure that the chances of financial 
irregularities occurring are reduced as far as reasonably 
possible by improving the quality of information at all levels in 
the Group, fostering an open environment and ensuring that 
the financial analysis is rigorously applied. Any system of 
internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Group’s management have established the procedures 
necessary to ensure that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, assessing and managing the significant risks to 
the Group. These procedures have been in place for the 
whole of the financial year ended 31 December 2017 and  
up to the date of the approval of these financial statements, 
and they are reviewed regularly.
Rightmove has an internal audit function, known as Rightmove 
Assurance, which is fully outsourced to PwC. Rightmove 
Assurance provides the Group with additional independent 
assurance on the effectiveness of internal controls.
The key elements of the system of internal control are:
•  Major commercial, strategic, competitive and financial risks 
are formally identified, quantified and assessed, discussed 
with the Executive Committee, after which they are 
considered by the Board; 
•  A comprehensive system of planning, budgeting and 
monitoring Group results. This includes monthly 
management reporting and monitoring of performance 
against both budgets and forecasts with explanations for  
all significant variances;
•  Clearly defined policies for capital expenditure and 
investment exist, including appropriate authorisation  
evels, with larger capital projects, acquisitions and  
disposals requiring Board approval;
•  A treasury function which manages cash flow forecasts  
and cash on deposit (including counterparty risk);
•  An organisational structure with clearly defined lines of 
responsibility and delegation of authority , and an 
embedded culture of openness where business decisions 
and their associated risks and benefits are discussed and 
challenged; 
•  A comprehensive disaster recovery plan and business 
continuity plan based upon:
-  co-hosting of the Rightmove platforms across three 
separate locations, which is regularly tested and reviewed;
-  the ability of the business to maintain business critical 
activities in the event of an incident;  
-  the capability for employees to work remotely from home 
or a third party location in the event of a loss of one of our 
premises. This was tested for the Milton Keynes office 
during the year through a planned full office closure.
•  Regular testing of the security of the IT systems and 
platforms, regular backups of key data and ongoing threat 
monitoring to protect against the risk of cyber-attack; and
•  Whistleblowing and bribery policies of which all employees 
are made aware, to enable concerns to be raised either with 
line management or , if appropriate, confidentially outside 
the line management. 
Through the procedures outlined above, the Board, with 
advice from the Audit Committee, has considered all 
significant aspects of internal control for the year and up  
to the date of this Annual Report. No significant failings or 
weaknesses were identified during this review. However ,  
had there been any such failings or weaknesses, the Board 
confirms that necessary actions would have been taken to 
remedy them. rightmove.co.uk 44
Composition and attendance at meetings
The Chairman and all the non-executive directors are 
members of the Committee. Peter Brooks-Johnson and 
Robyn Perriss attended meetings by invitation.
The Committee met three times during the year and 
attendance at the meetings is shown on page 36.
Membership 
The Committee is comprised entirely of non-executive 
directors, whose biographical details can be found on pages 
30 to 31. As at 31 December 2017, all the non-executive 
directors (five out of six members of the Committee) were 
considered by the Board to be independent. The quorum for 
meetings of the Committee is two members. At the request 
of the Committee Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer is 
normally invited to attend the meeting to discuss the annual 
organisation and succession plan.
The Chairman of the Company may not chair the Committee 
in connection with any discussion about the appointment of 
his successor. In these circumstances, the Senior 
Independent Director will take the chair. 
Appointments are for a period of up to three years, extendable 
by no more than two additional three-year periods, so long as 
Committee members continue to be independent.
Principal activities of the Committee during 2017
During the year the Committee has:
• reviewed the composition and diversity of the Board;
• reviewed the Board committees’ composition;
•  approved the plans for the organisation and succession of  
the executive directors and senior management; 
•  recommended the implementation of the Board succession 
plan and the appointment of Peter Brooks-Johnson as Chief 
Executive Officer following the retirement of Nick McKittrick; 
•  recommended the appointment of two non-executive 
directors including consideration of independence in relation 
to the Code;
Nomination Committee report
Dear shareholder 
I am pleased to present the report of the Nomination 
Committee (the Committee) for 2017.
The Committee’s role is to keep the structure, size and 
composition of the Board under review with the objective of 
matching the skills, knowledge and experience of directors to 
business requirements. Our priority is to optimise the Board’s 
performance to enable the Group to prosper , compete 
effectively and manage risk in an evolving market.
A copy of the terms of reference of the Committee can be found 
on the Company’s website at: plc.rightmove.co.uk. These were 
reviewed and updated with minor changes during the year.
The Committee fulfilled its terms of reference during 2017 by:
• reviewing the Group organisation and succession plans;
•  recommending the appointment of new non-executive 
directors; and 
•  conducting internal Board and Committee evaluations. Further 
details of the Board evaluation can be found on page 45.
The Committee continued to review Board succession and 
Andrew Findlay was appointed as a non-executive director on 
1 June 2017, following an external search by Korn Ferry 
International (Korn Ferry). Andrew will succeed Ashley Martin  
as our Audit Committee Chairman following the 2018 AGM. 
Lorna Tilbian joined the Board on 1 February 2018, following  
her retirement from Numis Corporation PLC.  
The Board currently consists of nine directors including seven 
non-executive directors, six of which are considered to be 
independent. Following the retirement of Ashley Martin (non-
executive director) at the 2018 AGM, the Board will comprise 
eight directors (two executive and six non-executive directors) 
and equal representation of men and women directors at both 
executive and non-executive levels.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions about the 
work of the Committee.

independence, as it does for every director , but the Board also 
sought independent legal advice to ensure compliance with 
Code requirements. The Committee concluded that no 
material relationship existed with Numis over the past three 
years, no material ongoing relationship exists and that Lorna is 
independent in character and judgment. In addition to Lorna’s 
media sector experience, her capital markets experience will 
be a great asset to Rightmove and the Board.
The Board considered the primary tests under the Code: 
whether there is a material financial relationship between 
Numis and Rightmove and whether that relationship would 
influence Lorna’s judgement. Numis Securities receives a 
standard commission from Rightmove for the share buyback 
programme and there is no retainer or special fees agreement 
in relation to brokerage or research; the commission 
payments of c£100,000 per annum are immaterial to 
Rightmove. Lorna retired from the Numis Board in  
September 2017. The Board carefully considered Lorna’s  
prior dealings with the Rightmove management team,  
which were meetings in the ordinary course of business with 
our former Chief Executive Officer. The Board therefore 
determined that Lorna is independent in character and 
judgement and there are no other factors that are likely to 
impair her judgement or prevent her from fulfilling her duties 
and responsibilities as a non-executive director effectively.
Board effectiveness and evaluation 
The Board is committed to undertaking annual reviews of its 
own performance and also the performance of its Committees 
and individual directors. 
The Board again completed an internal self-assessment  
during 2017. Directors were invited to provide feedback via  
the Company Secretary on Board and Committee performance 
and answer key questions relating to the Board’s strengths, 
improvements during the year and which business risks and 
development opportunities should receive more focus.  
The whole Board discussed the feedback at the Committee 
meeting in December 2017 and concluded that the Board and 
its Committees continue to operate effectively , with an open 
and effective Board dynamic resulting in effective challenge  
and collaboration between non-executive and executive 
directors. The Board also agreed initiatives to further improve 
Board effectiveness including a greater variety of business 
presentations from senior management covering a wide  
range of Company business operations.
An externally facilitated review of the performance of the  
Board and its Committees will be conducted in 2018.
•  agreed the process for and considered actions based upon 
the findings of the Board evaluation;
•  considered potential conflicts of interest for non-executive 
directors appointed to other boards; 
•  reviewed and considered actions to address the Group’s 
gender pay gap; and
• conducted an annual review of its terms of reference.  
Board induction and training
All new non-executive directors joining the Board undertake a 
tailored induction including meetings with key members of the 
management team. Directors are also encouraged to spend a 
day on the road with a sales director meeting our customers. 
New directors receive a comprehensive induction pack of 
corporate information and a briefing from the Company 
Secretary covering corporate governance, Group policies  
and relevant regulations.
Individual Board members have access to training and can  
seek advice from independent professional advisers, at the 
Group’s expense, where specific expertise or training is 
required in furtherance of their duties. 
Board succession and independence
At the end of 2016, the Committee confirmed the candidate 
profile identified through the Board Strategy review process 
and initiated the search for a non-executive director with 
suitable skills and experience to replace Ashley Martin,  
when he retires from the Board and as Audit Committee 
Chairman in May 2018. Following an external search, 
facilitated by Korn Ferry , the Committee recommended  
the appointment of Andrew Findlay as an experienced  
Finance Director with suitable financial skills and experience  
to Chair the Audit Committee.  
With due consideration to the conclusions of the Board 
Strategy Review (externally facilitated by Korn Ferry in 2015),  
the current Board composition and the Group’s strategic plan, 
the Committee agreed that a director with a broader media 
industry background would benefit the business. Following  
a process including Korn Ferry , the Board recruited and  
then agreed to appoint Lorna Tilbian as an independent  
non-executive director , following her retirement from  
Numis Corporation PLC (Numis) in December 2017.  
As Numis is Rightmove’s joint corporate broker together with 
UBS, the Board is aware that there may be a perception that  
a material relationship could exist or continue to exist that 
might impair Lorna’s independence. Therefore, Rightmove 
not only conducted a rigorous review to evaluate Lorna’s  rightmove.co.uk 46

Governance | Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the parent Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error , and have general responsibility for taking such 
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement that complies with that law and 
those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and 
parent Company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU) and applicable law and have elected to 
prepare the parent company financial statements on the  
same basis. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent 
Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the Group and parent Company financial statements, 
the directors are required to: 
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
•  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, 
relevant and reliable; 
•  state whether they have been prepared in accordance  
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
•  assess the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern; and
•  use the going concern basis of accounting unless  
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent 
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.  rightmove.co.uk 50
these performance targets is set out on page 70 and 
reflected in the lower bonus payout for 2017, relative to 
2016. Overall, performance for the year outperformed  
the baseline business plan and the Committee was  
therefore satisfied that it was appropriate to pay 60%  
of the maximum bonus. 
The Group’s longer-term performance reflects strong 
organic growth over the last three financial years. The 2015 
Performance Share Plan awards (measuring performance 
from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017) will vest in  
full in March 2018 as a result of delivering underlying basic 
EPS
(3)
 growth of 63% and TSR growth of 109% over the 
performance period, which exceeded the respective growth 
targets set of 60% and FTSE 250 Index +25% over the 
three-year period. The Committee tested the performance 
conditions, which were set at the beginning of the 
performance period, and determined that the Group had 
outperformed the maximum targets and was therefore 
satisfied that the awards should vest in full.
Chief Executive Officer retirement
Following the AGM on 9 May 2017, Nick McKittrick retired  
as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and as a director of 
Rightmove. He was succeeded by Peter Brooks-Johnson, 
former Chief Operating Officer and a Board director since 
2011, who has had a successful year in his new role as  
CEO and delivered a strong set of financial results in 2017.  
A summary of the remuneration arrangements relating to 
Nick’s retirement and Peter’s promotion were announced in 
May 2017 and are detailed on pages 71 and 72 of the Annual 
Report on Remuneration. 
Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present our Directors’ Remuneration  
Report for Rightmove (the Company) together with its 
subsidiary companies (the Group) for the year ended 
31 December 2017. 
The report is divided into two sections, the Remuneration 
Policy Report and the Annual Report on Remuneration, both 
of which are summarised in ‘Remuneration at a glance’ on 
page 52. We do not propose any changes to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, which received overwhelming support 
from our shareholders at our 2017 AGM. 
Performance and reward
The Committee considers that it is vital for the executive 
directors’ remuneration to fairly reflect the overall 
performance of the Group. As described in the Strategic 
Report, Rightmove’s 2017 results again show healthy growth 
in revenue and underlying operating profit
(1)
, demonstrating 
the strength of the Rightmove business model and the 
effectiveness of our management team. 
In accordance with the Remuneration Policy, the Committee 
has reviewed achievement against the bonus plan objectives 
for 2017 and recommended an annual bonus payment of 
60%. This reflects the growth in revenue and underlying 
operating profit
(1)
 of 11% and continued employee 
engagement with 90% of Rightmovers
(2)
 thinking that 
Rightmove is a great place to work. Our audience growth, 
measured on a time basis in absolute terms, did not outstrip 
the total of Rightmove’s closest competitors and other 
revenue from non-core businesses was not sufficiently 
strong to merit a bonus payout. Achievement against

Remuneration Policy
In 2017, following consultation with Rightmove’s major 
investors, the Committee proposed the Remuneration 
Policy, set out in the Remuneration Policy Report on pages 
53 to 62. The Policy was approved with overwhelming 
support from our shareholders.
The Policy addresses the significant shortfall in executive 
directors’ base salaries compared with the Committee’s 
assessment of an appropriate salary for each role and the 
performance of the current directors. Increases of 3% in 
excess of the average workforce rise have been awarded  
to the CEO and Finance Director from January 2018, 
recognising the size and complexity of each role and the 
present incumbents’ experience and capabilities.
The Committee’s objective is to retain a remuneration 
framework that rewards and incentivises our management 
team to deliver Rightmove’s longer-term strategy with a 
clear emphasis on performance-related pay to reflect the 
culture of the Group. The Remuneration Policy continues  
to provide below market levels of fixed pay with above 
market levels of variable pay opportunity, subject to the 
achievement of challenging performance measures linked 
to the Group KPIs. Variable pay is geared towards long-term 
sustainable performance, with a high level of annual bonus 
deferral into shares, long-term incentive awards and 
appropriate share ownership guidelines. 
We are committed to maintaining an open and transparent 
dialogue with shareholders. We have valued the engagement 
with and support of our shareholders and we remain focused 
on disclosing clearly how much our executive directors earn 
and how this links to the Group’s performance.

Remuneration Policy Report (unaudited)
 
Introduction
This report sets out the Company’s Policy on directors’ 
remuneration for the forthcoming year and for subsequent 
years, as well as information on remuneration paid to 
directors for the financial year ended 31 December 2017. 
The report has been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006, the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 (together the Act)  
and the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code).
In accordance with the Act this report comprises a  
Policy Report and an Annual Report on Remuneration.  
The Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders  
at the 2017 AGM with 95.8% voting for the new Policy.  
The Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an 
advisory vote at the 2018 AGM. The parts of the report 
which have been audited have been highlighted.
Remuneration Policy Report (the Policy Report) 
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out  
the Remuneration Policy for the Company and has been 
prepared in accordance with the Act. 
The Policy was developed in line with Rightmove’s approach, 
that our executive directors should be rewarded with 
demonstrably lower than market base salaries and benefits 
and higher than market equity rewards subject to the 
achievement of challenging performance targets. This 
approach accords with the views of our major shareholders 
and with ‘best practice’ principles set out in the Code.
The key principles of the Committee’s Policy are that 
executive remuneration should:
•  allow the Company to attract and retain talented individuals 
who are critical to the success of the business;
•  be simple to explain, understand and administer; 
•  be regarded as fair by both other employees and 
shareholders;
•  be below market levels for base salary with minimal benefits 
(which are made available on the same basis to all 
Rightmove employees) and above market levels of variable 
pay potential;
•  provide directors with the opportunity to receive a share  
in the future growth and development of the Group; 
•  align the interests of the executive directors with the 
interests of shareholders and reflect the dynamic, 
performance-driven culture of the Group;
•  principally reward individuals for the overall success of the 
business, measuring and incentivising directors against key 
short-term and medium to long-term goals; 
•  not enable executive directors to gain significantly from 
short-term successes, which subsequently prove not to be 
consistent with growing the overall value of the business. 
Hence the majority of any bonus payable in relation to 
short-term strategic goals in relation to the Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan is required to be taken in the form of shares in 
the Company which are deferred for a further two years 
after the bonus target has been achieved; and
•  normally be reviewed against the market every three years, 
with intervening pay reviews for executive directors directly 
linked to the policies applied to all employees, specifically 
with regard to cost of living rises in base salary and changes 
in benefits.
The following table provides an overview of the Committee’s 
Remuneration Policy, which has been designed to reflect the 
principles described above:  rightmove.co.uk 54

Performance  
criteria
Salary T o provide a 
base salary 
which will attract 
and retain  
high calibre 
executives to 
execute the 
Group’s 
business 
strategy.
Base salaries are normally reviewed 
annually. The timing of any change 
is at the Committee’s discretion 
and will usually be effective from  
1 January.
When considering the executive’s 
eligibility for a salary increase,  
the Committee considers the 
following points:
•  size and responsibilities of the role;
•  individual and Group performance;
•  increases awarded to the wider 
workforce; and
•  broader economic and inflationary 
conditions.
Executive directors’ remuneration 
is benchmarked against external 
market data periodically (generally 
every three years). Relevant market 
comparators are selected for 
comparison, which include other 
companies of a similar size and 
complexity. The Committee 
considers benchmark data, 
alongside a broad review of the 
individual’s skills and experience, 
performance and internal 
relativities. 
Directors’ current salaries are 
set out on page 64.
These salary levels will be 
eligible for increases during the 
period that the Remuneration 
Policy operates from the 
effective date. 
During this time, salaries may 
be increased each year (in 
percentage of salary terms) in 
line with those of the wider 
workforce and will be capped  
at the average workforce 
increase plus 3%, subject to 
the Committee’s consideration 
of the overall salary budget, 
individual and Group 
performance and factors  
in the wider economy  
including inflation. 
Increases beyond those linked 
to the workforce (in percentage 
of salary terms) will only be 
awarded where there is a 
change of incumbent, in 
responsibility, experience or  
a significant increase in the 
scale of the role and/or size, 
value and/or complexity of  
the Group.
The Committee considers both 
individual and Group performance 
in a broad context when 
determining base salary increases. 
Benefits T o provide 
simple, cost-
effective, 
employee 
benefits which 
are the same as 
those offered  
to the wider 
workforce.
The executive directors are 
enrolled in the Group’s private 
medical insurance scheme and 
receive life assurance cover  
equal to four times base salary.  
Additionally, all executive directors 
are members of the Group’s 
medical cash plan.
Executive directors will be entitled 
to receive new benefits on the 
same terms as those introduced 
for the whole workforce.
The value of benefits may vary 
from year to year depending on 
the cost to the Company from 
third party providers.

Pension T o provide  
a basic,  
cost-effective, 
long-term 
retirement 
benefit.
The Group operates a stakeholder 
pension plan for employees under 
which the employer contributes  
6% of base salary subject to the 
employee contributing a minimum 
of 3% of base salary. The Company 
does not contribute to any personal 
pension arrangements.
The Company may introduce a 
cash alternative to a pension 
contribution where this would be 
more tax efficient for the individual.
Whilst executives are not obliged  
to join, the Company operates  
a pension salary exchange 
arrangement whereby executives 
can exchange part of their salary 
for Company paid pension 
contributions. Where executives 
exchange salary and this reduces 
the Company’s National Insurance 
Contributions the Company  
credits the full saving to the 
executive’s pension.

Plan (DSP)
T o incentivise 
and recognise 
execution of  
the business 
strategy on an 
annual basis.
Rewards the 
achievement of 
annual financial 
and operational 
objectives.
The annual bonus comprises a 
cash award (40% of any bonus 
earned) and a DSP award (60%  
of any bonus earned). A greater 
proportion of the annual bonus 
may be deferred in future years  
at the Committee’s discretion.
Deferred shares will vest after two 
years and be potentially forfeitable 
during that period. 
Payments under the annual bonus 
plan may be subject to clawback  
in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Group’s 
financial results or misconduct.
.
Maximum (% salary): 
125% of base salary
The bonus is determined by and 
based on performance against  
a range of key performance 
indicators which will be selected 
and weighted to support delivery 
of the business strategy.
The primary bonus metric will be 
profit-based (e.g. underlying 
operating profit) with targets set  
in relation to a carefully considered 
business plan and requiring 
significant out-performance of 
that plan to trigger maximum 
payments. 
A minority of bonus will also be 
earned based on pre-set targets 
drawn from the Group’s other key 
performance indicators relating to 
underlying drivers of long-term 
revenue growth.
Details of the performance 
measures used for the current year 
and the targets set for the year 
under review and performance 
against them is provided on 
 pages 64 to 65 and 70 to 71.
25% of the awards vest for 
achieving the threshold 
performance target. Bonus is 
earned on a linear basis from 
threshold to maximum 
performance levels. rightmove.co.uk 56

and forfeitable shares which vest 
after three years subject to 
continued service and the 
achievement of challenging 
performance conditions. 
The Committee has discretion to 
introduce a two-year post-vesting 
holding period for future executive 
appointments to the Board.
A dividend equivalent provision 
operates enabling dividends to be 
paid (in cash or shares) on shares  
at the time of vesting.
PSP awards may be subject to 
clawback in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Group’s 
financial results or misconduct.

Financial targets will determine 
vesting in relation to at least half  
of an award.
25% of the awards vest for 
achieving the threshold 
performance target. Awards vest 
on a linear basis from threshold to 
maximum performance levels.
The performance period for 
financial targets and relative TSR 
targets is three financial years, 
starting with the year in which  
the award is granted. 
All-employee 
Sharesave 
Plan
Provides all 
employees with 
the opportunity 
to become 
owners in the 
Company on 
similar terms.
Executive directors are entitled to 
participate on the same terms as  
all other employees in the Group’s 
Sharesave Plan, which has standard 
terms.
Participation limits are set by 
HMRC from time to time.
None
Share 
Incentive Plan 
(SIP)
T o provide all

Executive directors are entitled  
to participate in the SIP on the 
same terms as all other employees. 
The SIP has standard terms and 
currently only free shares are 
offered. However , executive 
directors routinely forfeit their 
entitlement to any free share 
awards.
The Committee may award free 
shares to employees, subject to  
the continued strong Group 
performance. Share awards will 
typically be made annually in 
January and will be modest in value, 
historically 50 shares per employee, 
although this will differ with the 
market value of the shares. 
Participation in the SIP is based 
on HMRC rules. Share awards 
are discretionary and made 
within the SIP rules.

Executive directors are required  
to retain at least half of any share 
awards vesting or exercised (after 
selling sufficient shares to meet  
the exercise price and to pay any 
tax liabilities due) until they have 
met the shareholding guideline. 
The Committee will regularly 
monitor progress towards  
the guideline.
Shareholding guideline:  
200% of base salary for

directors
T o provide a 
competitive  
fee which  
will attract  
and retain  
high calibre 
individuals and 
reflects their 
relevant skills 
and experience.
The fees for non-executive 
directors (including the Company 
Chairman) are reviewed periodically 
(generally every three years). 
The Committee will consider  
the Chairman’s fee, whilst the  
non-executive directors’ fee is 
considered by the wider Board, 
excluding the non-executives. 
Fee levels for each role are 
determined after considering the 
responsibility of the role, the skills 
and knowledge required and the 
expected time commitments. 
Periodic benchmarking against 
relevant market comparators, 
reflecting the size and complexity 
of the role, is used to provide 
context when setting fee levels. 
In exceptional circumstances, 
where the normal time 
commitment has been 
substantially exceeded, an 
additional fee may be paid at  
the Board’s discretion.
Fees for the Chairman and 
non-executive directors were 
last reviewed in 2015 and are 
set out on page 65.
Fee increases may take place  
if fee levels are considered to 
have become out of line with 
the responsibilities and time 
commitments of individual 
roles.
Flexibility is retained to 
increase the above fee levels  
in the event that it is necessary 
to recruit a new Chairman or 
non-executive director of  
an appropriate calibre in  
future years.

Directors may claim reasonable 
business expenses within the 
terms of the Group’s expenses 
policy and be reimbursed on the 
same basis as all employees.  
The Group may reimburse  
business expenses which are  
in future classified as taxable 
benefits by HMRC.
Expenses vary from year to 
year according to each 
director’s responsibilities, 
business activity and location.

Discretions maintained by the Committee in operating 
the incentive plans
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan, PSP, 
Sharesave Plan and SIP according to their respective rules 
and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules 
where relevant. 
The Committee retains discretion, consistent with market 
practice, in a number of regards to the operation and 
administration of these plans. These discretions include,  
but are not limited to, the following:
•  the selection of participants in the respective plan;
•  the timing of grant of an award (if any) and payments;
•  the size of an award and/or a payment (with limits as 
described in the table above);
•  the extent of vesting based on the achievement of 
performance targets and applicable exercise periods  
where relevant; 
•  how to deal with a change of control (e.g. the timing of 
testing performance targets) or restructuring of the Group;
•  determination of a ‘good’/’bad’ leaver for incentive plan 
purposes based on the rules of each plan and the 
appropriate treatment chosen including the timing of  
the delivery of shares;
•  adjustments (if any) required in certain circumstances  
(e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events and 
special dividends); and
•  the annual review of performance measures, targets and 
weightings for the annual bonus plan and PSP from year  
to year.
The Committee also retains the ability to adjust the targets 
and/or set different measures for the annual bonus plan  
and PSP if events occur (e.g. a material divestment or 
acquisition) which cause it to determine that the conditions 
are no longer appropriate and an amendment is required so  rightmove.co.uk 58
that the conditions achieve their original purpose and are 
not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant,  
be detailed in the Annual Report on Remuneration and if 
appropriate, the subject of prior communication with the 
Company’s major shareholders.
For the avoidance of doubt, all previous commitments or 
entitlements agreed prior to the approval of this Policy or 
appointment to the Board will be permitted to payout on 
their original terms or in line with the Policy in force at the 
time they were agreed.
Selection of performance measures and how  
targets are set
The performance metrics that are used for annual bonus 
and long-term incentive plans are a subset of the Group’s 
key performance indicators.
For the annual bonus, underlying operating profit is the 
primary performance metric used as it is aligned to the 
Group’s strategy of delivering profitable growth and is a key 
financial performance indicator used within the business. 
Consistent with previous years, operating profit is measured 
on an underlying basis, to exclude any volatility in relation to 
the Company’s share price in connection with the IFRS 2 
valuation and National Insurance charge on share-based 
incentives granted. The underlying operating profit target  
is set on a sliding scale based around the business plan for 
the year , with 25% payable for threshold performance. 
The annual bonus also considers performance against other 
operational metrics, including a traffic market share target, 
growth in Other revenue and an employee engagement 
target, for a minority of the bonus, with a sliding scale used  
to determine performance against each measure. 
Market share is a measure of the size and engagement of 
our audience and the value which Rightmove brings to our 
customers and therefore a challenging target to increase 
Rightmove’s share of this audience is considered 
appropriate by the Committee. 
The Other revenue target measures growth in revenue  
from businesses other than Agency and New Homes.  
Since some of these businesses will be at an early stage of 
development, we consider growth in revenue rather than  
in operating profit to be the appropriate measure and note 
that this element of the bonus is only a small proportion of 
the total bonus opportunity. 
For the PSP, awards are subject to a combination of 
underlying basic earnings per share (EPS) and relative  
TSR performance conditions. EPS is considered the most 
appropriate financial metric for Rightmove at this stage in  
its development (since it is the measure of profitability that  
is most closely aligned with shareholders’ interests and 
monitored on an ongoing basis within the business).  
The Policy also recognises that relative TSR should also  
be a performance measure in order for there to be a clear 
alignment of executive directors’ and shareholder interests. 
EPS targets are set based on sliding scales that take account 
of internal financial planning and external analyst forecasts. 
Only 25% of the EPS element will payout for threshold 
performance levels, with the maximum award requiring 
substantial out-performance. For TSR, the range of targets 
measure how successful the Company is in out-performing 
the FTSE 350 Index with 25% of this part of the award 
vesting at the threshold performance level, through to full 
vesting for 25% out-performance of the Index over the 
three-year performance period. For historic PSP awards, 
performance against the FTSE 250 Index was the selected 
measure, however , the Company has resided in the top 
quartile of the FTSE 250 for some time and the wider index is 
now considered more appropriate for comparison purposes.
Performance targets do not apply to Sharesave or SIP 
awards since these awards are structured to encourage 
employees to become share-owners and to maintain  
tax-favoured status the awards must operate on a 
consistent basis for all employees.
The Company does not at the present time take account  
of the ratio of CEO to employee pay but will keep this under 
review as market and best practice develops and as 
regulations evolve.
How the views of employees are taken into account
The Company has not to date felt it necessary to consult 
directly with employees on executive remuneration matters. 
However , the Committee is kept aware of pay and 
employment conditions within the wider workforce when 
setting executive directors’ remuneration Policy. 
Remuneration Policy for executive directors compared 
to other employees
The Committee will consider the proposed salary budget  
for the whole Group when it is deciding on salary increases 
for executive directors specifically. 
In line with the Company’s strategy to keep remuneration 
simple and consistent, benefits and pension arrangements 
provided to executive directors are the same as those 
offered to all Group employees.

performance metrics used determined by the nature of the 
role and responsibilities and market rates at that level.
Long-term incentive awards such as the DSP, are only 
offered to senior management as those awards are more 
heavily weighted towards performance-related pay and have 
a stronger visibility on the value created for shareholders and 
the reward for participants. 
Shareholders’ views
The Committee considers it vitally important to maintain 
open and transparent communication with the Company’s 
shareholders. The Committee consulted major shareholders 
representing over 50% of the Company’s share ownership 
on proposed changes and continued suitability of the 
Remuneration Policy. The shareholders who were consulted 
were overwhelmingly supportive of the Policy proposals and 
commented constructively in relation to several areas, 
including future rises in basic salary and post-vesting holding 
periods for long-term incentives. Shareholder feedback was 
considered by the Committee and contributed to the 
development of the overall Remuneration Policy.
Most recently, in late 2017 , the Committee engaged with 
shareholders regarding the salary increases awarded to the 
executive directors in 2018.
Reward scenarios 
The Company’s Remuneration Policy (as previously outlined) is illustrated below using three different performance scenarios: 
minimum, on-target and maximum: 
Assumptions:
1.  Minimum = fixed pay only (salary + benefits + pension).
2.  On-target = 55% payable of the 2018 annual bonus and 62.5% vesting of the 2018 PSP awards being the midpoint 
between threshold vesting of 25% and maximum vesting of 100%.
3.  Maximum = 100% payable of the 2018 annual bonus and 100% vesting of the 2018 PSP awards.
Base salary is as set at 1 January 2018. The value of taxable benefits is based on the cost of supplying those benefits  
(using the cost as disclosed on page 68) for the year ended 31 December 2017. The executive directors have elected not  
to participate in the Company’s pension arrangements. 
The executive directors can participate in the Sharesave Plan and SIP on the same basis as other employees. The value that 
may be received under these schemes is subject to tax approved limits. For simplicity, the value that may be received from 
participating in these schemes has been excluded from the above charts. 
As required by the regulations no assumption is made as to future share price growth for reward elements (deferred bonus 
and long-term incentives) that are delivered in shares.
Amounts have been rounded to the nearest £1,000.

Recruitment and promotion policy
The Committee proposes an executive director’s remuneration package for new appointments in line with the principles 
outlined in the table below:
Element of remuneration Policy
Base salary Base salary levels will be set based on the roles and responsibilities of the individual together with their 
relevant skills and experience, taking into account the market rates for companies of comparable size 
and complexity and internal Company relativities. In some circumstances (e.g. to reflect an individual’s 
limited experience at a PLC board level) it may be considered appropriate to set initial salary levels 
below the perceived market competitive rate. Phased increases, potentially above inflation, may then 
be offered to achieve the desired market positioning over time, subject to an individual’s continued 
performance and development in the role. 
Benefits Benefits as provided to current executive directors. Where necessary the Committee may approve 
the payment of relocation expenses to facilitate recruitment, and flexibility is retained for the 
Company to pay legal fees and other costs incurred by the individual in relation to their appointment.
Pension Defined contributions or a cash alternative at the level provided to current executive directors.
Annual bonus An annual bonus would operate in the same manner as outlined for the current executive directors  
(as described above and in the Annual Report on Remuneration), although it would be pro-rated to 
reflect the employment period during the bonus year. Flexibility will be retained to set equivalent 
objectives for any new executive joining part way through a year.
The maximum bonus potential would not exceed 125% of base salary. 
It would be expected that the bonus for a new appointment would be assessed on the same 
performance metrics as that for the current executive directors on an ongoing basis. However , 
depending on the timing and nature of appointment it may be necessary to set tailored performance 
criteria for their first bonus plan. 
Long-term incentives A new appointment will be eligible to receive PSP awards as outlined in the Policy table. 
Share awards may be granted shortly after an appointment (subject to the Company not being in  
a closed period) and would be measured against the same performance criteria as the current 
executives. However , any award granted outside the normal award and performance cycle may be  
pro-rated at the Committee’s discretion. The Committee may introduce post-vesting holding periods 
under the PSP for new executives if it considers this an appropriate commitment in conjunction with 
the shareholding guidelines. 
The ongoing maximum award would not exceed 200% of base salary. 
For an internal hire, existing awards would continue over their original vesting period and remain 
subject to their terms as at the date of grant.  
The new appointment would be eligible to participate in the Sharesave Plan and the SIP under the 
same terms as all other employees.
Buy-out awards T o facilitate an external recruitment, it may be necessary to buy-out remuneration which would be 
forfeited on leaving their previous employer. When determining the quantum and structure of any  
buy-out awards the Committee will, as a minimum, take into account the following factors:
• the form of remuneration (cash or shares); 
• timing of expected payment/vesting; and 
• expected value (i.e. taking into account the likelihood of achieving the existing performance criteria). 
Buy-out awards, if used, will be granted using the Company’s existing share plans to the extent 
possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as 
permitted under the Listing Rules. 
Governance | Directors’ remuneration report continued Rightmove plc annual report 2017 61
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
to assess performance from grant to the date of cessation, 
and which will be reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion 
of the performance period actually served. The Committee 
retains the discretion to disapply time pro-rating in 
exceptional circumstances and to accelerate the vesting  
of awards for ‘good leavers’ in the event of death.
For awards granted under the DSP, ‘good leaver’ status  
may be determined for reasons of death, injury, disability, 
redundancy, transfer or sale of the employing company or 
other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee.  
If defined as a ‘good leaver’, awards will be retained and vest 
on the original vesting date, save as above in the event of 
death, when the Committee has the discretion to  
accelerate vesting.
Scott Forbes’ appointment may be terminated by either 
party giving to the other not less than three months’ notice 
in writing. The Company may also terminate by making a 
payment in lieu of notice. Scott Forbes is not contractually 
entitled to any other benefits on termination of his contract.
The Letters of Appointment for the non-executive directors 
provide for a term of up to two three-year periods and a 
possible further three-year term (subject to re-election  
by shareholders and subject to the director remaining 
independent). The appointments may be terminated with  
a notice period of three months on either side and the 
Letters of Appointment set out the time commitments 
required to meet the expectations of their roles. 
Copies are available for inspection on request to the 
Company Secretary. 
Further details of all directors’ contracts and Letters  
of Appointment are summarised overleaf:
Directors’ service contracts and non-executive 
directors’ terms of appointment
The Committee’s policy on service agreements for 
executive directors is that they should provide for  
12 months’ notice of termination by the Company and  
by the executive. Any proposals for the early termination  
by the Company of the service agreements of directors  
are considered by the Committee.
The service agreements for the executive directors allow  
for lawful termination of employment by making a payment 
in lieu of notice or by making phased payments over any 
remaining unexpired period of notice. The phased payments 
may be reduced if, and to the extent that, the executive finds 
an alternative remunerated position. 
In addition, any statutory entitlements or sums to settle  
or compromise claims in connection with the termination 
would be paid as necessary. The Company may also  
provide a contribution toward reasonable legal fees or 
outplacement services.
Peter Brooks-Johnson and Robyn Perriss are entitled to  
a payment in lieu of notice, restricted to base salary and 
benefits. In good leaver circumstances a bonus may be  
paid at the normal time subject to achievement of the 
performance conditions and pro-rating for the period 
worked in the year.
For awards granted under the PSP ‘good leaver’ status may 
be determined, in certain prescribed circumstances, such  
as death, ill health, disability, redundancy, transfer or sale  
of the employing company, or other circumstances at the 
discretion of the Committee. If defined as a ‘good leaver’, 
awards will remain subject to performance conditions, which 
will be measured over the performance period from grant to 
the original vesting date, unless the Committee determine  rightmove.co.uk 62

External advisors
New Bridge Street (NBS), a trading name of Aon Hewitt (part of 
Aon plc), which is a member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and has signed up to its Code of Conduct, has been 
retained as the Committee’s remuneration advisor since 
2011. The terms of engagement between the Company and 
NBS are available from the Company Secretary on request. 
The total fees paid to NBS in respect of services to the 
Committee during the year were £31,000. 
During 2017 NBS also provided services to the Company  
in connection with the valuation of share-based incentives  
(as required by IFRS 2) and confirmed that, in its view, these 
services did not present a conflict of interest with the other 
services provided to the Committee. The Committee reviews 
its relationship with external advisors on a regular basis and 
continues to believe that there are no conflicts of interest.
What has the Committee done during the year? 
The Committee met six times during the year to consider 
and, where appropriate, approve key remuneration items 
including:
Pay and incentive plan reviews
•  annual review and approval of executive directors’ base 
salaries and benefits;
•  approval of remuneration arrangements for Nick McKittrick 
on his retirement as Chief Executive Officer; 
•  approval of a salary increase and additional award under the 
Rightmove Performance Share Plan (PSP) for Peter Brooks-
Johnson on his promotion to Chief Executive Officer; 
•  review of 2017 business performance against relevant 
performance targets to determine annual bonus payouts 
and vesting of long-term incentives;
•  review and approval of appropriate benchmarks and 
performance measures for the annual performance-
related bonus and 2018 PSP awards to ensure  
measures are aligned with strategy and that targets  
are appropriately stretching;
•  approval of share awards granted in March 2017 under  
the Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSP) and the PSP; and
•  ongoing monitoring of senior management remuneration.
Governance and strategy
•  review and approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Report;
•  submitting the Remuneration Policy for executive directors 
for shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM;
•  review of the 2017 AGM voting and feedback from 
institutional investors;
•  evaluation of the Committee’s performance during  
the year; and
•  review of the Committee’s terms of reference.
Annual Report on Remuneration
 
Remuneration Committee role and membership
T erms of reference 
The primary role of the Committee is to make 
recommendations to the Board as to the Company’s overall 
policy and framework for the remuneration of the executive 
directors and the Chairman of the Board. The remuneration 
and terms of appointment of the non-executive directors 
are determined by the Board as a whole.
In accordance with the Code, the Committee also 
recommends the structure and monitors the level of 
remuneration for the first layer of management below Board 
level. The Committee is also aware of, and advises on, the 
employee benefit structures throughout the Group and 
ensures that it is kept aware of any potential business risks 
arising from those remuneration arrangements. 
The Committee has formal terms of reference which are 
reviewed annually and updated as required. These are 
available on the Company’s website at plc.rightmove.co.uk 
or on request from the Company Secretary.
Membership
The following independent non-executive directors were 
members of the Committee during 2017:
Peter Williams (Chairman of the Committee)
Rakhi Goss-Custard 
Jacqueline de Rojas (from 9 May 2017)
Colin Kemp (to 9 May 2017)
During the year the Committee met six times and 
attendance at the meetings is shown in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 36.
The quorum for meetings of the Committee is two members. 
The Committee will meet at such times as may be necessary 
but will normally meet at least five times a year. The Company 
Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
Only members of the Committee have the right to attend 
Committee meetings. The Chairman of the Committee  
has requested that the Chairman of the Board attend the 
meetings except during discussions relating to his own 
remuneration. The Chief Executive Officer may also be 
invited to meetings and the Committee takes into 
consideration his recommendations regarding the 
remuneration of executive colleagues and management 
below Board level. No executive director is involved in 
deciding their own remuneration. rightmove.co.uk 64

Salaries
The executive directors’ salaries for the 2018 financial year 
are set out in the table below:
    Salary Salary Workforce 
    1 January 31 December increase  
    2018 2017 plus Change
Executive directors
Peter Brooks-Johnson £472,268 £445,536
(1)
 3% 6%
Robyn Perriss £339,200 £320,000 3% 6%
 
(1)  On 9 May 2017, Nick McKittrick stepped down from the Board as  
Chief Executive Officer and retired from Rightmove on 30 June 2017. 
No payment was made in lieu of any unexpired period of notice. The Board 
approved the promotion of Peter Brooks-Johnson to Chief Executive Officer 
and the Committee approved an increase in his base salary from £373,136  
to £445,536, in line with his predecessor and our 2017 Remuneration Policy, 
with effect from 9 May 2017.
 
The 6% increase in base salaries for the executive directors 
represents an increase of 3% above the average workforce 
rise of 3% for 2018, primarily to recognise the scale and 
complexity of those roles and to address the relatively low 
pay of these executives compared with market norms.  
The salaries remain well below the market median for 
executives in comparable companies.
Pension and other benefits
The Group operates a stakeholder pension plan for all 
employees under which the employer contributes 6% of 
base salary, subject to the employee contributing a minimum 
of 3% of base salary. Peter Brooks-Johnson and Robyn 
Perriss elected not to participate in the pension plan during 
the year. The Company does not contribute to any personal 
pension arrangements. 
The executive directors are enrolled in the Group’s private 
medical insurance scheme and receive life assurance cover 
equal to four times base salary. Additionally, the executive 
directors are members of the Group’s medical cash plan.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus for the 2018 financial year will be 
consistent with the policy detailed on page 55 of the 
Remuneration Policy section of this report in terms of 
maximum bonus opportunity, deferral and clawback 
provisions. The mechanism through which the clawback  
can be implemented (enabling both the recovery and 
withholding of incentive pay) enables the Committee to  
(i) reduce the cash bonus earned in a subsequent year  
and/or reduce outstanding DSP/PSP share awards  
(i.e. withholding provisions may be used to effect a recovery) 
or (ii) for the Committee to require that a net of tax balancing 
cash payment be made to the Company. The performance 
measures have been selected to reflect a range of financial 
and strategic targets that continue to support the key 
objectives of the Group.
The performance measures and weightings will be as follows:
Measure As a % of maximum bonus opportunity
Financial targets
Underlying operating profit
(1)
 65%
Strategic targets
T raffic market share
(2) 
15%
Other revenue
(3) 
15%
Employee engagement
(4)
  5%
 
(1)  Operating profit before share-based payments and NI on  
share-based incentives.
(2)  Measured on a time on site basis by reference to comScore.
(3) Revenue excluding Agency and New Homes. 
(4) Based on the results of the annual employee survey.
In relation to the financial target a challenging sliding scale 
will operate with 25% of the maximum bonus opportunity 
payable at the threshold underlying operating profit target 
relative to the 2018 business plan through to 100% 
becoming payable for significant outperformance relative  
to the plan. A greater proportion of the award will be paid  
for exceeding threshold performance. 
The weighting of all performance measures are unchanged 
from 2017.
Governance | Directors’ remuneration report continued Rightmove plc annual report 2017 65
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
The targets themselves, as they relate to the 2018 financial 
year , are deemed to be commercially sensitive. However , 
retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance 
against them will be provided in next year’s Annual Report  
on Remuneration to the extent that they do not remain 
commercially sensitive at that time.
Long-term incentives
The award levels under the PSP, approved in 2017, remain  
at 200% of base salary for both executive directors.
Consistent with current market practice and previous years, 
awards to the executive directors under the PSP in 2018 will 
be subject to a mixture of EPS (75% of awards) and relative 
TSR (25% of the awards) performance conditions. The 2018 
targets are as follows:
EPS performance condition
The Group’s EPS growth will be measured over the period of 
three financial years (2018 to 2020). The EPS figure used will 
be equivalent to the Group’s basic underlying EPS (before 
share-based payments, National Insurance on share-based 
incentives and no related adjustment for tax). With a view to 
ensuring appropriately stretching but achievable targets  
are set, in light of market expectations for the Group, the 
following range of targets will apply to the 2018 awards:
Underlying basic EPS growth  % of award vesting 
from 2018 to 2020
(1)
 (maximum 75%)
Less than 20% 0%
20% 18.75%
50% 75%
Between 20% and 50% Straight-line vesting
 
(1)  The benchmark underlying basic EPS for the financial year 2017 from which 
these targets will be measured is 163.3p. 
 
As in prior years, the targets that are intended to operate  
for the 2018 PSP awards were set to be appropriately 
demanding in light of the Group’s internal planning, external 
market expectations for future growth and the current 
trading environment, the targets are considered to provide a 
realistic incentive at the lower end of the performance range 
but require exceptional performance to achieve full vesting. 
On this basis, the Committee is satisfied that the range of 
targets are appropriately demanding, and no less challenging 
than the range of targets set for the 2017 awards. 
Relative TSR performance condition
The vesting schedule for the relative TSR element of 
executive directors’ 2018 PSP awards is set out below. 
Relative TSR will be assessed against the FTSE 350 Index, 
reflecting the Company’s size in terms of market 
capitalisation. Performance will be measured over three 
financial years.
 TSR performance of the Company % of award vesting 
 relative to the FTSE 350 Index
(1)
 (maximum 25%)
 Less than the Index 0%
 Equal to the Index 6.25%
 25% higher than the Index 25%
 Intermediate performance Straight-line vesting
 
(1)  If the FTSE 350 Index’s TSR was 50% over the three-year performance period, 
then the Company’s TSR would have to be at least 75% for all 25% of the PSP 
shares to vest.
 
Chairman and non-executive directors’ fees
The Chairman and non-executive directors’ fees were  
last reviewed in a market context in 2015 and increased to 
current levels. In line with our Policy they are benchmarked 
and reviewed periodically, usually every three years.  
The next review is scheduled for 2018 with any increase 
taking effect in 2019. 
The basic non-executive fee is £50,000 with an additional 
£10,000 fee per annum paid for the chairing of the Audit  
and Remuneration Committees and a further £5,000 fee 
paid to the Senior Independent Director as detailed in the 
table below:
 Annual fee  Annual fee

Statement of shareholder voting at AGM
At the AGM on 9 May 2017, shareholders overwhelmingly 
voted in favour of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The Committee 
believes this illustrates the strong level of shareholder 
support for the remuneration framework. The table below 
shows full details of the voting outcomes for the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the Policy:

In line with the Company’s commitment to ongoing dialogue 
with its shareholders, the Committee corresponds with 
major shareholders and meetings are offered, where 
appropriate, to understand the reasons for any potential or 
actual opposition to the Company’s Remuneration Policy. 
Changes are made to our Policy where it is considered 
appropriate to do so.
Review of past performance
Share price performance
In 2017, the Company’s share price ended the year at £45.00 
up 15% year on year (the FTSE 250 Index was up 18% and 
the FTSE 350 Index was up 13%). On a three-year basis the  
share price has increased by 100% and has continued to 
outperform both the FTSE 250 and FTSE 350 Indices over 
that period as shown in the graphs below.
T otal shareholder return (TSR)
The first graph below compares the TSR of Rightmove’s 
shares against the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE 350  
Index for the three-year period from 1 January 2015 to 
31 December 2017. TSR is the product of movements in  
the share price plus dividends reinvested on the ex-dividend 
date. TSR provides a useful, widely used benchmark to 
illustrate the Company’s performance over the last three 
years. Specifically, it illustrates the value of £100 invested  
in Rightmove’s shares and in the FTSE 250 Index and the 
FTSE 350 Index over that period. 
As required by the Act, the Company’s TSR performance is 
required to be shown against a recognised broad-based 
share index. Since 2016, as Rightmove continues to be 
ranked towards the top of the FTSE 250 Index in terms of 
market capitalisation, the FTSE 350 Index is felt to be more 
appropriate for the purpose of comparing TSR performance 
and therefore this will be used as the criteria applied to 25% 
of the PSP awards to be granted in February 2018.
The graphs below illustrate, for statutory purposes, the  
TSR of Rightmove’s shares against the FTSE 250 Index  
and the FTSE 350 Index for the three and nine years to 
31 December 2017.

Defined contribution pension
The Group operates a stakeholder pension plan for employees under which the employer contributes 6% of base salary, 
subject to the employee contributing a minimum of 3% of base salary. None of the directors elected to participate in the 
pension plan during 2017. The Company does not contribute to any personal pension arrangements. rightmove.co.uk 70
How was pay linked to performance in 2017?
Annual bonus plan
The incentive for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 was in the form of a cash bonus of up to 50% of salary and a 
DSP bonus of up to 75% of salary (i.e. 125% in total). The bonus (both cash and DSP elements) was determined by a mixture 
of underlying operating profit performance (65%) and key performance indicators (35%) relating to underlying drivers of 
long-term revenue growth.
When comparing performance against the 2017 bonus targets set, the Committee determined that 60% of the maximum 
achievable cash and DSP bonus should be paid to the executive directors. Accordingly, a cash bonus of 30% of base salary will 
be paid to the executives and 45% of base salary will be granted to the executive directors under the DSP, which will be 
deferred until March 2020. More details are provided in the table below:

Long-term incentives vesting during the year
The PSP awards granted in March 2015 were subject to EPS (75% of the awards) and relative TSR (25% of the awards) 
performance conditions that related to the three-year period ended 31 December 2017. 
The vesting schedule for the relative TSR element of executive directors’ 2015 PSP awards is set out below:
 
 % of award vesting 
Relative TSR condition (maximum 25%)
Less than the Index 0%
Equal to the Index 6.25%
25% higher than the Index 25%
Intermediate performance Straight-line vesting
Governance | Directors’ remuneration report continued Rightmove plc annual report 2017 71
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
At the end of the performance period, Rightmove’s TSR was 109.2% compared to 39.2% for the FTSE 250 Index. As this level 
of outperformance is 70% higher than the Index, these options will vest in full on 2 March 2018.
Rightmove’s EPS growth is measured over a period of three financial years (2015 to 2017). The EPS figure used is equivalent 
to Rightmove’s reported underlying basic EPS (before share-based payments, NI on share-based incentives and no related 
adjustment for tax) and the vesting schedule is set out below:
Underlying basic EPS growth  % of award vesting 
from 2015 to 2017 (maximum 75%)
Less than 30% 0%
30% 18.75%
60% 75%
Between 30% and 60% Straight-line vesting
 
At the end of the performance period, underlying basic EPS was 163.3p which from an underlying basic EPS base of 100.3p 
results in growth of 63%, exceeding the maximum 60% EPS growth target and will result in full vesting of this part of the award 
(maximum of 75%) from 2 March 2018. 
Share awards granted during the year
On 1 March 2017 Peter Brooks-Johnson and Robyn Perriss were awarded shares under the PSP, which vest in March 2020, 
and are subject to a mixture of EPS (75% of the awards) and TSR relative to the FTSE 350 Index (25% of the awards) 
performance with the greater weighting on EPS to reflect its particular relevance to the performance of the business.

(1) Based on the average mid-market share price for the three consecutive days prior to grant, taken from the Daily Official List, of £39.93.
On 9 May 2017, the Committee approved a top-up award 
of performance shares for Peter Brooks-Johnson, 
following his promotion to CEO. The award was over 3,457 
ordinary shares of 1p each, reflecting the increase in his 
base salary from £373,136 to £445,536. The performance 
shares are exercisable for a period of two years from 9 May 
2020 and are subject to the same performance criteria as 
the original award granted on 1 March 2017. The number 
of additional shares was based on the average mid-market 
share price for the three consecutive days prior to grant, 
taken from the Daily Official List, of £41.90. 
The vesting schedule for the relative TSR element of 
executive directors’ 2017 PSP awards is set out below.  
It is consistent with the TSR condition used for previous 
grants under the share option scheme. Performance  
will be measured over three financial years.

no related adjustments for tax). 
The following vesting schedule will apply for executive 
directors’ awards granted in 2017:

Retirement arrangements for Nick McKittrick
Nick McKittrick retired as a director and Chief Executive Officer following the AGM on 9 May 2017. His employment with the 
Group ended on 30 June 2017. 
The Committee determined that he should continue to be paid his salary and normal package of benefits up to 30 June 2017 
and receive a bonus in respect of the 2016 financial year as detailed below. In line with the Remuneration Policy, 40% of the 
2016 bonus was paid in cash with the balance deferred in shares for a period of two years. Nick did not receive a bonus for the 
six months to 30 June 2017 and was not awarded performance shares under the PSP in March 2017. 
The Committee also determined that Nick would be treated as a good leaver in relation to his outstanding PSP and DSP

Outstanding PSP awards would also be subject to the achievement of performance conditions and vest pro-rata in

All existing executive share-based incentives can be satisfied from shares held in the Rightmove Employees’ Share T rust 
(EBT) and shares held in treasury. It is intended that the 2017 share-based incentive awards will also be settled from shares 
currently held in the EBT or from shares held in treasury without any requirement to issue further shares. 
During 2017, treasury shares were used to satisfy vested PSP awards and unapproved options over 379,269 shares, 
representing 0.42% of issued share capital (less treasury shares) as at 31 December 2017.

Percentage increase in the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer
The table below shows the movement in the salary, benefits and annual bonus for the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 
between the current and previous financial year compared to that of the total amounts for all employees of the Group for 
each of these elements of pay.
The CEO’s base salary increased by 5%, in line with the approved Remuneration Policy of awarding 3% above the average 
workforce inflationary increase for 2017. The annual bonus of the CEO decreased by 32% as a result of 60% of the 
maximum bonus being achieved in relation to the 2017 bonus targets, compared with a payout of 92% for 2016.
The average salary for all employees increased by 2% due to a universal cost of living increase in January 2017.

2.  Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of  
material misstatement 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. We summarise below the key audit 
matters (unchanged from 2016), in decreasing order of audit 
significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together 
with our key audit procedures to address those matters  
and our findings from those procedures in order that the 
Company’s members as a body may better understand the 
process by which we arrived at our audit opinion. These 
matters were addressed, and our findings are based on 
procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the 
purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are 
incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
 
1.  Our opinion is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Rightmove plc 
(“the Company”) for the year ended 31 December 2017 
which comprise the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, Consolidated statement of  
financial position, Company statement of financial position, 
Consolidated statement of cash flows, Company statement 
of cash flows, Consolidated statement of changes in 
shareholders’ equity, Company statement of changes in 
shareholders’ equity, and the related notes, including the 
accounting policies in note 1. 
In our opinion: 
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs  
as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the 
year then ended; 
•  the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
•  the parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006; and 
•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that  
the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and 
appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is 
consistent with our report to the audit committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the directors to the Group’s 
previous holding company, prior to it becoming a public 
interest entity, for the financial period ended 31 December 
2000. The period of total uninterrupted engagement as 
auditor is for the 12 financial years ended 31 December 2017 
as a public-interest entity and 18 years in total.  rightmove.co.uk 78

The risk: Our response: 
Revenue recognition Processing error: Our audit procedures included: 
The key revenue streams,  
being Agency , New Homes  
and Overseas, consist of 
subscription fees and customer 
spend on additional advertising 
products in respect of 
properties listed on Rightmove 
platforms. There is a variety of 
packages and membership 
offers available and customers 
are able to tailor the 
combination of products they 
receive. The resulting large 
volume of non-homogenous 
transactions creates a risk of 
processing error. In addition 
revenue is the most material 
figure in the financial 
statements and is considered 
to be a main driver of results, 
and as such had the greatest 
effect on our allocation of 
resources in planning and 
completing the audit. 
Control operation: T esting the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the Group’s controls over the review of monthly revenue 
recognised compared to the Group’s expectation and controls over the review 
and monitoring of membership offers that impact revenue recognition; 
Data comparison: Agreeing billings by individual invoice, for the entire 
population, to cash receipts;
T ests of details: For a sample of the highest revenue generating 
customers we inspected contracts signed in the year , to assess whether 
revenue has been recognised in accordance with the specific contract 
terms and conditions;  
Re-performance: For membership offers operated during the year , we 
selected a sample of customers from each offer , inspected the underlying 
contract and reperformed the revenue recognition calculations;
T ests of details: We assessed the appropriateness of deferred revenue at 
the period end with reference to subscription fee billings in December , and 
specific product deferrals where amounts are billed in advance but revenue 
recognition deferred until the services are provided; 
T est of details: Inspecting a sample of credit notes raised post year end to 
determine whether they related to revenue recognised in the year;
T ests of details: We obtained 100% of the journals posted in respect  
of revenue and, using computer assisted audit techniques, analysed 
these to identify and investigate any entries which appeared unusual 
based upon the specific characteristics of the journal, considering in 
particular whether the debit side of the journal entry was as expected, 
based on our business understanding.
Our findings:
We found no errors in the Group’s calculation of the revenue recognised.

Low risk, high value:
The carrying amount of the 
parent Company’s 
investments in the subsidiary 
company Rightmove Group 
Limited represents 99%  
(2016: 99%) of the Company’s 
total assets. Its recoverability is 
not at a high risk of significant 
misstatement or subject to 
significant judgement. 
However , due to its materiality 
in the context of the parent 
Company financial statements, 
this is considered to be the 
area that had the greatest 
effect on our overall parent 
Company audit.
Our audit procedures included: 
Comparing valuations: comparing the carrying amount of the investment 
to the market capitalisation of the Group, as Rightmove Group Limited 
contains all of the Group’s trading operations.
Our findings:
We found no indicators of impairment. Rightmove plc annual report 2017 79

3.  Our application of materiality and an overview  
of the scope of our audit 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was 
set at £7.5m (2016: £7.0m), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group profit before tax of £178.2m, of which  
it represents 4.2% (2016: 4.3%).
Materiality for the parent Company financial statements as  
a whole was set at £6.0m (2016: £5.6m), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of Company net assets, of which  
it represents 1.1% (2016: 1.1%). 
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected 
or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.37m 
(2016: £0.35m), in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. 
Of the Group’s three (2016: three) reporting components, 
which includes the parent Company, we subjected two  
(2016: three) to full scope audits for Group purposes.  
The components within the scope of our work accounted  
for 100% of total Group revenue, 100% of Group profit 
before tax and 99.8% of total Group assets.
The remaining 0.2% of total Group assets is represented by 
one reporting component, which individually is not 
significant to the Group.
The work on the two reporting components (2016: three 
components) was performed by the Group team, which 
includes the audit of the parent Company, with materiality  
for the components set at £6.0m (2016: £5.6m-£25,000).

significant doubt over the Group and Company’s use of 
that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements; or 
•   the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on 
page 89 is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
5.  We have nothing to report on the other  
information in the Annual Report 
The directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the financial

any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and,  
in doing so, consider whether , based on our financial

Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:

the Principal Risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity; 
•  the principal risks and uncertainties disclosures describing 
these risks and explaining how they are being managed and 
mitigated; and

Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or

which we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion: 
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the

7.  Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 
49, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the 
financial statements including being satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error; assessing the Group and parent Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend 
to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or other 
irregularities (see below), or error , and to issue our opinion in 
an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise  
from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
Irregularities – ability to detect
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could 
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the 
financial statements from our sector experience, through 
discussion with the directors and other management (as 
required by auditing standards).
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that directly 
affect the financial statements including financial reporting 
(including related company legislation) and taxation 
legislation. We considered the extent of compliance with 
those laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the 
related financial statements items.
We communicated identified laws and regulations 
throughout our team and remained alert to any indications 
of non-compliance throughout the audit. 
8.  The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and the terms of our engagement by 
the Company. Our audit work has been undertaken so that 
we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report, and 
the further matters we are required to state to them in 
accordance with the terms agreed with the Company,  
and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted  
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members,  
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.

Notes forming part of the financial statements
1 General information
Rightmove plc (the Company) is a company registered in England (Company no. 6426485) domiciled in the United Kingdom (UK). 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 comprise the Company 
and its interest in its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 are available upon request 
to the Company Secretary from the Company’s registered office at T urnberry House, 30 Caldecotte Lake Drive, Caldecotte, 
Milton Keynes, MK7 8LE or are available on the corporate website at plc.rightmove.co.uk.
Statement of compliance
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Board of directors in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (Adopted IFRSs).
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 23 February 2018.
Basis of preparation
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking 
advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual statement of comprehensive 
income and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has existing rights that give it the ability to  
direct the relevant activities of an entity and has the ability to affect the returns the Group will receive as a result of its 
involvement with the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken  
into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that 
control commences until the date that control ceases.
On 31 May 2016 the Group acquired The Outside View Analytics Ltd (“Outside View”) from which date the results of Outside View 
have been consolidated. Details of the acquisition are set out in Note 27.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements are in accordance with Adopted  
IFRSs and are the same as those applied by the Group in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended  
31 December 2016.
There have been no significant changes to accounting under IFRS which have affected the Group’s results for the current 
financial year. The only changes to the IFRS that are effective for the first time in this financial year , and are applicable for  
the Group, are the Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2014-2016 cycle. These have not had a material impact on the Group.
Going concern
Throughout 2017, the Group was debt free and has continued to generate significant cash and has an overall positive net asset 
position. The Group had cash balances of £20,930,000 at 31 December 2017 (2016: £13,749,000). The Group also had 
£4,045,000 of money market deposits (2016: £4,026,000).  
During the year £140,420,000 (2016: £131,289,000) of cash was returned to shareholders via dividends and discretionary share 
buybacks.
The Group agreed to extend a 12 month agreement with Barclays Bank plc for a £10,000,000 committed revolving loan facility. 
This agreement will expire on 12 February 2019.
The Board of directors is confident that with the existing cash resources and banking facilities in place, coupled with the strength 
of the underlying business model, the Group and the Company will remain cash positive and will have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for a period of 12 months from the date of signing these accounts. rightmove.co.uk 90
Notes continued
1 General information continued
Further information regarding the Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 29. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described on pages 17 to 19. In addition Note 4 to the financial statements includes 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Capital structure
The Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 14 November 2007 under the Companies Act 1985  
as a private company limited by shares with the name Rightmove Group Limited, registered no. 6426485. The Company was 
re-registered as a public limited company under the name Rightmove Group plc on 29 November 2007. On 28 January 2008  
the Company became the holding company of Rightmove Group Limited (formerly Rightmove plc, Company no. 3997679)  
and its subsidiaries pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement under s425 of the Companies Act 1985. The shares in the Company 
were admitted to trading on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange on 28 January 2008 and the Company immediately 
changed its name to Rightmove plc. Details of the share capital of the Company are disclosed in Note 22.
Judgements and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated and Company financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRSs requires management 
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and 
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making 
judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods, if applicable.
In particular , information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated and Company financial statements are 
included in the following notes:
Notes 16 and 24  The choice of valuation methodology and the inputs and assumptions used to calculate the initial fair value  
for new share-based incentives granted and the rate at which the related deferred tax asset is measured.  
The key estimates used in calculating the fair value of the options are the fair value of the Company’s shares 
at the grant date, expected share price volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and weighted 
average expected life of the instrument. In respect of share-based incentives granted to employees, the 
number of share-based incentives that are expected to vest is based upon estimates of the number of 
employees that will forfeit their awards through leaving the Group and the likelihood of any non-market 
performance conditions being satisfied. Management regularly performs a true-up of the estimate of the 
number of shares that are expected to vest; this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
Non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) performance measures
In the analysis of the Group’s financial performance certain information disclosed in the financial statements may be prepared on 
a non-GAAP basis or has been derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself an expressly permitted 
GAAP measure. These measures are reported in line with how financial information is analysed by management. The key  
non-GAAP measures presented by the Group are:
•  Underlying operating profit – which is defined as operating profit before share-based payments and National Insurance on 
share-based incentives; and
•  Underlying basic earnings per share (EPS) – which is defined as profit for the year before share-based payments and National 
Insurance on share-based incentives, with no related adjustment for tax, divided by the weighted average number of shares in 
issue for the year. Rightmove plc annual report 2017 91
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
1 General information continued
The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures provide a more appropriate measure of the Group’s business performance 
as share-based payments are a significant non-cash charge and are driven by a valuation model, and NI on share-based 
incentives is driven by reference to the Rightmove plc share price and so subject to volatility, rather than reflecting operational 
activity. The directors therefore consider underlying operating profit to be the most appropriate indicator of the performance of 
the business and year-on-year trends. For simplicity no adjustment for tax is made within the calculation of underlying basic EPS.  
The non-GAAP measures are designed to increase comparability of the Group’s financial performance year-on-year.
2 Significant accounting policies
(a) Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any provision for impairment in the parent Company financial statements. 
(b) Intangible assets
 (i) Goodwill
  Goodwill arising on a business combination represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the 
fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and is included in intangible assets. 
  In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the 
amount previously recorded under UK GAAP. The classification and accounting treatment of business that occurred prior to 
1 January 2004 was not reconsidered in preparing the Group’s opening IFRS statement of financial position at 1 January 2004.
  Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. This applies to 
all goodwill arising both before and after 1 January 2004.
 (ii) Research and development
  The Group undertakes research and development expenditure in view of developing new products and improving the existing 
property platforms. Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and 
understanding, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
  Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of a new 
product or substantially enhanced website, is capitalised if the new product or the enhanced website is technically and 
commercially feasible, the Group has sufficient resources to complete development, future economic benefits are probable 
and the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Capitalised 
costs are held as an asset in progress until such point that the asset is brought into use, at which point it is transferred to the 
appropriate intangible asset category and amortisation is charged.
  The expenditure capitalised includes subcontractors and direct labour. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets 
is capitalised only when it increases the economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other 
expenditure is expensed when incurred.
 (iii) Computer software and licences
  Computer software and externally acquired software licences are capitalised and stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use. Amortisation  
is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of the computer software or licence by equal annual 
instalments over its estimated useful economic life as follows:
 Computer software 20.0% – 33.3% per annum 
 Software licences 20.0% – 33.3% per annum
 (iv) Market appraisal algorithm
  The market appraisal algorithm identified on the acquisition of the Outside View Analytics Ltd is valued using the 
reproduction cost method based on market rate salaries. Amortisation is expensed in the profit or loss on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful economic life as follows: 
 Market appraisal algorithm 33.3% per annum rightmove.co.uk 92
2 Significant accounting policies continued
(c) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Capitalised costs are held  
as an asset in progress until such point that the asset is brought into use, at which point it is transferred to the appropriate property, 
plant and equipment category and depreciation is charged. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual 
value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Office equipment, fixtures and fittings 20.0% per annum 
Computer equipment 20.0% – 33.3% per annum 
Leasehold improvements remaining life of the lease
(d) Impairment
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is 
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of 
non-financial assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, 
the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment 
annually and whenever there is an indication that they might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 
which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Investments are assessed for possible impairment when there is an indication that the fair value of the investments may be 
below the Company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the 
investment is written down to its fair value and the amount written off is included in profit or loss. In making the determination  
as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the Company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, 
the investee’s financial performance and the Company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be 
sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value.
(e) Financial instruments
T rade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
less any impairment loss. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the receivables’ original terms.
T rade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
T rade payables are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability  
for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
Money market deposits are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. They represent deposits 
with a maturity of over three months.
Inter-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from inter-group transactions, are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less. 
(g) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can  
be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessment 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
(h) Employee benefits
 (i) Pensions
  The Group provides access to a stakeholder pension scheme (a defined contribution pension plan) into which employees 
may elect to contribute via salary exchange. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are 
recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are incurred.

2 Significant accounting policies continued
 (ii) Employee share schemes
  The Group provides share-based incentive plans allowing executive directors and other employees to acquire shares in the 
Company. An expense is recognised in profit or loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period during which  
the employees become unconditionally entitled to acquire equity settled share-based incentives.
  Fair value at the grant date is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black Scholes pricing model as is most appropriate 
for each scheme. Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected 
volatility (based on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information), 
weighted average expected life of the instruments (based on historical experience and general option behaviour), expected 
dividends, and risk-free interest rates (based on government bonds). Service and non-market performance conditions 
attached to the awards are not taken into account in determining the fair value.
  For share-based incentive awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based incentives is 
measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.  
When either the employee or the Company chooses not to meet the non-vesting condition, the failure to meet the  
non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation and the cost that would have been recognised over the remainder  
of the vesting period is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
 (iii) Own shares held by The Rightmove Employees’ Share T rust (EBT)
  The EBT is treated as an agent of Rightmove Group Limited, and as such EBT transactions are treated as being those of 
Rightmove Group Limited and are therefore reflected in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. In particular , at a 
consolidated level, the EBT’s purchases of shares in the Company are charged directly to equity.
 (iv) Own shares held by The Rightmove Share Incentive Plan T rust (SIP)
  The SIP is treated as an agent of Rightmove plc, and as such SIP transactions are treated as being those of Rightmove plc 
and are therefore reflected in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. In particular , at a consolidated level, the SIP’s 
purchases of shares in the Company are charged directly to equity.
 (v) National Insurance (NI) on share-based incentives
  Employer’s NI is accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when 
share-based incentives are exercised. In the case of share options, it is provided on the difference between the share price  
at the reporting date and the average exercise price of share options. In the case of nil cost performance shares and deferred 
shares, it is provided based on the share price at the reporting date.
(i) T reasury shares and shares purchased for cancellation
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable 
costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are either held in treasury or cancelled.
(j) Revenue
Revenue principally represents the amounts receivable from customers in respect of membership of the Rightmove platforms. 
Agency, New Homes, Overseas and Commercial revenue comprises subscriptions for core listing fees and amounts paid for 
additional advertising products. Contracts for these services are per branch location or branch equivalent for Agency and per 
development for New Homes. They vary in length from one month to five years, but are typically for periods of six to 12 months. 
Revenue is recognised over the period of the contract or as advertising products are used. Membership offers take place from time 
to time and may include discounted products and free periods. These are recognised on a monthly basis over the contract term.
Agency, Overseas and Commercial services are typically billed in advance with revenue deferred until the service commencement 
date. New Homes developers are billed monthly in arrears. Where invoices are raised on other than a monthly basis, the amounts 
are recognised as deferred or accrued revenue and released to the profit or loss on a monthly basis in line with the provision of 
services as stipulated in the contract terms.
Data Services revenue relates to fees generated for data and valuation services under a variety of contractual arrangements. 
Revenue is recognised when the service has been provided. Third party advertising revenue represents amounts paid in respect of 
non-property advertising on the Rightmove platforms and is recognised in the month in which the service is provided. Consumer 
Services revenue principally relates to payment for leads and is recognised when the lead is generated. Data Services, third party 
advertising and Consumer Services revenue is typically billed in arrears. rightmove.co.uk 94

(k) Segmental reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues  
and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components.  
An operating segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s Chief Executive Officer to make decisions about 
resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is available.
(l) Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The value of any lease 
incentive received, for example a rent-free period, is deferred and released on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(m) Financial income and expenses
Financial income comprises interest receivable on cash balances and money market deposits and dividend income. Interest 
income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised on the date that the 
Company’s right to receive payment is established.
Financial expenses comprise banking facility fees and bank charges and the unwinding of the discount on provisions.
(n) T axation
Income tax on the results for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to  
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period net of any charge or credit posted directly to  
equity, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of 
previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the 
initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other 
than in a business combination, and the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably  
not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised.
In accordance with IAS 12, the Group policy in relation to the recognition of deferred tax on share-based incentives is to include 
the income tax effect of the tax deduction in profit or loss to the value of the income tax charge on the cumulative IFRS 2 charge. 
The remainder of the income tax effect of the tax deduction is recognised in equity.
(o) Dividends
Dividends unpaid at the reporting date are only recognised as a liability (and deduction to equity) at that date to the extent that 
they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these 
criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
(p) Earnings per share (EPS)
The Group presents basic, diluted and underlying basic and diluted EPS data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by 
dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the year , adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to 
ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the 
effects of all potential dilutive instruments, which comprise share-based incentives granted to employees. The calculation of 
underlying basic and diluted EPS is disclosed in Note 11.

3 IFRSs not yet applied
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective for  
the year ended 31 December 2017 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was issued in 2014 and was endorsed by the EU in 2016. IFRS 15 establishes  
a comprehensive framework for determining whether , how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces existing revenue 
recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue. IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with 
early adoption permitted. The Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 in its financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018 
and to use the practical expedients for completed contracts. 
At present revenue is recognised either over time where there is continuing service provided by Rightmove to the customer or  
at the point in time when the risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer. Under IFRS 15 revenue will be recognised 
when performance obligations are satisfied. For the Group the transfer of control under IFRS 15 and satisfaction of performance 
obligations is over time. We have undertaken a detailed analysis of the impact of IFRS 15 on the Group which has shown that the 
recognition of revenue will be consistent with the transfer of risks and rewards to the customer under IAS 18. We have concluded 
following this assessment that the implementation of IFRS 15 will not have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 Leases was issued in January 2016, and was endorsed by the EU in 2017. IFRS 16 introduces a single on-balance sheet 
lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset 
and a corresponding lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-
term leases and leases of low value items. 
IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a 
Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of T ransactions Involving the Legal Form  
of a Lease. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted for 
entities that apply IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date of initial application of IFRS 16.
The Group has completed a detailed assessment to quantify the impact on its reported assets and liabilities of adoption of IFRS 
16. The Group will transition to IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective application approach with no restatement of prior year 
comparatives. On 1 January 2018 the Group expects to recognise new right-of-use assets of £10,730,000 and lease liabilities of 
£10,824,000 for its operating leases in respect of office premises and company cars. The nature of expenses related to those 
leases will also change as the straight-line operating lease expense will be replaced with a depreciation charge for right-of-use 
assets and interest expense on lease liabilities, in the first year of adoption these are expected to be approximately £1,775,000 
and £301,000 respectively. The Group plans to adopt IFRS 16 in its financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued in July 2014 and was endorsed by the EU in 2016. It replaces existing financial 
instruments guidance, including IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and the Group plans to adopt IFRS 9 in its financial statements for the year  
ending 31 December 2018. IFRS 9 will simplify the classification of financial assets for measurement purposes, but is not 
anticipated to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
Other amendments
There are no other new or amended standards expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
4 Risk and capital management
Overview
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• credit risk 
• liquidity risk 
• market risk
This note presents information about the Group and Company’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures 
are included throughout these consolidated financial statements. rightmove.co.uk 96
4 Risk and capital management continued
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. 
The primary method by which risks are monitored and managed by the Group is through the monthly Executive Management 
Committee, where any significant new risks or change in status to existing risks will be discussed and actions taken as appropriate.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk 
limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to 
reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and 
procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and 
obligations.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s internal controls and reviews the 
adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or banking institution fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group provides 
credit to customers in the normal course of business. The Group provides its services to a wide range of customers in the UK and 
overseas and therefore believes it has no material concentration of credit risk.
More than 88.0% (2016: 90.0%) of the Group’s Agency and New Homes customers pay via monthly direct debit, minimising the 
risk of non-payment. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in 
respect of trade and other receivables based on individually identified loss exposures.
The Group’s treasury policy is to monitor cash and deposit balances on a daily basis to ensure that no more than £30 million is 
held with any single institution.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities 
that are settled by delivering cash. The Group and Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that 
it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring 
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group’s revenue model is largely subscription-based, which results in a regular level of cash conversion allowing it to service 
working capital requirements.
The Group and Company ensure that they have sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses excluding the 
potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters. Throughout the year , 
the Group typically had sufficient cash on demand to meet operational expenses, before financing activities, for a period of 107 
days (2016: 95 days).
The Group agreed to extend a 12 month agreement with Barclays Bank plc for a £10,000,000 committed revolving loan facility. 
This agreement will expire on 12 February 2019.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange and interest rates will affect the Group’s income. 
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while 
optimising the return on risk.
 (i) Currency risk
  All of the Group’s sales and more than 95.0% (2016: 97.0%) of the Group’s purchases are Sterling denominated, accordingly it 
has no significant currency risk.
 (ii) Interest rate risk
  The Group and Company have no interest bearing financial liabilities. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash and 
money market deposit balances.

4 Risk and capital management continued
Capital management
The Board of directors’ policy is to maintain an efficient statement of financial position so as to maintain investor , creditor and 
market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board of directors considers that the future working 
capital and capital expenditure requirements of the Group will continue to be low and accordingly return on capital measures are 
not key performance targets. The Board of directors monitors the spread of the Company’s shareholders as well as underlying 
basic EPS. 
The Board’s policy is to return surplus capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks.
 (i) Dividend policy
  The Board of directors has a progressive dividend policy and monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders in 
relation to the growth in underlying basic EPS. The Board has adopted this policy in order to align shareholder returns with  
the underlying growth achieved in the profitability in the Group. 
  The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the level of available retained earnings  
in the Company, after deduction of own shares held, and the cash resources of the Group. The retained earnings of the 
Company, after deduction of own shares held, are £411,276,000 (2016: £405,801,000) as set out in the Company statement 
of changes in shareholders’ equity on page 88. The Group has cash and money market deposits at 31 December 2017 of  
£24,975,000 (2016: £17,775,000), the majority of which are held by the principal operating subsidiary Rightmove Group 
Limited. The Group is well positioned to fund its future dividends given the strong cash generative nature of the business  
and in 2017 cash generated from operating activities was £183,891,000 (2016: £169,250,000) representing an operating 
cash conversion in excess of 100%.
 (ii) Share buybacks
  The Company purchases its own shares in the market; the timing of these purchases depends on available free cash flow  
and market conditions. In 2017, 2,224,059  (2016: 2,251,711) shares were bought back and were cancelled at an average 
price of £40.83 (2016: £39.12).
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. Neither the Company nor any of its 
subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Group’s processes, 
personnel, technology and infrastructure, and from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those 
arising from legal and regulatory requirements and generally accepted standards of corporate behaviour. Operational risks arise 
from all of the Group’s operations.
The Group’s objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of financial losses and damage to the Group’s 
reputation with overall cost effectiveness and to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.
The primary responsibility for the development and implementation of controls to address operational risk is assigned to senior 
management within each business unit. This responsibility is supported by the development of overall Group standards for the 
management of operational risk in the following areas: 
•  requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorisation of transactions;
•  requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions; 
•  compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements;
•  documentation of controls and procedures;
•  requirements for the periodic assessment of operational risks faced and the adequacy of controls and procedures to address 
the risks identified;
•  requirements for reporting of operational losses and proposed remedial action;
•  development and regular testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans; 
•  regular testing of the security of the IT systems and platforms, regular backups of key data and ongoing threat monitoring to 
protect against the risk of cyber attack;
•  training and professional development; and
•  risk mitigation, including insurance where this is effective. rightmove.co.uk 98
5 Operating segments
The Group determines and presents operating segments based on internal information that is provided to the Chief Executive 
Officer , who is the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group’s reportable segments are as follows:
• The Agency segment which provides resale and lettings property advertising services on Rightmove’s platforms; and
•  T he New Homes segment which provides property advertising services to new home developers and housing associations  
on Rightmove’s platforms.
The Other segment which represents activities under the reportable segments threshold, comprises Overseas and Commercial 
property advertising services and non-property advertising services which include our third party advertising and Consumer 
Services as well as Data Services. Management monitors the business segments at a revenue and trade receivables level 
separately for the purpose of making decisions about resources to be allocated and of assessing performance. All revenue in 
both years is derived from third parties and there is no inter-segment revenue.
Operating costs, financial income, financial expenses and income taxes in relation to the Agency, New Homes and the Other 
segment are managed on a centralised basis at a Rightmove Group Limited level and as there are no internal measures of 
individual segment profitability, relevant disclosures have been shown under the heading of Central in the table below.
The Company has no reportable segments.

(2016: 19.8%). 
The difference between the standard rate and effective rate at 31 December 2017 of 0.2% (2016: 0.2%) is primarily attributable 
to an adjustment in respect of prior periods for research and development tax relief. rightmove.co.uk 102

which will be settled by ordinary shares held by the EBT , the SIP and shares held in treasury.

The average market value of the Group’s shares for the purposes of calculating the dilutive effect of share-based incentives was 
based on quoted market prices for the period during which the share-based incentives were outstanding.

11 Earnings per share (EPS) continued
Underlying EPS
Underlying EPS is calculated by taking basic earnings for the year and adding back the charge for share-based payments and the 
charge for NI on share-based incentives but without any adjustment to the tax charge in respect of these items. A reconciliation 
of the basic earnings for the year to the underlying earnings is presented below:

The 2016 final dividend paid on 2 June 2017 was £29,507,000 being £189,000 lower than that reported in the 2016 Annual 
Report, which was due to a decrease in the ordinary shares entitled to a dividend between 31 December 2016 and the final 
dividend record date of 5 May 2017.
The 2017 interim dividend paid on 3 November 2017 was £20,104,000 being £115,000 lower than that reported in the 2017  
Half Year Report, which was due to a decrease in the ordinary shares entitled to a dividend between 30 June 2017 and the  
interim dividend record date of 6 October 2017.
The terms of the EBT provide that dividends payable on the ordinary shares held by the EBT are waived. No provision was made 
for the final dividend in either year and there are no income tax consequences.

Impairment testing for cash generating units containing goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s Agency segment which represents the lowest level 
within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, which is not higher than the Group’s 
operating segments as reported in Note 5.
The carrying value of £2,465,000 goodwill, comprises £732,000 of purchased goodwill arising pre-transition to IFRS and 
£1,733,000 on acquisition of the Outside View. Goodwill arising from the acquisition of the Outside View has been allocated  
to the Agency segment as the revenue expected from the Outside View product is attributable to Agency customers.
Given the low level of significance of the total goodwill balance and strong growth in the Agency segment revenue in the year , 
with no impairment indicators present, the disclosures as required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets have not been made.

In 2008, the Company became the holding company of Rightmove Group Limited (formerly Rightmove plc, Company no. 3997679) 
and its subsidiaries pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement under s425 of the Companies Act 1985 by way of a share-for-share 
exchange. Following the Scheme of Arrangement, the Company underwent a court-approved capital reduction. The consolidated 
assets and liabilities of the Group immediately after the Scheme were substantially the same as the consolidated assets and 
liabilities of the Group immediately prior to the Scheme.
Following the capital reconstruction in 2008 all employees’ share-based incentives were transferred to the new holding company, 
Rightmove plc. In addition certain directors’ contracts of employment were transferred from Rightmove Group Limited to 
Rightmove plc, whilst all other employees remained employed by Rightmove Group Limited. Accordingly the share-based 
payments charge has been split between the Company and Rightmove Group Limited with £2,625,000 (2016: £1,738,000)  
being recognised in the Company accounts as a capital contribution to its subsidiary.

The decrease in the deferred tax asset relating to share-based incentives at 31 December 2017 is due to increased exercises of 
shares options in 2017 which has outweighed the number of new share scheme awards and the increase in the Company’s share 
price from £39.03 at 31 December 2016 to £45.00 at 31 December 2017.
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) was 
substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% (effective 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted 
on 6 September 2016. This will reduce the Group’s future tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2017 has 
been calculated at the rate of 19% which represents the average expected rate at which the net deferred tax asset will reverse in 
the future.

23 Reconciliation of movement in capital and reserves continued
(a) EBT shares reserve
This reserve represents the cost of own shares acquired by the EBT less any exercises of share-based incentives. 
At 31 December 2017, the EBT held 263,767 (2016: 343,275) ordinary shares in the Company of £0.01 each, representing 0.3% 
(2016: 0.4%) of the ordinary shares in issue (excluding shares held in treasury). The market value of the shares held in the EBT at 
31 December 2017 was £11,870,000 (2016: £13,398,000).
(b) SIP shares reserve (Group and Company)
In November 2014, the Company established the Rightmove Share Incentive Plan T rust (SIP). This reserve represents the cost  
of acquiring shares less any exercises or releases of SIP awards. Employees of the Group were offered 50 free shares (2016: 50), 
subject to a three year service period, with effect from 5 January 2018 (2016: 3 January 2017). 2,450 (2016: 600) shares were 
released by the SIP during the year in relation to good leavers and retirees. 20,000 (2016: 12,950) shares were transferred to the 
SIP reserve from the EBT.
At 31 December 2017 the SIP held 67,700 (2016: 50,150) ordinary shares in the Company of £0.01 each, representing 0.07% 
(2016: 0.05%) of the ordinary shares in issue (excluding shares held in treasury). The market value of the shares held in the SIP 
at 31 December 2017 was £3,047,000 (2016: £1,957,000). 
(c) T reasury shares (Group and Company)
This represents the cost of acquiring shares held in treasury less any exercises of share-based incentives. These shares were 
bought in 2008 at an average price of £4.76 and may be used to satisfy certain share-based incentive awards. An additional 6,277 
shares were issued as a result of rolled up dividend payments in relation to performance shares. 
Other reserves
This represents the Capital Redemption Reserve in respect of own shares bought back and cancelled. The movement of £22,000 
(2016: £22,000) is the nominal value of ordinary shares cancelled during the year.
Retained earnings
The loss on the exercise of share-based incentives of £1,485,000 (2016: £7,000 gain) is the difference between the value that the 
shares held by the EBT , SIP and treasury shares were originally acquired at and the exercise price at which share-based incentives 
were exercised or released during the year. Details of share buybacks and cancellation of shares are included in Note 22.
Company
Reverse acquisition reserve
This reserve resulted from the acquisition of Rightmove Group Limited by the Company and represents the difference between 
the value of the shares acquired at 28 January 2008 and the nominal value of the shares issued.
Other reserves
Awards relating to share-based incentives made to Rightmove Group Limited employees have been treated as a deemed capital 
contribution. The principal movement in other reserves for the year comprises £2,625,000 (2016: £1,738,000) in respect of the 
share-based incentives charge for employees of Rightmove Group Limited.
In addition, other reserves include £361,000 (2016: £339,000) of Capital Redemption Reserve. A movement of £22,000 
(2016: £22,000) has been recorded in relation to the nominal value of ordinary shares cancelled during the year. rightmove.co.uk 112
24 Share-based payments
The Group and Company operate a number of share-based incentive schemes for executive directors and employees. 
All share-based incentives are subject to a service condition. Such conditions are not taken into account in the fair value of the 
service received. The fair value of services received in return for share-based incentives is measured by reference to the fair value 
of share-based incentives granted. The estimate of the fair value of the share-based incentives is measured using either the 
Monte Carlo or Black Scholes pricing model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
The Group recognised a total share-based payments charge for the year of £4,836,000 (2016: £4,142,000) with a Company 
charge for the year of £2,211,000 (2016: £2,404,000), as set out below:

Sharesave Plan
The Group operates an HMRC Approved Sharesave Plan under which employees are granted an option to purchase ordinary 
shares in the Company at up to 20% less than the market price at invitation, in three years’ time, dependent on their entering into 
a contract to make monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period. These funds are used to fund the 
option exercise. No performance criteria are applied to the exercise of Sharesave options. The assumptions used in the 
measurement of the fair value at grant date of the Sharesave Plan are as follows:
         Employee 
          turnover  
         before vesting/ 
   Share price Exercise Expected Option Risk free Dividend non-vesting Fair value  
   at grant date price volatility life rate yield condition per option

Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility at the grant date.
The requirement that an employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave Plan is a non-vesting condition. 
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the Black 
Scholes pricing model. The discount has been determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based 
on expected future trends in the share price and past employee behaviour.

Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The PSP permits awards of nil cost options or contingent shares which will only vest in the event of prior satisfaction of a 
performance condition.
34,720 PSP awards were made on 1 March 2017 (the Grant Date) subject to Earnings Per Share (EPS) and T otal Shareholders 
Return (TSR) performance. A further 3,457 awards were made to Peter Brooks-Johnson on 9 May 2017 to bring his 2017 PSP 
award in line with his Chief Executive Officer salary. Performance for all 2017 awards will be measured over three financial years 
(1 January 2017 – 31 December 2019). The vesting in March and May 2020 (Vesting Date) of 25% of the 2017 PSP award will  
be dependent on a relative TSR performance condition measured over a three year performance period and the vesting of the 
75% of the 2017 PSP award will be dependent on the satisfaction of an EPS growth target measured over a three year 
performance period. 
The PSP awards have been valued using the Monte Carlo model for the TSR element and the Black Scholes model for the EPS 
element and the resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the three year period between Grant Date 
and Vesting Date. PSP award holders are entitled to receive dividends accruing between the Grant Date and the Vesting Date and 
this value will be delivered in shares. The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the PSP awards 
are as follows:

Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSP)
In March 2009 a DSP was established which allows executive directors and other selected senior management the opportunity  
to earn a bonus determined as a percentage of base salary settled in nil cost deferred shares. The award of shares under the plan 
is contingent on the satisfaction of pre-set internal targets relating to underlying drivers of long-term revenue growth (the 
Performance Period). The right to the shares is deferred for two years from the date of the award (the Vesting Period) and 
potentially forfeitable during that period should the employee leave employment. The deferred share awards have been valued 
using the Black Scholes model and the resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the combined 
Performance Period and Vesting Period of the shares, being three years.
The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value of the deferred share awards are calculated at the date on which  
the potential DSP bonus is communicated to directors and senior management (the grant date) as follows:
         Employee

Share Incentive Plan
In 2014, the Group established the Rightmove Share Incentive Plan T rust (SIP). Employees were offered 50 shares (2016: 50) as a 
gift, subject to a three year service period (the Vesting Period). The SIP awards have been valued using the Black Scholes model 
and the resulting share-based payments charge spread evenly over the Vesting Period of three years. The SIP shareholders are 
entitled to dividends paid in cash over the Vesting Period. No performance criteria are applied to the exercise of SIP options.  
The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the SIP awards are as follows:
