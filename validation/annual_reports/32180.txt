Where we operate 
The business has traditionally focused 
on East London, but the need for new 
homes is so great that we have recently 
expanded our horizons across a wider area. 
Telford Homes is skilled in all aspects of 
London development and we can apply our 
knowledge and expertise to a wider range  
of opportunities in new boroughs. 
We develop in non-prime locations to 
maintain an affordable price point for our 
individual customers and our strategic move 
into build to rent provides scope to work 
with investment partners across London.

05 Performance
Notwithstanding some uncertainty created by 
the outcome of the EU referendum, we have 
experienced robust demand for our homes from 
individual investors and owner-occupiers. Our ability 
to deliver forward sold homes to our customers 
on programme, together with a step change in our 
presence in the build to rent sector, saw Telford 
Homes achieving excellent results for the year to 
31 March 2017.  I am particularly pleased that we 
achieved a 99 per cent customer recommendation 
rate in 2016, a notable endorsement of our 
commitment to quality and service. 
Since February 2016 we have exchanged contracts 
on four significant build to rent transactions with 
a range of investors, indicative of our growing 
reputation in the sector as a trusted delivery partner.  
Along with monitoring external influences on the 
Group, the development of our build to rent strategy 
has been one of the principal areas of focus for 
the Board this year.  This sector complements our 
historic focus on individual sales to investors and 
owner-occupiers and is well aligned with our forward 
selling philosophy.  The attractive return on capital 
and lower risk profile associated with build to rent 
'We are well positioned to continue the growth of Telford 
Homes thanks to the strength of our performance in the 
undersupplied non-prime London housing market and  
our increasing activity in the build to rent sector.' 
Andrew Wiseman
Chairman
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
DEVELOPING IN LONDON: 
A STRONG PERFORMANCE
will facilitate accelerated growth for Telford Homes, 
although the Board remains mindful of ensuring  
the business grows in a controlled manner in order 
that our high standards of operational performance 
are upheld.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to declare a final dividend 
of 8.5 pence per share, making a total of 15.7 
pence per share for the year, an increase of just 
over 10 per cent compared with the previous 
year (2016: 14.2 pence).  Our policy is to pay one 
third of earnings as dividends in each financial 
year.  For the year to 31 March 2017 however, 
the Board has fulfilled its promise to increase the 
dividend payment above that level in order to offset 
the dilution in earnings resulting from the equity 
placing in late 2015.  Therefore, the interim dividend 
together with the full year dividend equates to 
over 40 per cent of earnings for this financial year.  
The final dividend will be paid on 14 July 2017 to 
those shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 16 June 2017.  The ex-dividend date is 
therefore 15 June 2017.
Culture and values
I have always been proud of the single team culture 
and strong values of Telford Homes.  In the last year 
we have recruited talented people from outside 
of the business at levels not seen previously.  As 
Telford Homes continues to grow and our strategy 
evolves, there is a need to ensure that the culture 
that has made the business so successful to date is 
preserved, yet able to adapt to the requirements of a 
larger organisation.  For this reason, the Group plans 
to review its corporate vision, mission and values 
during 2017 to ensure these reflect the evolving 
position of the business and allow us to capitalise  
on the opportunities that lie ahead.
06 In a year that has seen strong operational growth, our 
admirable health and safety record merits mention.  
Health and safety is the first item on the agenda at 
monthly Board meetings and our performance is 
testament to the sound policies and procedures 
in place, as well as the deep-rooted sense of 
responsibility that pervades the organisation.
Another core principle in our approach is the 
emphasis placed upon sustainability.  Although 
this has been a consideration in the Group’s way of 
operating for some years, following the appointment 
in 2016 of a Head of Sustainability, the philosophy  
has been formalised into our ‘Building a Living 
Legacy’ strategy.  A number of core targets have 
been established within this strategy and we are 
committed to achieving these in the coming years.
Outlook 
I am delighted to be able to look back on another 
excellent year, and, on behalf of the Board, I wish 
to thank all our employees for their hard work in 
delivering these results.  I am excited by the strength 
of our development pipeline and the promising 
opportunities that lie ahead for Telford Homes to 
play an increasing role in meeting the need for new 
homes in London.

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION Economic outlook
London’s economic growth has outpaced that 
of the rest of the UK for the last ten years, with 
the exception of 2009 to 2010 (see chart 1), 
and it is projected that London will remain the 
fastest growing region, although its pace of 
expansion could reduce from around 2.5 per 
cent in 2015 to an average of just under 2 per 
cent in 2017-18. 
The economic environment is proving to be 
robust and the economy has performed better 
than expected post the EU referendum vote, 
with the housing market remaining resilient.
Demand and population 
growth in London  
There has been consistent, long term growth 
in London’s population (see chart 2). This has 
led to ever growing demand for housing in the 
capital which has not been matched by the 
number of homes built. 
Over the past few years there has been a 
recovery in the housing market driven by wider 
economic recovery, increased access to low 
cost mortgage financing, improved availability 
of land through the planning process and 
Government support for the housing sector. 
These remain key drivers for the market over 
the longer term with the outlook strong in the 
near term.
The immediate impact of the EU referendum in 
June 2016 was relatively short-lived, with the 
widespread positive attitude adopted within 
the UK maintaining consumer and business 
confidence.  However, the medium term 
impact of the referendum as exit terms are 
negotiated is yet to be seen.
‘With prices high in 
central boroughs, 
the search for value 
and for higher price 
growth prospects in 
recent years has led 
to a surge in demand 
in Outer London 
locations. These 
characteristics are 
being sought by both 
owner-occupiers 
and investors and we 
expect this trend to 
escalate over the next 
five years.’

The principal driver of the London housing market remains the 
chronic imbalance between supply and demand and this is 
particularly the case at Telford Homes’ typical price point.  
Housing starts reduced in 2016, further exacerbating the situation.
MARKET OVERVIEW
DEVELOPING IN LONDON: 
FAVOURABLE FUNDAMENTALS
08 Housing starts reduce
There were circa 17,000 new build starts in 
London for the year to June 2016, down from 
around 25,000 in 2015 (see chart 3). This was 
the lowest level since 2012 and intensifies the 
cumulative deficit built up over decades.  
Tax changes 
The move to a tiered system of Stamp Duty 
Land Tax (SDLT) in recent years has assisted 
the majority of the Group’s customers because 
Telford Homes’ typical price point is lower than 
the £925,000 threshold where higher rates are 
now payable.  However, legislation introduced 
on 1 April 2016 increased by three per cent 
the SDLT payable by purchasers of buy-to-let 
or second homes.  This has led to many UK-
based investors becoming more circumspect 
about new purchases, although overseas 
buyers have been less deterred, with the fall in 
the value of sterling since the EU referendum 
undoubtedly a factor.  Build to rent investors 
factor SDLT into their acquisition model prior 
to any offer to purchase being made.
Changes have also been introduced to 
mortgage interest tax relief for investors. Prior 
to April 2017, landlords could deduct mortgage 
interest and other finance-related costs from 
their rental income before calculating their tax 
liability. This relief will be removed gradually 
between 2017 and 2020, although a ‘tax 
credit’ worth 20 per cent of the mortgage 
interest cost will remain allowable.
Increasing rental demand 
Affordability of housing in London is 
challenging. In 2016, seven of the ten least 
affordable local authority locations in the UK 
were in London. Unsurprisingly therefore 
the number of households renting homes 
in London has increased by 450,000 in 
the last 10 years.  The increase in average 
private rents in London relative to the rest of 
England is indicative of the demand for rented 
accommodation in the capital (see chart 4).   
Government support 
The Housing White Paper published in 
February 2017 seeks to address some of the 
issues that have inhibited housing supply. 
Proposals including accelerating the planning 
process, making available more development 
land and supporting SME builders in order to 
build sector capacity are encouraging. 
The planning regime has historically been a 
key constraint on the housebuilding industry’s 
ability to provide the number of new homes 
needed to keep pace with demand. Approval 
rates have improved over the last few years 
since the introduction of the National Planning 
Policy Framework, although the process to 
obtain planning permission and discharge 
conditions can remain arduous, with the 
shortage of local authority planning officers  
a key factor. 
The Government’s Help to Buy scheme now 
provides an equity loan of up to 40 per cent 
in London and this has further increased the 
number of potential customers who can benefit 
at price points up to £600,000. Whilst the 
scheme remains available it will assist many 
people to own their own home in London who 
otherwise could not raise enough finance.
Outlook
Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, 
particularly in relation to the outcome of 
the EU referendum, market fundamentals 
remain favourable. The attraction of London, 
as evidenced by its growing population 
and shortage of housing supply points to a 
continuing need for new homes, particularly 
in the locations and at the price points that 
Telford Homes develops.

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION There is a chronic shortage of new homes in London. Our goal is to grow Telford 
Homes over the next five years to help address this shortage. This will involve 
doubling our output of homes in one of the world’s greatest cities.
Our ambition
Our strategy
In the last few years we have been 
able to achieve enhanced returns 
by deploying our resources on 
larger development sites. We have 
increased our minimum site size 
threshold to focus our land  
buying accordingly.
We are improving our access to 
land opportunities and increasing 
the potential for new relationships 
by enlarging our target area of 
operation within London.  We have 
the knowledge and expertise to 
successfully develop in new boroughs.
We continue to manage the 
development pipeline to ensure our 
average price point remains affordable 
to potential owner-occupiers, investors 
and their tenants. The average price of 
the open market homes in our current 
pipeline is £527 ,000.

We have a clear plan to achieve our ambition of doubling our 
output of homes, underpinned by a philosophy of operating 
responsibly and efficiently.
AMBITION AND STRATEGY
DEVELOPING IN LONDON:  
DRIVING OUR GROWTH PLANS
12 We have always de-risked significant 
developments by securing forward 
sales early in the development 
process. This strategy has 
positioned the business well in 
economic downturns and increased 
our access to finance.
We have developed our sustainability 
strategy ‘Building a Living 
Legacy’ and recruited a Head of 
Sustainability to drive implementation 
across the business. The core 
priorities and targets are described 
on page 38.  
Selling homes to build to rent 
investors has been a significant 
change in our strategy since the 
start of 2016. Build to rent delivers 
enhanced capital returns and can 
accelerate our growth whilst also 
reducing our reliance on debt.

14 Performance
I am delighted to report record levels of revenue and 
profit for the year to 31 March 2017 . Pre-tax profits 
continued to increase, reaching £34.1 million (2016: 
£32.2 million), slightly ahead of the level anticipated at 
the beginning of the year due to more open market 
completions in the second half of the year and 
additional build to rent profit recognition. The gross 
margin before interest charges of 22.3 per cent and the 
operating margin before interest of 13.4 per cent were 
in line with expectations. Both reflect the increasing 
mix between developments sold to individual buyers 
and build to rent transactions secured at lower margins 
in exchange for enhanced capital returns.
Despite uncertainty in relation to the outcome of the 
EU referendum and tax changes impacting primarily 
UK based individual investors, our underlying market 
has remained resilient. Any potential dampening effect 
of these factors has been outweighed by the structural 
imbalance between supply and need for new homes 
in London, particularly at our typical price point.
'In addition to strong financial results for the year to  
31 March 2017, our growing reputation as a build to rent 
partner is unlocking an exciting source of future growth.'
Jon Di-Stefano
Chief Executive
CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW
DEVELOPING IN LONDON:  
A POSITIVE OUTLOOK
Our forward selling strategy continues to be at 
the heart of our model. We sell homes early in the 
development cycle as a means of de-risking projects 
and advancing investment into new opportunities. 
This means that trading activity undertaken in each 
financial year will typically deliver revenue and profit 
over the following two to three years, giving the 
Board substantial visibility over future profit levels 
and expected cash flows. We receive deposits when 
contracts are exchanged for individual properties 
and, as at 31 March 2017, £68.1 million of deposits 
had been taken in advance of future completions. 
This additional funding supports further investment 
in the development pipeline and reduces the need to 
draw down debt finance. We start the financial year 
with a substantial order book of forward sales of 
£546 million (1 April 2016: £579 million). This secure 
and de-risked position is underpinning our stated 
expectations for growth over the next few years.
Following some recent land acquisitions, our 
development pipeline stands at £1.5 billion of future 
revenue and represents more than five times the 
revenue generated in the year to 31 March 2017. The 
average anticipated price of the open market homes 
within the pipeline is £527,000 (2016: £513,000). 
This is in line with our model of seeking non-prime 
opportunities where the average sales price is below 
£1,000 per square foot, and hence the majority of 
homes are priced between £350,000 and £700,000.
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW
In February 2017, we added to the pipeline with 
the acquisition of a sizeable development site, the 
former London Electricity Board (LEB) building on 
Cambridge Heath Road, E2 for £30.2 million. The 
anticipated gross development value of the site is 
approximately £95.0 million. Subject to planning 
consent, we expect to start work on site in 2018 and 
to finish in 2021. Post year end we have exchanged 
contracts to acquire Stone Studios in Hackney 
Wick for 120 homes plus commercial space, and 
have been selected as the preferred partner of the 
London Borough of Brent to develop 236 homes in 
South Kilburn. Both sites have full planning consent 
and we expect to start on site later this year.
Customer mix
The Group’s customer mix for the year to 31 March 
2017 has moved significantly towards institutional 
build to rent investors, with this sector representing 
77 per cent of sales generated (2016: 24 per cent) 
compared with individual investors from the UK and 
overseas at 20 per cent (2016: 69 per cent) and 
owner-occupiers at three per cent (2016: seven per 
cent). In total, including build to rent transactions, 
we exchanged contracts for the sale of 501 open 
market properties in the year to 31 March 2017 
(2016: 463).

16 Individual open market sales
As our build to rent business has grown, and we 
have continued to pursue our forward sales strategy, 
we have naturally seen lower numbers of sales to 
owner-occupiers. Unless they are cash buyers, 
owner-occupiers are typically unable to purchase 
more than six months ahead of completion. 
However, there is clearly significant demand from 
this part of the market and over the last few weeks 
we have had a very encouraging response to the 
launch of the residual availability at Bermondsey 
Works leading to 22 owner-occupier reservations, 
20 of which are being purchased under the 
Government’s Help to Buy scheme.
We have seen robust demand from individual 
investors underpinned by a thriving rental market 
primarily caused by an imbalance between supply 
and demand for rental properties at the right price 
point. Amongst these sales it is pleasing to see 
a number of repeat purchasers, who often opt 
to wait for the launch of the next Telford Homes 
development rather than investing elsewhere. In 
the 2016 calendar year, we achieved a 99 per cent 
customer recommendation rate, an outstanding 
performance that sustains the high levels achieved 
in previous years (2015: 99 per cent).
Our last significant launch to individual investors was 
the second phase of City North, Finsbury Park, in 
November 2016, which secured 73 new sales for a 
combined value of over £43 million. The success of 
this is evidence that high quality homes in desirable 
locations remain sought after by investors across the 
world. Subsequent to City North, developments that 
could have been more widely launched for sale have 
instead been sold to build to rent investors as part of 
our new strategic focus. Notwithstanding this we are 
confident that there remains a healthy market for our 
typical product from individual buyers.
Build to rent
We have increased our presence in the London build 
to rent sector over the last year. Since February 2016 
we have entered into four build to rent transactions 
comprising of nearly 500 homes, together worth 
over £230 million. Telford Homes is a valued 
partner to large-scale investors, given our record in 
delivering complex residential projects, and we are 
proud to have become recognised as a significant 
build to rent developer in such a short space of time. 
In December 2016, we exchanged contracts for the 
sale of The Forge, Redclyffe Road, E6 to M&G Real 
Estate. The sale consisted of the freehold interest 
in the land and construction of 125 homes for a 
net consideration of £48.6 million. This was our 
third build to rent transaction, and the second with 
M&G. At the end of March 2017 our joint venture, 
Chobham Farm North LLP, exchanged contracts 
on our fourth significant build to rent transaction. 
Contracts were exchanged for the sale of 112 of the 
297 open market homes at New Garden Quarter, 
Stratford E15, for a net consideration of £53.7 
million. The sale, to a subsidiary of our joint venture 
partner Notting Hill Housing Group, was for the first 
phase of open market homes at this development 
and removed the need for third party debt finance.
As we have previously reported we are actively 
looking into establishing longer term relationships 
with build to rent investors. We anticipate that this 
type of partnership will enable Telford Homes to 
buy land with a secured build to rent sale already 
in place subject to any planning requirements. This 
will bring focus to our acquisition of build to rent 
opportunities, allowing us to move swiftly to secure 
sites and to take advantage of an increased desire 
for purpose built rental homes from local councils 
and the Mayor of London.

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION Market context
The principal market developments in the year have 
been a level of nervousness created by the outcome 
of the EU referendum and tax changes, namely the 
three per cent stamp duty surcharge on second 
properties and the phased removal of tax relief on 
mortgage interest. The potentially negative impact of 
these factors on our performance has been mitigated 
by the chronic imbalance between the supply of 
and need for homes in London. Our business model 
of developing homes that people can afford to 
either buy or rent is built upon this fundamental and 
longstanding driver of demand.
Although the EU referendum result created a degree 
of uncertainty, this has not to date been a significant 
cause for concern for the Group. We chose to defer 
launches for a short period while the immediate 
furore died down, something that our focus on 
forward selling allows us the flexibility to do. Demand 
remained buoyant however and neither have we seen 
significant pressure on labour availability or materials 
due to the result, especially as there has not been a 
dramatic increase in the supply of homes in London. 
We will continue to monitor the negotiations with 
the EU, looking for stability throughout the process 
and assurances as soon as possible on the rights of 
EU workers to remain in the UK. We consider that 
these are already vital considerations for both sides, 
which supports our confidence in continuing with our 
current strategy for growth.
The shift of our business model towards build to 
rent has helped to cushion us from the impact of 
the tax changes. In any case sales to overseas 
investors have remained robust, evidenced by the 
launches of the Liberty Building just over a year 
ago and more recently City North. We have seen 
particular success over the last three years in selling 
to investors based in China. This is despite any 
potential tempering of demand in relation to leaving 
the EU or the additional three per cent stamp duty, 
both of which have been offset for some buyers by 
favourable movements in exchange rates.
We have, however, seen a reduction in the number 
of UK based individuals seeking to invest in buy-
to-let properties. These investors have been more 
sensitive than overseas buyers to the uncertainty 
resulting from the EU referendum, and have also 
been deterred by the increase in stamp duty and the 
reducing ability to benefit from tax relief on mortgage 
interest. Despite these tax changes the attractive 
rental yields that are bringing institutional investors 
into the market should also encourage individuals to 
invest again once their confidence returns.
Objectives and strategy
Our primary objective is to build more homes in 
London and to grow in a controlled manner to meet 
some of the shortfall between supply and need in the 
capital. We are on track to achieve our stated ambition 
to generate significant growth in pre-tax profits over 
the next two years, and also to create a platform for 
sustaining a bigger business that can continue to  
grow in the longer term.
Our strategic priority is to further increase our activity 
in the build to rent sector. Our business is very capital 
intensive and this restricts our rate of growth if we are 
relying on our own sources of capital. A key attraction 
of build to rent is that forward funded developments 
do not require much, if any, of our equity, nor any 
debt finance. This allows us to accelerate the growth 
of the business, provided we have the operational 
capacity to do so, and to combine that with reducing 
our longer term reliance on debt.
As well as the focus on increasing our presence in 
build to rent, we are expanding our geographical 
reach beyond our historical heartland of boroughs 
in the East of London. We still expect to operate 
in our key boroughs, but as the business grows 
in scale we are looking to broaden the spread of 
individual sale and build to rent opportunities. An 
example of this in action is the South Kilburn site in 
partnership with Brent, a borough in which we have 
not previously developed. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW
18 We do not expect Help to Buy to become as 
fundamental to Telford Homes as it is to many other 
developers, but it will help us to maintain support for 
those who still wish to purchase their own home.
We are planning dedicated sales centres on more of our 
sites, working together with our central sales location in 
Stratford. In these instances, including at Bow Garden 
Square, St Pauls Way, E3 and the remainder of New 
Garden Quarter, we will be commencing sales much 
later in the development process than would normally 
be the case. We expect this to bring a healthy balance 
to our overall sales mix ensuring that we are able to 
flexibly adjust to any future demand changes across  
our various customer segments.
In the last 12 months we have taken a big step 
forward in terms of our commitment to sustainability. 
We now have a Head of Sustainability and a fully-
fledged strategy, ‘Building a Living Legacy’, including 
a commitment to achieving a range of targets over 
the next seven years. 
We believe our skillset can be deployed to develop 
homes across London, maintaining a strong pipeline 
of developments for individual buyers in non-prime 
locations and for build to rent investors.
Another decision that has resulted from our 
increased scale is to target larger sites, typically 
of 50 or more units, in order to secure economies 
of scale. This also fits with the minimum scale of 
investment for most build to rent investors and 
ensures we are not spending time on smaller sites 
that historically contribute much less to profits and 
disproportionately take up operational capacity.
Having a solid foundation of forward sold properties 
now allows us the flexibility to hold back some open 
market homes until later in the development time 
frame, should we wish to take advantage of an active 
owner-occupier market, supported in some instances 
by Help to Buy. We have seen recent success with 
Help to Buy at Bermondsey Works, having held back 
the residual availability with that objective.

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION We anticipate that over the next few years build to 
rent could represent as much as half of our total 
revenue pipeline. 
The Board is comfortable with the development 
pipeline, and we have avoided acquiring land at 
inflated prices. We have equity and debt available 
to add to the pipeline, and will do this where 
opportunities are consistent with our strategy and 
meet our financial hurdles. Prospects spanning 
a variety of locations are being evaluated on an 
ongoing basis and in greater numbers than in 2016. 
This, together with the successful tenders for our 
recent acquisitions, is encouraging in terms of 
securing access to our most important raw material.
We are confident in our product and market place 
as we look to the future. Over 80 per cent of the 
anticipated gross profit for the year to 31 March 2018 
has been secured, and Telford Homes is on track to 
deliver over £40 million of profit before tax. In addition, 
for the year to 31 March 2019, we have secured over 
60 per cent of the anticipated gross profit and expect 
profit before tax to exceed £50 million.
The strength of our performance and outlook are 
testament to the hard work and commitment of 
everyone at Telford Homes. I am proud of our way  
of working, our exemplary rate of employee retention 
and our excellent health and safety record and all 
the more so in view of the exceptional growth we 
have achieved in the last few years. I want to thank 
everyone that makes Telford Homes a special place 
to work and I look forward to another exciting period 
of growth ahead.

These targets address economic, social and 
environmental aspects of building a sustainable 
business for the benefit of all our stakeholders.  
You can read more about this on page 38.
Ever mindful of needing to work as efficiently as 
possible, we have increased our adoption of modern 
methods of construction to speed up the delivery of 
certain developments, something the Government 
has been encouraging the sector to do. Not only is 
this beneficial to our customers and investors but 
it also improves our return on capital. Examples 
include the off-site construction of brick cladding at 
our Manhattan Plaza development and the use of a 
lightweight metal frame structure at The Pavilions, one 
of our build to rent schemes. Along with the rest of the 
industry, we will be looking at how we can increase 
the use of these methods and others to deliver homes 
more quickly and efficiently.
More detail on our strategy is available on page 12.
Outlook
We anticipate that the lack of supply of new homes 
relative to need in non-prime areas of London 
will continue to provide ample opportunity for the 
growth of Telford Homes in the foreseeable future. 
Our increased focus on build to rent, with de-risked 
sales requiring reduced levels of equity and no debt 
finance, allows us to evaluate ways to grow at a 
faster rate. Although build to rent projects generate a 
moderately lower net margin, our return on capital is 
much improved and longer term debt requirements 
will be lower.
We expect to continue our successes in the build to 
rent sector due to the increasing appetite of a range 
of potential investors. In particular, we will pursue 
longer term partnerships whilst also maintaining an 
awareness of other opportunities.

21 Presentation of joint ventures
In the year to 31 March 2015, the Group adopted 
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ which states 
that joint ventures should be accounted for as 
equity investments rather than by proportional 
consolidation. The Group’s joint ventures are 
an integral part of the business and as such 
the Board believes that the financial results are 
most appropriately presented using proportional 
consolidation which means including the relevant 
share of the results of joint ventures in each line 
of the income statement and balance sheet. This 
therefore remains the method of presentation within 
the Group’s internal management accounts.
The Board has prepared an income statement and 
a balance sheet using proportional consolidation 
along with Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (GAAP) compliant versions presenting 
joint ventures as equity investments. The key 
performance indicators and other figures within this 
report include the Group’s share of joint venture 
results. The Board suggests investors follow its lead 
in assessing the business on the results that include 
a proportional share of joint ventures. 
Operating results
Revenue, including the Group’s share of joint 
ventures, has increased to a record £291.9 million 
(2016: £245.6 million), up 18.9 per cent on the prior 
year. On a GAAP basis, excluding the Group’s share 
of joint ventures, revenue increased to £266.0 million  
(2016: £242.7 million).
The Group has seen success in forward selling 
homes through traditional channels but has also 
increased its focus and prominence in the London 
build to rent sector, entering into three more build  
to rent contracts in the year. The Group has 
continued to invest in land and work in progress  
but still has substantial headroom within its  
£180 million revolving credit facility available  
to achieve its aspirations of increasing profit  
to over £50 million by March 2019.

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION The number of open market residential completions 
was lower than the prior year at 289 (2016: 482), 
however the average selling price was higher 
at £531,000 (2016: £417,000). The reduction in 
completions is purely down to availability of finished 
stock with fewer units physically available to 
handover in the current financial year. Similarly, the 
increase in average price is a function of the mix of 
developments completing in each year in terms of 
product and their location together with relatively 
modest sales price inflation.
The reduction in revenue from open market 
completions was more than offset by an increase 
in both subsidised affordable housing revenue and 
build to rent revenue recognised in the year. In 
the year to 31 March 2017, the Group exchanged 
contracts to deliver 400 affordable homes (2016: 
87 homes) and entered into three new build to rent 
contracts to deliver 387 build to rent homes (2016: 
156 homes) over the next few years.
The Group continues to recognise revenue from the 
sale of affordable homes and build to rent homes 
under contract accounting on a percentage of 
completion basis throughout the build programme. 
Revenue recognised from affordable housing was 
£50.1 million (2016: £19.1 million) and from build 
to rent contracts it was £76.5 million (2016: £19.9 
million). This includes the new contracts exchanged 
during the year together with the ongoing profit 
recognition on contracts exchanged in previous 
years.
The increased focus on build to rent will, over time, 
result in a greater proportion of the Group’s revenue 
and profit being recognised on a percentage of 
completion basis over the life of the development 
as opposed to individual open market sales where 
revenue and profit which is recognised at the  
point of legal completion. Build to rent sales can 
therefore result in the Group recognising revenue 
and profit earlier than if the homes had been sold  
to individual purchasers.
A further advantage of build to rent sales is that they 
are forward funded by the investors and therefore 
they offer exceptional returns on capital. 
THE JUNCTION E1
FINANCIAL REVIEW
  Completed residential development of 42 apartments
  Close to St. Katharine Docks and the River Thames
  Land originally purchased from Eastend Homes
24 Forward funding broadly means an initial payment 
reimbursing the cost of the land followed by monthly 
construction payments and finally a payment on 
completion. As such very little, if any, equity is 
used during construction and no debt is required. 
In return for these benefits the Group is accepting 
a moderately reduced net margin on build to rent 
contracts with a lower sale price being partly offset 
by savings in selling expenses and interest costs.
During the year to 31 March 2017, the Group sold 
one small undeveloped site for £5.0 million. Similar 
to the two sites sold in the prior year for a total 
of £6.7 million, this sale is a result of a change in 
strategic direction where smaller sites have become 
less attractive to build out and the Group is able to 
leverage its greater operational size to focus on larger 
scale developments. The Group has also continued 
its programme of disposing of older freehold assets, 
generating revenue of £4.9 million (2016: £1.7 million).
Gross profit has increased to £63.2 million from 
£63.1 million, including the Group’s share of joint 
ventures. Gross profit is stated after expensing loan 
interest that has been capitalised within inventories 
of £1.9 million (2016: £1.9 million) and, before 
charging this interest, the gross margin was 22.3 per 
cent compared to 26.5 per cent last year.
The decrease in gross profit margin was as expected 
with two main reasons for the reduction. Firstly, the 
margin achieved on open market sale completions 
of 25.4 per cent was lower than that achieved last 
year (2016: 27.3 per cent) but slightly ahead of the 
Group’s target when appraising new sites of 24 per 
cent. The margin recognised on open market homes 
is expected to trend down towards the target margin 
over time as older developments which benefitted 
from more significant sales price inflation and minimal 
build cost inflation are replaced with sites appraised 
more recently.
Secondly, a greater proportion of the revenue this 
year is generated from build to rent contracts which 
attract a lower gross margin to compensate for the 
advantages of being forward funded and for savings 
in selling expenses and interest costs. The Group 
expects build to rent transactions to achieve a gross 
margin of approximately 12 to 13 per cent which 
represents the normal target margin of 24 per cent 
less savings in selling expenses and interest costs of 
circa eight per cent and therefore a net difference of 
up to four per cent offset by a substantially improved 
return on capital. The margin achieved on the build 
to rent revenue recognised in the year to 31 March 
2017 was well ahead of that target at 16.0 per cent 
due to some of the land being purchased at more 
advantageous rates prior to becoming part of the 
build to rent portfolio. Future build to rent margins are 
still expected to be around 12 to 13 per cent.
Administrative expenses have increased to £20.8 
million (2016: £19.3 million) including the Group’s 
share of joint ventures and £20.7 million excluding joint 
ventures (2016: £19.1 million). This increase is mainly 
due to higher employee costs as the Group continues 
to recruit and reward the talent required to establish 
a structure appropriate for growth. As a percentage 
of revenue administrative expenses remain consistent 
year on year at circa seven per cent.
Selling expenses have reduced significantly to £5.1 
million (2016: £9.4 million) including the Group’s 
share of joint ventures and £4.1 million excluding the 
Group’s share of joint ventures (2016: £9.2 million). 
This reduction is partly due to the lower number 
of open market completions but also reflects the 
Group’s move towards build to rent, which has 
reduced the number of homes available to sell 
on the open market. During the year, there was 
only one significant launch, City North, incurring 
selling expenses of £0.9 million, compared to three 
launches in the previous year which resulted in 
combined selling expenses of £4.5 million. The 
homes sold under the three build to rent contracts 
entered into during the year would previously have 
been anticipated to be sold on the open market at 
some point over the next few years and therefore 
the build to rent transactions will generate significant 
sales cost savings over the same period.
The Group’s operating margin, calculated before 
interest and the costs associated with the United 
House acquisition in the prior year, reduced to 13.4 
per cent (2016: 15.0 per cent). This reduction is due 
to the increased proportion of build to rent profit 
this year which also generates interest cost savings 
below the operating margin line.
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION Profit before tax including the Group’s share of 
joint ventures has increased to a record high of 
£34.1 million from £32.2 million and to £34.6 million 
excluding the Group’s share of joint ventures (2016: 
£32.3 million). The Board expects the year to 31 March 
2018 to show significant growth in pre-tax profits 
and again in the following year. A large proportion of 
this growth is already visible due to the scale of the 
development pipeline and the Group’s substantial 
forward sold position.
Finance costs
Finance costs actually incurred in the year, including 
the Group’s share of joint ventures increased to 
£5.3 million (2016: £4.5 million) and reduced to £4.3 
million excluding the Group’s share of joint ventures 
(2016: £4.4 million).
Average borrowings in the year were higher at £55.1 
million (2016: £50.6 million), with the interest charged 
on these borrowings of £2.2 million (2016: £2.2 
million) being capitalised into work in progress as 
required by IAS 23.
Finance costs charged directly to the income 
statement primarily consist of amortised arrangement 
fees and non-utilisation fees on the Group’s £180 
million revolving credit facility and the new £110 million 
facility with LaSalle Residential Finance Fund secured 
in July 2016 to fund our joint venture scheme, City 
North. Non-utilisation fees including our share of joint 
ventures have increased to £2.5 million (2016: £1.7 
million), of which £1.6 million is attributable to the 
revolving credit facility (2016: £1.7 million) and £0.9 
million to the City North facility (2016: £nil).
Dividend
The Board’s policy is to pay one third of earnings as 
dividends. Following the equity placing concluded in 
November 2015, the Board committed to paying a 
dividend equivalent to one third of earnings adjusted 
to remove the dilutive effect of the new shares for 
both the year to 31 March 2016 and the year to 31 
March 2017. As a result, a final dividend of 8.5 pence 
per share has been proposed. Together with the 
7.2 pence interim dividend paid on 6 January 2017 
this makes the total dividend for the year 15.7 pence 
(2016: 14.2 pence). This equates to just over 40 per 
cent of earnings and delivers a yield of circa 
four per cent based on the share price at 31 March 
2017. The final dividend is expected to be paid on  
14 July 2017 to those shareholders on the register  
at the close of business on 16 June 2017.
Despite an increase in profit after tax, earnings 
per share has decreased from 39.3 pence to 36.8 
pence. This is due to the equity placing which 
increased the number of shares in issue throughout 
the year to 31 March 2017 but only for part of the 
previous year, thereby increasing the weighted 
average number of shares in issue year on year.
Balance sheet and cash
Net assets at 31 March 2017 were £204.3 million,  
an increase from £187.0 million last year mainly due 
to retained profits. This equates to net assets per 
share of 271.3 pence (31 March 2016: 249.8 pence). 
There has been a significant amount of investment in 
land and work in progress with inventories, including 
the Group’s share of joint ventures, increasing from 
£285.6 million to £339.4 million. Excluding joint 
ventures, inventories increased from £239.0 million 
to £287.7 million with the balance being recorded 
within investments in joint ventures. 
Investment in joint ventures has increased from £42.1 
million to £47.6 million. The increase is mainly a result 
of completing on the purchase of Gallions Quarter 
during the year. This is a joint venture with Notting Hill 
Housing Group and was part of the acquisition of the 
regeneration business of United House Developments 
in September 2015. Completion on this site was 
conditional on the satisfaction of certain conditions 
which were concluded on 28 July 2016.
The majority of the inventories balance is land 
and work in progress with minimal finished 
stock units due to our successful forward sales 
strategy. The Group does not typically land bank 
sites and therefore the vast majority of land held 
within inventories is under construction or is being 
progressed through the planning system. Included 
within inventories are £4.3 million of freehold assets 
held for future resale (2016: £5.7 million).
Land creditors, including the Group’s share of joint 
ventures, are £28.4 million (2016: £nil) and £26.9 
million (2016: £nil) excluding joint ventures.

27 Included within land creditors is £26.9 million in 
relation to a development site on Cambridge Heath 
Road E2, where the Group has exchanged contracts 
with completion due upon vacant possession of the 
site expected in the next few months. The remaining 
land creditors relate to our share of the land 
payment for two of our joint venture sites,  
Balfron Tower (£0.3 million) and Gallions Quarter 
(£1.1 million), where the original land contracts 
include a deferred land payment mechanism.
The Group continues to secure forward sales and 
benefit from the deposits received in advance of 
those sales completing. The Group had secured 
£546 million in forward sales at 1 April 2017 which 
will be recognised in future years. This is comprised 
of £397 million in relation to individual open market 
contracts, £40 million of affordable housing revenue 
and £109 million of build to rent revenue.
Total deposits received in advance on the open 
market contracts secured as at 31 March 2017 
reduced slightly to £68.1 million (2016: £70.3 million). 
Non-refundable deposits are paid on exchange of 
contracts with a minimum 10 per cent received at that 
point and, where the Group is selling well ahead of 
completion, a further 10 per cent is paid 12 months 
after exchange. The full amount of any deposit paid is 
released to the Group to invest in the business.
Borrowings
The Group continues to fund its development costs 
through a combination of debt and equity and, 
despite significant investment in land and work in 
progress, net debt has reduced to £14.3 million 
(2016: £17.3 million). This is partly due to open market 
completion proceeds received during the year, but 
also deposits and upfront payments received on 
forward sales including build to rent contracts.
As a result, gearing has decreased to 7.0 per cent 
(2016: 9.3 per cent) and remains at a very low level 
for the Group. Gearing is anticipated to increase to 
enable the significant growth expected over the next 
few years. The rate of increase will depend on the 
timing of future land purchases and how much the 
business moves towards a build to rent model. 
The Board is comfortable with the potential for 
increased levels of debt and gearing given that many 
of the Group’s developments have been substantially 
de-risked by the level of forward sales secured.
Telford Homes has a £180 million revolving credit 
facility which is available to fund developments that 
are not joint ventures. This facility, from a club of 
four banks, runs until March 2019 and is governed 
by standard corporate covenants together with site 
covenants on a portfolio basis. The margin payable 
on this facility varies from 2.8 per cent to 4 per cent 
over LIBOR depending on gearing. The Group has 
benefited from low gearing levels throughout the 
year and therefore the margin paid has been at the 
lower end of the range. As at 31 March 2017, the 
Group had drawn £55 million (2016: £40 million) 
of this facility, leaving headroom of £125 million 
to fund future site acquisitions and construction 
costs.
Joint venture developments are funded outside of 
the revolving credit facility with site specific loans 
secured as and when required. In July 2016, the 
Group secured a £110 million facility with LaSalle 
Residential Finance Fund to fund its 50 per cent 
owned joint venture at City North and, in February 
2017, it signed a £33 million facility with Williams and 
Glyn to fund Balfron Tower, in which the Group has 
a 25 per cent stake. The Group’s joint venture with 
Notting Hill Housing Group at New Garden Quarter 
is not expected to require any external debt finance 
due to a proportion of the development being sold 
for build to rent.
The Group has excellent long term relationships 
and is well supported by the banks that fund the 
revolving credit facility. The Board is pleased to 
have added to these relationships with the new 
institutions involved in the facilities signed during the 
year. Telford Homes is in a strong financial position 
with significant headroom within existing debt 
facilities and equity available to enable the growth 
targeted over the next few years.

DEVELOPING IN LONDON:  
MANAGING RISK
Risk Potential impact Mitigation Commentary
Attracting 
and retaining 
high-calibre 
employees 
An inability to recruit and retain 
employees with appropriate 
skill sets can introduce cost, 
delays in bringing developments 
forward or quality issues. 
Increased employee turnover 
can create instability and 
uncertainty.  Skills and 
experience lost are difficult to 
replace and loss of knowledge 
within the business can affect 
overall efficiency.
• The Group’s Human Resources programme includes 
management trainee schemes, succession planning 
and training tailored to each discipline.
• Remuneration packages are benchmarked against 
industry standards to ensure competitiveness.
• Employee statistics including turnover and absence 
are monitored monthly.
• Exit interviews and an employee engagement survey 
are used to identify any areas for improvement.
Skilled employees are 
critical to delivering 
the Group’s growth 
strategy, improving key 
financial metrics and 
the continued delivery 
of attractive returns to 
shareholders.
Availability of 
materials  
and labour 
The availability of materials and 
subcontracted labour for each 
site can affect both the length 
of the construction programme 
and the cost of construction. 
Build cost inflation will impact 
directly on the margin achieved 
on each site where this is in 
excess of forecasts.
• Planning of the construction programme and timely 
management of the tender process reduces the risk 
of delays.
• Thorough tender process ensures that competitive 
rates are achieved on every trade.
• Working in partnership with subcontractors and 
making timely payments to build mutually beneficial 
relationships.
• Close monitoring of build cost inflation and 
appropriate provisioning, coupled with an early fixing 
of build costs where possible.
The outcome of the 
EU referendum has 
increased uncertainty 
around labour 
availability, however no 
immediate change has 
been noted. 
Cash 
requirements 
and bank 
finance
Significant initial outlays of 
capital supported by bank 
finance are required for 
property development.  This 
is coupled with lengthy time 
periods before the majority 
of the cash inflows on each 
project. The availability of 
sufficient borrowing facilities is 
therefore critical to enable the 
servicing of liabilities. 
• The Group maintains a detailed cash flow forecast which 
extends five years ahead and is subject to continual 
re-assessment and sensitivity analysis to ensure it is not 
operating beyond its financial capacity.
• The cash flow position is reviewed by the Board and the 
Group’s banking partners on a regular basis.
• The Group has excellent relationships with its banking 
partners and has secured sufficient facilities to enable 
it to take advantage of appropriate land buying and 
operational opportunities.
• Deposits received from forward selling properties 
provide a source of equity which can be reinvested in 
new sites.
• The Group’s increased focus on build to rent results in 
cash inflows earlier in the development cycle.
The Group has 
continued to invest 
in land and work in 
progress but still has 
substantial headroom 
within its £180 million 
revolving credit facility 
available to achieve its 
growth aspirations.
The Group’s financial and operational performance is subject to a 
number of risks. These risks are continually assessed by the Board  
to mitigate and minimise their impact on the business. There are  
also a number of risks which are outside of the Group’s control.  
The principal risks facing the business are set out below.
30 Risk Potential impact Mitigation Commentary
Construction The construction process 
is critical to the efficient and 
timely delivery of properties 
to purchasers which affects 
both cash flow and customer 
satisfaction. The quality of the 
construction work and finish 
in each property affects the 
reputation of the Group and can 
impact on repeat purchase and 
recommendation rates. 
• The Group ensures that the right product and 
systems solutions are integrated early in the 
development lifecycle to minimise project risk.
• The construction teams work very closely with the 
customer service team and quality reviews are 
performed at each stage of construction.
Customer surveys are 
conducted on handover 
of homes and results 
are analysed to improve 
product quality.
Economic 
environment
Demand for the Group’s 
homes from both investors and 
owner-occupiers is dependent 
on confidence in the economy 
and local housing markets. This 
confidence is heavily influenced 
by factors outside the Group’s 
control such as interest rates, 
the availability and costs 
of mortgage finance, rental 
incomes, unemployment and 
increasing consumer costs for 
other goods and services. 
The wider economic impacts 
of the outcome of the EU 
referendum may also be felt by 
the housebuilding industry in 
future.
• The Group’s policy is to sell early in the development 
process, where practical and possible, to minimise 
risk and the number of unsold units at practical 
completion.
• Forward sales are being secured with housing 
associations and overseas and UK based buyers. 
Build to rent sales are also helping to give certainty to 
cash flow and earn higher capital returns.
The economic impacts 
of the outcome of 
the EU referendum 
will be monitored 
and mitigated where 
possible by the Board 
with the appropriate 
action being taken in a 
timely manner.
Health and 
safety
A deterioration in the Group’s 
health and safety standards 
could put employees, 
contractors, site visitors or 
the general public at risk of 
injury or death and could 
lead to litigation or penalties 
and damage Telford Homes’ 
reputation.
• Investment in training, the promotion of health and 
safety to all employees and extensive policies and 
procedures all contribute to ensuring that high 
standards are maintained.
• The Group has a dedicated Health and Safety 
team who conduct regular health and safety audits, 
augmented by an external advisor.
• Processes and procedures are modified as required 
with a view to achieving continuous improvement.
Continued focus upon 
health and safety seeks 
to further reduce injury 
rates and manage the 
risks inherent in the 
construction process.

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION Risk Potential impact Mitigation Commentary
Land 
acquisition
The Group needs new land to 
maintain a development pipeline 
and to enable the business to 
continue to operate at a certain 
capacity. This land needs to be 
sourced in appropriate locations 
and where optimum planning 
consents can be obtained. 
The appraisal process that 
determines the price paid for 
land is critical in maintaining 
margins and return on equity at 
acceptable levels. 
• The Group’s strong relationships with various land 
owners, including local authorities and affordable 
housing providers, plays a key role in its ability to 
acquire new sites.
• A robust land appraisal process ensures each project 
is financially viable and consistent with the Group’s 
strategy.
The Group has 
successfully added 
to its development 
pipeline in the last few 
months. That pipeline 
represents over 4,000 
homes valued at  
£1.5 billion.
Planning 
process
Delays in achieving suitable 
planning permissions can affect 
the number of properties that 
can be brought to market and 
impact the timing of future 
cash flows. Failure to achieve 
a suitable planning permission 
may lead to cost write offs or 
reduced margins on individual 
developments.
• A planning and risk assessment is conducted prior to 
any land purchase. 
• Strong relationships are maintained with local 
authorities, planning officers and local communities 
to best understand underlying policy and planning 
prospects.  While this cannot remove planning risks it 
mitigates them as much as possible.
The Board ensures 
that the Group is 
not overexposed 
to planning risks 
by limiting the total 
investment in sites 
without a planning 
permission at any one 
time.
Political 
environment
Changes in laws and 
regulations can have a direct 
impact on the Group and 
the costs incurred on each 
development. Changes in both 
local and national Government 
can have a direct bearing on 
the regulatory environment.
• The potential impact of changes in Government 
policy and new laws and regulations are monitored 
and communicated throughout the business and 
operations are planned accordingly.
• There is broad consensus amongst all main political 
parties that more needs to be done to improve the 
supply of new housing which is a positive for the 
housebuilding industry.
The early calling of a 
general election in June 
2017 has increased 
uncertainty in the short 
term, however once the 
result is known it should 
provide greater clarity 
looking ahead. 
Sustainability Failure to address sustainability 
issues could affect the Group’s 
ability to acquire land, gain 
planning permission, manage 
its reputation effectively, and 
address the demand for 
sustainable living.
•  ‘Building a Living Legacy’ is our strategy to create places 
that will stand the test of time by making a positive long 
term contribution to London’s local communities and 
the environment.  It is underpinned by short to long term 
objectives (set out on pages 38 to 45) that will ensure that 
sustainability risks are recognised and addressed.
• To manage environmental risks, the Group has put in 
place an Environmental Management System that is 
accredited to BS EN ISO 14001:2004 and is audited 
bi-annually by the British Standards Institute.
As a responsible 
business, we have been 
working in innovative 
and sustainable 
ways for many years.  
Moving forward, we 
will continue to shape 
our ‘Building a Living 
Legacy’ strategy.

33 OUR PEOPLE
CREATING A GREAT PLACE TO WORK:  
ENGAGING AND DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE
Overview
We recognise that it’s our people that make 
us different, and we strive to recruit, retain, 
engage and develop the best. We pride 
ourselves on our unique and supportive 
culture, and have worked hard to inspire this in 
the colleagues that we have welcomed to the 
organisation in the last year. 
In an average day we have over 1,000 people 
on our sites and at head office, of which 248 
are directly employed with the remainder being 
employed by our subcontractor partners.
Learning and development
Following the appointment of a dedicated 
Learning and Development Manager we have 
enhanced our Management Trainee scheme, 
and now have a programme for five areas 
of the business: Technical; Commercial; 
Construction; Engineering and Planning. We 
are working to ensure that all trainees receive 
a consistent experience of being mentored 
and developed, by enhancing the skills of our 
management team.
Over the last year, a record number of people 
from across the business attended one or 
more training courses and workshops, and 
more than one third of our senior managers 
achieved an ILM (Institute of Leadership and 
Management) accreditation. We are proud 
to have been awarded a significant grant 
from the CITB (Construction Industry Training 
Board) to invest in our training schemes.
As well as equipping Telford Homes 
employees with the skills they need, we are 
committed to working to address the skills 
shortage in the wider industry. We have an 
average intake of five Higher Apprentices 
per year, we encourage our subcontractors 
to offer apprenticeships, and the Group 
also partners with local authorities such as 
through Skillsmatch in Tower Hamlets to offer 
opportunities to young people. 
Our employees are at the heart of our business and we consistently 
strive to ensure they are engaged and have the opportunity to 
develop in a job they enjoy.
We are proud 
to have above 
industry 
average levels 
of employee 
retention, which 
is currently 
running at 90%.

34 EMPLOYEE LENGTH OF SERVICE
Recruitment and retention
Last year we strengthened our team, particularly 
in Operations. Just over 50 new starters joined 
Telford Homes, meaning that 20 per cent of 
our workforce was new to the organisation. 
We expect this figure to be higher next year, to 
support the growth of the business. Even with 
this rate of growth we have been able to retain 
our unique culture, thanks to the Telford Homes 
behaviours that run through the business  
and which are now included as a core element 
of our induction process. These include: strong 
and consistent performance; respect for our 
people and customers; teamwork; integrity  
and commitment, and effective leadership.  
Our workforce is diverse, and our behaviours 
help us strive to drive performance in a 
consistent way across the team. 
Employee engagement
We undertook our first employee satisfaction 
survey in July 2016. The response was 
excellent, and we were extremely pleased that 
overall satisfaction with Telford Homes as an 
employer and intention to be working for Telford 
Homes in 12 months’ time were both at levels 
exceeding 90 per cent. These results reflect 
how hard we strive to create a great place to 
work. The survey also highlighted a few areas 
for improvement and we have put in place 
action plans across all departments to address 
some of the issues raised.

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION HEALTH & SAFETY
KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE:  
AN EXCELLENT RECORD
Policies and procedures
The Board actively promotes a positive 
occupational health and safety culture  
within the business and ensures that this is 
reflected in all of our policies and procedures, 
as well as in our approach to the training  
and development of the people involved in  
our operations. Occupational health and 
safety is the first agenda item at monthly 
Board meetings.
We have developed a comprehensive set of 
policies and procedures covering all of our 
operations, and these are constantly updated 
and communicated to relevant employees 
and everyone else working on our sites. Our 
procedures identify all of the relevant risks and 
hazards that are likely to be encountered in 
the course of our work and, more importantly, 
set out the appropriate precautionary control 
measures to ensure work is undertaken safely.
We also require our supply chain partners to 
employ competent people and encourage 
their continuing professional development. 
We expect the highest occupational health 
and safety standards from each supplier, and 
this is a key consideration when awarding 
contracts. We monitor our suppliers on an 
ongoing basis and take the necessary steps 
to ensure they meet our high expectations, 
including offering subsidised on-site training 
specifically for their employees, often at no 
cost to our partners.
The Group’s Health and Safety Management 
System is accredited to BS OHSAS 
18001:2007 and is audited every six months 
by the British Standards Institution (BSI) in 
accordance with their stringent processes. 
We have an Executive Safety Committee and  
an Operational Safety Forum whose members 
The occupational health and safety of everyone involved 
in our business or affected by it is a vital consideration 
in everything we do.
This year our 
occupational 
health 
and safety 
performance 
was once again 
recognised by 
RoSPA when 
we received 
our eighth 
consecutive 
gold award.
36 are senior employees with extensive industry 
experience. Both of these groups meet regularly 
and are instrumental in developing significant 
changes to the way occupational health and 
safety is managed and to our policies and 
procedures. This ensures we are constantly 
up to date with any changes in working 
practices or regulations. John Fitzgerald is the 
Board director with overall responsibility for 
occupational health and safety.
Training and development
Telford Homes operates in an industry where 
up to date qualifications, standards and 
knowledge are vital to the safe and successful 
operation of the business. The Board views 
training, particularly through apprenticeships 
and our Management Trainee programmes,  
as an essential investment in the future of  
the Group and the construction industry  
more broadly. 
We invest in a rigorous health and safety training 
programme to ensure that all employees have 
the appropriate skills and knowledge, and these 
are evaluated in the context of prospective 
changes to the external environment. The 
needs of members of staff joining the business 
are carefully assessed to identify and address 
specific training requirements. 
Performance
The year to 31 March 2017 has been our 
busiest on record, with over 2.55 million person 
hours worked. There were just three reportable 
injuries (RIDDOR)
1
 during the period, resulting in 
an Accident Frequency Rate (AFR)
2
 of 0.12. The 
construction industry average AFR for the year 
to 31 March 2016
 
was 0.35.
We carefully monitor the nature of any accidents 
or incidents to ensure we learn from them, and 
adjust our training requirements and procedures 
accordingly. The majority of our accidents this 
year arose from simple behavioural failings of 
the people involved, and we are continuing with 
our behavioural focused training programmes 
to make people aware of these basic mistakes 
and the impacts they can have. 
This year our occupational health and safety 
performance was once again recognised 
by the Royal Society for the Prevention 
of Accidents (RoSPA) when we received 
our eighth consecutive gold award, and 
similarly our management of occupational 
road risk was recognised with a gold award. 
These awards and the BSI certification are 
recognition of the very high standard of the 
Group’s overall approach to occupational 
health and safety. 
Summary
Although our occupational health and safety 
performance in the year has been excellent, 
we are not complacent and continue to strive 
for improvement. We will ensure that, as the 
business grows, we have systems in place to 
train new staff and suppliers in our policies 
and procedures.  
We remain confident that our comprehensive 
procedures and investment in training mean 
that Telford Homes is doing everything 
possible to minimise health and safety 
risks within the business, now and in the 
foreseeable future.

SHORT TERM TARGETS
As a responsible business, we have been working in innovative 
and sustainable ways for many years. We launched our ‘Building a 
Living Legacy’ (BLL) sustainability strategy in 2016. It underpins our 
commitment to create places that stand the test of time by making a 
positive long term contribution to London’s built environment. 
Economic, social and environmental principles are central to our 
business strategy and support our ambition to create thriving places 
for future generations. Under the strategy, we have developed a 
Living Legacy framework to help manage four priority areas and 
supporting targets, where we believe we can have the greatest 
positive impact by 2024.
38 Built by passionate people and strong relationships, we will 
use innovative land, design and development solutions to 
create a legacy of high quality sustainable homes and places.
OUR SUSTAINABILITY MISSION
A new approach
This is the first year of reporting our sustainability 
performance against our BLL strategy. The 
strategy will enable us to enhance the quality 
of life for our customers, while supporting our 
operations and delivering value for our stakeholders 
and shareholders.
Launched partly in response to known 
national policy and the London Plan, the BLL 
strategy was developed through a detailed 
political, economic, social, technological, legal 
and environmental (PESTLE) analysis and a 
collaborative materiality assessment.  
Moving forward, we will continue to shape the 
strategy taking into consideration changes to the 
above, as well as sectoral analysis such as JLL ’s ‘Big 
Eight for Real Estate’, which sets out interconnected 
sustainability trends through to 2030. 
Our approach to materiality
As part of our annual business planning, the Board 
set out ambitions for formalising our BLL strategy in 
2016.  To ensure a robust and transparent approach, 
we engaged with our employees and development 
partners to identify the most important sustainability 
issues for Telford Homes and our stakeholders. 
The materiality review consisted of internal 
workshops, key stakeholder interviews, a peer 
analysis and review of sustainability legislation, 
including an analysis of our position in the 
NextGeneration sustainability benchmark.
This process enabled us to develop a clear 
materiality matrix, identify our key focus areas 
and create a roadmap to 2024, complete with 
targets and key performance indicators. Through 
our research, we have also set the ambition to 
improve on our current 18th place position in the 
NextGeneration benchmark of UK Housebuilders, 
aiming to be in the top 10 by 2018.  
Strong sustainability governance
Following our materiality review, a detailed 
recommendation was made for the Board to provide 
oversight and high-level sustainability governance, 
which led to the creation of a dedicated BLL Steering 
Committee. Our Chief Executive chairs the committee.
In line with best practice, we will report progress 
against the strategy by adopting an integrated 
reporting approach in the future. This will ensure that 
we are comprehensively communicating our journey 
towards BLL to a wider audience.
Over the next few pages we outline our progress 
across each of the four priority areas to date.

Create a Living Legacy framework using best practice principles
Following a detailed 
review of existing 
policies, emerging urban 
design frameworks, 
socioeconomic 
and environmental 
standards, and the 
emerging consultations 
of the London Plan, 
we have developed a 
comprehensive Living

The framework consists of 
10 principles and a series 
of supporting objectives, 
which we believe are 
vital towards creating 
strong communities and 
encouraging sustainable 
lifestyles:
We are committed to creating a legacy of high quality sustainable 
homes, mixed use buildings and thriving places across London. 
Through collaboration with local stakeholders, our approach to place

40 OBJECTIVE 3:
Develop a Living Legacy toolkit
We have created a toolkit that will inform project briefings and live 
throughout the development lifecycle to embed Living Legacy 
principles at each project phase.
It is likely that the toolkit will be further developed during the emerging 
consultations of the London Plan in 2017/18, and nuanced on live 
projects. 
OBJECTIVE 2:
Trial the Living Legacy  
development framework on  
one new project
We have trialled the framework within several new mixed use 
schemes of varying scales in differing London boroughs such as 
the LEB Building in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Initial 
stakeholder reviews are helping us to test the principles and its 
flexibility. We will continue to test it and gather important feedback to 
inform our approach moving forward.
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE:
Monitoring trends to create a Living Legacy
To safeguard our strategy and to deliver a positive long term contribution to London’s built environment, we have undertaken 
a detailed analysis of the socioeconomic and environmental priorities in a cross-section of London boroughs including Brent, 
Enfield, Hackney, Newham, Southwark and Tower Hamlets. 
We will continue to monitor societal trends such as the demographic expectations of Baby Boomers and Generations X, Y 
and Z, which are increasingly important, to ensure that our BLL strategy delivers on our ambitions.

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION With finite resources, rising commodity costs and the ever increasing 
drive for operational efficiency, it’s vital we balance the resources 
we use to contribute to a sustainable future. Our balanced resources 
objectives focus on reducing our environmental impact whilst 
improving cost efficiency and creating long term resilience.
OBJECTIVE 1:
Set targets to reduce energy, 
greenhouse gas emissions and  
waste, and increase recycling rate
We have set the goal of reducing waste intensity, energy usage and 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by three per cent per annum 
across all our sites and corporate offices. 
We monitor our Scope 1, 2 and 3 (business travel) GHG emissions 
usage for our business activities.  We will shortly be reporting our 
GHG emissions on the sustainability section of our corporate website. 
In the long term, we are engaged in developing carbon positive and 
zero waste to landfill practices.
OBJECTIVE 3:
Align our procurement policy  
with ‘Building a Living Legacy’  
objectives
We have started reviewing the introduction of BLL ambitions into 
existing policies and are planning the release of a suite of interrelated 
policies in 2017 .
OBJECTIVE 2:
Set a target to increase our use 
of sustainably sourced timber
We are committed to procuring at least 90 per cent of our timber 
from sustainable sources such as the Forest Stewardship Council 
(FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification 
(PEFC) Chain of Custody Certification. We are also committed to 
eliminating the use of illicit timber in our operations and supply chain.
OBJECTIVE 4:
Set targets to reduce water  
consumption
We have set a three per cent annual reduction target for water 
intensity across all our sites and corporate offices. Additionally, we 
have incorporated Blue-Green Cities infrastructure in a number of 
our projects to contribute to urban biodiversity and promote naturally 
oriented water cycle systems.
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE:

As we make strong progress against our objectives, we will look to report the related cost savings of our environmental 
initiatives. In line with the Social Value Act, we will also report on our Social Return on Investment (SRI) when developing 
integrated value chains to deliver sustainable homes, mixed used schemes and neighbourhoods. 
SUSTAINABILITY
BALANCED RESOURCES:  
EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES 
ACROSS OUR BUSINESS 
42 Homebuilding and the delivery of mixed use schemes is becoming 
increasingly complex and calls for a broader range of skills, knowledge 
and innovation than ever before. We have a long tradition of completing 
schemes using innovative building solutions, whilst being risk averse and 
commercially astute. Our approach emphasises long term collaboration 
with partners to identify fit for purpose solutions for our customers.
  
2016 objectives 
  
2017 objectives
OBJECTIVE 1:
Agree focus areas for  
research into sustainable innovations
A wide range of creative and innovative building solutions and 
systems were further developed in 2016.  These were implemented 
across numerous projects, from residential homes to schools, 
colleges, churches and mosques. These examples are used to 
advise clients, partners and future investors of the most appropriate 
delivery models.  
Our experience and ability to manage risk, whilst maintaining high 
levels of health and safety and customer satisfaction, is testament to 
our enduring ability to implement the right solutions in the right areas. 
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE:
Moving towards a circular economy 
Whilst there is no legislative driver to integrate circular economy principles into our business model, BLL principles underpin 
our profitable growth strategy. As we move towards integrated reporting and measuring our SRI, we will show how our 
approach contributes to a circular economy.
OBJECTIVE 2:
Establish innovation working  
groups for all new developments
Our projects are thoroughly assessed by Project Teams and an 
Executive Steering Group to ensure they meet Telford Homes’ 
rigorous standards. An Innovation Forum has also been instigated, 
and various design, technical, procurement, process (including 
Building Information Modelling (BIM)), Modern Methods of 
Construction (MMC) and social innovations are being discussed for 
further research.  
Our Standard Assessment Procedure performance goes beyond 
regulation, and 80 per cent of our homes benefit from low carbon or 
renewable technologies. 
OBJECTIVE 3:
Present a yearly review of innovative sustainable building solutions  
to design teams
A range of creative building solutions and systems were formally reported to the BLL Steering Committee and its Innovation Forum in 2016. 
Relevant solutions are also briefed to design teams for consideration in future projects.

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION Our people and value chain are our greatest assets, which is why we 
are investing in them to deliver our 2024 objectives. We are making 
good progress against our smart business objectives and ambition  
to create lasting value for our stakeholders.
OBJECTIVE 1:
Set up a Sustainability 
Steering Committee and appoint 
Living Legacy champions
Executive directors and senior managers were nominated to sit on 
our BBL Steering Committee in 2016. Members were tasked with 
operational and strategic deliverables to promote sustainability within 
Telford Homes. 
To support BLL implementation, Living Legacy champions were also 
appointed to build capacity and promote sustainability knowledge 
throughout the year. Each department has defined responsibilities 
and actions that contribute to the achievement of our 2016-2018 
targets.  
Progress against our areas of focus will continue to be reviewed every 
three months, and ‘horizon scanning’ will ensure that we are quick to 
respond to emerging trends. 
OBJECTIVE 3:
Ensure all our staff complete  
our ‘Building a Living Legacy’ 
induction
In 2016, all staff attended BLL presentations and new starters were 
inducted in the strategy. Additionally, more comprehensive BLL 
training is being rolled out across all priority areas.
OBJECTIVE 4:
Integrate employee wellbeing  
questions into our staff survey
During 2016, we included wellbeing questions in our first staff survey. 
The feedback and results were very positive, and will provide a good 
platform for ongoing engagement and future comparison.
OBJECTIVE 2:
Embrace the principles  
behind the Modern Slavery Act  
2015 and carry out a key risk review
We continued to engage with our value chain in light of legislative 
change, by way of example the Modern Slavery Act, and to help 
develop supply chain capacity and resilience, given the chronic 
shortage of homes in London. 
Our prompt payment and longstanding preferred supplier 
commitments ensure we are maintaining strong relationships with our 
key suppliers. An update of our value chain risk assessment will be 
published in 2017 .
Since Telford Homes was founded in 2000, we have not faced any 
warnings or prosecutions relating to our sustainability practices. Over 
the reporting period, BSI’s auditing of our ISO14001 systems did 
not raise any non-conformances. In 2017 , we will transition from the 
ISO14001:2004 standard to 2015 accreditation.
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE:
Building advocacy and strong partnerships
Citizenship and advocacy is an important part of being a smart business. By networking and knowledge sharing we are 
developing innovative solutions for our customers. 
To ensure that our strategy is future-proofed, we participate in various committees and forums, including memberships with 
Future of London, Home Builders Federation Skills Partnership, NextGeneration Initiative, NHBC Standards Committee and 
the UK Green Building Council.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
Application of principles
Although not formally required to do so, the directors have sought to embrace the principles contained in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) issued by the Financial Reporting Council applicable to fully listed companies, in formulating and 
applying the Group’s corporate governance policies. These policies are tailored to ensure that they are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances given the size of the Group. 
Directors
The Company and Group are managed by a Board of directors and they have the necessary skills and experience to effectively 
operate and control the business. There are nine directors in total, of whom two are Non Executive Directors. Frank Nelson 
and Jane Earl, the Non Executive Directors, are considered independent and they sit on both the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. The Board meets once a month and the directors make every effort to attend all Board meetings. Further details on 
the Board’s skills and experience are set out within their biographies on pages 48 and 49.
The Board is responsible for taking all major strategic decisions and also addressing any significant operational matters. In addition, 
the Board reviews the risk profile of the Group and ensures that an adequate system of internal control is in place. Management 
information systems are in place to enable the directors to make informed decisions to properly discharge their duties.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separate. The Chairman is responsible for running the Board and he meets 
regularly and separately with the Chief Executive and the Non Executive Directors to discuss matters for the Board.
As the business has developed, the composition of the Board has been under constant review to ensure that it remains 
appropriate to the managerial requirements of the Group. One third of the directors retire annually in rotation in accordance with 
the Company’s articles of association. This enables the shareholders to decide on the election of the Company’s Board.
The Board takes decisions regarding the appointment of new directors as a whole and this is only done following a thorough 
assessment of a potential candidate’s skills and suitability for the role. New directors are given a full induction to the Group where 
required so as to ensure that they can properly fulfil their role and meet their responsibilities.
All directors are offered appropriate coaching and training to develop their knowledge and ensure they remain up to date in 
relevant matters for which they have responsibility as a member of the Board.
The Chairman’s statement and Chief Executive’s review, included in this annual report, give the Board’s current assessment of the 
Group’s prospects. The directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements as set out in the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities. The responsibilities of the auditors are set out in their report.
Remuneration committee
Details concerning the composition and meetings of the Remuneration Committee are contained in the directors' remuneration 
report on pages 52 to 59.
50 Audit committee
During the period, the Audit Committee, which is chaired by Frank Nelson an independent Non Executive Director, has met three 
times with the external auditors being in attendance on all occasions. The Non Executive Directors meet separately with the 
auditors twice a year.
The committee has a responsibility for reviewing the financial statements provided to shareholders. In addition the committee 
reviews the business and financial risks and internal controls as described below.
The duties of the committee also include ensuring that the auditors provide a cost effective service to the Group and remain 
objective and independent and to consider from time to time the need for an internal audit function.
Relations with shareholders
The Company has institutional shareholders and is, where practicable, willing to enter into a dialogue with them. The Chief Executive 
and the Group Financial Director meet regularly with institutional investors within the confines of relevant legislation and guidance.
The Board invites communication from its private investors and encourages participation by them at the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM). All Board members present at the AGM are available to answer questions from shareholders. Notice of the AGM in excess 
of 21 clear days is given and the business of the meeting is conducted with separate resolutions, voted on initially by a show of 
hands and with the result of the voting being clearly indicated.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed 
to mitigate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Board is of the view that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks 
and that it has been in place for the period ended 31 March 2017 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and 
accounts, and that it is regularly reviewed by the Board.
The internal control procedures are delegated to Executive Directors and senior management in the Group, operating within a 
clearly defined departmental structure. The Board regularly reviews the internal control procedures in the light of the ongoing 
assessment of the Group’s significant risks.
On a monthly basis, management accounts, including a comprehensive cash flow forecast, are reviewed by the Board in order 
to provide effective monitoring of financial performance. At the same time the Board considers other significant strategic, 
organisational and compliance issues to ensure that the Group’s assets are safeguarded and financial information and accounting 
records can be relied upon. The Board formally monitors monthly progress on each development.

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the directors' remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
As an AIM listed Company, Telford Homes Plc is not required to comply with the remuneration reporting requirements applicable 
to fully listed companies in the UK. However the Committee has taken into account these regulations in the preparation of the 
directors' remuneration report for the year as a matter of best practice. 
This report is presented in two sections. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy sets out the forward looking remuneration policy. The 
annual report on Remuneration provides details of the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 31 March 2017 and how the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be operated for the year commencing 1 April 2017.
The directors' remuneration report is subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2017 Annual General Meeting. 
Review of the year to 31 March 2017
As described earlier in the annual report the Group has performed well during the year, delivering record revenues and profit 
before tax of £291.9 million and £34.1 million respectively. Consequently, Executive Directors earned an annual bonus equivalent 
to 0.6 per cent of profit before tax (capped at 100 per cent of salary if applicable), 50 per cent of which will be deferred and paid 
out to each director in equal instalments over the next three years in line with the bonus scheme rules.
The Committee remains committed to a fair and responsible approach to executive pay. In January 2017 the Committee 
determined it was appropriate to award the Executive Directors a 3 per cent salary increase, which was in line with increases for 
the wider workforce. 
During the year, the Committee commissioned Deloitte LLP to undertake a review of remuneration and propose changes to the 
remuneration structure to ensure that it is in line with best practice, and that Executive Directors are appropriately incentivised 
over the longer term and have the ability to build up their personal equity holding. This is a reflection of the Board's commitment to 
ensure that the Company retains and develops the talents needed to deliver on its growth targets.
This has resulted in a change to the annual bonus scheme applicable from 1 April 2017, where maximum opportunity is set by 
reference to base salary and amounts earned will be subject to the achievement of annual profit before tax (PBT) targets. In 
addition, a new Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) has been introduced designed to motivate the Executive Directors over the longer 
term to deliver the Group’s strategy and to reward appropriately, and to reflect their contribution to shareholder value creation. The 
LTIP is based on the achievement of three year performance conditions, initially focused around cumulative earnings per share 
(EPS) over three years. The first awards will be made following the 2017 Annual General Meeting, subject to shareholder approval 
of the LTIP. Further details of the new annual bonus scheme and LTIP are set out in the Directors' Remuneration Policy.
Outlook for the year to 31 March 2018
•  Having undertaken a detailed review of variable remuneration, the Committee will now seek to embed the new bonus and LTIP 
into the Group and will focus on this as the primary incentive mechanism. The bonus scheme will be centred on an annual PBT 
target and the LTIP around EPS. 
•  Salary increases for 2018 will be reviewed in January 2018 and will be fully disclosed and explained in next year’s Report.

52 Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This section sets out the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which will apply from the date of the next Annual General Meeting to be 
held on 13 July 2017. The policy is determined by the Remuneration Committee of the Group. 
Key principles
The main aim of the Group’s policy is to align the interests of Executive Directors with the Group’s growth strategy and long term 
creation of shareholder value. The policy is designed to remunerate the Executive Directors competitively and appropriately and 
allows them to share in this success and the value delivered to shareholders. 
The policy is based on the following principles:
• Promote shareholder value creation and support the business growth strategy
• Ensure that the interests of the directors are aligned with the long term interests of shareholders
• Deliver a competitive level of pay for the directors sufficient to attract, retain and motivate individuals
• Ensure that an appropriate proportion of the package is determined by targets linked to the Group’s performance

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
54 Explanation of performance measures chosen
Performance measures are selected that are aligned with the performance of the Group and the interest of shareholders. 
Stretching performance targets are set each year for the annual bonus and long term incentive awards. When setting these 
performance targets, the Committee will take into account a number of different reference points, which may include the Group’s 
business plan and strategy and economic environment. Full vesting will only occur for what the Committee considers to be 
stretching performance. 
The annual bonus is based on PBT performance which is a key financial performance metric of the Group. 
The LTIP is based on EPS performance as the Committee considers this to be a key measure of long term sustainable business 
performance. 
The Committee retains the ability to adjust or set different performance measures if events occur which cause the Committee to 
determine that the measures are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required so that they can achieve their original purpose.
Awards and options may be adjusted in the event of a variation of share capital in accordance with the rules of the LTIP.
Legacy remuneration 
The Committee has the right to settle remuneration arrangements that were put in place prior to this Policy being created.  
These being:
• The bonus scheme applicable to Executive Directors from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2017 involved a proportion of the bonus 
earned in the year (up to 50 per cent) being deferred and paid out to each director in equal instalments over the next three 
years, subject to a minimum level of profit being achieved in these years. Therefore, subject to the minimum level of profit being 
achieved in the financial years to March 2018, March 2019 and March 2020, deferred bonus payments will be paid in line with 
the rules of this scheme. The amount carried forward under this scheme for each director is included on page 58.
•  During 2006 the Company set up a Deferred Payment Share Purchase Plan (DPSPP) for the benefit of select employees. Further 
details are given in note 18 to the financial statements. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for approving any offers of 
shares made under the DPSPP although further grants are very unlikely. 
•  Approved and unapproved share options have been granted to Executive Directors in previous years under the Telford Homes 
Plc Employee Share Option Scheme. Outstanding options detailed on page 58 can still be exercised under the rules of the 
scheme. 
Non Executive Directors’ remuneration policy
The remuneration policy for the Non Executive Directors is to pay fees necessary to attract an individual of the calibre required 
taking into consideration the size and complexity of the business and the time commitment of the role.
Details are set out in the table below:
Approach to setting fees Basis of fee Other items
The fees of the Non Executive Directors 
are agreed by the Chairman and CEO.
Fees are reviewed annually.
Fees are set taking into account 
the level of responsibility, relevant 
experience and specialist knowledge  
of each Non Executive Director.
Fees may include a basic fee and  
additional fees for further responsibilities  
(for example Chairman of the Remuneration 
and Audit Committee).
Fees are paid in cash.
Non Executive Directors do not receive any 
benefits or pension contributions. They are 
entitled to participate in the SIP.
Travel and other reasonable expenses incurred 
in the course of performing their duties are 
reimbursed.

it has undertaken relevant research to ensure that remuneration levels are competitive with the industry average. Generally 
the Committee meet three times during the year, however in the current year the Committee has met five times to enable full 
consideration to be given to the decisions required regarding the new bonus structure and LTIP.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
62 Strategic report
The strategic report for the Group, including a fair review of the Group, a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group, the development and performance of the Group during the financial year, the Group’s position at the financial year end  
and an analysis of the Group’s key performance indicators, can be found from pages 1 to 45.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have 
prepared the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group, and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding  
the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 48 to 49 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
•  the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and 
•  the report of the directors and Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business  
and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION
73 STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
31 March 2017
Basis of preparation   
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) including International Accounting Standards (IAS) and 
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as 
adopted for use in the European Union and with those parts  
of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention as modified for reassessment of 
derivatives at fair value and on a going concern basis.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires 
the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates 
are based on the directors' best knowledge of the amounts, 
events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those 
estimates. The most significant estimates made by the directors 
in these financial statements are set out in 'Critical accounting 
judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty'.
The Group adopted IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 
(revised) from 1 April 2014 and as a result, proportional 
consolidation of joint venture results is no longer allowed. Under 
these accounting standards, key line items such as statutory 
revenue, cost of sales, inventory and debt no longer include the 
Group’s portion of joint venture balances. Instead, the Group’s 
share of the statutory results from joint ventures is accounted 
for under the equity method. Therefore the Group’s share of the 
results in joint ventures is presented in one line in the income 
statement and the statutory balance sheet includes one line 
representing the Group’s investment in joint ventures.
Joint ventures are an integral part of the business and the Board 
has included an income statement and a balance sheet using 
proportional consolidation for the results of joint ventures within  
the Group’s financial statements. These are presented in addition  
to the GAAP compliant versions of the income statement and 
balance sheet which present joint ventures as equity investments. 
Accounting policies    
The accounting policies set out on these pages have been applied 
consistently for all periods presented in these financial statements. 
Basis of consolidation   
The consolidated financial statements include the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and the 
Group's share of results of joint ventures. The results of 
subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of 
during the year are included in the financial statements from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of 
disposal, as appropriate. All intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.  
 
Exemptions   
The directors have taken advantage of the exemption available 
under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and have not 
presented an income statement or statement of comprehensive 
income for the Company alone. 
Joint ventures   
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an 
interest with one or more other parties where a contractual 
arrangement has established joint control over the entity. 
Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method 
of accounting. Under this method, the Group’s share of 
post-tax results of joint ventures are included in the Group’s 
operating profit in the consolidated income statement and its 
interest in their net assets is included within investments in the 
consolidated balance sheet.
As joint ventures are an integral part of the business, total 
revenue, including the Group's share of joint venture revenue,  
is presented on the face of the income statement and 
reconciled to Group revenue which is the GAAP compliant 
revenue amount.
Revenue and profit recognition 
Properties for open market sale   
Revenue and profit is recognised at the point of legal 
completion of each property. Revenue is the contract price 
of each property net of any incentives and profit is calculated 
based on an assessment of the overall revenues and costs 
expected on that particular development. The assessment of 
total revenues and total costs expected on each development 
requires a degree of estimation although in the majority of 
cases, at the point of handover of open market properties,  
the development will be nearing completion and therefore 
profits are more certain.
Construction contracts 
Contracts are treated as construction contracts when they 
have been specifically negotiated for the construction of a 
development or a number of properties and the risks and 
rewards of the construction transfer to the customer over time. 
These contracts can be for the construction of open market 
homes sold under build to rent contracts or for the construction 
of affordable homes sold to affordable housing providers. 
Revenue is only recognised on a construction contract where 
the outcome can be estimated reliably. Revenue and costs are 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract 
activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by 
an assessment of work performed to date on a proportion of 
overall cost basis.  
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be  
estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent  
of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. 
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total 
contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an  
expense immediately.  
74 On the balance sheet, the Group reports the net contract 
position for each contract either as an asset or liability. A 
contract represents an asset where costs incurred plus 
recognised profits exceed progress billing and a contract 
represents a liability where the opposite is the case. These  
are disclosed as 'Amounts recoverable on contracts'.
Sale of freehold assets 
Revenue and profit are recognised at the point of legal 
completion of each freehold asset sale. 
Grant income   
Grants received are recognised as revenue in the income  
statement to match with the related costs that they are intended  
to compensate.
Selling expenses   
Selling expenses are charged to the income statement as 
incurred.
Employee benefits   
In accordance with IAS 19, employee benefits are recognised 
as an expense in the period they are earned by the employee. 
Under the Group's annual bonus scheme for Executive 
Directors and senior management there is a deferred element 
to be paid in future years. This deferred element is recognised 
as an expense over the remaining period dependant on the 
employee's continued service. 
Borrowings   
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured 
at fair value, being proceeds received net of transaction costs 
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method. 
Borrowing costs directly relating to the development of 
properties that take a substantial period of time to get ready 
for sale, are capitalised within inventories. Capitalisation of 
borrowing costs commences from the date of initial expenditure 
on a given development and continues until the properties are 
ready for sale. 
The capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended where there 
are prolonged periods when development activity on a site is 
interrupted. Capitalisation is not normally suspended during  
a period when substantial technical and administrative work  
is being carried out.
All other borrowing costs are charged to the income 
statement using the effective interest method. Borrowing 
costs paid are classified as operating activities in the cash flow 
statement.  
Exceptional items   
Exceptional items are those significant items which are 
separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable 
a full understanding of the Group's financial performance. 
Hedge accounting – interest rate swaps
The Group has adopted hedge accounting for its interest 
rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. The hedge is 
used to mitigate financial exposure to movements in interest 
rates. Changes in intrinsic fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income to the extent that the cash flow hedge 
is determined to be effective. All other changes in fair value are 
recognised immediately in the income statement. The hedged 
item is the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) element of 
a variable rate bank loan. The accumulated gains and losses 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income are 
classified into the income statement as a financial expense 
over the life of the loan. This has the effect of fixing the LIBOR 
element of the interest rate recognised in the income statement 
to the hedge rate over the life of the swap. The effectiveness 
of the hedge is tested prospectively and retrospectively on an 
annual basis.
Operating leases   
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement  
on a straight line basis over the life of the lease. 
Pension costs   
Contributions paid to group personal pension schemes (defined 
contribution), in respect of employees, are charged to the 
income statement as incurred.   
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a 
straight line basis at rates calculated to write down the cost, 
less estimated residual value, of each asset over its expected 
useful life as follows: 
Leasehold improvements –  shorter of term of lease 
and 10 years
Plant and machinery – 2 to 5 years
Motor vehicles – 3 years
Goodwill   
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries represents 
the excess of the consideration transferred. Goodwill 
impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
a potential impairment. The carrying value of the cash-
generating unit (CGU) containing the goodwill is compared to 
the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use 
and the fair value, less costs of disposal. Any impairment is 
recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently 
reversed. 
Investments   
Interests in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are 
valued at cost less impairment.

75 STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
31 March 2017
Business combinations   
The Group accounts for business combinations on the date 
control is transferred to the Group and applies the acquisition 
method of accounting for business combinations. The 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at 
the fair value at the acquisition date. Acquisition related costs 
are expensed as incurred. 
Inventories   
Development properties are included in inventories and are 
stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost 
comprises costs of acquisition and development, including 
directly attributable fees and expenses, direct labour costs and 
borrowing costs. Included within development properties are 
freehold interests held in completed developments. The cost of 
these interests are estimated at initial recognition on the basis 
of a multiple of annual ground rents and are not subsequently 
revalued. These are held for future sale.
Planning costs   
Planning costs are capitalised and recognised as an asset 
in work in progress when there is probable future economic 
benefit expected to arise from those costs.
Financial instruments   
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Group's balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provision of the instrument.
Trade receivables and other receivables 
Trade receivables on normal terms do not carry any interest 
and are stated at their nominal value reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated unrecoverable amounts. 
Cash and cash equivalents   
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash balances in 
hand and in the bank (including short term cash deposits) which 
mature within three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Borrowings   
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured 
at fair value, being proceeds received net of transaction costs 
and are subsequently measured at amortised costs, using the 
effective interest rate method.   
Trade payables   
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and 
are stated at their nominal value.   
Land creditors   
Land creditors are recognised at the point the Group has a 
commitment to purchase land and all substantive contractual 
conditions have been satisfied. The liability is initially valued at 
fair value and discounted to present value. Subsequently the 
difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is 
amortised over the length of the payment period and charged to 
inventory, increasing the value of the land creditor so that at the 
date of maturity the land creditor equals the payment required.
Deposits received in advance   
Deposits received on exchange of contracts of open market 
properties are included within trade and other payables until 
legal completion of the related property.  
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the 
Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs. 
Current assets and liabilities  
Assets that are expected to be realised in, or are intended for 
sale or consumption in, the Group's normal operating cycle are 
treated as current even to the extent these are expected to be 
realised after 12 months from the balance sheet date. Liabilities 
that are expected to be settled in the Group's normal operating 
cycle are treated as current even though these may be due for 
settlement after 12 months from the balance sheet date.  
 
Contingent liabilities   
Disclosures are made for each class of contingent liabilities 
at the balance sheet date detailing, where practicable, an 
estimate of its financial effect and an indication of uncertainties 
associated with the timing or amount of the outflow, unless the 
possibility of a financial outflow is remote.  
Taxation   
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently 
payable and deferred tax.   
The tax currently payable is based on the profits for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that 
are tax deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for 
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary 
differences that have originated, but not reversed at the 
balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in 
an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less 
tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and 
therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available 
evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there 
will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of 
the underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
76 Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to 
equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Share-based payments   
In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of equity settled share 
options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured as 
at the date the options are granted using the Black-Scholes-
Merton pricing model and is charged equally over the vesting 
period. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted each 
reporting period to reflect the actual number of options that are 
expected to vest.
With respect to share-based payments, a deferred tax asset 
is recognised on the relevant tax base. The tax base is then 
compared to the cumulative share-based payment expense 
recognised in the income statement. Deferred tax arising on 
the excess of the tax base over the cumulative share-based 
payment expense recognised in the income statement has 
been recognised directly in equity. 
Own shares   
Shares held by employee benefit trusts in order to satisfy 
awards under the Group's share plans are included net  
within equity until such time as the shares are vested to the 
relevant employees.
Critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty
Construction contract revenue and profit recognition
Construction contract accounting is applied to affordable and 
build to rent contracts which can contribute significantly to 
revenue and profits in a financial year. As such, judgements 
required as part of contract accounting can have an impact on 
profit recognised each year and the timing profile of total profit 
recognised on each site.
Contract revenue is recognised from the date of exchange of 
construction contracts, and once there is reasonable certainty 
that all conditions will be met, at a rate equivalent to the value 
of work undertaken in respect of land development. Contract 
profit on construction contracts is recognised in proportion to 
revenue only to the extent that the total eventual profit on the 
contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty.
Assessing the percentage complete on each contract involves 
estimation of total expected costs to be incurred until the end 
of the contract. Forecasting the total expected costs includes 
making assumptions regarding construction costs including 
cost inflation. The earlier in the development process, the more 
judgement is involved in making this estimate. Recognition of 
profit also involves estimation of the total expected revenues 
from each site and therefore the expected profit margin that will 
be achieved. The expected profit margins for individual sites are 
updated on a regular basis and are reviewed by the Board as 
part of established controls procedures. Judgement is required 
to assess whether the total eventual profit on each contract can 
be foreseen with reasonable certainty (note 13).
Carrying value of land and work in progress
Inventories include land and work in progress in respect 
of development sites. On each development judgement is 
required to assess whether the cost of land and any associated 
work in progress is in excess of its net realisable value 
(note 12). 
Future adoption of new and revised 
Standards and Interpretations 
At the date of the authorisation of these financial statements, 
there are a number of standards, amendments and 
interpretations that have been published but are not yet 
effective for the year ended 31 March 2017 and have not been 
adopted early. 
The following EU endorsed standards are expected to impact  
the Group.   
IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers' will be 
effective for the Group for the year ending 31 March 2019. 
The standard remains subject to industry interpretation and 
consensus. The Group has already identified that there will be 
an impact on the timing of recognition of some selling expenses 
which are currently expensed as incurred, but in the future will 
need to be capitalised and expensed as cost of sales on legal 
completion of the properties. The Group continues to assess 
other potential impacts of the standard, including considering 
whether any changes will be required to the recognition of 
revenue from construction contracts. It is not practical to 
provide an estimate of the full impact of IFRS 15 until the  
Group has completed its assessment. 
The following standards are expected to impact the Group,  
but are not yet EU endorsed:   
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases' is expected to impact the recognition of 
leases currently recognised as operating leases. This would 
apply to the Group's property lease for its office premises and 
motor vehicle leases. 
• Amendments to IAS 7, 'Statement of cash flows' on disclosure 
initiative is expected to impact the disclosure of liabilities 
arising from financing activities.   
 
A full assessment of these will be undertaken once the 
standards are EU endorsed.   
The following standards are relevant to the Group but are not 
expected to have any material impact:   
• IFRS 9 'Financial instruments'   
• Amendments to IAS 12, 'Income taxes' regarding recognition  
of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses 
• Amendments to IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payments’ classification  
and measurement of share-based payment transactions.

2 Segmental reporting   
The Group has only one reportable segment being housebuilding in the United Kingdom. Financial analysis is presented to the 
chief operating decision makers of the Group, these being the Board of directors, on a site by site basis. It is on this basis that the 
Board make decisions as to the allocation of resources and assesses the Group's performance. The information is aggregated 
and presented as one reportable segment given the sites share similar economic characteristics.     
Management information is presented to the Board of directors with the Group's share of joint venture results proportionally 
consolidated to reflect the true underlying performance of the Group and the importance of joint ventures to the business. The 
results disclosed within the Group's financial statements do not proportionally consolidate joint venture results and instead they are 
accounted for on an equity basis. A reconciliation between management information and the GAAP compliant information in the 
financial statements is as follows:

7 Earnings per share  
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the Share Incentive Plan. For diluted earnings per share, the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. 
Earnings per share have been calculated using the following figures:   
Year ended  
31 March 2017

31 March 2016
Weighted average number of shares in issue 74,716,939 65,498,340

Goodwill arose during the year ended 31 March 2016 as a result of the acquisition of the regeneration business of United 
House Developments (UHD). The total consideration on acquisition was £18,562,000 compared to the net assets acquired of 
£18,258,000 resulting in goodwill of £304,000.   
Impairment of goodwill of £15,000 (2016: £nil) is as a result of a change in the tax rate at which deferred tax is recognised on the fair 
value of the net assets acquired.

On 30 June 2015, the Group acquired and took control of the regeneration business of UHD from United House Group Holdings

Group completed its acquisition of Gallions Limited.

Development properties 287,652 238,976 266,851 232,868 
All inventories are considered to be current in nature. The operating cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be 
realised within 12 months. It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will be 
subject to a number of issues such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.    
Included within development properties for the Group are freehold interests held for future sale of £4,304,000 (2016: £5,703,000).  
During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group recognised £2,325,000 of new freehold interests and disposed of £3,724,000 of 
freehold interests, receiving sales proceeds of £4,850,000 (2016: the Group disposed of £144,000 of freehold interests, receiving 
sales proceeds of £270,000 and recognised £780,000 of new freehold interests). Included within development properties for the 
Company are freehold interests held for future sale of £4,304,000 (2016: £4,476,000).     
The value of inventories expensed in cost of sales by the Group in the year ended 31 March 2017 was £203,504,000 (2016: 
£179,807,000). Costs capitalised by the Group during the year include interest of £2,151,000 (2016: £2,186,000), which is 
capitalised based on the site specific cost of borrowings. 
During the year the Group conducted a review of the net realisable value of its inventories. Where the estimated net realisable value 
has changed due to movements in cost and revenue estimates and this was less than the carrying value within the balance sheet,  
the Group has written down the value of inventories. The total amount recognised as an expense was £363,000 (2016: £135,000).

18 Employee Share Schemes
Telford Homes Plc Employee Share Option Scheme    
A charge is made to the income statement to reflect the calculated fair value of employee share options. This charge is calculated 
at the date of grant of the options and is charged equally over the vesting period.    
The Group operates both an approved share option scheme and an unapproved share option scheme. Awards under each scheme 
are made periodically to new employees. All schemes are equity-settled and options can normally be exercised three years after the 
grant date.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to calculate the fair value of granted options. Individual calculations have 
been performed for groups of share options with differing exercise prices and dates. The assumptions applied to the Black-
Scholes-Merton formula for share options issued and the fair value per option are set out below:  
2017 2016
Expected life of options based on options exercised to date 4 years 4 years
Volatility of share price based on three year share price history 33% 25%
Dividend yield 4.2% 4.0%
Risk free interest rate 0.25% 0.5%
Weighted average share price at date of grant 312p 383p
Weighted average exercise price 312p 383p
Weighted average fair value per option £0.52 £0.47
Expected volatility was determined by considering the volatility levels historically for the Group. Volatility in more recent years is 
considered to have more relevance than earlier years for the period reviewed.    
The charge calculated for the year ended 31 March 2017 is £43,000 (2016: £27,000).

18 Employee Share Schemes continued
Telford Homes Plc Share Incentive Plan    
During the year ended 31 March 2004, Telford Homes Plc set up a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) for the benefit of all of the 
employees of the Group. This SIP has been approved by the Inland Revenue and confers certain tax advantages for participating 
employees.
The SIP enables for employees to purchase shares up to a value of £1,800 in each tax year. These shares are known as 
'Partnership shares'. Partnership shares are matched on a one for one basis by 'Matching shares' provided by the Group, 
subject to the shares remaining in the SIP for a period of not less than three years. Dividends are paid on both Partnership 
and Matching shares and these are allocated to employees as 'Dividend shares'.    
The Group has set up a trust to administer the SIP and to hold shares on behalf of individual employees. This trust is an entirely 
separate entity to the Group and is managed by a corporate trustee, Telford Homes Trustees Limited. The costs associated with 
the trust are paid for by the Group and the Group finances all share purchases.    
The trust has distributed shares as Partnership shares and Dividend shares to employees participating in the scheme. These 
shares remain in the trust until such time as an employee withdraws from the SIP. Further shares have been allocated to 
employees as Matching shares and the cost of these shares is being written off over the three year holding period. The charge in 
the year ended 31 March 2017 is £211,000 (2016: £191,000).    
During the year ended 31 March 2017, the trust acquired 250,000 shares at 343.5p. At 31 March 2017 the trust remains interested 
in 137,268 shares (2016: 140,335) which have not been allocated to employees and a further 216,194 (2016: 212,988) that have been 
allocated to employees as Matching shares but have not yet vested. Shares in which the trust remains interested do not rank for 
dividends and all shares that have not yet vested do not count in the calculation of the weighted average numbers of shares used to 
calculate earnings per share.
Shares held by the SIP are recognised as a deduction from shareholders' funds. The value of these shares at 31 March 2017 was 
£777,997 (2016: £718,640). Movements in retained earnings relating to the SIP are shown in the statement of changes in equity. 
Telford Homes Plc 2006 Deferred Payment Share Purchase Plan    
During the year ended 31 March 2007, Telford Homes Plc set up a Deferred Payment Share Purchase Plan (DPSPP) for the 
benefit of selected senior employees. An employee benefit trust (the Telford Homes Plc 2006 Employee Benefit Trust) was set up 
with Abacus Corporate Trustee Limited acting as trustee.    
Participants in the DPSPP are offered a loan by the trustee to enable them to subscribe for a specified number of shares in the 
Group at market value. This loan is interest free, repayable on or before the repayment date which is normally 20 years from the 
date of the loan or on leaving employment or disposing of the shares. The loan has a limited recourse such that repayment is 
limited to the value of the shares on the repayment date. The Group will lend the trustee sufficient funds to enable the trustee to 
provide the loans to individual participants. All shares acquired under the DPSPP will be subject to a three year vesting period and 
are held by the trustee for the benefit of the participants. Offers to participants will be made periodically at the discretion of the 
directors of Telford Homes Plc.  
In September 2006 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 550,000 shares at the market value of 260p. 
These shares were issued on 9 November 2006. On this date the Group provided a loan to the trustee of £1,430,000 to enable 
the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. This loan is repayable at the earlier of the sale of the vested shares and 
November 2026 and has been recognised as a deduction from shareholders' funds in the statement of changes in equity. In the 
year ended 31 March 2017, £136,000 of this loan has been repaid, leaving an outstanding balance of £626,000 (2016: £762,000).
In December 2007 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 160,000 shares at the market value of 244p. 
These shares were issued on 14 December 2007. On this date the Group provided a loan to the trustee of £390,400 to enable 
the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. This loan is repayable at the earlier of the sale of the vested shares and 
December 2027 and has been recognised as a deduction from shareholders' funds in the statement of changes in equity. In the 
year ended 31 March 2017, £4,000 of this loan has been repaid leaving an outstanding balance of £319,000 (2016: £323,000). 
Shares held in Trust    
At 31 March 2017, employee benefit trusts held interests in 724,969 shares at a nominal value of 10p this represents 1.0% of the 
Company's allocated share capital (2016: 778,777 shares at 10p nominal value representing 1.0%).

On 13 February 2017, the Group entered into a new 10 year contract to lease its existing head office. In addition to this, also on 13 
February 2017, the Group entered into a 10 year contract to lease additional space at the same location as its existing head office.
Contingent liabilities    
Contingent land payments    
On 27 September 2013, the Company purchased its Horizons development in Tower Hamlets. The site was acquired for consideration 
equating to a variable percentage of the open market sales proceeds that are achieved from the future development. The total 
payments are expected to be approximately £23.9 million (2016: £24.2 million). Consideration of £22.8 million (2016: £4.0 million) has 
been paid to date and the remainder will be settled directly from open market sales proceeds on individual legal completion of the 
remaining two units. 
On occasions the Group enters into contracts to purchase land subject to conditions being satisfied such as obtaining a planning 
consent. At 31 March 2017 the Company had entered into no conditional contracts for which the conditions had not been fully 
satisfied (2016: £22.7 million).

20 Business combinations  
On 30 June 2015, the Group acquired and took control of the regeneration business of United House Developments (UHD) from 
United House Group Holdings Limited (UHGHL). The regeneration business of UHD consists of a group of companies that have 
various interests in four significant development opportunities in North and East London.  
Completion of one of the developments, Gallions Quarter, was conditional on UHGHL securing a legal interest in the site.  
On 28 July 2016, those conditions were met and the Group completed its acquisition of Gallions Limited. The consideration  
for the business combination on 28 July 2016 was £3.56 million.
The consideration paid for the acquisition of Gallions Limited, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date, is as follows: 
Consideration as at 28 July 2016 £000
Cash 3,556
Total consideration paid 3,556
Recognised amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed which were consolidated as at 28 July 2016 were:

Acquisition-related costs of £18,000 have been charged to administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the 
year ended 31 March 2017 (2016: £393,000).  
Revenue and profit recognised since the date of acquisition are minimal and not significant to the Group.  
The fair value of inventories acquired including the Group’s share of joint venture inventories was £3,556,000. The method for 
determining the fair value of inventory is to use the expected selling price less costs to complete, costs of disposal and expected 
margin for each development.

The Group has an interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge. The hedge is used to mitigate the financial exposure to 
movements in interest rates. The Group has no direct exposure to exchange rate movements as any purchases or sales outside 
of the United Kingdom are denominated in sterling.     
Interest rate swap
The fair value of the interest rate swap at 31 March 2017 was a £1,096,000 liability (2016: £855,000 liability). This is measured using 
valuations acquired from third party banks and is a level two valuation. Hedge accounting was applied and no ineffectiveness arose 
in the period. The notional principal amount of the interest rate swap was £50 million during the year, increasing to £100 million on 
4 June 2017.
Trade and other receivables and trade payables     
The fair value of trade and other receivables, amounts owed by and to Group undertakings and joint ventures, trade payables 
and land creditors at 31 March 2017 is equal to the carrying value stated in the balance sheet at that date. There are no amounts 
included within trade and other receivables currently overdue (2016: £nil).      
Borrowings     
The Group uses loan finance, all of which is denominated in sterling, to acquire development land and undertake site construction. 
On 4 March 2015, the Group signed a new revolving credit facility for £180 million which extends to March 2019 with a club of four 
banks, namely the Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Santander and Allied Irish Bank. The debt drawn under this facility is secured 
against the assets of the Group and is monitored by financial covenants. At 31 March 2017 the Group had utilised £55.0 million of 
this facility, leaving an unutilised balance of £125.0 million. Interest is being charged on this facility at LIBOR plus a margin which 
ranges from 2.8% to 4.0% depending on the Group's level of gearing.      
On 22 July 2016, the Group's joint venture City North Finsbury Park Limited signed a £110 million development loan facility with 
LaSalle Residential Finance Fund which extends to May 2020. As at 31 March 2017, City North Finsbury Park Limited had utilised 
£1.3 million of the facility.     
On 22 February 2017, the Group's joint venture Balfron Tower Developments LLP signed a £33 million development loan facility with 
RBS which extends to February 2020. As at 31 March 2017, Balfron Tower Developments LLP had utilised £nil of the facility.
98 All borrowings are treated as current even though these may be due for settlement after 12 months from the balance sheet date 
as they are expected to be settled in the Group's normal operating cycle. For all borrowings fair value is materially equivalent to 
the original book value.     
Market risk
The Group is exposed to the financial risk of changes in interest rates both in terms of changes in the base rate and LIBOR and in 
terms of individual bank's attitude to market risk and their application of either base rate or LIBOR to new facilities and the margin 
applied to each new facility.     
In order to assess the risk interest costs are forecast on a monthly basis over a five year period using estimates of likely changes 
in rates and actual costs are compared to this forecast. Volatility of interest costs remained at an acceptable level in the year 
ended 31 March 2017 as LIBOR remains at a historically low level. Interest on all facilities currently held is charged at floating 
interest rates and the Group assesses the requirement for fixing interest rates on a regular basis.    
From 1 October 2014 the Group reduced its exposure to movements in interest rates by entering into an interest rate swap. The 
Group receives interest on the swap at LIBOR and pays a fixed rate of 1.115 per cent. The effective date of the swap is 1 October 
2014 and the maturity date was 30 September 2016, securing the interest rate paid on £50 million of the Group's £180 million 
revolving credit facility for this period. 
On 15 January 2016 the Group entered into an additional interest rate swap. The Group receives interest on the swap at LIBOR and 
pays a fixed rate of 1.080 per cent. The effective date of the swap is 1 October 2016 and the maturity date is 4 March 2019, securing 
the interest rate paid on £50 million, increasing to £100 million from 4 June 2017, of the Group's £180 million revolving credit facility 
for this period. 
The effect on the income statement of a 1 per cent rise and a 1 per cent fall in interest rates has been calculated to assess interest 
rate sensitivity. Based on average monthly borrowings in the year, a one per cent rise in interest rates would have a negative effect of 
£551,000 before tax (2016: £288,000), and a one per cent fall in interest rates gives the same but opposite effect.  
Capital risk     
The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order 
to provide returns for shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining an appropriate capital structure to 
reduce the costs of capital. The Group considers its capital to be all of the components of equity and borrowings.
The Group ensures that there are appropriate controls over the purchase of land and levels of work in progress in the business in 
order to appropriately manage its capital. In addition, the other methods by which the Group can manage its short term and long term 
capital structure include adjusting the level of ordinary dividends paid to shareholders, issuing new share capital and arranging debt.
Credit risk     
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.   
Trade and other receivables includes amounts recoverable on contracts which are due from housing associations and balances 
due from other Group undertakings. The Group considers the credit quality of the various debtors to be good in respect of the 
amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low.     
Surplus cash is held in secure bank deposit accounts with the Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Santander and Lloyds. 
Liquidity risk     
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows over a five year period and 
performing sensitivity analysis on these forecasts. The forecasts are necessarily subject to a number of assumptions and 
judgements and these are tested on a reasonable basis by the sensitivity analysis. These forecasts and the related sensitivity 
analysis are reviewed by the directors in detail on a monthly basis. In addition all of the forecasts and supporting calculations are 
made available to each bank funding the Group on a monthly basis. The current forecasts show positive cash balances beyond 
the next 12 months, even where this is subjected to sensitivity testing.      
The Group utilises bank facilities to ensure that adequate funding is available to cover working capital requirements and the 
directors consider that existing facilities are sufficient to cover funding requirements in the foreseeable future both where these 
have already been utilised and where they are currently unutilised.      
The Group's bank facilities are subject to a number of general and financial covenants which are tested periodically by each bank.  
In all cases the directors have assessed whether the Group will remain in compliance with the covenants for at least 12 months 
after signing the financial statements and are satisfied that it is highly unlikely there will be any breach of covenants.

Report on the financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion:
• Telford Homes Plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the 'financial statements') give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the Group’s profit and the Group’s and 
the Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
('IFRSs') as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union  
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the annual report and accounts (the 'annual report'), comprise:
•  the Group income statement and Group statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended 31 March 2017;
• the Group and Company balance sheet as at 31 March 2017;
• the Group and Company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;
• the Group and Company cash flow statement for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union and, as regards the Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006, and applicable law.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect 
of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future events.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
•  the information given in the Strategic Report and the report of the directors for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
•  the Strategic Report and the report of the directors have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group, the Company and their environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the report of the 
directors. We have nothing to report in this respect.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) ('ISAs (UK & Ireland)'). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
•  the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
•  the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide 
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report and 
report of the directors, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
