We continue to spend around 
6–7% of our total revenue on 
research and development, enhancing 
existing products and bringing new

 Global leadership
 
With continued innovation and 
a strategically diverse portfolio 
of premium-quality offerings, we remain 
the number one global audio interface 
manufacturer with our Focusrite-branded 
solutions. Additionally, Focusrite Pro, led 
by our RedNet line of enterprise level 
audio over internet protocol (‘AOIP’) 
solutions continues to show widespread 
adoption in all professional audio 
facilities. Our Ampify-branded music 
creation apps (Launchpad, Blocs Wave 
and Groovebox) have been downloaded 
by over 7.5 million customers. With 
Novation, we continue to shape the sound 
of electronic music today with market-
leading keyboard controllers, synthesisers 
and grid-based musical instruments.

  People with a shared 
passion for music making
 Our employee base is very 
passionate about the art of making 
great audio. Many are musicians, audio 
engineers, DJs and producers that use 
our products in real-world environments 
every week, bringing to work that 
same drive, to push the boundaries 
of musical creativity and modern-
day audio production. Our employee 
footprint continues to expand in our 
High Wycombe, London, Los Angeles 
and Hong Kong offices, as well as with 
remote employees all over the globe. 2/3

Our divisions
Focusrite
Originally the Focusrite division 
sold large studio consoles. 
Since that starting point 28 years 
ago, the division has evolved 
to provide a spectrum of highly 
advanced technologically-
driven products. These range 
from recording equipment for 
hobbyists all the way to audio 
networking systems for large 
organisations, such as NBC 
and Microsoft. Importantly, the 
Focusrite name has always 
meant legendary, top-of-the-
range sound quality. Through 
product innovation we now offer 
the best value to a wide range 
of different market segments. 
As a result, we’ve become 
the number one producer of 
audio interfaces in the world.
Novation
Novation, a brand well known for 
synthesisers, was acquired by 
Focusrite in 2004, Novation now 
represents about a third of our 
revenue. Making new instruments 
and software for electronic 
music, the fastest-growing music 
creation segment, Novation is 
disrupting how music is made 
with its grid controllers, iOS 
software and new approaches 
to mobile music making.
Our global coverage
The Group’s products are sold globally 
through distribution and our e-commerce 
platform. We utilise an effective mix of 
retailers – online and ‘bricks and mortar’ 
distributors in areas where localisation  
is a factor, a hybrid approach in the USA 
utilising a distributor with our own demand 
generation team, and direct business to 
consumer with our e-commerce store  
and in-app software purchases. 
Over 800,000 physical products were 
sold to end-users last year. Our music 
creation apps were downloaded 2.7 million 
times in FY17, with approximately 
700,000 in-app customer transactions. 
Our suppliers are chiefly based in China 
and we use third-party logistics support. 
We employ around 190 people in the UK, 
USA, Germany and Hong Kong.

Chairman’s Statement
Another 
successful year
I am very pleased to report that FY17 has proved to be another 
successful year, exceeding our expectations for revenue, at 
£66.1 million (+21.6%), profit and cash flow.
The Company’s products have continued 
to grow market share in our established 
and growth markets. Revenue and profits 
have been boosted by the strengthening 
of the Euro and US Dollar but, even on 
a constant currency basis, the Company 
has enjoyed excellent growth.
This is our first set of results with 
Tim Carroll as Chief Executive Officer, 
having joined the Company in January 
2017. He has successfully established 
himself with the management team 
and the Company more broadly and 
is building on Focusrite’s strong 
foundations. Tim enjoyed almost 20 years 
with Avid Technology Inc, a respected 
business in our marketplace, in global 
sales roles and latterly heading the 
audio division, as a result of which he 
has an unmatched experience of the 
markets that Focusrite seeks to serve, 
from the professional to amateur.
FY17 has seen continued development 
of our sales channels. I am particularly 
pleased with the progress of our 
e-commerce platform, only in its second 
year and which is now offering the 
Company’s products globally. Sales in 
the Far East, notably China, continue to 
grow faster than most other regions of 
the world. In response to this demand, 
the Company has established a Hong 
Kong office to manage our third-party 
distributors and marketing in the Asia-
Pacific region and to provide customer 
support to Asian customers. This office 
continues to grow and, importantly, 
enables us to provide support to 
customers who use our products all over 
the world, 24/7. Looking forward, new 
distribution initiatives in Japan promise 
to underpin growth prospects in this 
important but challenging market.
Last year, I reported on the launch of the 
second generation of Focusrite’s Scarlett 
range of audio interfaces. Scarlett is the 
market-leading range globally and our 
results very much reflect the outstanding 
success and growth of this range, 
that provides musicians and the wider 
recording community with outstanding 
performance and reliability. Focusrite 
Clarett is a premium range of interfaces 
for those whose recordings are more 
likely to have commercial potential.
Phil Dudderidge
Founder and  
Executive Chairman Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 05
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Our Novation brand of musical 
instruments comprising synthesisers, 
keyboard controllers and the Launchpad 
grid controller family enjoyed a 37.8% 
uplift in demand compared with a flat 
2016. A new flagship synthesiser, 
Peak, was launched to much acclaim.
Focusrite continues to build demand for 
products designed for a professional 
audience and business enterprises, 
namely the RedNet and Red ranges. 
A Focusrite Pro team has been formed to 
develop the professional and commercial 
sales channels, as well as bringing 
better focus to product development and 
marketing to these specialist vertical 
markets that include broadcast, post-
production, education and entertainment 
facilities. This market segment is seen as 
an exciting growth opportunity where our 
investment in this segment over recent 
years is expected to pay off handsomely.
I am delighted Focusrite Plc has delivered 
another strong year of growth. Our 
foundations as a company that has a 
history at the leading edge of music 
technology innovation, with an 
established, global customer base for its 
market-leading brands and a strong 
culture, make us well placed for further 
growth. The Company has no debt, 
continues to be highly cash-generative 
and continues to consider acquisition 
opportunities that would complement the 
existing business.
I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank our employees, manufacturing 
partners, distribution partners 
and professional advisers for their 
contributions to our success.

Market Context
A Rising Generation 
of New Customers
A recent survey of our customer 
base confirmed what we believed, 
that our customers are starting to 
produce and record music at an 
ever-younger age. 3% are aged 
between 13 and 17 while 18–25 
year olds account for 22%. 26–34 
year olds account for 21%, the 
same percentage as 35–44 year 
olds. 45–54 year olds account for 
18% while 55–65 year olds still 
account for 13% and 3% are 
those customers aged over 65 (it’s 
never too late to make music!).
These are very promising 
statistics suggesting that we have 
the potential opportunity to 
engage people for their entire 
adult lifetimes.
Music technology now features 
in music education from the age 
of 14 in many schools and is in 
increasing demand at colleges 
and universities around the world, 
many hosting extensive recording 
and performance complexes. 
This development is driving 
the demand from students 
themselves to invest in audio 
interfaces and production 
hardware/software while the 
faculties themselves are an 
important customer segment, 
for teaching equipment and 
audio infrastructure, that we 
are successfully addressing.

Worldwide leader 
with room to grow
Four highly successful brands (Focusrite, Focusrite Pro, 
Novation and Ampify) with global distribution and industry 
recognition in their respective verticals.
• Distributed in approximately 
160 countries.
• Number one in sales of audio 
interfaces but, overall, only 
approximately 1 1% market share 
across all ranges as the Group 
enters new markets.
• Moved successfully into post, 
broadcast and live sound 
markets with RedNet audio 
networking.
• Introduced iOS apps with over 
7.5 million downloads to date.
• Disrupting how new music  
is made with grids, groove 
stations and apps.
Focusrite
The Focusrite brand of home and mobile 
audio interfaces is the largest selling 
brand of audio interfaces in the world. Our 
Scarlett range, now with a global market 
share of approximately 50%, continues 
to lead the industry in both innovation, 
sound quality and ease of use. Extending 
our range is the Clarett line, which offers 
our customers even more features and 
capabilities for their production needs.
Focusrite Pro
Designed, tested and supported with 
professional audio facilities front of 
mind, our Red and RedNet products 
are taking centre stage in many of the 
largest post production facilities, and 
on media arts campuses, and live and 
broadcast stages all around the world. 
A dedicated product, sales and support 
team who understand the requirements 
and ever-evolving workflow challenges 
in these environments, Focusrite Pro 
leads the way in implementing AOIP.
Novation
Our widely acclaimed Novation brand is a 
market leader in keyboard controllers and 
grid-based controllers and instruments. 
‘Launchpadding’ and Groove Stations 
are now common terms in the world of 
electronic music, enabling anyone to 
create electronic music with little or no 
computer or classical music know-how. 
These innovative electronic instruments 
are great enablers for us to continue to 
increase our core customer base and 
bring the art of music making to people 
all around the world. Our portfolio of 
keyboard controllers provide deep, 
unique integration with the most popular 
music creation software titles (including 
our own). Rounding out the Novation 
brand is our new flagship synthesiser, 
Peak, catering to the most discerning 
professional electronic musicians.
Ampify
Ampify is our software division, creating 
and marketing a world-class suite of 
creative applications to inspire anyone 
to create their own music. Intuitive 
and importantly requiring no previous 
music education or additional gear, 
our apps such as Launchpad, Blocs 
Wave and Groovebox open up the 
world of electronic music creation to 
anyone with an iOS device. Utilising a 
freemium model, our apps have had 
over 7.5 million downloads and an active 
user base of approximately 550,000. Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 08
Chief Executive’s Statement
A refined growth 
strategy
This is my first full year report, having joined the Company in 
January 2017, and I am delighted to update shareholders on 
another year of operational and financial success. 
Introduction
It has been another busy and productive 
year, during which we have expanded 
our product portfolio; launched two 
new brands; and refined our growth 
strategy to optimise our expansion 
opportunities now and for the future.
Focusrite is a business I knew well before 
I joined; with a well-earned reputation 
for high-quality products and a history 
of innovation and disruption, and I was 
honoured and proud to be asked to 
lead the Company into its next phase of 
growth. One of the primary factors that 
led to my decision to join the Company 
was the passion that came through 
from the employees. Many of our people 
are musicians, audio engineers, or DJs 
themselves and they use our products 
in real-world environments every week, 
bringing to work a real drive to push the 
boundaries of modern-day audio production. 
Our employee footprint continues to 
expand in our High Wycombe, London, 
Los Angeles and Hong Kong offices, as 
well as with remote employees all over the 
globe. It is a great pleasure and privilege 
to help guide and lead them and I thank 
them for their hard work and dedication.
Overview
The Group’s products are now sold 
in approximately 160 territories and 
countries all over the world. We utilise 
an effective mix of retailers – online and 
‘bricks and mortar’ locations, distributors 
in areas where localisation is a factor, 
a hybrid approach in the USA utilising 
a distributor with our own demand 
generation team, and direct business 
to consumer with our own e-commerce 
store and in-app software purchases.
We sold approximately 800,000 physical 
products to end-users last year, and our 
music creation apps were downloaded 2.7 
million times with around 700,000 in-app 
customer transactions. Our manufacturing 
partners are located in South China and 
we use third-party logistics support. 
We employ around 190 people in the 
UK, USA, Germany and Hong Kong.
This is a business of considerable 
scale with scope for further growth 
and our market position, products, 
people and customer base are the 
envy of many in the industry.
The market
The global audio production market 
continues to grow and we believe we 
remain well poised to increase our 
market share with existing products 
and also to exploit opportunities to 
expand into adjacent product categories 
that would make commercial sense 
and are a strategic fit for our existing 
business. This can be done organically 
and, when it makes commercial and 
economic sense, by acquisition.
For many personal and professional 
audio recording customers, Focusrite 
technology and solutions are a 
cornerstone of their set-ups and 
creative workflows. We know that puts 
Tim Carroll
Chief Executive Officer Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 09
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
us in a unique position to expand our 
offerings and participate in more of the 
economic value chain. Alongside that, 
we recognise the opportunity to continue 
to make audio recording technology 
easier to use and more accessible 
to a larger addressable market.
Operating review
This year has seen further operational 
progress and this has translated 
into financial success with careful 
management of our cost base and a 
focus on cash generation. Revenues grew 
by 21.6% to £66.1 million, delivering 
an operating profit of £9.5 million, 
representing year-on-year growth of 
32.6%. These results were materially 
ahead of forecasts and represent a 
very pleasing outcome for the Group.
This positive performance has been 
driven by a number of factors, including 
a wider market acceptance and growth 
of share in many of our core products; 
along with a suite of new innovative 
offerings, giving us more depth to 
our portfolio and the opportunity to 
sell more to our customer base.
The Group continues to penetrate new 
market segments and price points with 
best-in-class, user-friendly products. 
Customer and sales channel satisfaction 
feedback remains strong on new and 
existing products and continued high 
levels of end-user satisfaction are 
illustrated by our top net promotor 
scores for individual products.
Focusrite
Within Focusrite, our Scarlett, Clarett 
and RedNet ranges all grew, leading 
to total segment revenue growth of 
18.6%. In each category we increased 
market share and experienced 
growth beyond the industry norms.
Sales of our second generation Scarlett 
USB audio interface range, upgraded 
and launched in June last year, were 
particularly strong. The Scarlett 
family has earned the reputation as 
a best-in-class, premium solution at 
affordable pricing. This product line 
remains the number one selling audio 
interface product in the world.
The Clarett range continues to set 
new price/performance standards 
in our mid-range interface offerings 
and, with an advanced set of features 
catered to creative professionals, we 
are very pleased to see that Clarett 
has been warmly received and enjoyed 
numerous accolades from the industry.
Our commercial and pro-audio range, 
led by RedNet, is gaining momentum 
as applications for its use and potential 
customers grow, especially in post-
production, education and broadcast 
markets. This year we have witnessed 
some of the top production facilities in the 
world transition their entire infrastructure 
to RedNet and reap numerous benefits 
in efficiency, costs and productivity.
During the year we also launched the 
Focusrite Pro brand to support our 
growing Red/RedNet business and bring 
key sales talent and focus to this market. 
This additional investment will continue 
next year. We believe that our portfolio of 
professional AOIP solutions are well 
poised to become industry standards in 
post-production, broadcast, installed and 
live sound.
Novation
The Novation segment now consists of 
Novation and Ampify, the Group’s own 
software brand.
Launchpad, Launchkey, and the synthesiser 
product categories all experienced 
accelerated sales growth, with overall 
growth in this business segment of 37.8%.
Wider market acceptance of grid-based 
controllers in the electronic music space, 
coupled with larger penetration from online 
distribution channels such as Amazon, has 
driven demand for Launchpad. This 
product range experienced significant 
worldwide uplift in demand with year-on-
year sales volume growth of 39.0%.
Our Launchkey family of keyboard 
controllers also enjoyed significant uplift 
in worldwide demand, with its intuitive 
feature set and extensive integrated 
control features with top music-making 
software such as Ableton Live. Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 10
Chief Executive’s Statement continued
small when seen as a percentage of total 
Group revenue, but growing significantly 
year-on-year as we continue to increase 
our library of in-app purchases for these 
customers. Our apps consistently rank in 
the top ten for music creation tools on 
Apple’s app store and are currently 
displayed in Apple stores worldwide. We 
recently launched Groovebox – ‘a new 
beats and synth music studio’ for iPad and 
iPhone – and to date it has had over 
200,000 downloads and is growing fast.
Innovation
Innovation is key driver of growth and 
we continue to spend around 6% 
to 7% of revenue on research and 
development so as to provide a constant 
stream of new and relevant products 
for our various customer channels.
Our new flagship synthesiser, Peak, 
has seen widespread adoption within 
the professional music community 
and won numerous accolades from 
the industry as a true next-generation 
synthesiser; building off the legacy 
of the Novation brand and its many 
famous earlier synthesiser products.
During the year we rebranded our apps 
division to Ampify: a brand on which we will 
continue to develop powerful audio 
software tools for new customers and our 
existing customers alike. We are investing 
substantially in Ampify, as we aim to grow 
the Company’s own software capability. 
This investment is starting to be rewarded 
with operational progress and we now have 
three music-making apps with around 
550,000 active users. Revenues are still 
 
“  By improving the 
product and customer 
experience we will seek 
to extend the customer 
life cycle, keeping them 
using our products 
longer throughout their 
music-making lifetime.” Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 11
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
During the year we launched eight 
new hardware and two new software 
products, including: Red 8 Pre, Clarett 
OctoPre, Scarlett OctoPre, Scarlett 
OctoPre Dynamic, iTrack One Pre 
and Circuit Components update.
These new products are across 
different price segments and target 
customer markets, giving us further 
penetration and reach. Feedback from 
the consumer, retailer and distribution 
channels has been positive and 
acceptance so far has been pleasing.
We continue to enhance our offerings 
with improved drivers, new tool sets and 
capabilities that make our solutions easier 
to install and use, netting us industry-
leading Net Promoter Scores and 
overall customer experience statistics.
Additionally, we have focused some 
of our development resources on the 
‘out-of-the-box’ experience for new 
customers, as we believe that ensuring 
customers have a great first experience 
with our products is paramount to our 
overall success and growth strategy.
Geographic overview
I am pleased to report that our success 
this past year was truly global and 
sales in all major regions grew.
The USA finished with a 30.9% rise 
in revenue when compared with last 
year. Europe experienced 11.4% 
growth. Finally, the Rest of the World 
(incorporating Asia, Latin America 
and Canada) finished the year with 
24.9% year-on-year growth.
The USA market, the largest market for 
our portfolio and currently 42% of total 
Group sales, remains a key focus for our 
sales efforts and we continue to expand 
the team in our Los Angeles office.
In Europe, where we saw increased 
competition between the major 
continental resellers, our growth 
was lower than our other regions 
but still ahead of industry 
averages in our segment.
Within the Rest of the World, Asia-Pacific 
sales were strong across most countries, 
especially in China, and our Hong 
Kong office is now fully functional and 
integrated with our Company systems. 
Additionally, we are investing in more 
sales talent to scale for what we believe 
is still a large opportunity in this region.
Finally, Latin America and Canada 
both had healthy growth and we 
will continue to invest in resources 
and tools to grow these regions 
into this next year and beyond.
Distribution and logistics initiatives
Focusrite’s distribution of adjacent 
products, such as KRK monitors and 
sE Electronics microphones, remains a 
small overall proportion of Group revenue. 
It remains important to us as it offers 
add-on products within the music-making 
industry and provides us with invaluable 
market feedback, insight and knowledge.
e-commerce initiatives
The Group’s e-commerce store, which 
launched in March last year, accounted 
for over 1% of the Group’s revenue 
and this continues to improve. With a 
global presence but specific emphasis 
on markets where localised content, 
language support and swift delivery 
to end-users are key to success, we 
believe this segment will grow further.
Summary and outlook
We are focused on three core goals: 
growing our customer base; increasing 
the lifetime value of our customers; 
and expanding into new market 
segments both from a price and product 
perspective. To achieve this we will 
continue to innovate, disrupt, grow our 
audience and ultimately continue in 
our tradition of making the creative 
process of music creation and audio

Although competitive pressures remain 
strong, changes in technology and new

keeping abreast of these risks in order to 
continue to deliver strong growth.
Since the year end, revenue and cash

Disrupt
The art of audio production continues to go through a period of profound change. How music 
and audio is created, and the formats in which it is delivered, evolve continuously. Focusrite has 
been at the forefront of these sweeping changes for decades. Disruptive products like our 
Scarlett Gen 2 audio interfaces, Launchpad and iOS music apps have removed many barriers 
of entry to the new music maker, democratising the art of music creation. Our RedNet portfolio 
of professional solutions has afforded audio facilities across the globe to scale and deploy 
audio networks in ways unimaginable just a few years ago. We believe disruption is a key 
element in growing our core customer base and differentiating ourselves.

Financial Review
Growing, profitable 
and cash-generative
The Group has had an excellent year, with revenue growth of 
21.6% leading to higher growth in profit and cash.
Overview
The Group has had an excellent 
year, with revenue growth of 21.6%, 
adjusted EBITDA growth of 27.9% and 
adjusted diluted earnings per share 
up by 29.8%. In addition, the Group 
has managed working capital tightly, 
leading to good cash generation.
Income statement
Revenue
Revenue grew from £54.3 million 
to £66.1 million, a rise of 21.6%. 
Since 2009, when the Group 
revenue was £9.1 million, the Group 
has grown revenue every year at 
a growth rate of at least 10%.
The largest segment, Focusrite, grew 
by 18.6%, from £37.6 million to £44.6 
million, as the second generation of the 
Scarlett range continued to gain market 
share following its launch in June 2016. 
Scarlett is approximately three-quarters 
of the Focusrite segment by revenue 
and the Group has developed related 
ranges of products such as Clarett 
and RedNet, which are diversifying the 
Focusrite segment as they also grow and 
establish themselves in their markets.
The Novation segment consists of 
Novation and Ampify, the Group’s new 
software brand. The combined revenue 
was £18.9 million, up 37.8% on £13.7 
million last year. The Novation segment 
is relatively diverse: the largest range is 
Launchpad, which is approximately half 
of the segment revenue and, for which, 
demand grew strongly. Approximately 
a quarter of segment revenue is the 
Launchkey range and the remainder 
is split between synthesisers, Circuit 
and the remaining products.
In the UK, the Group distributes products 
such as microphones and monitors 
manufactured by other organisations. 
Revenue was £2.6 million, down 
13.6% from £3.1 million in 2016.
All regions grew. Regionally, the USA 
is the largest market in the music 
industry and the largest market for the 
Group’s products. Revenue in the USA 
grew 30.9% (constant currency: 18%) 
to £28.0 million, Europe grew 11.4% 
(constant currency: 7%) to £25.2 million 
and the Rest of the World grew by 24.9% 
(constant currency: 13%) to £12.9 
million. The primary drivers of growth in 
the USA were the further consolidation 
of the Scarlett range in the market and 
strong growth of Novation. In Europe, 
there was increased competition between 
the major continental resellers which 
held back growth. In the Rest of the 
World, the major portion of the revenue 
is in Asia, which continues to grow as

the new regional sales office in Hong 
Kong becomes more established.
Exchange rates were important this 
year. In essence, in FY16 there were 
ten months ‘pre-Brexit’ and two months 
post. Therefore, there was a more 
pronounced effect this year of the 
stronger US Dollar and Euro. At constant 
currency, revenue grew by 13%.
Gross profit
Gross profit increased to £26.4 million, 
up from £20.9 million in FY16. This 
represented a gross margin of 39.9% 
(FY16: 38.4%). This growth in gross 
margin was driven by several factors: 
closer attention paid to the fluctuations of 
market prices and then management of 
discounts given to resellers; the stronger 
Euro and a minor range mix impact.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses consist of sales, 
marketing, operations, the uncapitalised 
element of research and development 
and central functions such as legal, 
finance and the Group Board. These 
expenses were £16.9 million, up from 
£13.7 million last year. Directionally, 
the greater growth was on sales and 
marketing as the Group invested, via the 
profit and loss account, in key initiatives 
such as the Asia office and e-commerce.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 27.9% 
to £13.1 million (FY16: £10.2 million).
In FY17, there were no non-underlying 
costs. In FY16, there was a non-underlying 
cost of £0.5 million due to legal disputes 
relating to intellectual property and 
distribution contracts, which have no 
significant effect on our ongoing business. 
All of these legal disputes have now been 
resolved, with no further cost to the Group.
Foreign exchange and hedging
The Brexit vote in June 2016 changed 
the exchange rates substantially 
but there has been greater stability 
since then. Therefore, the average 
exchange rates show a strengthening 
of US Dollar and Euro, whereas the 
year-end rates are more similar.
Exchange rates 2017 2016
Average
USD:GBP 1.27 1.45
EUR:GBP 1.16 1.29
Year end
USD:GBP 1.29 1.31
EUR:GBP 1.09 1.18
The Group buys product in US Dollars 
and approximately 60% of its revenue is 
in US Dollars so there is a natural hedge. 
Therefore, the US Dollar strengthening 
from $1.45 to $1.27 increased revenue 
but had little effect on gross profit.

Approximately a quarter of revenue is in 
Euro but little cost. The Group enters into 
forward contracts to convert Euro to GBP. 
In FY16, approximately three-quarters 
of Euro flows were hedged at €1.39, 
thereby creating a blended exchange 
rate of approximately €1.37. In FY17, the 
equivalent hedging contracts were at 
€1.28 (a blended rate of approximately 
€1.26). For FY18, the equivalent rate 
for the forward contracts is €1.12.
Hedge accounting is used, meaning 
that the hedging contracts have been 
matched to income flows and, providing 
the hedging contracts remain effective, 
movements in fair value are shown in a 
hedging reserve in the balance sheet, 
until the hedge transaction occurs.
Corporation tax
Corporation tax as a proportion of profit 
before tax was 10.1% (FY16: 12.2%). 
The effective tax rate is lower than the 
headline rate, largely due to enhanced 
tax relief on R&D, a small element of 
vesting share options and a lower than 
expected payment in the prior year. 
In addition, the UK headline tax rate 
has been reduced by 1 percentage 
point to 19% within the last year. Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 22
Financial Review continued
Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share for the 
year was 15.4 pence, up 30.5% from 
11.8 pence in FY16. This rise was driven 
largely by the rise in profit and the 
fact that there were no non-underlying 
items in FY17. The more comparable 
measure, excluding non-underlying items 
and including the small dilutive effect 
of share options, is adjusted diluted 
earnings per share. This was 14.8 pence, 
up 29.8% from 11.4 pence in FY16.
Balance sheet
Non-current assets
The non-current assets comprise mainly 
capitalised R&D costs. Between 70% and 
80% of R&D costs are capitalised and 
they are amortised over three years. The 
typical product life is three to six years. 
This policy is unchanged from last year.
Working capital
Working capital fell from 22.4% of 
revenue to 19.1%. The main driver of this 
reduction was stock, which was reduced 
from £11.4 million to £8.3 million. The 
reduction in stock was achieved through 
lower levels of safety stock and the 
rising sales of new products, launched 
in FY15 and FY16, for which the Group 
had bought larger initial quantities to 
protect against possible ‘stock-outs’ 
should demand have risen more quickly 
than expected. As commented on in last 
year’s Annual Report, stock quantities 
have been reduced as the demand 
pattern for these products has become 
more predictable. There have been no 
significant changes in payment terms 
relating to either customers or suppliers.
Cash flow
Cash at the year end was £14.2 million, 
up from £9.4 million at the half year 
and £5.6 million at 31 August 2016, 
driven by the higher profit and lower 
working capital explained previously. 
Free cash flow was strong, at £9.4 
million (FY16: £0.2 million), which 
represented 14.3% of revenue (FY16: 
0.4%). Finally, the Group has a £10 
million revolving credit facility with HSBC.

Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend 
of 1.95 pence per share (FY16 final 
dividend: 1.3 pence), which would result 
in a total of 2.7 pence per share for the 
year (FY16: 1.95 pence). At this level, 
the dividend is covered approximately 
5.5 times by earnings. This represents 
the first step towards an ongoing 
target dividend cover of between 4 
and 5 times. The Group is focused on, 
and investing in, future growth and 
therefore maintains a strong dividend 
cover whilst maintaining a sustainable 
and progressive annual dividend.
Going concern
As required, the Board have considered 
the ability of the Group to continue as 
a going concern. The Board reviewed 
the cash position, the management of 
working capital, the strategic plans, the 
forecast cash flow and the borrowing 
arrangements and capacity. The Board 
have concluded that the Group will remain 
as a going concern and that this Annual 
Report should be prepared on that basis.
Summary
The Group has had an excellent year. 
Revenue has grown by 21.6%, adjusted 
EBITDA by 27.9%, adjusted diluted 
earnings per share by 29.8% and 
the cash balance has increased from 
£5.6 million to £14.2 million. The Board 
remains focused on extending our track 
record of growth in future years.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Risk factors
In common with all businesses, the Group faces risks, the 
effective management of which is necessary to enable it to 
achieve its strategic objectives and secure the resilience of the 
business for the long term. Management of risk is critical to the 
effective running of the business and is considered as part of the 
Group’s decision-making processes.
Risk area Description Mitigation
Economic environment The Group operates in the global economy 
and ultimately within a retail environment 
to consumer end-user musicians. Such 
operations are influenced by global 
and national economic factors.
The Group sells products in around 160 
territories worldwide via two distinct product 
categories and so aims to avoid being unduly 
reliant on any single product or territory.
UK exit from the European 
Union
The impact of the decision to exit the 
European Union remains uncertain. 
There has already been foreign exchange 
volatility and it is possible that, in future, 
the UK may not be part of the European 
free trade zone or the customs union.
The Group has increased selling prices in 
the UK to correct the imbalance caused 
by the significant foreign exchange rate 
changes. The Group will continue to monitor 
other possible effects of Brexit and act 
accordingly as they become known.
Technological changes, 
product innovation and 
competition
The market for the Group’s products is 
characterised by continued evolution in 
technology, evolving industry standards, 
changes in customer needs and frequent 
new competitive product introductions. If 
the Group is unable to anticipate or respond 
to these challenges, or fails to develop and 
introduce successful products on a timely 
basis, it could have an adverse impact on 
the Group’s business and prospects.
The Group invests significantly in its 
R&D and operates a rigorous, disciplined 
product introduction process to ensure 
that as far as possible the fast-changing 
needs of its target markets are met. 
In addition, the Board aims to operate 
an efficient, low-cost business.
Dependence on a small 
number of suppliers
The Group is dependent on a small number 
of suppliers, in particular its largest supplier, 
which supplies Focusrite interfaces. 
Failure or material delay by its suppliers to 
perform or failure by the Group to renew 
such arrangements could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business, 
operating results and financial position.
The Group aims to diversify its risk by using 
four major Chinese manufacturers for 
the production of its products. The Group 
maintains appropriate levels of insurance 
to mitigate the financial impacts of a 
failure of one of its suppliers. Relationships 
are long-lasting and strong. Typically, 
members of the operations department 
within Focusrite meet each supplier every 
quarter to review performance and costs.
Key resellers and 
distributors
In certain countries, the Group operates 
via a single distributor or has large 
individual reseller customers. In certain 
cases, a failure of or breakdown in the 
relationship with a key reseller or distributor, 
or even the failure of a major customer 
of that distributor, could significantly and 
adversely affect the Group’s business.
In cases where there is a large distributor in 
a significant market (e.g. the USA distributor 
purchased £28 million of stock in FY17), 
the Group also maintains relationships with 
the major retailers. In addition, the Group 
carefully monitors customer credit limits and 
has credit insurance which typically covers 
the majority of the customer debts

Risk area Description Mitigation
Development of the 
channels to market
Significant change in the methods 
by which end-users wish to buy 
Focusrite products could significantly 
affect the Group’s business.
The Group or its distributors sell to both 
‘bricks and mortar’ and e-commerce 
retailers so that the Group can satisfy 
customer demand via both methods.
Currency risks The Group is exposed to currency 
and exchange rate fluctuations, which 
may affect the Group’s revenue and 
costs when reported in Sterling.
There is a largely effective natural hedge 
for US Dollar transactions in as much 
as the Group uses its generation of 
US Dollars to buy product in US Dollars. 
In addition, the Group mitigates its 
Euro exposure by entering into forward 
foreign exchange hedging contracts for 
the conversion of Euros to Sterling.
Scarcity of experienced 
technical personnel
The nature of the Group’s business 
requires its employees in the technical 
and development teams to be highly 
skilled and experienced in their respective 
fields. The Group is dependent for its 
continued success on being able to 
hire and retain such individuals.
The Group is a leading music industry 
company in the UK and so attracts 
high-quality technical personnel. The 
Group also attracts graduates from 
music technology courses at local 
universities. The Group has wide-ranging 
share ownership incentives and other 
employment benefits to aid retention.
Intellectual property and 
data protection
The intellectual property and data developed 
by the Group is valuable and the Group 
could be harmed by infringement or loss.
The Group has data and information 
technology controls which are reviewed by 
the Group Board. Additionally, the Group 
includes data protection provisions in the 
contracts of all Group employees. The 
Group also aims to protect its intellectual 
property and pursues infringements.
Information security Information security and cyber threats are 
currently a priority across all industries and 
remain a key Government agenda item.
The Group has carried out a detailed 
review of IT systems to identify elements 
requiring upgrade. There has already 
been a widespread upgrade of core IT 
functionality and the improvement of 
backup and disaster recovery processes. 
The Group has moved core ERP systems to 
cloud with robust SLAs in place to ensure 
data availability and security. There is an 
improving business continuity framework 
and a dedicated internal IT support team 
aided by external support providers. Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 26
Corporate Social Responsibility
‘Acting in a 
responsible and 
considerate way’
We have a duty to maintain the trust of the end-users of our 
products as well as our customers, suppliers, staff and other 
stakeholders by ensuring that we act with integrity at all times. 
Corporate social responsibility (‘CSR’) is a core part of 
that commitment. 
We recognise that by acting in a 
responsible and considerate way with 
everyone who comes into contact with 
us, we will positively impact both the 
societies we operate in and the music-
making communities that lie at the heart 
of our business, supporting the long-term 
value of Focusrite. Our CSR Policy builds 
on the foundations we have put in place 
to reduce our impact on the environment, 
ensuring we act as a responsible 
and fair employer and supporting the 
national and local community projects 
that our staff are involved in.
Impact on society
Focusrite carefully considers its social 
impact at both the local and global levels. 
Local initiatives include always trying to 
recruit locally to minimise commuting 
miles and encouraging employees living 
further afield to relocate locally, which 
in turn supports the local community.
Focusrite has successfully established 
and maintained links with educational 
establishments on a local and national 
level. Working with educational 
establishments is not a new concept 
for Focusrite. Since 1999 Focusrite 
has worked closely with a number 
of renowned universities. Each year 
Focusrite takes on approximately 
six third-year undergraduate interns 
and provides them with a year of 
intense work experience. Several of 
Focusrite’s current technical staff 
have been recruited as a result of this 
close relationship with universities.
Moving further afield, Focusrite works 
with four major Chinese contract 
manufacturers. Focusrite visits its 
contract manufacturers once every 
three months to check on compliance 
issues, manufacturing control and 
general relationship management.
Environmental impact
There are two aspects which Focusrite 
evaluates when assessing environmental 
impact, the first being the environmental 
impact of the corporation and its activities 
and the second being the environmental 
impact of Focusrite’s products.
In terms of the environmental impact of 
the corporation there are a number of 
policies that have been introduced to 
lower any negative impacts. These include 
Focusrite supporting the government 
initiative of the cycle to work scheme, in 
which 16% of staff have participated.
Employees are encouraged to lower 
their carbon footprint by lift sharing, 
and there is an unofficial car pool 
scheme for those who live in the local 
area, which is used on a daily basis.
In terms of waste, Focusrite is 
registered for WEEE and Focusrite 
has deployed recycling bins in every 
office and communal work area with 
shredding bins for secure waste.
Focusrite has also stopped using 
alkaline (non-rechargeable) batteries 
across the Group and has replaced 
these with high-capacity nickel metal 
hydride (rechargeable) batteries.
Focusrite has started to conduct video 
conferencing for international meetings 
that has resulted in a reduction in 
the annual number of international 
flights undertaken by employees.
The packaging for Focusrite 
products has been designed to have 
minimal environmental impact and 
Focusrite has substituted the use of 
expanded polyethylene foam with 
moulded recycled pulp paper.
All Focusrite products which rely on 
mains power comply with all current 
power efficiency directives and 
either have internal high-efficiency 
switchable power supplies or external 
high-efficiency power supplies.
Relations with suppliers, partners 
and contractors
Whilst price will always play an important 
part in the commercial decision-making 
of Focusrite in terms of suppliers, 
partners and contractors, it is by no 
means the only significant consideration. 
Focusrite prides itself not only on 
what it does but the way that it does 
it and this must also be true for those 
third parties with which it partners.
Examples of this include a strategic 
partnership with Kuehne + Nagel, which 
provides inbound and outbound third-
party logistics to Focusrite. Kuehne  Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 27
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
+ Nagel is committed to lowering 
the negative environmental impact of 
its operations as well as maximising 
the positive social impact. It achieves 
this by reviewing each shipment to 
determine the most efficient methods of 
transporting products, both inbound and 
outbound. Focusrite forward plans the 
production and shipment of its products 
so that air freight is rarely required.
The electricity supplier to Focusrite 
is Total, which has demonstrated a 
true year-on-year reduction in CO
2
 
emissions from its power stations, 
transportation and from its own 
offices. The fact that Total states that 
sustainability is its business, its strategy 
and its future aligns it well with the 
sustainability ethos of Focusrite.
Focusrite’s choice of Chinese contract 
manufacturers is critical to the 
business, not only in terms of quality 
of manufacture but also in terms of 
social responsibility and sustainability. 
An example of this is our largest 
manufacturer, which is ISO 9002, TS 
9000, ISO 9001:2000, ISO 14001, TL 
9001, ISO 13488 and TS 16949 certified, 
as well as having a commitment to 
providing a safe working environment for 
its 4,000 contract manufacturing staff.
Slavery and human trafficking
Focusrite is committed to ensuring that 
there is no modern slavery or human 
trafficking in its supply chain or any part 
of its business. The Focusrite Anti-Slavery 
Policy, as published on the Group’s 
website, reflects the commitment to 
acting ethically and with integrity in all 
the Group’s business relationships and 
to implementing and enforcing effective 
systems and controls to ensure slavery 
and human trafficking is not taking 
place anywhere in its supply chain.
All Focusrite contract manufacturers 
operate with a minimum accreditation of 
ISO 9001 and ISO 14001. Our largest 
manufacturer also holds SA 8000 
and OHSAS 18001 accreditation with 
a strong, active CSR programme in 
place to improve worker engagement, 
health and safety. All of Focusrite’s 
contract manufacturers are responsible 
employers which comply with local 
employment law and provide good 
working and living conditions for 
their staff. As part of the ongoing 
relationship with these manufacturers, 
senior members of the Group visit each 
supplier around four times per year. 
These visits include inspection of the 
production lines, the people working 
on those production lines and their 
working, eating and living conditions 
to ensure that they are acceptable.
To ensure a high level of understanding 
of the risks of modern slavery and 
human trafficking in our supply chains 
and our business, we provide training to 
our staff. An introduction to our modern 
slavery and human trafficking practices 
and policies forms part of the induction 
process for each new member of staff.
Relations with employees
Whilst Focusrite has clear leadership and 
reporting structures in place, it enjoys 
a flat hierarchy amongst its staff. This 
approach, together with an ‘open door’ 
policy, means that anyone at any time can 
talk to any of the Directors to raise any 
matters for discussion, ask questions or 
share ideas. The fluidity of knowledge-
sharing in the Group is one of its core 
strengths and that, together with the true 
sense that all staff are members of the 
Focusrite family, means that challenges 
can often turn into opportunities.
Focusrite has been awarded a three star 
accreditation (the highest possible) six 
years in a row from Best Companies, 
the organisation which conducts and 
manages The Sunday Times 100 
Best Small Companies to Work For. 
To assist in the dynamic flow of 
knowledge within the Group, Focusrite 
has an internal Company blog, WIKI, 
and message board for the sharing of 
ideas, information and best practice.
Focusrite staff enjoy the use of a fully 
subsidised kitchen for both breakfast 
and lunch, as well as free coffee, tea and 
biscuits throughout the working day.
To ensure that both employees 
and Focusrite are getting the 
best out of each other, there are 
formal employee assessments 
on an annual basis and informal 
assessments throughout the year.
The Group has a comprehensive 
documented Health and Safety Policy 
in place which is reviewed by the 
Compliance Committee regularly.
The Group has implemented a Whistle-
Blowing Policy. All employees are clear 
that they are able to contact the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or 
either of the Non-executive Directors of 
the Group if they have an issue which 
they feel they cannot discuss with their 
immediate manager.
Relations with customers
Focusrite has three types of customer: 
distributor, retailer and end-user. Ultimately, 
Focusrite makes product for the end-users 
of those products and that is where its 
customer attention is most acutely focused. 
Communicating with end-users is realised 
through direct e-communications, social 
media sites and YouTube channels. 
Relevance and authenticity are the 
hallmarks of Focusrite’s end-user 
communication strategy, with industry-
leading videos as the primary medium for 
content. A genuine bi-directional line of 
communication with swift response rates 
has helped to grow Focusrite’s social media 
channels, most notably with the Novation 
brand. With paid advertising on social 
media kept relatively low, investments are 
instead made in the generation of strong 
relevant content that the community shares 
organically. Social media channels include 
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Periscope, 
Google+ and YouTube.
Both the Focusrite and Novation brands 
have worldwide recognition as being 
class-leading. With over 10% of the 
Group’s staff dedicated to end-user 
customer support, Focusrite makes sure 
that the users of its products have the 
best possible experience.
The customer support team meets weekly 
to discuss end-user, distributor and retailer 
topics which have come up during the 
week and review past topics. The customer 
support team also relays this information 
directly to the R&D team, either to effect 
improved usability of a product or to 
influence future product innovation and 
design.
The Strategic Report has been approved 
by the Directors and signed by order of 
the Board.

Corporate Governance Report
The Company was admitted to trading on AIM in December 
2014. Accordingly, compliance with the governance framework 
contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code published by 
the Financial Reporting Council (the ‘Code’) is not currently 
mandatory. Nevertheless, the Board remains committed to high 
standards of corporate governance and endeavours to comply 
with the Code to the extent practicable for a public company of 
its size. Furthermore, the Board confirms that it has complied 
with the QCA Corporate Governance Guidelines (as devised by 
the QCA in consultation with a number of significant institutional 
small company investors), to the extent appropriate and 
practicable for a company of its nature and size.
Board of Directors and Board Committees
The Board comprises five Directors, of whom three are 
Executives and two Non-executives, and reflects a blend of 
different experience and backgrounds. The Board considers the 
two Non-executive Directors to be independent. Biographical 
details of all the Directors at the date of this Report are set out 
on pages 28 to 29.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate. The 
Chairman leads Board meetings and Board discussions and has 
responsibility for the Board’s overall effectiveness. The Chief 
Executive is responsible for the achievement of the Group’s 
strategic and commercial objectives, within the context of the 
Group’s resources and the risk tolerances laid down by the 
Board. The Board is responsible to shareholders and provides 
leadership and direction to the Group. It is the role of the Board 
to set the strategic direction and goals of the Group within the 
risk tolerances and control mechanisms the Board believes are 
appropriate.
The Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its 
consideration which includes, but is not limited to, matters of 
strategy, risk management, consideration and approval of 
financial budgets, major capital expenditure decisions, 
acquisitions and disposals, approval of the interim and final 
results and the recommendation of any dividends.
An Executive Committee (known as the Operations Board) 
supports the Board in implementing strategy and reports 
relevant matters to the Board for its consideration and approval. 
This Executive Committee comprises the three Executive 
Directors and six members of senior management.
All the Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
General Counsel and Company Secretary, who are responsible 
for ensuring compliance with applicable rules, regulations and 
Board procedures. Individual Directors have the right to request 
that any concerns they have are recorded in the appropriate 
Committee or Board minutes.
The Board has arranged a schedule of meetings to consider 
strategy, performance and the framework of internal controls 
and will both support and challenge the management team to 
deliver the objectives set. The Board has established Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees with formally 
delegated duties and responsibilities. The terms of reference 
for these Committees are available on the Company’s website. 
To enable the Board and its Committees to discharge their 
responsibilities, the Directors receive appropriate and timely 
information. Briefing papers are distributed to all Directors in 
advance of Board and Committee meetings. The Directors all 
have access to independent advice, if required, in respect of 
their duties from a variety of professional advisers. The 
Company maintains an appropriate Directors’ and Officers’ 
insurance policy in respect of any legal actions against the 
Directors and Officers.
Re-election of Directors
The Company’s Articles provide that one-third of the Directors 
for the time being (excluding any Director appointed since the 
previous AGM) or, if their number is not divisible by three, the 
number nearest to but not exceeding one-third, shall retire 
from office by rotation. However, it has been decided that all 
Directors should be subject to annual election by shareholders.
Information and professional development
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that Directors receive 
a comprehensive induction including:
• an overview of the Group;
• briefings on Directors’ regulatory and compliance 
responsibilities;
• detailed reviews of strategic projects and initiatives under 
way; and
• one-to-one meetings with senior managers.
Directors are encouraged to keep abreast of developments and 
attend training courses to assist them with their duties.
In order that Directors continue to further their understanding 
of the issues facing the Group and are able to challenge 
constructively and help develop proposals on strategy, the Board 
receives regular business presentations from members of the 
Operations Board on strategy and performance.
In addition to the formal meetings of the Board, the Chairman 
is available to the Non-executive Directors to discuss any issues 
of concern they may have relating to the Group or as regards 
their area of responsibility and to keep them fully briefed on 
ongoing matters relating to the Group’s operations.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that new Directors 
each receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining 
the Board. Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 33
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Meetings of the Board and its Committees
The above table sets out the number of meetings of the Board 
and its Committees during the year under review and individual 
attendance by the relevant members at these meetings.
In the event that Directors are unable to attend a meeting, their 
comments on the business to be considered at the meeting are 
discussed with the Chairman ahead of the meeting so that their 
contribution can be included in the wider Board discussion.
Board Committees
As noted above, the Board has three principal Committees with 
clearly defined terms of reference. The members of the 
Committees and their duties are set out below.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its 
responsibilities, within agreed terms of reference, with regard 
to corporate governance, financial reporting and external and 
internal audits and controls.
This includes, amongst other things, reviewing the Group’s interim 
and annual financial statements and reviewing the auditor’s 
findings from the audit including discussions with the auditor 
without executive management being present. The interim and 
annual reporting processes also include review of key risks, going 
concern, judgements and significant accounting policies.
The areas of risk, or areas requiring judgement, reviewed during 
the year included revenue recognition, inventory valuation 
and provisions, debtor provisions, capitalisation and impairment 
of intangible assets, non-underlying costs, share option 
accounting, the tax charge, management override of controls 
and alternative performance measures. In each case, the Audit 
Committee concluded that there was an appropriate 
management of risk and financial judgement made.
The Committee’s work also includes the appointment of external 
auditors, the agreement and approval of their audit plan and 
fees, reviewing and monitoring the extent of the non-audit 
services undertaken by external auditors. Additionally, the Audit 
Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls and risk management systems.
The Group’s internal audit work during the year focused on the 
replacement of the core enterprise business systems, including 
the management information system and the payroll system. 
Areas of perceived higher financial control risk were identified 
and internal reviews carried out so that the replacement system 
could address current control weaknesses. The resultant 
findings and recommendations were documented, discussed 
with local management and then the final reports presented to 
the Audit Committee for their review. The Committee believes 
that the Group’s internal review processes are appropriate for 
a group of this size and complexity, and will continue to assess 
this on an ongoing basis.
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the 
Annual Report and Accounts and the half-yearly reports remains 
with the Board. Membership of the Audit Committee comprises 
the two independent Directors and is chaired by Paul Dean. The 
Executive Directors are normally invited to attend. The Audit 
Committee meets formally not less than three times every year 
and otherwise as required.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible, within agreed 
terms of reference, for establishing a formal and transparent 
procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration and 
for setting the remuneration packages of individual Directors. 
This includes agreeing with the Board the framework for 
remuneration of the Executive Directors, the General Counsel 
and the Executive Management Team. It is furthermore 
responsible for determining the total individual remuneration 
packages of each Director including, where appropriate, 
bonuses, incentive payments and share options. No Director 
may be involved in any decision as to their own remuneration. 
The membership of the Remuneration Committee comprises the 
two independent Directors and the Committee is chaired by 
David Bezem. The Remuneration Committee meets not less 
than twice a year and at such other times as the Chairman of 
the Committee shall require.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee has responsibility for reviewing the 
structure, size and composition of the Board and recommending 
to the Board any changes required, for succession planning, 
and for identifying and nominating for approval of the Board 
candidates to fill vacancies as and when they arise. The 
Committee is also responsible for reviewing the results of 
any Board performance evaluation process and making 
recommendations to the Board concerning the Board’s 
Committees and the re-election of Directors at the AGM. 
Membership of the Nomination Committee comprises the two 
independent Directors and Phil Dudderidge. The Committee is 
chaired by David Bezem.
The Nomination Committee meets not less than once a year and 
at such other times as the Chairman of the Committee shall 
require. Following Dave Froker’s decision to retire at the end of 
2016, the Nomination Committee led the process to appoint his 
successor with the assistance of Odgers Berndtson, an 
international executive search firm.

Board evaluation
During 2017, the Nomination Committee undertook a formal 
evaluation of the Board. It was noted that the Board was 
continuing to function in a satisfactory manner. It was also noted 
that there were only two Non-executive Directors compared with 
three Executive Directors and it was agreed to start the process 
to recruit a third Non-executive Director.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s systems of internal 
controls and, together with the Audit Committee, reviewing 
those systems. The systems put in place are designed to 
manage, limit and control risk but cannot eliminate all risk 
completely.
The Executive Directors of the Company are actively involved in 
the daily management of the operations of the Group. Business 
risks are regularly identified and appropriate control systems are 
implemented to manage those risks. Such systems are designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. Steps 
have been taken to embed internal control and risk management 
further into the operations of the business. The monthly results 
of each area of the business are reported, discussed and 
compared to forecast.
Auditor independence
The Audit Committee and the external auditor, KPMG LLP, have 
safeguards in place to avoid the possibility that the auditor’s 
objectivity and independence could be compromised. These 
safeguards include the Auditor’s Report to the Audit Committee 
on the actions they take to comply with the professional and 
regulatory requirements and best practice designed to ensure 
their independence from the Company. In addition, a formal 
policy for audit and non-audit services has been agreed by the 
Audit Committee, ensuring that there is appropriate high level 
authorisation before the auditor is engaged in providing a 
material non-audit service.
The overall performance and the independence of the auditor is 
reviewed annually by the Audit Committee, taking into account 
the views of management. The Audit Committee also has 
discussions with the auditor without management being present 
on the adequacy of controls and on any judgemental areas.
The annual appointment of the auditor by shareholders at the 
AGM is a fundamental safeguard of auditor independence. 
Beyond this, the Group has implemented an Audit Service Policy, 
compliant with the latest guidance, that considers whether 
additional work performed by the auditor may be appropriate for 
sound commercial and practical reasons, including confidentiality. 
Examples of work that would fall into this category include 
regulatory advice and financial due diligence work.
Shareholder relations and the AGM
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer meet 
analysts and institutional shareholders of the Company after the 
interim and annual results announcements and on an as-needed 
basis at other times in the year to update shareholders on the 
progress of the Group. Additionally, the Non-executive Directors 
are available to meet shareholders if requested.
The Directors encourage the participation of all shareholders, 
including private shareholders, at the AGM. The Annual Report 
and Accounts are published on the Company’s website, 
www.focusriteplc.com, and can be accessed by shareholders 
and potential investors.
Notice of the AGM will be sent to shareholders at least 21 clear 
days before the meeting. The voting results will be announced 
following the meeting.
The Company uses its corporate website (www.focusriteplc.com) 
to communicate with its institutional shareholders and private 
investors and posts the latest announcements, press releases 
and published financial information, together with market 
updates and other information about the Group.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
The Directors present their Report for the year ended 31 August 
2017 in accordance with section 415 of the Companies Act 
2006. Particulars of important events affecting the Group, 
together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report 
on pages 1 to 27 which is incorporated into this Report by 
reference together with the Corporate Governance Report 
on pages 32 to 34. In addition, this Report should be read 
in conjunction with information concerning employee share 
schemes, which can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on page 40 and in note 29 to the financial statements, 
and which is incorporated by way of cross-reference into the 
Directors’ Report. The Company did not make any political 
donations during the year.
Results and dividends
The results for the year are set out in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income on page 48. During the 
year, the Directors approved the payment of an interim dividend 
of 0.75 pence per share. Following the year end, the Directors 
assessed the appropriateness of the Group declaring a final 
dividend and are recommending that a dividend of 1.95 pence 
should be paid. This dividend recommendation shall be put to 
the shareholders to vote on at the AGM to be held on 
10 January 2018.
Directors
During the year, Dave Froker retired as Chief Executive Officer

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Introduction
I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ Remuneration Report (‘DRR’) for the year ended 31 August 2017, the third since the 
Company’s flotation on AIM. The main themes this year have been a very strong performance by the business, which have exceeded 
the testing targets set by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of the year, and the retirement of the CEO since the IPO, 
Dave Froker, and recruitment of his successor, Tim Carroll. Tim Carroll joined the Company at the beginning of January 2017. As a 
consequence of the necessary discipline required as part of such a senior and critical recruitment process, which was conducted on 
our behalf by Odgers Berndtson, the executive search consultants, the Committee reviewed the remuneration for both the CEO and 
Finance Director roles to ensure they were competitive, fair and appropriately aligned with shareholders’ interests. This took account 
of the detailed review of the Executive Directors’ and other senior management’s remuneration, which was carried out for us by 
Kepler Associates, now part of Mercer Limited, in 2015. The data from this was helpful in setting the fixed and variable components 
of their remuneration, both relatively and in relation to the wider market for quoted businesses of similar size, value and complexity, 
a process that began in the preceding financial year as reported in last year’s DRR. It remains the case that the Company puts a 
strong emphasis on variable remuneration and in particular share ownership by all staff including, but by no means limited to, the 
Executive Directors of the Company.
As a company admitted to AIM, Focusrite Group Plc is not required to prepare a DRR. However, the Board supports the principle of 
transparency and has therefore prepared this Report in order to provide useful information to shareholders on its executive remuneration 
arrangements. Accordingly, although not required to comply with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the ‘Regulations’), the Company has used these Regulations as guidance for presenting 
selected disclosures where it considers these to be relevant, helpful and appropriate. Accordingly, this Report sets out information about 
the remuneration of the Directors of the Company for the year ended 31 August 2017 and, as appropriate, the following year.
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are David Bezem (Chairman) and Paul Dean, who are both independent 
Non-executive Directors. Attendance at meetings of the Remuneration Committee by individual member is detailed in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 33.
The Executive Chairman, CEO, General Counsel and external advisers may be invited to attend meetings of the Remuneration 
Committee but do not take part in the decision-making. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the committee.
Terms of reference have been approved for the Remuneration Committee and are reviewed annually. The Committee’s primary 
responsibility is to determine, on behalf of the Board, the policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and such other 
members of the Executive Management Team of the Group as is deemed appropriate. The remuneration of the Non-executive 
Directors is a matter for the Chairman and the Executive members of the Board.
The Committee members have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. They have no 
conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships or from being involved in the day-to-day business of the Group. The Committee 
members do not participate in any bonus, share awards or pension arrangements.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee’s overarching aims in setting the Remuneration Policy are to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre senior 
management to focus them on the delivery of the Group’s strategic and business objectives; to promote a strong and sustainable 
performance culture; and to align the interests of Executive Directors and other senior managers with those of shareholders.
The remuneration package for each Executive Director is designed to include performance and non-performance-related elements. 
Non-performance elements include salary, taxable benefits and employer pension contributions. All other components of the 
remuneration package are performance-related and comprise a mixture of cash and share-based, and short and long-term 
incentives, as set out below.
The main elements of the remuneration packages for Executive Directors are:
• base salary;
• performance-related annual bonus;
• long-term share incentives;
• pension contribution; and
• benefits.
Directors’ Remuneration Report Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 38
Base salary
Base salaries for the Executive Directors are reviewed annually and determined taking account of individual performance, scope of 
responsibility, relative pay levels within the Group and reference to external market data as referred to above. This year differed in 
that Tim Carroll joined the Company part way through the year and therefore his base salary and other remuneration was agreed as 
part of that recruitment process. Phil Dudderidge’s and Jeremy Wilson’s base salaries for the year ended 31 August 2017 were 
increased by 2% over their base salaries in the preceding financial year. The Executive Directors’ base salaries are also being 
increased by 2% in the financial year ending 31 August 2018. The Non-executive Directors received the same inflationary 
increases as the Executive Directors.
The details of the Executive Directors’ base salaries for the 2017 financial year are set out in the table on page 41.
Performance-related annual bonus
Tim Carroll and Jeremy Wilson were awarded a performance-based discretionary annual bonus for the financial year ended 
31 August 2017. Phil Dudderidge does not receive an annual bonus. For both Tim Carroll and Jeremy Wilson the bonus was based 
on two tests, achieving EBITDA targets, which represented 70% of the maximum bonus, and achieving cash targets at the year end, 
which represented 30% of the maximum bonus. The tests operated independently of one another. The reason for introducing the 
year-end cash targets test was to ensure that there was a strong focus on managing working capital efficiently alongside the 
achievement of profits.
The maximum cash bonus for both Tim Carroll and Jeremy Wilson was set at 100% of annual base salary, prorated in Tim Carroll’s 
case to the period he was employed by the Company in the financial year. In addition, as part of the importance placed by the 
Company on share ownership, Tim Carroll and Jeremy Wilson had the opportunity to take a portion of their bonus in shares up to a 
maximum value of 25% of their base salary. To the extent they elected to do so, the Company made a matching award of shares 
(the ‘matching shares’). This was subject to the condition that both the shares they elected to receive out of their cash bonus and 
the matching shares would be held for not less than two years, including if they were no longer employed by the Company, subject 
only to satisfying any tax payments due on this remuneration.
Owing to the strong performance of the business in the year ended 31 August 2017, Tim Carroll and Jeremy Wilson received the 
maximum bonus to which they were entitled. The table shows the upper and lower boundaries, the target and the actual bonuses 
achieved:

1 Tim Carroll joined the Group on 1 January 2017 so his bonus represents 
8
/12 of the full annual amount.
2 Tim Carroll and Jeremy Wilson have elected to take an amount equivalent to 10% and 25% respectively of their cash bonus entitlement in the form of shares, matched by a 
similar additional award from the Company, as set out in the Directors’ emoluments table below.
For the financial year ending 31 August 2018, a similar structure is being adopted as the Remuneration Committee considers that it 
was successful in achieving its intended objectives in the year. The details of the bonus targets for the 2018 financial year will be 
set out in next year’s Annual Report.
Other discretionary payments
As part of the remuneration package on which Tim Carroll joined the Company as CEO in January 2017, he received a payment of 
£45,000 as compensation for the value of awards forfeited by leaving his previous employer in the USA. It was agreed that this 
would be paid in April 2017 on the basis that he was still employed by the Company at that time. Dave Froker, who left the Company 
in December 2016, received an ex gratia payment of £10,000 in respect of a portion of the costs he would incur relocating his 
family back to the USA. He received no performance-related annual bonus in respect of the four months of the 2017 financial year 
for which he was employed by the Company and no other compensation.

Long-term incentive plans
A bespoke long-term share incentive plan was put in place for Dave Froker when he joined the Group in September 2012. All share 
awards which had not vested at the time he ceased to be an employee of the Company in December 2016 lapsed. An award of 
options under the Company’s Enterprise Management Incentive Plan (‘the EMI Plan’) was made to Jeremy Wilson prior to the 
Company’s flotation on AIM when he joined Focusrite in September 2014. This EMI Plan award has three tranches, each in respect 
of a three-year performance period, running respectively to the end of the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years. Accordingly, the 
first of these has now reached the end of its performance period and 91,295 shares, representing 68.5% of the maximum number 
of shares under this tranche of the award, have vested. These awards have been satisfied out of those owned by the Employee 
Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’) established prior to the flotation on AIM. Details of these awards are set out in the table below:

1 During FY15 the vesting threshold of £9 million EBITDA was exceeded and consequently the Remuneration Committee approved the vesting of the 619,000 options.
2 Dave Froker ceased to be an employee on 31 December 2016, at which point all options that had not vested lapsed.
3 Compound Annual Growth Rate.
Three year share awards made to other senior management under the Company’s Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) also vested at 
the end of the 2017 financial year resulting in the grant of 103,611 shares in total which have also been satisfied out of the EBT. 
New three year share awards over a total of 58,809 shares were made during the 2017 financial year to the other members of the 
senior management team which will vest at the end of the 2019 financial year.
Following the announcement of results in respect of the 2017 financial year, awards were granted under the PSP to Tim Carroll and 
to Jeremy Wilson in respect of the three-year performance period to the end of the 2020 financial year. These awards are worth a 
maximum of 100% of base salary at the time of grant and are based on the achievement of EPS targets. The vesting criteria are set 
out in the table below:
Vesting criteria Threshold Maximum
Three-year EPS CAGR 10% 18%
Proportion of award vesting

20% 100%
1 Between threshold and maximum performance vesting is calculated on a straight line basis. Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 40
The Group also operates both EMI schemes and unapproved option schemes for the benefit of other employees of the Group. 
These schemes, which were set up prior to the flotation on AIM, form part of the programme of incentives to promote the successful 
recruitment, retention and rewarding of all employees and reflect the importance the Company places on wider share ownership. 
The last of such awards were granted in December 2015 and the majority date from before the flotation on AIM in December 2014. 
For this reason, a new scheme is being introduced in the 2018 financial year for the benefit of employees other than the CEO, CFO 
and other members of the senior management team. This scheme will operate in a similar way to a conventional option scheme with 
grants of awards with an exercise price equivalent to the market price at the time the award is made. The awards will vest in equal 
tranches after three, four and five years. Based on certain assumptions of share price growth over the period, it is intended that 
after five years the profit on those share options will be equivalent to approximately 50% of one year’s salary at the time of the 
grant. The aggregate number of shares awarded in the 2018 financial year under this new scheme will be set out in next year’s 
Annual Report.
Dilution
All of the Group’s equity-based awards are subject to an overall limit on the number of new ordinary shares that can be issued which 
will be dilutive. Other than awards to be satisfied by shares held by the EBT at the time of the IPO, these must not, in aggregate, 
exceed 10% of the Company’s issued share capital over any rolling ten-year period post-IPO. The following table illustrates the 
maximum outstanding share awards and the potential net dilution as at 31 August 2017:
Plan
Maximum number of  
shares relating to award
% of issued  
share capital
Jeremy Wilson LTIP 400,000 0.69%
Senior management PSP 292,677 0.50%

Potential net dilution 265,836 0.46%
1 Represents the number of shares held by the EBT as at the IPO less the number of shares used by the EBT since then to satisfy options that have vested and been exercised.
Pension contributions
In the year ended 31 August 2017, Tim Carroll and Jeremy Wilson were entitled to pension contributions of 15% of annual base 
salary, pro-rated in Tim Carroll’s case to the period he was employed by the Company. They were permitted to elect to be paid the 
pension contributions in cash, subject to a deduction in respect of employer’s National Insurance contributions.
Benefits
The Company provides life assurance, membership of the Group’s healthcare insurance scheme, critical illness insurance and travel 
insurance to the Executive Directors. These benefits do not form part of their pensionable earnings. Tim Carroll received an 
additional one-off benefit amounting to £8,000, which was exempt from tax, in respect of the costs of relocating his family from the 
USA to the UK to take up the post of CEO in succession to Dave Froker.
Executive Directors’ service contracts
The service contracts for the Executive Directors are terminable by either the Company or the Executive Directors on not less than 
six months’ notice. There are no predetermined special provisions for Executive Directors with regard to compensation in the event 
of loss of office.
Non-executive Directors’ terms of appointment
Both Non-executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of three years from the IPO in 
December 2014. Subject to reappointment at the AGM, it is intended to reappoint both Non-executive Directors for a further period 
of three years. The appointment letters for the Non-executive Directors provide that no compensation is payable on termination. The 
appointments are terminable by the Company or the Non-executive Directors on six months’ notice.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. 
As required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange 
they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (‘IFRSs’ as adopted by the EU) 
and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with UK 
accounting standards and applicable law (UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent 
Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the Group and Parent Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, 
relevant, reliable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU;
• assess the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern; and
• for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; 
• use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report and a Directors’ 
Report that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our 
ethical responsibilities under, and are independent of the Group 
in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC 
Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate 
basis for our opinion. Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 44
2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In arriving at our audit opinion 
above, the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
The risk Our response
Provisions against 
inventory 
(£672,000; 2016: 
£844,000)
Refer to page 33 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 
56 (accounting policy) and 
page 68 (financial 
disclosures).
Subjective estimate
There is a risk that changes in consumer tastes 
and technology may impact upon the saleability 
of the products for which there is a provision in 
place, there is therefore a high level of judgment 
over the estimated net realisable value of 
inventory. 
Our procedures included:
• Control design: Evaluating the group’s 
procedures for calculating the inventory 
provision;
• Tests of details: Comparing the cost of a 
sample of inventory items to after date sales to 
identify items sold at below cost. For items 
sold at below cost, checking that an 
appropriate level of provision is held;
• Our sector expertise: Gaining an 
understanding of the respective products and 
their forecast demand through inquiry with 
the product development director. Critically 
assessing those forecasts using our sector 
expertise and considering whether the 
assumptions applied in the calculation of 
the provision were consistent with those 
expectations and forecasts;
• Historical comparisons: Evaluating 
historical value of inventory sold at a loss or 
written off to assess historical forecasting 
accuracy by the directors; and
• Assessing transparency: Considering the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures about the 
degree of estimation involved in arriving at the 
valuation.
Recoverability of 
investment in 
subsidiaries
(£14.6 million; 2016: 
£14.6 million)
Refer to page 33 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 
80 (accounting policy) and 
page 82(financial 
disclosures).
Low risk, high value
The carrying amount of the parent company’s 
investments in subsidiaries represents 60% 
(2016: 74%) of the company’s total assets. 
Their recoverability is not at a high risk of 
significant misstatement or subject to significant 
judgement. However, due to their materiality in 
the context of the parent company financial 
statements, this is considered to be the area 
that had the greatest effect on our overall 
parent company audit.
Our procedures included:
• Tests of detail: Comparing the carrying 
amount of 100% of investments of the total 
investment balance with the relevant 
subsidiaries’ balance sheets to identify 
whether their net assets, being an 
approximation of their minimum recoverable 
amount, were in excess of their carrying 
amount and assessing whether those 
subsidiaries have historically been 
profit‑making.
• Assessing subsidiary audits: Considering 
the results of our audit work on the profits and 
net assets of those subsidiaries.

3. Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the group financial statements 
as a whole was set at £475,000 (2016: 354,000), 
determined with reference to a benchmark of 
Group profit before taxation of which it represents 
5% (2016: 5%).
Materiality for the parent company financial 
statements as a whole was set at £222,000 
(2016: £147,000), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of company total assets, of which it 
represents 0.9% (2016: 1.0%).
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any 
corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements 
exceeding £24,000 (2016: £17,000), in addition to 
other identified misstatements that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s four (2016: four) reporting 
components, two were subject to audit for group 
reporting purposes, two (2016: none) were subject 
to specified risk‑ focused audit procedures related 
to costs. The latter were not individually financially 
significant enough to require a full scope audit for 
group purposes, but did present specific individual 
risks that needed to be addressed.
The components within the scope of our work 
accounted for the percentages illustrated.
The Group team determined the component 
materialities, which ranged from £222,000 to 
£430,000, having regard to the mix of size and risk 
profile of the Group across the components. All 
work was performed by the Group team. Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 46
4. We have nothing to report on going concern
We are required to report to you if we have anything material to 
add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in 
note 2 to the financial statements on the use of the going 
concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company’s use of 
that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements. We have nothing to report 
in these respects.
5. We have nothing to report on the other information in 
the Annual Report
The directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the financial 
statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express 
an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit 
work, the information therein is materially misstated or 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit 
knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified 
material misstatements in the other information.
Strategic report and directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
• we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report;
• in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and
• in our opinion those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
6. We have nothing to report on the other matters on 
which we are required to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report which we were engaged to 
audit are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
7. Respective responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 42, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing 
the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent 
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the 
financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006 and the terms of our engagement by the company. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report, and the further matters we are 
required to state to them in accordance with the terms agreed 
with the company, and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the company and the company’s members, as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.

Consolidated Cash Flow Statement
For the year ended 31 August 2017 Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 52
1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Focusrite Plc (the ‘Company’), is a company incorporated in the UK. The consolidated financial statements (‘financial statements’) 
as at and for the year ended 31 August 2017 comprised the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’).
The Group is a business engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of professional audio and electronic music products.
Basis of preparation
Statement of compliance
The financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2017 are presented in pounds (‘GBP’ thousands; £’000). This is the 
functional currency of the Group. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, International Accounting 
Standards (‘IAS’) and interpretations currently endorsed by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and its 
committees as adopted by the EU and as required to be adopted by UK companies.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company accounts in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework (‘FRS 101’).
These financial statements were authorised for issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on 21 November 2017.
2 ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS
In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs that are mandatorily effective. Their adoption has not 
had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Standards not affecting the reported results or the financial position
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
• Annual improvements to IFRS 2012‑ 2014 cycle
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
Of these, only IFRS 16 is expected to have a material impact on the future financial statements of the Group since it would require the 
substantial majority of the Group’s operating lease commitments (c£1.1 million on an undiscounted basis as shown in note 24 of the 
financial statements) to be brought on to the balance sheet, resulting in the recognition of significant lease assets and liabilities which 
would be depreciated and amortised separately. IFRS 16 would first apply to the Group for the financial year ending 31 August 2020.
Per IFRS 15, the Group has performed an initial impact assessment. This assessment concludes that it is unlikely that the adoption 
of IFRS 15 will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently for all periods presented in the financial statements.
Any standards and interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective, and that are available for early application, have 
not been applied by the Group in these financial statements.
Application of these standards and interpretations is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements in the future.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all entities controlled by the Group from the date 
control commences until the date that control ceases. Control is achieved where the Company:
• Has the power over the investee.
• Is exposed or has rights to a variable return from the involvement with the investee.
• Has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
As such, the results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the effective 
date of acquisition.
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 August 2017 Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 53
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Going concern
The Group’s business activities and position in the market are described in the Strategic Report. The Directors believe that the Group 
is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertainties within the global economy. The Group has 
considerable financial resources, ongoing revenue streams and a broad spread of customers. As a consequence of these factors and 
having reviewed the current three‑ year plan and more detailed forecasts for the coming year, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. Further detail is contained in 
the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 27.
Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted EPS data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to 
ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. For diluted EPS, the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted for the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares arising from the exercise 
of granted share options.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the ‘acquisition date’). 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non‑ controlling interest in the 
acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the amounts of the 
identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the 
consideration transferred, the amount of any non‑ controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously 
held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to the Group’s cash‑ generating units (‘CGUs’) expected to benefit from synergies arising from the combination. CGUs to 
which goodwill has been attributed under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently 
when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of 
the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the 
other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in determining profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary 
course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of sales taxes and discounts.
The Group recognises revenue when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• The Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods in accordance with the 
relevant contractual incoterms.
• The Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective 
control over the goods sold.
• The amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
• It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity.
• The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
The Group has assessed the impacts of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 and concluded that there is no material change to the accounting 
treatment of the relevant transactions.
Revenue recognised in the income statement but not yet invoiced is held on the balance sheet within ‘Trade and other receivables’. 
Revenue invoiced but not yet recognised in the income statement is held on the balance sheet within ‘Deferred revenue’.
Revenue is classified as follows:
• Sale of goods
Revenue from the supply of goods is recognised as soon as all substantial risks and rewards relating to the title of the goods have 
been transferred to the customer.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 54
• Sale of apps
Revenue from the download of apps is recognised upon confirmation from the app store provider.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can 
be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective 
interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Non-underlying items
Non‑ underlying items are those items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence. The Directors consider that these 
items should be separately identified within their relevant income statement category to enable a full understanding of the Group’s 
result.
Leasing
The Group’s leases are currently all operating leases (leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are 
retained by the lessor). Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight‑ line basis over 
the term of the relevant lease (net of any incentive received from the lessor).
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each subsidiary are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates (its functional currency). Sterling is the predominant functional currency of the Group and presentation currency for the 
consolidated financial information.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance 
sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that 
date. Non‑ monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the 
date when the fair value was determined. Non‑ monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:
• Exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see below under financial 
instruments/hedge accounting).
• For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial information, exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or 
payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net 
investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to 
profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the net investment.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial information, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at 
the date of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in the income statement.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to 
state‑ managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s 
obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Equity-settled share-based payments
The Group issues equity‑ settled payments to certain employees (including Directors). Where employees are rewarded using 
share‑ based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the 
instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non‑ market vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
Share options are valued at the date of grant using the Black‑ Scholes option pricing model for options with non‑ market vesting 
conditions attached and a simulation model for options with market vesting conditions attached, and are charged to operating profit 
over the vesting period of the award with a corresponding credit to the ‘other reserves’.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 August 2017 Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 55
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
If vesting periods or other non‑ market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that 
the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately 
exercised are different to that estimated on vesting.
Upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and, where 
appropriate, share premium account.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the consolidated financial information and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are only recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, where the 
Group is unable to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised 
based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Tangible and intangible assets
Property, plant and equipment
Other items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less residual value over their useful lives, using the 
straight‑ line method, on the following bases:
Plant, equipment and tooling 3 to 5 years
Computer equipment  2 years
Fixtures and fittings  5 years
Leasehold improvements  5 to 8 years
Customer demonstration units 2 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in income on the transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 56
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are amortised over the following periods on a straight‑ line basis:
Development expenditure  3 years
Purchased intellectual property 2 years
Licences    2 to 5 years
Computer software  2 years
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally‑ generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s development of new and enhanced products is recognised only if 
all of the following conditions are met:
• an asset is created that can be identified (such as product designs and new processes);
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
• the costs of developing this asset can be measured reliably.
Where no internally‑ generated intangible asset can be recognised, the expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in 
which it is incurred.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that 
are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of: (i) fair value less costs to sell; and (ii) value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre‑ tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant 
asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that the 
revaluation balance is greater than the impairment loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years for the asset (or CGU). A reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal 
of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct 
labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is 
calculated using either the first‑ in‑ first‑ out method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated 
costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Trade and other receivables
Trade debtors, which generally have 30–90‑ day terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and 
recoverable amount. Provision for impairment is made through profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the Group will not 
be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 August 2017 Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 57
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Financial assets
All financial assets are normally recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis where the purchase or sale of a financial asset 
is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, 
and are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs. This excludes those financial assets classified as at fair value through 
profit or loss (‘FVTPL’), which are initially measured at fair value. On derecognition, however, where a specific transaction is entered 
into with a counterparty that is judged to carry a high credit or liquidity risk, then management may determine that derecognition of 
the financial asset shall be based on settlement date rather than trade date, with any realised gain or loss taken to profit and loss on 
date of settlement.
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at FVTPL, ‘held‑ to‑ maturity’ investments, 
‘available‑ for‑ sale’ (‘AFS’) financial assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the 
financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income 
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all 
fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or 
discounts) through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on 
initial recognition.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified as at FVTPL.
Classes of financial asset
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL when the financial asset is either held for trading or is designated as at FVTPL.
A financial asset is classified as held for trading if:
• it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term; or
• on initial recognition it is a part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a 
recent actual pattern of short‑ term profit‑ taking; or
• it is a derivative that is not a designated and effective hedging instrument.
A financial asset other than a financial asset held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
• such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; or
• the financial asset forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance 
is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and 
information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
• it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss. 
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in 
the ‘other gains and losses’ line in the income statement. Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 31.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short‑ term receivables when the 
recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets 
are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of 
the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below 
its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 58
For all other financial assets, including finance lease receivables, objective evidence of impairment could include:
• significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
• default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
• it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in 
addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include 
the Group’s past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average 
credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of 
trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is 
considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are 
credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
A financial liability is classified as held for trading if:
• it has been incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term; or
• on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent 
actual pattern of short‑ term profit‑ taking; or
• it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
A financial liability other than a financial liability held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
• such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; or
• the financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance 
is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and 
information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
• it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss. 
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability and is included in the ‘other 
gains and losses’ line in the income statement. Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 31.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense 
recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense 
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the 
expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group is able to enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign 
exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross‑ currency swaps. Further details of 
derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 33.
Hedge accounting
For the year ended 31 August 2016 and subsequent years, the Group adopted hedge accounting for qualifying transactions. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to 
their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative 
is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the 
nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or 
hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedges).
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a 
highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised 
directly in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
For cash flow hedges, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the 
same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship 
but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is 
recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to 
take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised 
as a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non‑ current asset or a non‑ current liability if the remaining maturity of the 
instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented 
as current assets or current liabilities.
4 JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATIONS IN APPLYING THE GROUP’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following are the important judgements and estimations that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial information.
Judgements
Judgement is required to determine the level of inventory at the year end that may become obsolete due to changes in consumer 
habits of technology and therefore the level of provision against it.
Revenue recognition
In making its judgement, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue set out in IAS 18. Management 
is satisfied that the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred and that the recognition of revenue upon despatch is 
appropriate.
Inventory valuation
Judgement is required to determine the level of inventory at the year end that may become obsolete due to changes in consumer 
habits or technology and therefore the level of provision against it. The Group has an inventory provisioning policy that reflects the 
fact that there are strong physical controls carried out by the independent service provider which manages the Group’s inventory 
resulting in low inventory loss or damage.
Estimates
Revenue recognition
The Group has contractual terms with certain customers that require estimation of the rebate payable at the year end because the 
amount payable is based on future sales to the end user.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 60
Recoverability of internally-generated intangible asset
Management reconsidered the recoverability of its internally‑ generated intangible asset for development costs which is included in 
the balance sheet at 31 August 2017 at £4,066,000 (2016: £4,172,000). These projects continue to progress in a satisfactory 
manner, and customer reaction has reconfirmed management’s previous estimates of anticipated revenues from the project.
Management is confident that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered in full. This situation will be closely monitored, and 
adjustments made in future periods if future market activity indicates that such adjustments are appropriate.
Allowance for doubtful debts
Management undertakes a review of all new customers and a periodic review of existing customers to determine whether specific 
risks of default exist. A substantial proportion of the Group’s trade receivables ledger is covered by credit insurance. Beyond 
identification of specific risks, management undertakes periodic reviews into the calculation of allowances for doubtful debts to 
ensure historic trends continue to provide a basis for determining a reliable estimate for them.
Share option schemes
The Group has established several share option schemes. The fair value of the options issued under these schemes is derived by 
the Company using the Black‑ Scholes model and the resultant values are allocated to the income statement over the period of 
vesting. In arriving at the fair value using this model, the Company calculates a number of inputs to the model, including estimated 
share price volatility.
Further details regarding the option schemes are set out in note 29.

6 BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Information reported to the Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is 
focused on the main product groups which Focusrite sells. The Group’s reportable segments under IFRS 8 are therefore as follows:
Focusrite  – Sales of Focusrite or Focusrite Pro branded products
Novation  – Sales of Novation or Ampify branded products
Distribution –  Distribution of third‑ party brands including KRK, Ableton, Stanton, Cerwin‑ Vega, Cakewalk and sE Electronics
Segment revenues and results
The following is an analysis of the Group’s revenue and results by reportable segment:
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies described in note 3. Segment 
profit represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of the share of central administration costs including 
Directors’ salaries, investment revenue and finance costs, and income tax expense. This is the measure reported to the Board of 
Directors for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
Central administration costs comprise principally the employment‑ related costs and other overheads incurred by Focusrite and its 
USA subsidiary, net of inter‑ Company commission income. Also included within central administration costs is the charge relating to 
the share option scheme (note 29) of £145,000 for the year ended 31 August 2017 (2016: £120,000).

Basic EPS 15.4 11.8
Diluted EPS 14.8 10.7
At 31 August 2017, the total number of ordinary shares issued and fully paid was 58,075,000. This included 2,546,845 (2016: 
4,494,504) shares held by the EBT to satisfy options vesting in future years. The operation of this EBT is funded by the Group so 
the EBT is required to be consolidated, with the result that the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of the 
basic EPS calculation is the net of the total number of shares in issue (58,075,000) less the number of shares held by the EBT 
(2,546,845). It should be noted that the only right relinquished by the Trustees of the EBT is the right to receive dividends. In all 
other respects, the shares held by the EBT have full voting rights.
The effect of dilutive potential ordinary share issues is calculated in accordance with IAS 33 and arises from the employee share 
options currently outstanding, adjusted by the profit element as a proportion of the average share price during the period.

At 31 August 2017 419
Goodwill arose as a result of a transfer on 31 August 2004 of the assets and liabilities of Novation Digital Music Systems Limited 
for a consideration of £711,000. Accordingly, the whole of the value of goodwill is attributable to the Novation operating segment 
and cash CGU.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The 
recoverable amount of the CGU is determined using ‘value‑ in‑ use’ calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA is used as a proxy of free cash flows) as well as the level of capital expenditure required to 
maintain the existing business into the future. These assumptions are reviewed and revised annually in light of current economic 
conditions and the future outlook for each CGU. Management estimates discount rates using pre‑ tax rates that reflect current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each CGU. This has been set at 10%.
The growth rates used are based on management’s assessment of the cash flow forecasts over the medium term. The growth for 
the next five years is based on the lower of 2% and either the rate forecast for year five or the average annual growth rate derived 
over the initial five‑ year term and does not exceed the average long‑ term growth rate for the relevant economies in which these 
CGUs operate. These are based on conservative estimates of the Group’s ability to participate in growth expected in the industry 
and a modest dilution in market share as more competitors enter the market over the next ten years. Changes in selling prices and 
direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The value of goodwill recognised in the accounts has been compared to the derived value in use. Throughout the three‑ year period 
the goodwill carrying value has been below its value in use. The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test 
results for each CGU and concluded no material sensitivity exists in these calculations.

Trade receivables
Trade receivables disclosed above are classified as loans and receivables and are measured at amortised cost.
The average credit period offered on sales of goods during 2017 was 56 days (2016: 57 days). The days sales outstanding (‘DSO’) 
at 31 August 2017 was 60 days (2016: 63 days).
The Group has not charged interest for late payment of invoices in 2016 or 2017.
Allowances against doubtful debts are recognised against overdue trade receivables based on estimated irrecoverable amounts 
determined by reference to past default experience. Specific counterparty risk is also considered where an analysis of the 
counterparty’s current financial position indicates a change in credit risk.
Before accepting any significant new customer, the Group uses a variety of credit scoring systems to assess the potential 
customer’s credit quality and to define credit limits for each customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers are reviewed 
regularly. A single major distributor accounted for 60% of the total balance of trade receivables net of allowances for doubtful debts 
on 31 August 2017 (2016: 53%). No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of the total balance of trade receivables 
net of allowances for doubtful debts during the period under review.
Trade receivables disclosed above include amounts (see below for aged analysis) which are past due at the year end but against 
which the Group has not recognised an allowance for doubtful receivables. There has not been a significant change in credit quality 
and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the relevant year end. Aside from the major customer mentioned above, the 
concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and diverse in terms of industry sector. The Group’s 
exposure to credit risk for trade receivables is substantially covered by credit insurance, including amounts in relation to its largest 
customer. In addition, the Group maintains a close operational relationship with the key management of its major customer, so as to 
monitor any changes in the level of credit risk associated with that business.

Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. The average credit 
period taken for trade purchases was 37 days (2016: 68 days). No interest costs have been incurred in relation to trade payables. 
The Group policy is to ensure that payables are paid within the pre‑ agreed credit terms and to avoid incurring penalties and/or 
interest on late payments. Other creditors include sales taxes, property taxes, social security and employment taxes due to local 
tax authorities.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates their fair value.

30 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEME
The Group operates a stakeholder retirement benefit scheme which is open to all employees.
Other than amounts that are deducted from employees’ remuneration and accrued pending payment to the pension fund, no further 
obligations fall on the Group as the assets of these arrangements are held and managed by third parties entirely separate from 
the Group.
The pension charge for the period represents contributions payable to the fund and amounted to £323,000 for the year ended 
31 August 2017 (2016: £273,000). Contributions totalling £16,448 (2016: £20,000) were payable to the fund at the balance 
sheet date and are included in trade and other payables.

Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s finance function is responsible for all aspects of corporate treasury. It co-ordinates access to financial markets, 
monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through internal reports which analyse exposures 
by degree and magnitude. The risks reviewed include market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk), 
credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures. The 
use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provides guidance to the 
finance function in addressing all risks, including foreign exchange risk, credit risk and the appropriate use of financial derivatives 
and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. The Group does not enter into or trade financial 
instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Group’s bankers are party to a debenture which provides for security over the whole of the Company’s assets and undertaking. 
This debenture is in place to support the revolving credit facility, provision of forward contracts and a duty deferment facility. Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 74
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group enters into 
a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. Currently the exposure to short‑ term 
foreign exchange rate risks is mitigated through the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate 
risk arising on trading with overseas customers.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters, utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the relevant period 
end dates are as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to the Euro and US Dollar.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in Sterling against the relevant foreign 
currencies.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the 
period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
A negative number below indicates a decline in profits and other equity where Sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant 
currency. For a 10% weakening of Sterling against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable impact on the profit and 
other equity, and the balances below would be positive.

2 This is mainly attributable to the exposure to US Dollar net payables and receivables at the balance sheet date.
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is representative of the inherent foreign exchange risk through the year.
Forward foreign exchange contracts
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and 
receipts during the following financial year with the aim that approximately 75% of the foreign exchange exposure is covered. 
In addition, approximately 50% of the Euro foreign exchange exposure is covered for the year after that. Basis adjustments are 
made to the carrying amounts of non‑ financial hedged items when the anticipated sale or purchase transaction takes place.

The Group started a policy of hedge accounting during the prior year. In FY17, all forward foreign exchange contracts have been 
hedge accounted. For cash flow hedges the following table sets out the periods when the cash flows are expected to occur and

Interest rate risk management
The Group is not currently exposed to interest rate risk because it does not have any external borrowings.
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The 
Group has a well‑ established system of credit limits and credit insurance, typically covering around 90% of the Group’s trade 
receivables.
The carrying amount recorded for financial assets in the consolidated financial information is net of impairment losses and 
represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. No guarantees have been given in respect to third parties.
Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. To counter 
this risk, the Group operates with a high level of cash and no bank debt. In addition, it benefits from strong cash flow from its normal 
trading activities.
The following table details the Group’s expected maturity for its non‑ derivative financial assets. The tables below have been drawn 
up based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the financial assets including interest that will be earned on those assets. 
The inclusion of information on non‑ derivative financial assets is necessary to understand the Group’s liquidity risk management as 
the liquidity is managed on a net asset and liability basis.

Fair value of financial instruments
Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortised cost
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the 
financial statements approximate their fair values.
31 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 76
Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purposes of measuring fair value
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
• The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions, and traded on active liquid markets 
are determined with reference to quoted market prices (includes listed redeemable notes, bills of exchange, debentures and 
perpetual notes).
• The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined in accordance 
with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market 
transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments.
• The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, a discounted 
cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non‑ optional derivatives, 
and option pricing models for optional derivatives. Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward 
exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. Interest rate swaps are 
measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from 
quoted interest rates.
Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value. 
The grouping into Levels 1 to 3 is based on the degree to which their fair value is observable:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities.
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are 
not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Under IAS 39, all derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as derivatives at fair value through the 
income statement. The Group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. All transactions in derivative financial instruments 
are underpinned by firm orders from customers or to suppliers or where there is a high degree of certainty that orders will be 
received.
32 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Company and its subsidiaries may, from time to time, be involved in a number of legal proceedings that are incidental to their 
operations. During the year to 31 August 2016, the Group incurred one‑ off litigation costs, which are explained in note 13. These 
legal proceedings have now been resolved. In the opinion of the Directors, the Company and its subsidiaries are not involved 
currently in any other legal proceedings which, at 31 August 2017 and for the period up to the date of approval of these financial 
statements, have had a significant effect on the financial position or profitability of the Company and its subsidiaries.

1 AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH FRS 101
The Parent Company financial statements of Focusrite Plc for the year ended 31 August 2017 were authorised for issue by 
the Board of Directors on 21 November 2017 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by Tim Carroll and 
Jeremy Wilson.
Focusrite Plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The Company’s ordinary shares are 
traded on AIM. These financial statements were prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the period ended 
31 August 2017.
2 BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with FRS 101. The amendments to FRS 101 (2014/15 Cycle) issued in 
July 2015 and effective immediately have been applied.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of IFRS, 
but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of 
the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss 
account.
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 
31 August 2017.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities and position in the market are described in the Strategic Report. The Directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertainties within the global economy. The 
Group has considerable financial resources, recurring revenue streams and a broad spread of customers. As a consequence of 
these factors and having reviewed the forecasts for the coming year, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Strategic Report on 
pages 1 to 27 .
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Cash
Cash and short‑ term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand, and short‑ term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less.
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, 
based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exception:
• deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when 
the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Notes to the Company Accounts
For the year ended 31 August 2017 Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 81
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only if a legally enforced right exists to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Company to make a 
single net payment.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other 
comprehensive income. Similarly, income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or 
charged directly to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to 
state‑ managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s 
obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Equity-settled share-based payments
The Company issues equity‑ settled payments to certain employees (including Directors). All goods and services received in 
exchange for the grant of any share‑ based payment are measured at their fair values. Where employees are rewarded using 
share‑ based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the 
instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non‑ market vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
Share options are valued at the date of grant using the Black‑ Scholes option pricing model for options with non‑ market vesting 
conditions attached and a simulation model for options with market vesting conditions attached, and are charged to operating profit 
over the vesting period of the award with a corresponding credit to the ‘other reserves’.
If vesting periods or other non‑ market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that 
the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately 
exercised are different to that estimated on vesting.
Upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and, where 
appropriate, share premium account.
The share option charge related to the grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary 
undertakings is subsequently recharged to the relevant employing subsidiary.
