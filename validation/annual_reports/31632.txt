  ERV STRATEGIC REPORT  OVERVIEW  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
Our business
Over the 31 years since Shaftesbury was formed, we have assembled 
an impossible-to-replicate portfolio in the heart of London’ s 
West End of some 600 buildings across 14½ acres. The renowned 
and enduring appeal of London’ s West End to a global audience 
of visitors and businesses brings a resilience to its economy not 
seen elsewhere in the UK and in very few cities across the world.
Underpinned by an estimated 200 million annual visits to the 
West End, our business focusses on the 1.1 million sq. ft. of restaurant, 
leisure and retail space that we own in high profile, popular locations. 
With our forensic knowledge of the West End, we curate 
distinctive, interesting and lively destinations which attract 
Londoners, a large and important local working population, 
domestic visitors, and international tourists in numbers 
unmatched by any city destination in the western world. 
Continuing value creation and 
income growth
Our portfolio, now valued
1
 at £3.64 billion, continues to deliver 
rental and capital growth, but with relatively low capital 
expenditure. 
We have continued our long record of crystallising our portfolio’ s 
reversionary potential into contracted cash flow, whilst growing 
this potential further. Together with significantly reduced finance 
costs following important refinancing activity, this has driven 
strong growth in earnings over the year. The Board is delighted 
to recommend a final dividend of 8.1p, bringing the total 
distribution for the year to 16.0p, an increase of 8.8%. This 
follows last year’ s increase of 6.9%.
Focus on culture, governance 
and sustainability 
In my first year with Shaftesbury, I have come to appreciate the 
culture of this business and the important part it plays in supporting 
our strategy and our continuing success. Importantly, our strategy, 
and every aspect of its implementation, prioritises long-term 
goals, planning and sustainable outcomes over short-term gains 
and rewards. 
We pride ourselves in being open, transparent and engaged, 
not just with shareholders but also with our wide array of 
stakeholders, including our employees, local communities, 
neighbours and local authorities. We ensure that our Board 
decision-making includes consideration of these important 
stakeholders. 
The Board and I are committed to maintaining the high standards 
of corporate governance and behaviour we have demonstrated 
for many years. 
Succession planning throughout the organisation is an essential 
aspect of our long-term strategy. My responsibility is to ensure 
that the Board’ s membership continues to evolve so that we 
have access to the broad skills and experience required to 
support the current and future needs of the business.

Chairman’s 
Statement
  
I am delighted to report another strong set 
of results, following a busy and successful 
year for the Group. Our focussed strategy 
has continued to deliver our objectives of 
growth in both income and the value of our 
exceptional portfolio, along with long-term, 
sector-leading returns for shareholders.

STRATEGIC REPORT  OVERVIEW  CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
The knowledge and enthusiasm of our management team have been critical 
to the successful implementation of our strategy. Our employee retention 
record, which is a testament to the working environment we offer , is exceptional. 
We invest in training and developing our employees, to ensure they grow in 
their roles and that we maintain a pipeline of talent for internal promotion.  
A key aspect of our long-term success is the socially responsible way in 
which we run our business. We see the preservation and enhancement of 
our iconic destinations as critical to our long-term future and we are 
committed to bringing economic and environmental sustainability through 
the stewardship of our extensive ownership of mainly older buildings. 
Creating prosperous, appealing locations which support the businesses of 
our commercial occupiers, and which benefit the important residential 
communities in and around our areas, creates the conditions which sustain 
the long-term prospects of our business. 
Board changes
Oliver Marriott retired from the Board in July and I would like to thank him 
for his outstanding contribution to Shaftesbury during his eight-year tenure. 
On 28 November 2017, Richard Akers will join the Board as a non-executive 
director, and I am sure his broad range of real estate and corporate skills 
and experience will be invaluable.
Outlook
Whilst UK economic and political uncertainty is unsettling business 
confidence and investment, London continues to thrive. Its long-term 
prospects, and those of the West End, are underpinned by their global 
status and appeal, excellent connectivity and dynamic, creative, broad-
based economy. 
Over my first year, it has become increasingly apparent that this business 
has many strengths, from our exceptional portfolio through to a quality 
team, a proven and evolving long-term strategy and a robust balance sheet. 
I am confident we shall continue to meet today’ s challenges, capture 
tomorrow’ s opportunities and maintain our long record of delivering 
sustained growth in income, capital value and shareholder returns.
Jonathan Nicholls 
Chairman
27 November 2017 6
With increasing numbers of visitors to the West End and the widely-recog-
nised growth in interest and spending on leisure activities, our 282 restau-
rants, cafés and pubs are important drivers of footfall and trading in our 
locations. 7
STRATEGIC REPORT  OVERVIEW  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
Chief 
Executive’s 
Statement
  It is pleasing to report another year of good progress and strong results, 
against a backdrop of economic uncertainty.  
   
Growing earnings
Continued demand for space in our popular and busy 
locations, together with our proven management strategy, 
has resulted in an increase in net property income of 5.0% 
to £88.3 million. We are now reaping the benefits of the 
important refinancing initiatives we completed in October last 
year , which significantly reduced our finance costs. T ogether , 
these factors have contributed to an increase in EPRA 
earnings
1
 of £6.2 million to £45.2 million, which equates to 
an increase in EPRA earnings per share1 of 15.7%. 
Uplift in NAV
Our exceptional portfolio has delivered underlying capital 
value growth of 7.0% over the year, adding 83 pence (9.3%) 
to EPRA net asset value per share
1
. The increase in value 
reflects the combined impact of growing current income 
and the prospect of sustained future income growth, 
particularly in locations which are expected to benefit from 
Crossrail-related footfall in the coming years. Limited 
opportunities to buy the type of buildings we own, and 
continuing strong investor demand, have led to a reduction 
in investment yields in the West End market, particularly in 
the second half of the year.
This valuation uplift has been offset partly by the cost of 
terminating our remaining legacy interest rate swaps, which 
amounted to 20 pence per share. At 30 September 2017, 
EPRA NAV per share
1
 stood at £9.52, an increase of 64 
pence, or 7.2%.

STRATEGIC REPORT  OVERVIEW  CHIEF ExECUTIVE’S STATEMENT  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
A unique portfolio in an 
exceptional location
Our portfolio extends to some 600 buildings across 14½ acres of London’ s 
West End. 
Our investment strategy is focussed on restaurants, leisure and retail, uses 
which, in the West End, have a long record of resilience and growth. Our 
long-term management strategy of assembling clusters of ownerships 
enables us to curate and promote distinctive destinations which offer a wide 
variety of innovative, mid-market choices in dining, leisure and retail.
London is the largest city in Western Europe and most visited city in the 
western world, with an estimated 19.1 million international visitors in 2016. 
Current forecasts point to a growth in tourist numbers of around 3.5% per 
annum through to 2025. 
Located at its heart is the West End, with its exceptional variety of visitor 
attractions, from cultural and historic to dining and shopping. The exceptional 
numbers of domestic and international visitors, together with a large local 
working population, mean that the West End is busy seven-days-a-week, 
throughout the year. It offers a prosperous trading environment for our 
occupiers, attracting demand for space and sustaining growth in our rental 
values and income.
Within the West End, the availability of space, particularly for restaurant, 
leisure and retail uses, is constrained by local planning and other policies. 
This structural imbalance between demand for, and availability of, space is 
fundamental to our portfolio’ s rental and capital value prospects.
The West End economy
In our long experience, the breadth of the West End’ s economy provides 
considerable protection from the cyclicality and headwinds experienced by 
the UK national economy.  
Over the year, business and consumer confidence has begun to come under 
pressure, and growth in the national economy is slowing. However , conditions 
in the West End have so far largely been unaffected. In particular, weakness 
in sterling has provided a boost to the spending power of international visitors 
as well as increasing visitor numbers. Our restaurants, cafés, bars and shops 
are reporting resilient trading growth, better enabling them to absorb 
upward pressures on operating costs currently faced by all businesses.
Demand for the smaller accommodation that traditionally we offer is 
healthy. Lettings, lease renewals and rent reviews are being concluded on 
terms in line with our expectations, and vacancy levels have remained in line 
with our long-term trend of 3%, or less, of portfolio ERV.
We are making good progress at our three larger schemes. 46% by ERV of 
the completed space is now either let or under offer and marketing of the 
remaining space continues. This larger space we are offering requires 
occupiers to invest significant sums in fit-out and take on substantial rental 
commitments and we expect letting periods to be longer than for smaller 
space. Macro-economic uncertainties are now showing signs of slowing 
potential occupiers’ decision–making processes. We shall be patient in 
selecting occupiers which match our long-term aspirations. 
The widely reported increase in national business rates took effect in April 
2017. As we anticipated, average increases for our occupiers were in the 
range of 30% to 40%, with a large number of our smaller tenants able to 
benefit from a four-year transition period. Occupiers of large space on 
streets where rental levels are above our average have seen greater 
increases, and only limited transition provisions. Despite these unwelcome 
increases in operating costs for our tenants, we have not seen any direct 
impact on occupancy levels or interest in leasing space.
During the year, we concluded £31.1 million of leasing transactions, achieving 
rents for commercial space 6.7% above ERV at the previous year end. This is 
not only converting an element of our reversionary potential in to 
contracted income, but it also provides valuable evidence to increase rental 
tones and grow income from our adjacent and nearby buildings.
West End connectivity and 
infrastructure
The completion of Crossrail 1 is now a year away, with the first services on 
the Elizabeth line expected in December 2018. Once fully operational, this 
important addition to London’ s transport network will add 10% to its 
capacity, and materially improve accessibility to the West End. Over the 
medium term, we expect the new transport hubs at Tottenham Court Road 
and Bond Street will result in significant changes to traditional footfall 
patterns throughout the West End. With all our portfolio in close proximity 
to these hubs, we anticipate being a major beneficiary of these changes, 
with a number of our streets expected to see much increased footfall and 
profile, enhancing their long-term rental growth prospects.
Continuing investment across the transport network is improving reliability 
and increasing capacity, encouraging travel by public transport to the West 
End. Last year’ s introduction of 24-hour running at weekends on certain 
underground lines has been well-received, and initial passenger numbers 
have exceeded forecasts.
Elsewhere, we are seeing a number of Crossrail-related public realm 
schemes progressing. Of great importance to the West End is the initiative 
announced, earlier this year, to pedestrianise much of Oxford Street. This 
will bring significant benefits, including a much-improved pedestrian 
environment and a reduction in traffic-generated air pollution. Currently, it 
is expected that the first stage of pedestrianisation, west of Oxford Circus, 
will be operational by mid-2018. Planning for the eastern end of Oxford 
Street is underway. 
Investing in our portfolio
Our strategy is to adapt our buildings to meet the expectations of today’ s 
occupiers, and improve energy performance, through reconfiguration and 
refurbishment, rather than redevelopment. We focus on uses where we 
provide space in shell form only, with tenants taking responsibility for what 
are often substantial fit-out costs. This significantly reduces our exposure to 
obsolescence costs across the portfolio. Consequently, despite continuing 
high levels of activity across our holdings, capital expenditure remains 
modest. This year, our outlay was £40.3 million, slightly above our long-term 
average of around 1% of portfolio value. Additionally, our share of capital 
expenditure in the Longmartin joint venture was £1.2 million.
We continue to identify schemes across our portfolio, and are prepared to 
intervene to negotiate early vacant possession of space to accelerate our 
plans. We balance the costs of these initiatives against the valuable 
long-term benefits to income and capital values, which frequently 
compound across our extensive adjacent ownerships.
Adding to our portfolio
We have assembled our portfolio over a period of 31 years, through acquiring 
single buildings, small portfolios, or occasionally large blocks, which were in 
single ownership. We apply strict investment criteria to every purchase, and 
focus on the prospects for long-term income growth potential through 
harnessing our forensic market knowledge, our particular skills in improving 
older building stock and capturing synergies with our other ownerships.
The buildings we seek to acquire in our chosen locations are frequently in 
long-term private ownership. Their availability is always limited, as existing 
owners are reluctant to sell in our sought-after areas. Understandably, 
competition to purchase is intense, as other investors appreciate the 
long-term prospects and security they offer.
This year, additions to our portfolio totalled £37.1 million. In addition, in 
August 2017, we announced the forward purchase of a strategically important 
block on Berwick Street in Soho, for £38.5 million. Currently, it is undergoing 
a major redevelopment, which is expected to finish in late 2018, at which 
point we will complete the acquisition. 9
STRATEGIC REPORT  OVERVIEW  CHIEF ExECUTIVE’S STATEMENT  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
Refinancing legacy debt and hedging
T aking advantage of low long-term interest rates, over the year, we have 
taken important steps to refinance the remainder of our legacy debt and 
hedging, whilst adding to our financial resources.
We have issued £575 million of long-dated bonds, comprising £285 million 
for 15 years at 2.487% and £290 million for 10 years at 2.348%. The 
proceeds were used, in part, to fund the early repayment of our historical 
debenture stock and a bank facility. In addition, we have terminated our 
remaining £180 million of interest rate swaps.
Together, these transactions reduced the cost of our debt significantly, 
benefiting earnings and dividends, as well as adding around £310 million to 
our financial resources. In a competitive investment market, the ready 
availability of funding to secure acquisitions gives us a valuable advantage.
Long-term rewards of a long-term 
strategy
October 2017 marked the 30th anniversary of the listing of Shaftesbury’ s 
shares on the London Stock Exchange. In our early years, whilst we owned a 
block of 26 restaurants in the centre of Chinatown, our assets comprised 
mainly offices in London and several UK locations. From mid-1993, we 
refocussed the business, concentrating on restaurant, leisure and retail in 
London’ s West End.
Our long-term approach to assembling and managing this exceptional portfolio 
has delivered sustainable growth in income, which is the ultimate driver of 
long-term value. The success of this strategy is evident in our performance. 
Since we floated in 1987, our share price has risen 460%, compared with the 
FTSE 350 Real Estate Index of 94%, and since our focus switched to the 
West End, the increase has been 1,431% against 119% for the sector.
Looking ahead
The uncertainties created by last year’ s EU referendum decision have 
increased during 2017. It may be some time before the UK’ s future trading 
and other arrangements with the EU become clear , and there could be further 
challenges as their ramifications become apparent. Inevitably, business and 
consumer confidence is being affected, slowing economic growth and 
business investment.
The broad economic base of the West End, and its enduring global appeal to 
visitors and businesses, underpin its resilience and long-term prospects, providing 
a considerable degree of protection against national economic headwinds. 
This has been evident in the strength of our performance through different 
business cycles and operating environments in our 31-year history.
The successful implementation of our distinctive strategy is due to our 
committed, experienced and enthusiastic team, supported by the wide range 
of external advisors who are invaluable in delivering our strategy . T ogether , they 
bring flair and innovation to the management of our portfolio, ensuring it 
evolves and adapts to meet the ever-changing tastes and expectations of all 
those who visit, work or establish businesses in the West End.
Underwritten by the unique features of the West End, we are confident our

in the heart of

Exceptional
Accumulated over 31 years, our portfolio 
comprises nearly 600 buildings, mostly of 
domestic size, close to the West End’ s 
world-class visitor attractions. 
The areas in which we invest are long-establ ished , 
with street patterns generally laid out between 
1680 and 1720. Our wholly-owned portfolio is 
all within Conservation Areas and around 20% 
of our buildings are listed as being of special 
architectural interest. 
The buildings we seek to acquire are typically 
in long-term private ownership, and, in our 
experience, existing owners are unwilling to 
sell in this resilient area. We believe it would 
be impossible to replicate a portfolio such as 
ours in these vibrant and prosperous locations.

One of the world’ s principal global 
cities 
London is the largest city in Western Europe and is a leading commercial 
centre. With its unrivalled variety of heritage and cultural attractions, which 
draw huge numbers of domestic and international visitors, it is one of the 
world’ s most popular tourist city destinations. Annual overseas visitor 
numbers have grown 25% over the past five years and 2016 saw a record 
19.1 million visits. Current forecasts point to increases of 35% and 21% in 
overseas and domestic overnight visits, respectively, by 2025.
Growing population
The city’ s population is currently around 8.6 million, with growth of 16% 
forecast by the mid 2030’ s. Additionally, there is a similar, and growing, 
population in southern England within easy commuting or visiting distance. 
Economic resilience
Its global appeal brings long-term prosperity, which gives it a resilient 
economic base, which is not reliant solely on the fortunes of the wider UK 
economy.

Huge numbers of visitors and large 
working population 
The West End has an unrivalled concentration of entertainment and cultural 
attractions, historic buildings, public spaces, world–class variety of shops 
and a wide choice of innovative and accessible dining and leisure concepts.
Together, these provide an exceptional all-round experience, attracting huge 
numbers of domestic and international visitors. Annual visits are estimated 
at over 200 million. Importantly, it is also a location for a wide range of 
global, national and local businesses, and a popular place to live. The City of 
Westminster generates over 4% of UK economic output and has a working 
population across the borough of almost 700,000. Together with its visitor 
base and its important residential community, this brings high, and growing, 
footfall and spending.
Demand outstrips availability of 
space 
Availability of restaurant, leisure and retail space in the West End is 
constrained, planning regulations are tight and there is demand from a wide 
variety of national and international occupiers. This structural imbalance in 
supply and demand is fundamental to our portfolio’ s rental prospects and 
capital value, both of which have shown significantly greater long-term 
growth and stability through economic cycles than the real estate market 
outside this resilient location. 
Exceptional and improving 
transport links 
The West End is at the heart of the capital’ s underground and bus network. 
The six underground stations closest to our villages handle over 200 million 
passengers annually. The transport network is critical to the success of the 
West End and infrastructure investment to improve capacity and reliability 
continues. 
We expect to benefit greatly from the Elizabeth Line, which opens in a year’ s 
time. Apart from increasing network capacity, it will extend the West End’ s 
provincial catchment area and shorten travel times; factors which are 
expected to increase visitor numbers and retail and leisure spending. 
Passenger numbers at the Tottenham Court Road and Bond Street transport 
hubs are forecast to reach over 200 million by the mid-2020s, materially 
changing footfall patterns in the vicinity. All our properties are within ten 
minutes’ walk, and approximately 80% within five minutes, of these two 
West End stations. 
Responding to the expected substantial increase in footfall around the new 
stations and in nearby streets, a number of improvements to the public 
realm are planned, or underway, to ease pavement congestion and provide 
stronger connections between retail, cultural and leisure attractions. 16

West End entertainment district, 
next to Leicester Square, Piccadilly 
Circus and Shaftesbury Avenue. 
It has an exceptional concentration of restaurants 
which offer a wide range of Chinese and East Asian 
dining choices. The prosperity of this thriving 
destination is underpinned by the large number of 
visitors it attracts throughout the day, and into the 
night, seven days a week, estimated at over 50 
million annually. We are the dominant owner, with 
holdings extending to 3.2 acres.

of a flourishing day-time business 
community and an important 
evening and night-time economy. 
By day, it offers a wide variety of independent, quirky 
shops and is a hub for creativity with many small 
businesses, typically in the media, tech and fashion 
sectors. In the evening and night-time, its distinctive 
atmosphere and exceptional choice of restaurants, 
cafés, bars and clubs, together with nearby theatres, 
create a popular destination for visitors as well as the

on restaurants, 
leisure and retail
Mix of uses, focussed on 
restaurants, leisure and retail 
over lower floors with offices 
and residential on upper floors.
Our 1.1 million sq. ft. of restaurant, leisure and retail space 
provides 70% of total current income
1
. It comprises 282 
restaurants, cafés and pubs and 302 shops, mainly of medium or 
small size. The variety of interesting dining, leisure and retail 
brands gives our destinations a particular identity and provides 
visitors with an experience unmatched by other areas.
New concepts and 
independents favoured 
Careful tenant selection is critical to ensure our areas remain 
popular and attract growing footfall. We favour new concepts, 
independent operators and international retailers making their 
UK debut and prefer mid-market, innovative formats. Our shops 
are neither luxury nor value-led and our restaurants typically are 
neither Michelin-starred nor low-end fast food. 
Long history of demand 
exceeding availability 
In the West End, there is a long history of occupier demand for 
restaurant, leisure and retail space exceeding availability, which is 
often restricted by planning policies. 
Consequently, rents for these uses, in our areas, have not 
demonstrated cyclical nor structural decline, even in times of 
major economic uncertainty. Over the past ten years, ERV for 
these uses has demonstrated like-for-like annualised growth of 
3.8%, despite rental levels remaining broadly flat during the global 
financial crisis. Vacancy levels for these uses over the same 
period have averaged 3.0% of ERV
1,2
. 
Limited obsolescence
An important aspect of restaurant, leisure and retail 
accommodation is that we provide it in shell form only. Tenants 
are responsible for their fit-out, with no capital contribution 
from us. When tenants vacate, we re-let the shell of space 
without incurring significant refurbishment costs, limiting our 
exposure to obsolescence.
Upper floors - a mix of offices 
and residential
The space above our shops and restaurants comprises small 
offices, residential, or a mix of both. A local working population 
and a residential community are essential elements of the 
character and economy of our areas, bringing added life and 
vibrancy, and providing regular customers for our shops, 
restaurants, cafés, and leisure operators.

STRATEGIC REPORT  OVERVIEW  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
 Creating
distinctive, lively and interesting destinations
Attracting footfall and 
spending
Focussed on long-term sustainable income growth 
and value creation, our portfolio management 
strategy includes curating our vibrant restaurant, 
leisure and retail destinations to: 
•  provide an interesting experience to visitors.
•  appeal to occupiers and residents.
• attract footfall and spending.
•  drive sustained demand from tenants and  
high occupancy levels.
Fundamental to the strategy is managing the 
long-term restaurant, leisure and retail  
tenant-mix by: 
• clustering similar uses and brands.
•  managing planning uses to maximise rental  
and capital values.
•  encouraging new formats to ensure our  
villages respond to ever-changing tastes  
and expectations. 
Compounding benefits 
of individual transactions 
across nearby holdings
Over the years, we have identified well-located 
areas where footfall potential is good but rents 
are initially low, often because they have suffered 
from fragmented ownership, lack of investment, 
and the absence of a coherent strategy for uses 
and tenant mix.
By establishing ownership clusters, we can take a 
long-term holistic view in our investment and 
management strategies. This allows us to unlock 
rental and capital value potential whilst 
compounding the benefits of individual transactions, 
such as improved tenant quality and higher rental 
tones, across our adjacent and nearby holdings. 
Growing rents, unlocking 
value, ensuring long-term 
sustainability
We estimate that the average age of our buildings 
is around 150 years. Whilst conservation and listed 
building legislation limits wholescale development 
in our areas, our skill is in bringing long-term 
economic and environmental sustainability to  
our properties. We improve our buildings through 
refurbishment and reconfiguration to enhance 
their rental potential and capital values, and extend 
their useful lives. This involves a combination of:
•   maximising retail, restaurant and leisure space.
•  reconfiguration to provide occupiers with more 
efficient trading space.
•  ensuring they are capable of meeting the needs 
of modern occupiers.
•  maximising environmental performance whilst 
maintaining buildings’ individual characters.
•  converting under-utilised space on upper 
floors to introduce more valuable uses and 
bring long-term economic sustainability to 
buildings as a whole.
Typically, the duration of our schemes is short 
and the costs are modest. Annual capital 
expenditure is normally around 1% of portfolio 
value.

Driving sustained 
occupier demand  
and footfall
We work closely with our tenants to promote 
our areas and their businesses to the West 
End’ s wide domestic and international 
audience.
Our multi-channel marketing includes: 
•  widely-publicised initiatives such as 
shopping, street food and music events.
•  an active digital strategy , including dedicated 
websites for our villages, and an extensive 
social media presence.
•  decorating our villages e.g. at Christmas 
and for Chinese New Year.
We build on relationships with our existing 
tenants who are not only a great source of new 
ideas, but also have their own promotional 
and digital strategies which bring further 
footfall to our villages.
We invest considerable resources in promoting 
our areas to potential retail, restaurant and 
leisure operators. This includes active 
engagement with trade press, research visits 
to UK and international cities, and attendance 
at trade events.
Creating safe and 
welcoming areas  
to drive footfall
We identify, promote and contribute to 
public realm improvements in our villages to 
ensure our streetscapes provide a safe and 
welcoming environment for tenants, their 
customers, and residents. In our experience, 
this is an important catalyst for increasing 
footfall. 
Experience through 
economic cycles
Our long-established team’ s forensic 
knowledge of the West End and experience of 
management through economic cycles is key 
to implementing our strategy. 
Our executive directors have an average length 
of service of nearly 24 years, and the senior 
executive management team has eleven 
years’ average service. 
Additionally , we are supported by a broad range 
of external advisors, who bring us both ideas 
and their wide experience, gained from other 
clients. Everybody involved with Shaftesbury 
– staff and advisors – shares a passion and 
enthusiasm for the West End and our locations.
Based in Carnaby, we are within fifteen 
minutes’ walk of all our holdings. We maintain 
regular contact with tenants, community groups, 
neighbouring owners and other stakeholders, 
and are able to respond quickly to 
opportunities and issues as they arise. 
As a long-term investor in our areas, we are 
active in working with, and supporting, our local 
community to address issues and challenges 
of mutual interest and concern. Also, we work 
closely with Westminster City Council and 
the London Borough of Camden to achieve 
our shared goal of a safe, lively and prosperous 
West End.

OPERATIONAL MEASURES
SUSTAINED RENTAL GROWTH
2,3
MAxIMISE OCCUPANCY
4
Sustained growth in contracted and potential rents is 
fundamental to long-term income and value creation. 
Achieving rents above ERV is a KPI. In our leasing activity, we aim to establish 
new rental tones which exceed ERVs assessed by our external valuers. This 
improves our portfolio’ s reversionary potential by generating rental evidence 
on individual properties, which is then compounded across our nearby 
holdings. Typically, we crystallise this rental potential into contracted income 
over a three - five year period. Importantly, the level of lease incentives 
granted to tenants remains modest.
Our strategy has delivered sustained growth in annualised current income 
and rental values over many years. The 10-year like-for-like compound annual 
growth rate in annualised current income and ERV of our portfolio has been 
4.9% p.a. and 4.6% p.a. respectively, with growth in current income every year .
The reversion currently stands at £30.4 million, 26.6% above annualised 
current income.
Maximises income generated by the portfolio.
Letting space quickly is a KPI. With sustained tenant demand, vacancy levels 
are typically low. Average EPRA vacancy
4
 over the past ten years has been 
2.7% of ERV. At 30 September 2017, EPRA vacancy was 6.0%, which 
included 3.5% in respect of space recently created at our Thomas Neal’ s 
Warehouse and Central Cross schemes.

STRATEGIC REPORT  OVERVIEW  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
 Sustainability
and
 
stakeholders
Our strategic goals:
The environmentally sustainable re-use and  
careful management of existing buildings 
 Effective stakeholder engagement 
 Invest in our community
A fair and ethical framework for employees  
and our supply chain
We pride ourselves on our ability to extend the economic 
useful lives of our buildings through changes of use and 
reconfiguration, within the constraints of legislation, so  
that they continue to meet the needs of modern occupiers.  
This emphasis on refurbishment forms the core of our 
sustainability strategy and is measured through an increased 
number of schemes achieving BREEAM* certification.
In an urban location, which is intensively used by huge 
numbers of visitors, a large working population and residential 
community, social issues and challenges are bound to arise. 
We therefore focus on community-related activities which 
help to support organisations that tackle these problems. 
The Wild West End collaboration, which promotes biodiversity, 
continues to gain momentum. Working with other 
neighbouring landowners, we are increasing the number of 
biodiversity features in our areas and on our buildings, with 
the associated benefits which promote health and well-being 
for tenants and visitors. We were delighted to be recognised 
for our work at Carnaby with pollinators as part of the 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affair’ s Bees’ 
Needs Week. 
In the year ahead we will work together with our stakeholders 
and, in particular, our tenants, to further our sustainability 
objectives. 
See also the full sustainability report on our website.
Management of 
sustainability
A sustainability committee meets quarterly to define objectives, 
agree strategies and review progress. We have a robust and 
effective sustainability policy which is reviewed annually by 
the Board and is available on our website. 
We continue to base our sustainability strategies on the 
core goals: 
Environment: the re-use and careful management of 
existing buildings is inherently sustainable. In addition, 
reducing the running costs of the buildings and improving 
their operational efficiencies is essential to attract tenants, 
as well as meet future regulatory requirements.
Community: engaging with community groups and charities 
to ensure we integrate with our community. 
Stakeholders: engaging with our tenants and investors 
ensures that we are aware of their expectations and can 
respond accordingly. In particular, we work with tenants to 
identify ways in which they can use our buildings more 
efficiently and operate in a more sustainable manner. 
Working closely with our suppliers enables us to control our 
potentially most significant impacts and facilitate better 
standards of service through our supply chain.
Employees: investing in the welfare and development of our 
employees ensures development in their role and 
continuing retention.

Stakeholders
As a long-term business in the West End, we have, over many 
years, created an extensive stakeholder group.
During the year, we have focussed our sustainability efforts on 
developing an air quality strategy and supply chain management 
which involves working in partnership with a number of stakeholders.  
As a consequence of our outsourcing model, the effective 
communication of our policies and objectives through our supply 
chain is important to ensure that an ethical and sustainable 
approach is adopted to the employment of labour and the purchase 
of goods and services on our behalf. 
We have developed a Supplier Code of Conduct which has been 
circulated to our principal suppliers for inclusion in contracts. 
We require payment of the London Living Wage and compliance 
with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 throughout our supply chain.
We publish a statement on our website detailing how we are 
tackling slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain. Having 
written to all our principal suppliers to raise awareness of the 
legislation, we have progressed to identifying the higher risk areas 
within our supply chain and are working to raise awareness and 
monitoring processes. 
We have other policies in place which address human rights, 
whistleblowing and the ethical conduct of our business, all of 
which are included within our sustainability policy. The policy  
is updated annually and provided to organisations in our supply 
chain to encourage them to adopt and enforce similar policies  
in their own businesses.
Two important initiatives were introduced during the year to 
implement the air quality strategy:
•  Consolidation of waste collections in Carnaby. This had the 
dual benefit of reducing vehicle movements in the area and 
minimising the number of refuse bags left on the street, 
thereby improving the visual appearance of the area. 
•  A partnership to provide consolidated and managed deliveries 
for tenants and customers in Carnaby. The aim is through 
delivery consolidation of office supplies, there will be fewer 
vehicles in the area and by using a low emission fleet, air 
quality will be improved. 
Environment
We are committed to sustainability by the re-use and careful 
management of existing buildings. We improve and extend the 
economic life of our buildings.
All our portfolio is located in a Conservation Area and around 20% 
of our buildings are listed. Within these constraints, we strive to 
minimise our impact on the environment. 
Building certifications
Our objective is to achieve BREEAM Very Good for all commercial 
refurbishment schemes. Progress has been made over the year 
to extend the coverage to include larger projects, both 
commercial and domestic; six are in progress and are on course 
to achieve at least our target of Very Good. Three other schemes 
are at pre-assessment or planning stage. 
EPCs
We are making good progress against the Government’ s Minimum 
Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES). From April 2018, leased areas, 
at the time of letting, will be required to have an Energy Performance 
Certificate (EPC) of grade E or above. Properties where we have 
not got EPCs at, or above, this level have generally been let under 
long-term leases which commenced before MESS requirements for 
EPCs were introduced. They will be scheduled for works, to meet 
or exceed the requirements of MEES, when the leases expire.

Community
Our engagement and activities are aligned with the community in 
which our portfolio is located. We have a long record of support, 
and close involvement with, local charities and not-for-profit 
organisations which assist with initiatives in these communities. 
Not only are they our neighbours, but their work ensures that the 
West End remains a vibrant and diverse destination, which 
supports residential communities, businesses and cultural 
organisations and which welcomes growing numbers of domestic 
and international visitors. 
We have continued our membership of the London Benchmarking 
Group (LBG). Our contribution is measured in accordance with 
their framework which provides a standard and comparable 
methodology. 
Our LBG contribution equated to £562,000 and is analysed 
opposite. We provide space to charities and other not-for-profit 
organisations on a short-term basis to assist in promoting their 
charity or cause in our areas or provide cost-effective space for 
organisations in our central locations. 
Our Section 106 contributions (an agreement to make a payment 
to a local authority in respect of planning obligations) totalled 
£513,000. These funds are generally for investment in public 
realm works.  
Our total community contribution equated to 2.5% of EPRA 
pre-tax earnings.  
We are establishing a community investment committee to 
oversee the strategic direction and effectiveness of our 
community giving.

STRATEGIC REPORT  OVERVIEW  SUSTAINABILITY AND STAKEHOLDERS  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
Employees
Our employees play a vital role in implementing our strategy and 
contributing to its evolution. The culture of the organisation and 
our approach to employee training, development and employment 
conditions has been an important part of our focus this year. 
Diversity is important to ensure that we have a mix of views and 
inputs into our business. This is not limited to gender diversity, 
but includes a wide spectrum of attributes and backgrounds we 
look for when recruiting new employees. We have increased our 
employee numbers by three this year and in the recruitment 
process, we implemented new procedures to ensure that we are 
recruiting from the widest talent pool. 
In the real estate sector, there is a concerted effort to ensure 
gender is at the forefront of diversity initiatives. We are 
committed to gender equality and employee development. This is 
reflected in our membership of both Real Estate Balance and 
the RICS Inclusive Employer Quality Mark. Our gender diversity is 
set out below and in the Nomination Committee report. We have 
been ranked first in the FTSE250 progress for Executive Committee 
and Direct Reports in the Hampton-Alexander review on gender 
diversity. Overall, the Group was ranked 37 in the FTSE250 for 
combined Board and Executive Committee diversity.
We believe that investing in training and development is essential 
and, this year, employees underwent an average of 16 hours 
training. A number of new training initiatives have been introduced 
including an e-learning training programme. We have also had 
training on unconscious bias, time management and people 
management skills. Employees receive personal development 
reviews and annual appraisals. The Board and employees 
undertook culture workshops to discuss and document the 
corporate values and behaviours. 
14% of employees have taken advantage of the flexible working 
arrangements we offer.   
We recognise the importance of community volunteering from 
both an employee and a community perspective and are now 
introducing volunteering leave.   
There have been no instances of non-compliance with our 
Anti-Bribery Policy during the financial year.

Strong valuation performance
At 30 September 2017 , the valuation of our portfolio, including our 
50% share of the Longmartin joint venture, increased to £3.64 
billion, following a revaluation surplus for the year of £233.2 million. 
Like-for-like valuation growth was 7.0%, bringing the compound 
annual growth rate over five years to 11.7%. 
This year’ s valuation performance reflects sustained occupier 
demand, intensive asset management activity across our portfolio, 
and continued growth in contracted income and rental values. 
Also, it takes into account expectations of further rental growth, 
good occupancy levels, and low capital expenditure. 
Sustained investor demand yet 
limited supply of assets to acquire
During the year, we have seen a sharpening of investor appetite, 
especially for freehold properties in our locations, which offer 
investment security, growing returns and limited exposure to 
obsolescence. This heightening of demand is particularly evident 
for properties close to prime streets, where lower rental levels 
offer better growth prospects.
The equivalent yield attributed by our valuers to our wholly-owned 
portfolio was 3.46%, an eleven basis points reduction over the 
year. The availability of buildings to purchase remains as limited 
as ever, largely because they are typically in long-term private 
ownership and existing owners are reluctant to sell. Consequently, 
when assets do become available, competition is fierce.
In the Longmartin joint venture, ERV reflects the conclusion of 
the first round of rent reviews, following scheme completion in 
2011, where we have seen significant increases in rents. The 
equivalent yield for this geared long leasehold interest was 
broadly unchanged at 3.8%.
Potential for greater value
Cushman & Wakefield, independent valuer of our wholly-owned 
portfolio, has continued to note that: 
•   our portfolio is unusual in its substantial number of predominantly 
restaurant, leisure and retail properties in adjacent, or adjoining, 
locations in London’ s West End; and
•   there is a long record of strong occupier demand for these 
uses in this location and, as a result, high occupancy levels, 
which underpins the long-term prospects for rental growth.
Consequently, they have reiterated to the Board that some 
prospective purchasers may recognise the rare and compelling 
opportunity to acquire, in a single transaction, substantial parts 
of the portfolio, or the portfolio in its entirety. Such parties may 
consider a combination of some, or all, parts of the portfolio to 
have a greater value than currently reflected in the valuation 
included in these financial statements, which has been prepared 
in accordance with RICS guidelines. 37

The components of the portfolio reversionary potential are shown below. Of the total uncontracted reversion, 67% is accounted for by restaurants, leisure 
and retail. In our locations, these uses have a long history of sustained demand, which, together with a restricted availability of space, underpins their growth 
prospects. We remain confident that, with our proven long-term management strategy, we shall continue to convert this rental potential into cash flow, 
whilst delivering further long-term growth in rental values.

Continuing growth in contracted rents and ERVs
Demand for space in our carefully-curated locations has been good throughout the year, which, together with extensive asset management across the 
portfolio, has continued to drive growth in contracted and potential future income. 
At 30 September 2017, annualised current income stood at £114.1 million, following a like-for-like increase of 3.9% during the year. The ERV of our portfolio, 
which is based on current rental tones and largely reflects rental evidence we have established through our leasing transactions, was assessed by our valuers 
at £144.5 million, £30.4 million or 26.6% above current income. Like-for-like ERV growth over the year was 3.5%.

 L easing  
and 
occupancy
Sustained demand across our portfolio helped deliver strong leasing results. 
Our Thomas Neal’ s Warehouse and Central Cross schemes completed in 
the year and letting is underway.
Leasing 
During the year, we concluded leasing transactions in the wholly-owned 
portfolio with a rental value of £31.1 million (2016: £27.8 million). Of this, 
commercial transactions totalled £23.8 million (2016: £21.6 million) and 
residential lettings and renewals amounted to £7.3 million (2016: £6.2 million). 
Rents for commercial uses were, on average, 6.7% above ERV at 30 
September 2016.
Our share of lettings, lease renewals and rent reviews in the Longmartin joint 
venture was £3.9 million (2016: £2.7 million), with commercial rents achieved 
broadly in line with ERV at 30 September 2016. Accounting for £3.2 million, 
rent reviews delivered average increases of 36.4% compared with previous 
rental levels, an equivalent 5-year CAGR of 6.4%. We have now concluded the 
majority of this first round of rent reviews following scheme completion in 2011.

EPRA vacancy
At 30 September 2017, EPRA vacancy was 6.0% of ERV, an increase of 4.4% 
over the year . The total includes 3.5% in respect of Thomas Neal’ s Warehouse 
and Central Cross. Excluding these larger schemes, EPRA vacancy was 2.5%, 
in-line with our long-term average. 
Completed larger schemes
We have created large, prominent retail and restaurant units at our Thomas 
Neal’ s Warehouse and Central Cross schemes, of which 34% by ERV is now 
let or under offer. Larger space requires occupiers to commit to significant 
investment in fit-out and substantial rental obligations and we expect letting 
periods to be longer for these units than for the smaller space typically we have 
to offer . Current macro-economic uncertainties are showing signs of slowing 
potential tenants’ decision–making processes. We will be patient in selecting 
occupiers which meet our objective of delivering long-term rental growth.
Thomas Neal’ s Warehouse
In the heart of Seven Dials, our scheme created a unique 22,800 sq. ft. 
flagship retail unit. At 30 September 2017, it accounted for 0.7% of 
available-to-let ERV. The space now is under offer to a single occupier. 
Central Cross
Located at the eastern gateway to Chinatown, next to Leicester Square 
Underground station and a few minutes’ walk from Tottenham Court Road 
station, our scheme is well-positioned to benefit from high and growing 
footfall.  
We have created exceptional, double-height accommodation with five 
shops, totalling 34,500 sq. ft., on Charing Cross Road and seven restaurants, 
fronting Newport Place and Newport Court, extending to 13,300 sq. ft.  
At 30 September 2017, all four of the smaller restaurants (ERV: £0.4 million) 
were let or under offer. Subsequently, we have placed one large restaurant 
under offer (ERV: £0.3 million). We have ongoing discussions with a number 
of parties for the remaining space. 41

Restaurants, cafés  
and leisure
Largest provider of dining 
and leisure space in the 
West End
With increasing numbers of visitors to the West End, 
and the widely-recognised growth in interest and 
spending on leisure activities, our 282 restaurants, 
cafés and pubs are important drivers of footfall and 
trading in our locations. We are the largest single 
provider of dining and leisure space in the West End, 
curating high-profile and busy destinations such as 
Chinatown, Kingly Court, Neal’ s Yard and the Opera 
Quarter. The majority of our restaurants provide 
casual dining, with a focus on atmosphere, quality 
and experience, increasingly with an all-day offer.
Operators are attracted to the West End as it provides 
access to exceptional daily footfall throughout the 
year , a discerning, affluent customer base of domestic 
and international visitors and a large working population. 
The independent sector is particularly active, reflecting 
the interest from diners to experience high quality, 
creative and accessible new food concepts, often 
then sharing their experiences on social media. 
Demand outstrips 
availability of space
Availability of restaurant and leisure accommodation 
remains constrained by local planning policies, which 
restrict large-scale increases in these uses, whether by 
development, extension of existing space, or conversion 
from other uses. The barriers to entry are high, with 
existing operators reluctant to relinquish their valuable 
sites, other than for significant premiums. Generally, 
tenants ensure they preserve their valuable occupation 
rights and our bad debt history is negligible. 
Demand for the smaller space typically we have  
to offer is healthy, particularly from independent 
operators, established street-food concepts and 
start-ups seeking their first site. 
At 30 September 2017, EPRA vacancy for these uses 
was 3.7%, and included 3.1% in respect of the recently 
completed Central Cross scheme. Other vacancy was 
0.6%, of which 0.4% was under offer. Our ten-year 
average EPRA vacancy for restaurants, cafés and 
leisure is 1.6%.
Newer leases provide us 
with more flexibility
Tenants invest considerable sums fitting out their 
space, sometimes spending the equivalent of 3-5 
years’ rent and, therefore, we grant longer leases 
than for shops, to provide an extended period over 
which occupiers can amortise this cost.
Until recently, leases were granted over whole buildings 
and provided tenants with renewal rights on expiry. 
We find that upper floors often are now under-utilised 
and, where opportunities arise, we seek to negotiate 
the surrender of these leases to secure vacant 
possession. This allows us to improve the configuration 
of space on the lower floors, attract new operators 
on more beneficial terms, and often release valuable 
upper floors for other uses.
Reflecting the strength of demand for our restaurant 
space, in recent years we have reduced the term of 
leases we grant and introduced more flexibility at 
expiry. Also, we include turnover-related rental 
top-ups, giving us the higher of market rent and a 
percentage of annual turnover. This provides a useful 
contribution to both income and earnings.

Retail
Contribution to the West 
End as a leading shopping 
destination  
Providing 77% of our current annualised retail 
income, our large clusters of shops in Carnaby and 
Seven Dials make an important contribution to the 
West End’ s reputation as a leading global retail 
destination. 
Wide range of shop sizes 
and rents
An important element of the character of our 
destinations is the wide range of shop sizes and 
rental levels across our buildings and streets. 
Of our 302 shops, 209 are small (ERV < £150,000 p.a.), 
providing 37% of our current annualised income, and 
93 are large (63% of current annualised income). This 
allows us to provide a variety of retail formats, from 
start-ups to more established operators, whilst 
offering retailers flexibility to expand or introduce 
new concepts. 
Importantly , rental levels in our high-footfall and spending 
locations are competitive compared with nearby streets 
(see the chart, opposite).
Responding to ever-
changing shopper tastes
The majority of our space is let to fashion and lifestyle 
retailers.
T enant selection is a key aspect of our strategy to create 
and maintain distinctive retail locations. Shoppers’ 
behaviour is changing rapidly with an emphasis on 
innovation, experience, fulfilment and the ability to 
find something different from that commonly found 
in shopping centres and on high streets. To attract 
visitors, we seek out new, interesting concepts from 
across the world, to maintain a fresh retail mix. 
Additionally, we maintain flexibility in our leasing so 
we are able to respond to shoppers’ ever-changing 
tastes and retailers’ requirements.
Interest remains good
With high footfall, we continue to have good demand 
for space, both from domestic and overseas retailers, 
often opening new concept stores or flagships.  
Despite well-publicised challenges being faced by the 
retail sector, leasing activity during the year has been 
good with lettings, renewals and rent reviews being 
concluded ahead of ERVs assessed by our valuers. 
Importantly, currently we have a number of tenants 
renewing leases early or upsizing, demonstrating their 
confidence in continued profitable trading in our 
locations.
EPRA vacancy at 30 September 2017 was 11.1% of 
retail ERV, of which vacant space at Thomas Neal’ s 
Warehouse and Central Cross accounted for 7.2%. Of 
other available space, 1.3% was under offer. Average

Offices
Large provider of small, 
flexible office space
With 403,000 sq. ft. of office space, let to 243 
tenants, we are an important provider of small office 
accommodation in the core West End. Our average 
letting is 1,380 sq. ft. at £55 per sq. ft. (2016: £51 per 
sq. ft.) and average ERV is £61 per sq. ft. (2016: £61 
per sq. ft.).
Whilst we already provide flexible terms and space, 
we are working to ensure we remain competitive with 
other SME space providers.
Limited availability of space
Demand for our office space remains good, particularly 
from the media, creative and tech sectors, which often 
find their natural home in Soho and Covent Garden. 
Availability of smaller office space remains low across 
our locations. Whilst we have seen a modest increase 
in lease incentive packages during the year , occupancy 
levels have been high. Retention rates have been 
good, with 30 leases being renewed. 
Office vacancy at 30 September 2017 was 4.0% 
of total office ERV.

Residential
Popular area to live
The West End is a popular place to live and we continue 
to see sustained demand to rent our mid-market 
apartments. Our flats are mainly studios and one or two- 
bedroom apartments, many of which have been created 
from the conversion of small office accommodation 
back to its original residential use. We have a number 
of further planning consents for residential conversion, 
which we could implement in the future.
High occupancy and 
reliable cash flow
Demand for our mid-market apartments remains good, 
resulting in high occupancy levels and a stable cash 
flow. Normally, we have less than ten apartments 
available at any one time. At 30 September 2017 we 
had six apartments available, of which five were 
under offer.
During the year , we have seen a slight softening in rental 
levels, owing to increased availability of newly-built 
buy-to-let flats across central London. We continue 
our rolling programme to upgrade our apartments, in 
order to ensure their specification remains competitive 
and maintain our high occupancy rates.
Preference to lease, not sell, 
our apartments
Most of the value of our buildings is in the commercial 
uses on the lower floors. We prefer to lease, rather 
than sell, our apartments in order to retain control 
over whole buildings to realise the long-term potential 
in those valuable lower floors. During the year, we 
identified , and sold , nine apartments which we considered 
did not compromise long-term management flexibility.
  2018 KEY PRIORITIES
Continue our rolling 
refurbishment programme 
to upgrade our apartments 
and improve their rental 
prospects.
Identify future potential 
residential conversions.
Maintain strong cash flow

Portfolio
investment
Considerable activity continues, adding to income, increasing rental 
tones and unlocking value. Important acquisitions secured during the 
year.
Investing across our portfolio 
Continuing the trend over recent years, high levels of asset 
management and refurbishment activity continue across our 
portfolio, improving our buildings, increasing income and rental 
potential, and unlocking value. 
Capital expenditure during the year totalled £40.3 million, representing 
1.29% of wholly-owned portfolio value, with schemes extending to 
249,400 sq. ft. (13.7% of wholly-owned floor space). This included 
£14.5 million in respect of our three larger schemes: Thomas Neal’ s 
Warehouse, Central Cross and 57 Broadwick Street.
During the year, we secured 62 planning consents, an important part 
of maintaining a pipeline of projects. At year end, we had 22 planning 
applications awaiting decision.
We continue to identify opportunities to implement further asset 
management initiatives. This often involves negotiations to secure 
vacant possession of space to enable us to accelerate the 
implementation of our ideas.
Projects in hand at year end
At 30 September 2017 , we had schemes extending to 124,000 sq. ft. and 
representing 6.6% of ERV, down from 11.0% a year ago. This decrease 
was largely due to the completion of our Thomas Neal’ s Warehouse and 
Central Cross schemes.

57 Broadwick Street, Carnaby
Construction at our mixed-use project at 57 Broadwick Street, at the 
eastern entrance to Carnaby, is progressing well. Located within a few 
minutes’ walk of the new western entrance to Tottenham Court Road 
station, on Dean Street, the scheme will provide: 
•  11,800 sq. ft. of flagship retail and restaurant space over the lower floors;
•  15,000 sq. ft. of new grade A office accommodation across the upper 
floors; and 
•  two apartments totalling 1,900 sq. ft. 
The scheme is expected to cost £14.9 million, of which £10.2 million had 
been incurred by 30 September 2017. Construction of the retail and 
restaurant accommodation (ERV: £1.0 million) has now completed and the 
space either is let or under offer. Marketing of the office accommodation, 
which is planned to complete early in 2018, has commenced. 
Other schemes
During the year, schemes with an ERV of £4.6 million completed and are 
largely now income-producing. New schemes, with an ERV of £4.1 million, 
commenced. 
We had 47 schemes underway at 30 September 2017, extending to 95,300 
sq. ft. and representing 4.9% of ERV. These included 17,600 sq. ft. of 
restaurants and cafés (ERV: £1.5 million), 22,500 sq. ft. of shops (ERV: £1.9 
million), 32,300 sq. ft. of office space (ERV: £2.1 million), and 38 apartments 
either being created or up-graded (ERV: £1.1 million). Of this, space with an 
ERV of £0.9 million was under offer.
In the Longmartin joint venture, our share of capital expenditure during the 
year was £1.2 million. At 30 September 2017, the ERV of our 50% share of 
space held for refurbishment was £0.7 million. This includes the 
redevelopment of the prominent 13,000 sq. ft. mixed-use building on the 
corner of Long Acre and Upper St Martin’ s Lane. Expected to complete in 
late 2018, our share of the cost of this scheme is expected to be £4.6 million.
Improving the public realm
Improving the public realm is a key part of our management strategy.
Public realm improvements both to Cambridge Circus and the western 
section of Earlham Street are now close to completion. We expect that 
these schemes, together with the opening of the Elizabeth Line, will, over 
time, materially improve footfall throughout Seven Dials, bringing benefits 
particularly to those streets where rental values are currently materially 
below their long-term potential.
At our Central Cross holding, Westminster City Council’ s improvement 
scheme for Newport Place and Newport Court, which we are funding, has 
commenced recently. It is scheduled for completion in phases from spring 
2018. This new public space will be traffic-free each day, other than for 
servicing between 7am and noon, providing the opportunity, subject to 
planning and licensing approvals, for al fresco dining. 
As part of the plans to improve pedestrian capacity, in advance of the 
opening of the Elizabeth Line, Westminster City Council have designated 
Broadwick Street as a priority pedestrian route. There have already been 
improvements to the public realm at the eastern end of the street and we 
are now working with the City Council on plans to improve the streetscape 
around 57 Broadwick Street and the eastern entrance to Carnaby.
Acquisitions with good rental growth 
prospects
£37 .1 m
ACQUISITIONS
During the year, we acquired seven properties at a total cost of £37.1 million. 
These comprised four restaurants, two shops, one pub and 3,700 sq. ft. of 
office space, of which 2,300 sq. ft. has planning consent for residential use. 
Three of these buildings were acquired with vacant possession. Through 
short and medium-term asset management initiatives, these additions each 
offer the potential for good rental and capital growth, either individually or 
in combination with our existing ownerships. 
We continue to identify and investigate opportunities to acquire assets in, 
and around, our areas, which offer the opportunity for future rental growth. 
90-104 Berwick Street 
In August 2017, we entered in to a contract to forward purchase a long-
leasehold interest in 90-104 Berwick Street, Soho, at a price of £38.5 million.
Located at the southern end of Berwick Street, the property is currently 
being redeveloped to provide 12,500 sq. ft of retail, a 5,500 sq. ft. 
supermarket, a 2,000 sq. ft. restaurant and a 110-bedroom hotel. Both the 
hotel and supermarket have been pre-let. The redevelopment is expected 
to complete in late 2018, which will, subject to satisfying various contractual 
conditions, trigger the completion of the acquisition.
This strategic acquisition increases our ownership of Berwick Street 
frontages to 50%. Once completed, it will enable us to accelerate our 
long-term strategy on this important north-south route in the heart of 
Soho, which we consider to have good medium to long-term prospects. We 
expect Berwick Street, which is currently in the final phase of major public 
realm improvements, to benefit from a significant increase in footfall from 
the opening of the Elizabeth Line and Tottenham Court Road’ s new ticket 
hall on Dean Street in December 2018.

STRATEGIC REPORT  ANNUAL REVIEW  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
This year’ s results show further 
growth in income, earnings and 
dividends, resulting from continued 
crystallisation of our portfolio’ s 
reversionary potential and the 
benefit of lower financing costs. 
Net asset value growth was driven 
by a strong portfolio valuation 
performance.  
Presentation of financial information
Our property portfolio is a combination of properties which are 
wholly owned by the Group and a 50% share of property held in 
joint venture.
The financial statements, prepared under IFRS, includes the Group’ s 
interest in its joint venture as one-line items in the Income Statement 
and Balance Sheet. The analysis below is based on the IFRS financial 
statements.
Internally, management consider the valuation of properties and our 
debt position on a proportionally consolidated basis, including our 
50% share of the joint venture. Consequently, the analysis of the 
valuation on pages 36 to 38 and the finance review on pages 56 to 57 
are presented on this proportionally consolidated basis.
We consider that this presentation better explains to stakeholders the 
Group’ s activities and financial position. Measures presented on a 
proportional consolidation basis are alternative performance measures 
as they are not defined under IFRS. Further details are set out on 
page 140.

Net property income
Rents receivable increased by £5.0 million to £103.4 million (2016: £98.4 
million). Like-for-like growth was 5.0%, as we continue to convert our 
portfolio’ s reversionary potential into contracted cash flow. Acquisitions 
contributed £1.3 million to the increase, whilst vacancy arising from our 
larger schemes and disposals reduced rents receivable compared with last 
year by £0.8 million and £0.2 million, respectively.
Irrecoverable property charges were £15.1 million (2016: £14.3 million), 
representing 14.6% of rents receivable (2016: 14.5%). After these costs, net 
property income was £88.3 million, up 5.0% (2016: £84.1 million).
Reported earnings
Profit after tax for the year amounted to £301.6 million (2016: £99.1 million). 
Basic earnings per share increased to 108.1p (2016: 35.6p), largely due to:
•  the portfolio revaluation surplus, which contributed 82.7p (2016: 38.9p).
•  net property income which added 31.7p (2016: 30.2p).
•  the decrease in the fair value deficit of our interest rate swaps added 7.9p, 
compared with an increase in this deficit, which reduced earnings per 
share by 12.5p last year. 
•  net finance costs, excluding fair value movements, reduced earnings per 
share by 11.7p (2016: 12.1p).
•  a decrease in our share of the post-tax profits from our joint venture, 
which contributed 2.3p (2016: 6.6p), largely driven by a lower revaluation 
surplus.
Additionally, last year’ s earnings per share were reduced by 10.5p as a result 
of a one-off charge to recognise the fair value of our 8.5% Debenture Stock.
EPRA earnings
1
As is usual practice in our sector, we produce alternative measures for 
certain indicators, including earnings, making adjustments set out by EPRA in 
its Best Practice and Policy Recommendations. EPRA earnings are a 
measure of the level of underlying operating results and an indication of the 
extent to which current dividend payments are supported by recurring 
earnings. In our case, EPRA earnings exclude valuation movements in 
respect of our properties and interest rate swaps, profits on disposal of 
investment properties and deferred tax arising in our Longmartin joint 
venture. In 2016, it also excluded the charge for recognising the fair value of 
our Debenture Stock. EPRA earnings are reconciled below.
EPRA earnings increased by 15.9% to £45.2 million (2016: £39.0 million) and 
EPRA EPS grew 15.7% to 16.2p (2016: 14.0p). This increase was principally 
driven by growth in net property income as we continue to capture our 
portfolio’ s reversionary potential, lower finance costs following our 
refinancing in October 2016 (see page 56), and increased profits from our 
Longmartin joint venture, having concluded a number of rent reviews during 
the year.

these charges, increased by £1.0 million to £9.6 million (2016: £8.6 million), 
reflecting growing activity within our business, increased employment costs 
and additional headcount. We do not capitalise administrative costs.

Valuation gains and disposal profits
The surplus arising on the revaluation of our wholly-owned portfolio amounted 
to £230.6 million (2016: £108.3 million). This represented a like-for-like 
increase of 7.5%, principally driven by like-for-like ERV growth of 3.4%, 
together with yield compression of 11 basis points. Further details are 
provided on pages 36 to 38.
Disposals of non-core assets in the period totalled £13.8 million, 12.6% above 
book value at 30 September 2016. These included nine apartments, a small 
mixed-use building in Covent Garden and 1,500 sq. ft. of ancillary commercial 
basement space, which was sold to an adjoining owner. After costs, these 
disposals generated a profit in the year of £1.1 million. 
Net finance costs
Net finance costs (excluding the change in fair value of interest rate swaps) 
decreased by £0.9 million to £32.7 million (2016: £33.6 million) largely as a 
result of the benefits of reduced borrowing costs following our refinancing 
in October 2016. This was partly offset by:
•  higher net debt as a result of acquisitions and further investment in our 
portfolio; and
•  an accelerated write-off of unamortised deferred loan issue costs of 
£0.3 million, following our refinancing in September 2017.
Debt and interest rate swaps fair value 
movements
Following increases in long-term interest rates during the year, the fair value 
deficit in respect of our interest rate swaps decreased, leading to a credit to 
the Income Statement of £22.0 million. We have now terminated these 
swap contracts. 
Share of Longmartin post-tax results
Our share of post-tax profit from the Longmartin joint venture decreased by 
£12.1 million to £6.4 million (2016: £18.5 million), largely due to a lower revaluation 
surplus of £2.6 million (2016: £11.3 million). Our share of net property income 
increased by £1.3 million, following the successful conclusion of a number of 
rent reviews which contributed to a like-for-like increase in rents receivable 
of 17.2%. 
Tax
As a REIT, the Group’ s activities are largely exempt from corporation tax and, 
as a result, there is no tax charge in the year (2016: £Nil). 
In common with most businesses, we do collect and pay other taxes and levies 
e.g. payroll taxes, VAT, Stamp Duty Land T ax, Business Rates, and withholding 
tax on Property Income Distributions. During the year, the total amount paid 
in respect of these taxes amounted to £18.1 million (2016: £22.2 million). In 
addition, our share of corporation tax incurred by the Longmartin joint 
venture was £0.9 million (2016: £0.6 million).
The Group’ s tax strategy is to account for tax on an accurate and timely 
basis. Our appetite for tax risk is low and we structure our affairs based on 
sound commercial principles, rather than engaging in aggressive tax planning. 
We maintain an open dialogue with HMRC with a view to identifying and 
solving issues promptly. HMRC have designated us as a ‘low risk’ taxpayer, 
a status we aim to maintain. Our detailed tax strategy is available on 
our website.
Dividends
As a REIT, we are required to distribute a minimum of 90% of qualifying REIT 
income, calculated by reference to tax rather than accounting rules, as a 
PID. This is treated as income for investors, and is taxed according to their 
own tax status. PIDs are subject to withholding tax at basic rate income tax, 
except for certain classes of investors who can register to receive their 
distributions gross, rather than net.
Notwithstanding this distribution requirement, our dividend policy is to maintain 
steady growth in dividends, reflecting the long-term trend in our income and 
EPRA earnings, adjusted to add back the non-cash accounting charge for 
equity-settled remuneration. T o the extent that dividends exceed the amount 
available to distribute as a PID, we pay the balance as ordinary dividends. 
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 8.1p per share, up 7.3% on 
last year’ s final dividend (7.55p per share). Together with the interim dividend 
of 7.9p per share, this brings the total for the year to 16.0p per share, an 
increase of 8.8% on 2016 (14.7p per share).  
This increase reflects growth in net property income and earnings 
enhancements from the refinancing reported last year and is covered 1.01 
times by EPRA earnings per share and 1.04 times by adjusted earnings per 
share
1
, after adding back the non-cash accounting share option charge of 
£1.4 million. 
If approved at the 2018 AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 16 February 
2018. The exceptional charges associated with our refinancing activities 
during the year are charged against our current year qualifying REIT income. 
Since these charges outweigh qualifying income in the year , the final dividend 
will be paid as an ordinary dividend. It is likely that PID distributions will 
resume in 2018.
The Board monitors the Group’ s ability to pay dividends out of available 
resources and distributable reserves. Prospective dividend payments are 
estimated in our forecasts, which also take into consideration future 
liquidity requirements. 
At 30 September 2017, we had distributable reserves of £218.0 million. It is our 
policy, where possible, for subsidiary companies to distribute the majority of 
their distributable profits to Shaftesbury PLC annually. Currently, there are 
no restrictions on subsidiaries’ ability to distribute profits.

Net asset value per share increased by 10.7% to £9.49 (2016: £8.57), largely due 
to the revaluation surplus on our investment properties, which contributed 82p. 
Operating profit, excluding the revaluation surplus, added 27p. Net finance 
costs reduced net asset value per share by 4p, after a credit for the decrease 
in the fair value deficit attributable to our interest rate swaps, prior to their 
termination in September 2017, of 8p. Our share of the Longmartin joint 
venture contributed 2p and dividends paid during the year totalled 15.45p.
EPRA NAV
1
EPRA NAV is a sector-recognised benchmark, which makes adjustments to 
reported NAV to provide a measure of the fair value of net assets on a long-term 
basis. Assets and liabilities which are not expected to crystallise in normal 
circumstances are excluded. In our case, the calculation excludes deferred 
tax related to property valuation surpluses in the Longmartin joint venture 
and the fair value of interest rate swaps. Having terminated our remaining 
interest rate swaps during the year, there is now no adjustment to EPRA NAV 
in respect of these.
EPRA NAV per share increased by 64p (7.2%) to £9.52 (2016: £8.88). EPRA 
earnings of 16.2p per share were offset largely by dividends paid in the year 
(15.45p per share). The revaluation surpluses from the wholly-owned portfolio 
and the Longmartin joint venture added 83p. The cancellation of our remaining 
interest rate swaps reduced EPRA NAV by 20p. Growth over the year, 
excluding these exceptional refinancing costs, was 9.5%.

Sources of capital
Under REIT rules, we are required to distribute the majority of our recurring 
earnings. Furthermore, the importance of our ownership clusters in long-term 
value creation means that opportunities to recycle capital are limited.
Therefore, investment in our portfolio is funded through a combination of 
equity and debt, with equity providing the permanent capital to support our 
long-term strategy. We use debt to enhance, not drive, returns.
Low-risk debt structure
Consistent with the long-term nature of our portfolio and secure income 
streams, our core debt finance is provided by long-term arrangements with 
covenant structures which do not restrict the active management of our 
assets. Medium-term revolving facilities provide us with flexibility in managing 
our resources and capacity to invest further in our existing portfolio, in 
particular allowing us to act swiftly when acquiring properties.
Over the long term, we would expect debt to represent around one third  
of our invested capital, although we consider other metrics, such as interest 
cover, when considering gearing levels.
Financing activity during the year
We have concluded important initiatives during the year to strengthen further 
the Group’ s financing arrangements, taking advantage of the current interest 
rate environment and lenders’ appetite to provide secure long-term finance. 
During the year we issued £575 million of secured bonds:

AMOUNT
£M RATE MATURITY
October 2016 285.0 2.487% 2031
September 2017 290.0 2.348% 2027
The proceeds of the first issue, in October 2016, were used to redeem  
our £61 million 8.5% Debenture Stock, including a prepayment cost of  
£31.1 million, and to terminate interest rate swaps with a notional principal  
of £55 million, at a cost of £34.1 million. The balance was used to reduce 
drawings against our revolving credit facilities. 
Following the second issue, in September 2017, we repaid bank facilities 
totalling £75 million, reduced drawings against our revolving credit facilities, 
with the balance being retained as cash. Subsequently, we cancelled our 
remaining interest rate swaps at a cost of £57.9 million.
Together, these transactions increased our financial resources, diversified 
our sources of debt, reduced the blended cost and extended the average 
maturity. 
At 30 September, our cash and undrawn revolving credit facilities totalled  
£320.6 million and our blended cost of debt had fallen over the year by 1.2% 
to 3.3%. The marginal cost of our undrawn facilities was just 1.2%. As we 
continue to fund net investment in our portfolio through further drawings 
against these facilities, our weighted average cost of debt will fall further.

STRATEGIC REPORT  ANNUAL REVIEW  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
Risk 
management
The Board’ s attitude to risk management is consistent  
with its low overall appetite for risk.
This report should be read in conjunction with the  
viability statement on page 64. 
Overview
The Board structures the Group’ s operations to minimise exposure to 
investment, operational and financial risks, and to ensure that there is a 
rigorous, regular review of risks and mitigation across its activities.
Important factors contributing to the relatively low risk of our business 
include:
•  The Group invests only in London’ s West End, where there is a long history  
of resilience, stability and sustained occupier demand for restaurant, 
leisure and retail space, which are the principal sources of our rental 
income and portfolio value
•  With a diverse tenant base, there is limited exposure to any single tenant
•  The nature of our portfolio does not expose us to risks inherent in 
material speculative development schemes
•  We have an established and experienced management team, based in one 
location, close to all our holdings
•  We manage our balance sheet on a conservative basis with moderate 
leverage, long-term finance, a spread of loan maturities, good interest  
cover and with the majority of interest costs fixed.
Management structure
As a foundation to effective day-to-day risk management, we have a culture 
which encourages open dialogue within the management team and with the 
wide range of external advisors we employ in running the business. Our 
team, based in one office, within fifteen minutes’ walk of all our holdings, 
comprises four executive directors and 25 staff. The executive management 
team, with an average tenure of over 16 years, has an in-depth knowledge of 
our business and the West End property market. 
The Board’ s attitude to risk is embedded in the business, with executive 
directors closely involved in all aspects of operations and significant 
decisions. Non-executive directors approve capital, debt and non-routine 
transactions over a specified level. 
Senior management, below Board level, is incentivised in the same way  
as executive directors to achieve the Group’ s strategic goals of delivering 
long-term growth in rental income, capital values and shareholder returns. 
Decisions are made for long-term benefit, rather than short-term gain. 
Succession planning across the management team is continually monitored 
by the Board.

STRATEGIC REPORT  ANNUAL REVIEW  RISK MANAGEMENT  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
Risk management and internal control
The Board reviews the nature and extent of the Group’ s principal risks and 
uncertainties, and monitors the risk management framework and internal 
control systems. Such systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risks faced by the business and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. Their adequacy and 
effectiveness are monitored through the risk management and audit 
processes which include financial and property management audits. 
The Group has established processes and procedures to identify, assess, 
and manage the principal risks and uncertainties we face. These processes 
and procedures were in place throughout the year and remained in place 
up to the date of the approval of the Annual Report and accord with the 
Financial Reporting Council’ s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting (2014).
The key elements of the Group’ s procedures and internal financial control 
framework are:
•  Close involvement of the executive directors in all aspects of day-to-day 
operations, including regular meetings with employees to review risks and 
controls.
•  Clearly defined responsibilities and limits of authority.
•  Defined schedule of matters for decision by the Board including significant 
acquisitions, disposals, major contracts, material refurbishment/ development 
proposals and any other transaction outside the normal course of business.
•  A comprehensive system of financial reporting and forecasting, which 
includes forecast liquidity requirements and loan covenant compliance.
•  The day-to-day management of the Group’ s portfolio is outsourced to 
two managing agents. The Group monitors the performance of each 
managing agent and has established extensive financial and operational 
controls to ensure that each maintains an acceptable level of service and 
provides reliable financial and operational information. The managing 
agents share with the Group their internal control assessments. The Group 
periodically uses the services of an external consultant to review the 
managing agents’ operational processes and controls.
Risk assessment
Operational and financial risks facing the Group are monitored through  
a process of regular assessment by the executive team. The aim of this 
assessment is to:
•  Provide reasonable assurance that material risks are identified.
•  Ensure appropriate mitigation action is taken at an early stage.
Risks are considered in terms of their impact and likelihood from operational, 
financial and reputational perspectives. Risks, and the controls in place to 
mitigate them, are formally reported, discussed and challenged, at meetings 
of the Audit Committee and the Board. To the extent that significant risks, 
failings or control weaknesses arise during the year, these are reported to 
the Board and appropriate action is taken to rectify the issue and implement 
controls to mitigate further occurrences. 
The Audit Committee has monitored the Group’ s risk management and 
internal control system, and having reviewed the effectiveness of material 
controls, has not identified any significant failings or weaknesses in the 
Group’ s controls during the year.
Principal risks and uncertainties 
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks and 
uncertainties which might prevent the Group achieving its goal of long-term 
growth in rental income, capital values and shareholder returns. These risks 
and uncertainties are consistent with those reported in 2016. 
The performance of the UK economy has been relatively resilient since the 
EU referendum in June 2016. Whilst national consumer spending trends are 
unclear, trading in our locations continues to be buoyant, benefiting from 
increasing numbers of international visitors, whose spending power has 
been enhanced by the strength of their local currencies against Sterling 
since the referendum.
Looking ahead, the UK faces a period of uncertainty as it negotiates its exit 
from the EU, which brings a risk of lower business and consumer confidence. 
Whilst it is not possible to conclude as to any long-term impact this may 
have on our business, we expect the West End, underpinned by its wide 
appeal and dynamic economy, will maintain its long record of resilience. 
Details of the principal risks and uncertainties, mitigation and evolution of 
risk during the year are set out on pages 61 to 63. 61

GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION RISK
RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION COMMENTARY
HOW RISK HAS 
EVOLVED
Events which discourage visitors 
to the West End e.g. 
•  Threats to security or public 
safety due to terrorism
•  H e a l t h c o nc er n s  
(e.g. pandemics)
•  Reduced visitor numbers, 
spending and occupier 
demand
•  Reduced rental income  
and/or capital values
•  Potential increased vacancy 
and declining profitability
• Damage to property
•  Inherent risk given the 
geographic concentration  
of our investments in a high 
profile location
•  Insurance cover maintained 
for terrorism and loss-of-rent
•  Close liaison with statutory 
authorities to maximise 
safety of visitors
•  D e t ai l e d e m er g e n c y 
response plans 
London has a growing 
population, is the most visited 
city destination for international 
tourists in the western world, 
and current forecasts are for 
further growth in visitor 
numbers. Across the West End,  
spending and occupier demand 
continue to be healthy
The UK’ s terrorism threat level 
currently is “severe” after 
briefly being raised to 
“critical” earlier this year
Competing destinations lead to 
long-term decline in footfall in 
our villages
•  Reduced visitor numbers 
and occupier demand
•  Reduced rental income  
and/or capital values
•  Potential increased vacancy 
and declining profitability
•  Ensure our villages maintain  
a distinct identity
•  Management strategies to 
create prosperous 
destinations within which 
tenants can operate
•  Seek out new concepts, 
brands and ideas to keep our 
villages vibrant and appealing 
•  C o n s i ste n t st r a te g y  
on tenant mix, which evolves 
over time
•  Marketing and promotion of  
our villages
•  KPI to deliver sustainable rental 
growth
•  Regular board monitoring of 
performance and prospects
Footfall and occupier demand 
across our villages remains 
good. We continue to see 
rental growth and low 
underlying vacancy
REGULATORY RISK
All our properties are in the 
boroughs of Westminster and 
Camden. Changes to national 
or local policies, particularly 
planning and licensing, could 
have a significant impact on our 
ability to maximise the long-
term potential of our assets
•  Limit our ability to optimise 
revenues
• Reduced profitability
•  Reduced capital values
•  Ensure our properties are 
operated in compliance with 
local regulations
•  Make representations on 
proposed policy changes, 
to ensure our views and 
experience are considered
•  Mix of uses in our portfolio 
means we are not reliant on 
income from one particular 
use
There are no current 
indications that the evolution 
of planning and licensing 
frameworks, either as a result 
of national or local legislation, 
will have a material impact on 
the Group’ s business for the 
foreseeable future

ECONOMIC RISK
RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION COMMENTARY
HOW RISK HAS 
EVOLVED
Economic uncertainty and 
lower confidence could reduce 
consumer spending. Together 
with upward cost pressures, 
this could reduce tenant 
profitability and occupier 
demand
• Pressure on rents
• Declining profitability
•  Reduced capital values
•  Focus on assets, locations 
and uses which have 
historically proved to be 
economically resilient
•  Tourism and retail/leisure 
spending in the West End are 
not reliant on the wider-UK 
economy
• Promoting our areas
•  Diverse tenant base with 
limited exposure to any one 
tenant
•  Tenant deposits held against 
unpaid rent obligations at 
30 September 2017: £18.5m
Restaurant, leisure and retail 
tenants provide 70% of our 
annualised current income
In our areas, trading, footfall 
and spending have been 
resilient since the EU 
referendum and we continue 
to benefit from healthy 
demand and rental growth. 
However, uncertainty will 
remain until the UK's future 
arrangements with  
the EU are negotiated
Decline in the UK real estate 
market due to macro-
economic factors e.g. global 
political landscape, currency 
expectations, bond yields, 
interest rate expectations, 
availability and cost of finance, 
relative attractiveness of 
property compared with other 
asset classes
•  Reduced capital values
•  Decrease in NAV, amplified 
by gearing
•  Loan covenant defaults 
•  Focus on assets, locations 
and uses where: 
-  there is a structural 
imbalance between 
availability of space and 
demand
-   which have historically 
proved to be economically 
resilient and have 
demonstrated much lower 
valuation volatility than the 
wider market
•  Regular review of investment 
market conditions including 
bi-annual external valuations
•  Conservative levels of 
leverage, with the majority 
at fixed rates
•  Spread of sources of finance 
and loan maturities
•  Quarterly forecasts including 
covenant headroom review
•  Pool of uncharged assets 
available to top up security 
held by lenders
Interest rates have continued 
at historically low levels
Present market sentiment is 
that increases will be moderate 
and gradual, although the 
current political and economic 
backdrop increases uncertainty

STRATEGIC REPORT  ANNUAL REVIEW  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
 Viability 
 stat ement
The Board has assessed the prospects of 
the Group over a five year period. Based  
on the assumptions set out below, it has  
a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over  
this assessment period.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The most relevant potential impacts on viability, which arise 
from our principal risks and uncertainties are set out below:
•  A substantial and sustained decrease in visitor numbers to  
the West End and our villages which could result in reduced 
occupier demand, rental income and/or capital values,  
higher vacancy and declining profitability
•  Regulatory changes which could reduce profitability and 
capital values
•  Changing economic conditions which could reduce capital 
values, reducing headroom in loan covenants.
Scenario analysis
In carrying out this review, we assumed no further acquisitions 
nor capital expenditure, other than that which was committed 
or approved by the Board. Similarly, we assume no new debt 
facilities are raised and no debt refinancing takes place, other 
than refinancing the bank facilities which mature during the 
forecast period. 
The review overlaid the potential impact of the principal risks 
which could affect solvency or liquidity in ‘severe but plausible’ 
scenarios onto the five-year forecasts and concluded that the 
business would remain viable. It included sensitivity analyses 
which flexed inputs to the forecasts including reduced income, 
profitability and capital values, both individually and in unison, to 
reflect these severe but plausible scenarios. 
Asset value declines resulting from increasing equivalent yields 
to levels similar to those in 2008/09 were modelled. This would 
result in a near halving of our portfolio valuation. In unison, we 
considered decreases in rental income of up to 40%. These 
assumptions would represent a significant contraction in the 
size of the business over the five-year period. However, our 
assessment is that such a scenario would not threaten the 
viability of the Group.  
Viability
Based on the assessment outlined above, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
five-year period to September 2022.
The Strategic Report on pages 1 to 64 was approved by the 
Board on 27 November 2017.
Brian Bickell Chris Ward 
Chief Executive Finance Director
The Board considered a five-year review of the Group’ s prospects, prepared by senior 
management. This period reflects lease lengths or rent review patterns across the 
majority of our portfolio, and corresponds with the Group’ s current forecast period. 
Our forecasts are updated half-yearly and reflect the Group’ s established strategy of 
long-term investment in London’ s West End, its existing commitments, available 
financial resources, and long-term financing arrangements. They consider profits, cash 
flows, funding requirements and other key financial ratios over the period, as well as the 
headroom in the financial covenants contained in the Group’ s various loan agreements.  
KEY FORECAST ASSUMPTIONS  
 
ASSUMPTIONS COMMENT
The Group had cash and 
undrawn committed loan 
facilities at 30 September 
2017 totalling £320.6 million, 
which comfortably exceeds 
the Group’ s commitments over 
the assessment period. This 
assumes an ability to refinance 
revolving credit facilities totalling 
£150 million and £125 million 
which mature in 2018 and 2020 
respectively.
The Group maintains a prudent approach 
to gearing, with debt facilities which are 
largely fixed and long-term in nature. At 
30 September, our loan-to-value ratio
1
 
was 26.7%. The interest on all drawn debt 
was fixed at that point and our weighted 
average maturity of debt was 10.3 years.
The two facilities which mature during the 
period of assessment represent 22.2% of 
our total committed debt facilities. 
We are currently in advanced negotiations 
to refinance both of these facilities and the 
Board has reasonable confidence that these 
negotiations will conclude successfully. 
Crystallisation of the portfolio 
reversionary potential over the 
period. 
We have a long record of crystallising 
the independently-assessed ERV of our 
portfolio over a three-to-five year period. 
67% of the total uncontracted portfolio 
reversion arises from restaurants, leisure 
and shops, the demand for which, in 
our locations, is not cyclical and has 
demonstrated sustained long-term 
growth over many years. ERVs are based 
on current, proven rental tones, and do 
not assume any further growth.

BUSINESS, PR OVIDE LEADERSHIP 
AND SUPERVISION AND 
REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS 
ON ITS STEWARDSHIP
Corporate 
Governance
Dear shareholder
I am delighted to be writing to you following my first 
year as your Chairman. 
Corporate governance is embedded in our culture 
and the day-to-day running of your Company. I am 
committed to maintaining the high standards we 
have demonstrated for many years. We pride 
ourselves on being open, transparent and engaged 
with our shareholders, stakeholders and our local 
community. 
We have a well-balanced Board with a good range  
of skills. It is important that I ensure there is a steady 
and smooth rotation and refreshing of non-
executive directors.
Oliver Marriott retired as a director in July having 
served for almost eight years. I thank him, on behalf 
of the Board and shareholders, for his contribution 
during this time. 
We will appoint a new non-executive director,  
Richard Akers, on 28 November 2017. His skills will 
complement those of his fellow directors. He will be 
proposed to shareholders for election at the AGM 
in February 2018. The process leading up to his 
recommendation for election is contained in the 
Nomination Committee report. We are delighted to 
welcome him to the Board.  
In accordance with good governance, each of my 
fellow directors and I will stand for re-election at the 
AGM. The Nomination Committee had recommended 
the re-election of Jill Little and Hilary Riva, who have 
both served on the Board for more than six years, 
having considered the contribution that they make 
to the business and their continuing independence. 
Compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance 
Code
The Company has complied in full with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code during the year.   
The application of the principles of the Code is 
contained in this report and in the individual 
Committee reports which follow.  
Employees
The knowledge, experience and commitment of our 
employees is critical to the delivery of our strategy. 
I have spent time this year getting to know, not only 
my fellow Board members, but also everyone who 
works for us.  
This year , we have focussed on employee recruitment, 
training and development. We have instigated a 
number of procedures around recruitment to ensure 
we recruit from a diverse talent pool. Training and 
development are important to ensure employees 
grow in their roles and that we continue to retain 
their skills and experience.  75
GOVERNANCE  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
We have recently formed an Executive Committee 
comprising the executive directors, Company 
Secretary and the senior leadership team. Its role 
is to monitor operational matters and contribute to 
the longer term evolution of the Group’ s strategy 
and its implementation. It provides senior employees 
below Board level, greater engagement and 
experience in managing the Group’ s business.   
Further information can be found on page 70.
Culture
Culture is important in the operation of the 
Board and throughout the Group. Our corporate 
culture underpins the success of our business 
and is embedded throughout our long-term 
business model.
The Board has an open and transparent culture 
which is facilitated and monitored by me. This is 
particularly evident in Board meetings where we 
engage in constructive and open dialogue.  
As part of our July meeting, Board culture was 
discussed. This was the first stage of our work, to 
articulate and document our culture and values, 
which has been extended throughout the 
organisation.  
Data protection
In addition to the risk and control framework review, 
particular attention has been focussed this year 
to ensure that we have appropriate data and 
information governance processes, controls and 
policies in place ahead of the implementation of 
the General Data Protection Regulation in May 2018. 
Further information on our risks is contained in 
risk management on pages 59 to 63.
Board performance 
evaluation
This year, we have undertaken a full external 
Board performance review. The process, 
recommendations made, and the actions to 
implement those recommendations, are 
summarised on page 77.

There is a balance of executive and non-executive 
directors, with a wide range of business skills, 
including property, finance, retail and fund 
management on our Board. All directors 
contribute to constructive debate in the 
boardroom and to the implementation of the 
Group’ s strategy. 
The Chairman was independent on his 
appointment to the Board. He chairs the 
Nomination Committee, but, in line with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, is not a member of 
the Remuneration or Audit Committees. Each of 
the other non-executive directors is considered 
by the Board to be independent. 
The Board meets regularly and there is an annual 
cycle of topics to be considered, including key 
management and financial updates, as well as 
approval of significant acquisitions and 
refurbishment schemes.
Each Committee provides a summary of business 
discussed to the Board and the minutes of all 
Committees are circulated to the Board.
Whilst strategy is considered at every Board, one 
meeting each year is dedicated to this topic. The 
July 2017 Board meeting focussed on a strategy 
session which considered the impact of external 
changes and developments and how the Group’ s 
business model might be affected. This included 
consideration of the Company’ s culture, 
succession, the impact of technology, changes in 
consumer behaviours and the tourism market as 
well as the resources and skills the business may 
require in the future.  
Employees below Board level are invited to present 
to the Board on operational topics during the course 
of the year. Non-executive directors have direct 
and open access to employees below Board level.

Board performance evaluation
No evaluation was undertaken last year due to the change of the Chairman 
but, the Board undertook to carry out a full externally-facilitated evaluation 
during the course of 2017. Boardroom Dialogue was appointed to carry 
out the review. Meetings were held with each director and the Company 
Secretary individually. The report was discussed at the September 
meeting of the Board.  
•  The conclusion of the evaluation was that the Board functions well.  
•  The appointment of a new Chairman has been received positively by 
stakeholders and he has settled well into the role.  
•  There is an excellent working relationship at all levels of the Board.
Areas to focus on in the year ahead include:
•  Continuing focus on succession planning for both executive and 
non-executive directors.
•  Increased training and development of employees.
•   Introduce a NED only session at every Board meeting (currently held 
annually).  
• Streamline the volume and format of information to the Board.
The Senior Independent Director reviewed the performance of the 
Chairman. The Chairman reviewed the performance of all other 
directors. 
A review of each committee was undertaken by its members.

KEY ACTIVITIES
Dear shareholder
The primary role of the Committee is to consider 
Board composition and orderly succession, both for 
executive and non-executive directors. 
During the year , Oliver Marriott retired following eight 
years’ service and Richard Akers will join the Board. 
Succession planning and 
development
As Chairman of this Committee, my focus is on  
Board succession and talent development to ensure 
that there is a pipeline of able and experienced 
people in the business for potential future senior 
executive and Board appointments. 
The Committee ensures that the evolution of the 
Board’ s membership is planned and properly managed, 
and that in the event of unforeseen changes, 
management and oversight of the Group’ s business 
and long-term strategy would not be disrupted.
T o manage executive di rector succession, we address 
continuity in, and development of, the management 
team below Board level. Current executive directors 
have a long tenure and there are no immediate 
vacancies at Board level. However, we recognise that 
it is important to develop internal talent. Our 
development planning encourages employees to 
fulfil their potential and grow in their roles. 
Search for a non-executive 
director
As part of the evolution of Board membership, and 
following the retirement of Oliver Marriott, a search 
was undertaken to recruit a non-executive director. 
The Board considered the skills required and 
appointed The Zygos Partnership, to undertake the  
search. They have worked with us on a number of 
appointments and appreciate our business, strategy, 
culture, diversity policy and the skills we were seeking. 
Shortlisted candidates were interviewed by myself 
and the Senior Independent Director. The final 
interview was with the Chief Executive, executive 
directors and the Company Secretary. 
The Committee recommended to the Board the 
appointment of Richard Akers, who joins us on 28 
November 2017. We are delighted with his 
appointment, which brings his broad range of 
experience to complement the overall skill set of the 
Board. He has wide experience within the real estate 
and construction sectors. The Committee was careful 
to ensure that his other roles did not give rise to any 
conflicts of interest and that he has sufficient time 
to devote to his directorship. 
A detailed induction programme has commenced 
to familarise Richard with the business. 
We will continue to keep the composition of the 
Board under review.
KEY RESPONSIBILITIES 
•  
Review the structure, size  
and composition of the Board 
and its Committees (including  
skills, experience, independence 
and diversity) and make  
recommendations to the  
Board accordingly.
•  
Lead the process for new  
Board appointments and  
review succession for directors 
and senior management.
•  
Review the time commitment 
expected from the Chairman  
and non-executive directors.

of the Board, its Committees 
and directors is conducted 
annually.

Directors standing for 
election and re-election
Richard Akers will be proposed for election to the 
Board at the 2018 AGM.
Jill Little and Hilary Riva have been on the Board for 
more than six years. The Committee has concluded 
that they continue to bring to the Board the 
appropriate range of skills and expertise to operate 
effectively and maintain their independence. The 
Committee therefore recommends that they remain 
on the Board for a further year. Therefore, on the 
advice of the Committee, the Board proposes the 
re-election of each director. Board tenure is set

Diversity
The Board recognises the importance of diversity, 
both in its membership, and in the Group’ s 
employees. It has a clear policy to promote 
diversity across the business.   
The Board considers that quotas are not appropriate 
in determining its composition and has therefore 
chosen not to set targets. 
All aspects of diversity, including but not limited to 
gender , are considered at every level of recruitment. 
All appointments to the Board, and elsewhere in 
the Group, are made on merit. Gender diversity of 
the Board and Group is set out below,

a forum for LGBT real estate professionals. 
The Group has committed to the RICS Inclusive 
Employer Quality Mark scheme which aims to drive 
behaviour changes by encouraging businesses in 
the real estate sector to look carefully at their 
employment practices and to ensure inclusivity is 
embedded in their operations. During the year, 
we have appointed three new employees and 
these principles have been applied in the 
recruitment process. Unconscious bias training 
has been held for all employees.

GOVERNANCE  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
The Committee is an important element of the 
Group’ s governance structure and provides effective 
oversight of the performance, independence and 
objectivity of the auditor and the audit process.  
Our role is to review and advise the Board on 
financial reporting including the processes around 
the portfolio valuation, which is the most significant 
figure in the annual results. This, and other judgements 
made by the Board in the preparation of the financial 
statements, are discussed in detail below. 
The Committee advises the Board on various 
statements made in the Annual Report, including those 
on viability, going concern, risk and controls and 
whether, when read as a whole, the Annual Report is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’ s performance, business model and strategy. 
The Committee also oversees the Group’ s risk 
management framework and processes.  
Going concern
The Committee reviewed whether it was appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation 
of the results. In considering this, we reviewed the 
Group’ s five-year forecasts, availability of committed 
bank facilities and expected headroom under the 
financial covenants in our debt arrangements. This 
review included sensitivity analyses. Following the 
review, it recommended to the Board that it was 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis. The 
Board’ s confirmation is set out on page 102.
Viability statement
At the request of the Board, the Committee reviewed 
the Viability Statement and the period for which the 
Board should assess the prospects of the Group. 
Last year, the Group considered a five-year period 
to be appropriate. Following the review, the 
Committee concluded that this period remains 
appropriate. The Committee reviewed a report from 
management which set out the basis for the conclusions 
in the Viability Statement, including scenario analyses. 
The Board’ s Viability Statement is set out on page 64.
KEY RESPONSIBILITIES 
•  
Review in detail the work  
of the external auditor and  
valuer and any significant  
financial judgement made  
by management.
•  
Monitor the Group’ s  
reporting process and  
financial management.
•

and effective.

Financial statements
The executive directors confirmed to the Committee that they were 
not aware of any material misstatements in the Annual Report and the 
auditors confirmed that they had found no material misstatements in 
the course of their work. 
After reviewing the reports from management and, following its 
discussions with the auditors and valuers, the Committee is satisfied 
that the financial statements appropriately address the critical 
judgements and key estimates, both in respect of the amounts 
reported and the disclosures. The Committee is satisfied that the 
processes used for determining the value of the assets and liabilities 
have been appropriately reviewed, challenged and are sufficiently 
robust. 
2017 annual report:
Fair , balanced and understandable 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report. The 
Committee reported to the Board that the Annual Report:
•
 was fair, balanced and understandable;
•
  provided the necessary information for shareholders to assess the 
Group’ s performance, business model and strategy; and
•
  had been written in straightforward language, without unnecessary 
repetition of information, and that the use of any adjusted 
measures, e.g. those set out in EPRA Best Practice 
Recommendations, had been adequately explained and reconciled 
to the financial statements and not been given more prominence 
than a corresponding measure under IFRS. 
The Committee considered the systems and controls around the 
preparation of the financial statements, the procedures to bring 
relevant information to the attention of the preparers of the financial 
statements, and whether the report was in accordance with the 
information provided to the Board during the year.
Significant judgements: 
Valuation of investment properties
The valuation opinion provided by independent external valuers is one 
of the critical components of the annual and half year financial results. 
External valuations are subjective and require significant judgement to 
be exercised by the valuation firm.  
To assist the Board’ s review of the valuation, management prepared  
a detailed analysis. The valuers presented their valuation to the 
Committee, providing comparable evidence for key judgements. 
Following the presentation, the Committee had a discussion with the 
valuers without management present. 
The auditors use in-house real estate specialists, who met with  
the valuers as part of their audit and report their findings to the 
Committee. 
The Board considered the valuation at its meeting to approve  
the financial statements.
Other areas of judgement
Whilst not material in the context of the Group’ s assets or net assets, 
the Committee reviewed the judgements made by management in 
calculating the charge for equity-settled remuneration. 84
GOVERNANCE  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
External auditors
The Committee is satisfied with the effectiveness of the external audit. The 
Company has complied with the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.
This is the second year that Eamonn McGrath has been the lead audit 
partner. There are no contractual obligations restricting the Group’ s choice 
of external auditor. In accordance with the current regulations, the Group 
will re-tender the audit at least every ten years.
Annual auditor assessment 
Annually, the Committee assesses the qualifications, expertise, resources, 
and independence of the Group’ s external auditors, as well as the 
effectiveness of the audit process. It does this through discussion with the 
Finance Director, review of a detailed assessment questionnaire and 
confirmations from the external auditor. The Chairman of the Committee 
and the Finance Director also met with an independent partner of Ernst & 
Young LLP . 
This is the second year that Ernst & Young LLP have been our auditor and 
following informal assessments, to date, the Committee is satisfied with the 
effectiveness of the external audit and the interaction between the auditors 
and the Committee. Following completion of the current year’ s audit, the 
Committee will carry out a formal assessment of the audit process.  
Ernst & Young LLP has confirmed to the Committee that: 
•
  They have internal procedures in place to identify any aspects of 
non-audit work which could compromise their role as auditors and to 
ensure the objectivity of their audit report. 
•
  The total fees paid by the Group during the year do not represent a 
material part of their firm’ s fee income. 
•
  They consider that they have maintained their audit independence 
throughout the year. 
The Committee has satisfied itself as to their qualifications, expertise and 
resources and remains confident that their objectivity and independence 
are not in any way impaired by reason of the non-audit services which they 
provide to the Group. 
Award of non-audit assignments to the 
external audit firm
The policy of the Committee is that non-audit assignments are not awarded 
to the external audit firm if there is a risk that their audit independence and 
objectivity could be compromised. Other than in exceptional circumstances, 
non-audit fees should not exceed audit and assurance fees in any year. The 
award of any non-audit assignment to the Group’ s auditors in excess of 
£25,000 is subject to the prior approval of the Committee. 
There was one non-audit assignment during the year relating to the issue of 
a First Mortgage Bond by Shaftesbury Chinatown PLC.
Internal audit 
In view of the focussed nature of the Group’ s business, the close 
involvement of the executive directors in day-to-day decision making and 
relatively simple structure, together with the regular independent reviews of 
the processes and controls of managing agents, the Committee has advised 
the Board that, at the present time, it considers that there is no need to 
establish an internal audit function.
The need for an internal audit function is reviewed annually.
Audit fees 
Fees payable to the Group’ s auditors for audit and non-audit services are 
set out in note 4 to the Financial Statements on page 121. 
Total fees related to non-audit services represented 41% of the total fees 
for audit and assurance services (2016: 50%). 
The auditors were also paid £31,000 (2016: £27,000) for their audit of 
Longmartin Properties Limited. The Company’ s 50% share of this was 
£15,500 (2016: £13,500).

GOVERNANCE  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
We have reported another strong set of results which 
has delivered growth in income and the value of the 
business. We have continued intensive asset 
management of our portfolio and completed important 
refinancing initiatives, as summarised in the Strategic 
Report on page 56. Against the backdrop of this 
performance, the Committee’ s main decisions during 
the year related to the following elements:
Annual bonus outcomes
At the beginning of each year, we set financial and 
operational targets for the annual bonus scheme 
which align with the Group’ s long-term strategy. Where 
projects extend for periods beyond the financial year , 
annual targets are set to assess progress towards 
achievement of the ultimate objectives. In setting 
targets, we use the Group’ s KPIs which drive value 
through the delivery of long-term rental growth. 
The outcome of performance against our targets  
was 55% of the maximum potential award. The 2017 
bonus targets are disclosed in full on page 94. 
Each executive director has elected to receive his 
award solely in the form of deferred shares, and will 
therefore receive an award under the Deferred 
Annual Share Bonus Scheme of 82.5% of salary in 
December 2017, which will vest in December 2020.
2018 salary review 
Salaries of executive directors were reviewed and 
increases of 2% were approved, effective from 
1 December 2017. This is below the average salary 
increases awarded to employees.
2018 annual bonus
The Committee reviewed the annual bonus 
framework for 2018 to ensure it remained aligned to 
the Group’ s strategy and operational goals. We 
decided that the performance measures remained 
appropriate but would introduce two minor 
amendments to the calibration for the year ahead. 
First, we are increasing the weighting of the “growth 
in ERV” metric from 20% to 35% of the overall 
bonus to reflect the strategic importance of rental 
growth to the business. Second, for that ERV metric, 
we will introduce a target range with a payout scaled 
from threshold to maximum, depending on the 
performance achieved. This reflects feedback from 
our investors and is intended to make the target 
more stretching whilst also providing greater 
incentive to maximise performance within a range of 
potential outcomes. T argets will be fully disclosed 
retrospectively in next year’ s report.

 r eport 
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present our 2017 remuneration report. 
The remuneration policy sets out our approach  
to the reward of executive and non-executive 
directors. Our aim is to provide a remuneration 
structure which is fair, with incentives aligned  
with the Group’ s strategy and long-term object ives ,  
and which encourages executive continuity. 87
GOVERNANCE  REMUNERATION REPORT  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
LTIP vesting
LTIP awards which were made in 2014 will vest in 
December 2017 , based on a three year performance 
period which ended on 30 September 2017. 
Annualised TSR of 15.5% per annum exceeded 
that of the benchmark (FTSE 350 Real Estate 
Index) by 11% per annum over the period. Growth 
in NAV exceeded the benchmark RPI by 7.9% 
over the period. As a result of this performance, 
the TSR target and the NAV target were fully met 
resulting in 100% vesting of these awards. 
2018 LTIP grant 
An LTIP award will be made in December 2017 at 
125% of basic annual salary with a three-year 
performance period ending 30 September 2020.  
Subject to performance against the targets (TSR 
performance compared with the FTSE 350 REIT 
Index and NAV growth), which will remain 
unchanged, the awards will vest in December 
2020, and be released in December 2022 
following a two-year post-vesting holding period. 
Alignment with employees
In reviewing salaries and bonus outcomes, we 
consider overall remuneration packages of the 
executive directors. Employee remuneration 
levels are considered when reviewing executive 
directors’ salaries. Employees receive the same 
benefits as directors; they participate in the LTIP 
and have the opportunity to defer their annual 
bonus into shares. They also participate in 
Sharesave, and receive health and life insurance.  
The Company makes a pension contribution to 
employees: executive directors receive 25% of 
salary and all other employees receive 17.5% of 
salary. This is paid into a pension or may be taken 
as a cash equivalent, in which case it is reduced for 
any associated tax borne by the Group.
Review of non-executive 
director and chairman fees
Fees for non-executive directors, including the 
Chairman, are reviewed every two years. 
Fees for non-executive directors were reviewed by 
the Board and new fee levels equating to an increase 
of 3.6% will take effect from 1 December 2017 .   
The Committee reviewed the Chairman’ s fee 
taking into account his time commitment, 
experience and performance. His performance 
during his first year in the role was reviewed in a 
process led by the Senior Independent Director.  
The Committee agreed to increase the fee to 
£225,000 with effect from 1 December 2017. The 
fee will remain below the lower quartile of UK 
listed companies of a similar financial size and 
most of our closest industry peers.  
Remuneration policy
Our policy was approved at the 2016 AGM, with 
94% of shareholders, who voted, voting in favour . 
The policy table is summarised on page 91 for 
ease of reference. 
We are not proposing any changes this year. 
The 2016 Annual Remuneration Report was approved 
at the 2017 AGM, with 99% of shareholders who 
voted, voting in favour.
We will review our policy during 2018 for 
shareholder approval in 2019.  
We look forward to receiving your continued 
support at the forthcoming AGM.

ADVISOR TO THE COMMITTEE 
Deloitte LLP act as independent  
advisor to the Committee.    
 
Deloitte LLP is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and voluntarily operates 
under the Code of Conduct in relation to 
executive remuneration consulting in the 
UK. The Committee is satisfied that the 
Deloitte LLP engagement partner and team 
that provide remuneration advice to the 
Committee do not have connections with 
the Group that may impair their objectivity 
and independence. The fees charged by 
Deloitte LLP for the provision of independent 
advice to the Committee during the 
financial year were £24,500 (excluding 
VAT). Deloitte LLP provided no other 
services to the Group during the year . 
•  Salary review
•  Review advisor’ s performance

• Dilution review
Context for the Group’ s 
remuneration approach
The Group has 29 employees, including four 
executive directors. The combined holdings of 
the executive directors is just over 3.1 million 
shares (market value at 30 September 2017 of 
circa £31 million). This equates to individual 
holdings of between 3 and 30 times their 
annual salary. 
These substantial holdings have been built up 
over a number of years through a combination of:
•  
T aking the annual bonus in shares through 
the Deferred Annual Share Bonus scheme; 
•
  Retaining shares from the LTIP; and
•
 Acquiring shares for cash.
The Group’ s small team of executive directors 
and key employees all have a close 
involvement in the continuing development 
and implementation of the Group’ s strategy. 
Consequently, the Committee considers it 
appropriate that, in setting objectives and 
measuring performance, emphasis is placed 
on team rather than individual performance. 
Average length of service of the executive 
directors is 24 years and of the executive 
committee is eleven years.  88 89

Executive Directors
ELEMENT OPERATION / PERFORMANCE MEASURES MAXIMUM POTENTIAL VALUE
SALARY Salaries are normally reviewed annually with effect from 1 December. Any increases are  
determined with reference to inflation and the salary increases for other employees, unless 
there is a change of role or responsibility or a new director is recruited 
Sector and other relevant market data (e.g. against constituent companies of the FTSE 350  
REIT Index) may be requested from remuneration advisors as required
The Committee recognises the importance of setting salaries at levels in the context of  
market median levels in the real estate sector, but which are not excessive in relation to the 
Group’ s particular strategy and features. The emphasis in the Group’ s remuneration policies is  
to place greater weight on performance-based rewards within the overall remuneration package
The Committee does not 
specify a maximum salary 
or maximum salary increase
Further details on salary 
levels and any increases 
are provided in the Annual  
Remuneration Report
ANNUAL 
BONUS
Annual performance targets are set by the Committee at the beginning of the year and are  
linked to the Group’ s strategy and key business objectives 
At the end of the financial year , the Committee evaluates performance against these objectives, 
whilst also taking into account overall financial performance and future prospects. The Committee 
also satisfies itself that short-term targets have not been met at the expense of long-term goals 
Within the limits of the scheme, the Committee has discretion to adjust bonus outcomes  
(upwards or downwards) as it considers appropriate, to ensure alignment of pay with overall 
performance and market conditions
Minimum performance required for any part of the bonus to be earned is calibrated so as  
to be appropriately stretching and achievable 
Where directors take all or part of the bonus as an award of shares (in the form of a  
conditional award of shares or a nil-cost option), these awards vest after a minimum of  
three years from grant under the Company’ s deferred bonus plan. No further performance  
conditions apply. Awards may also, at the Committee’ s discretion, be settled in cash 
Malus and clawback provisions apply to all elements of the bonus. Performance is assessed 
against a set of key financial and non-financial annual measures which may vary each year  
depending on the annual priorities of the business
Measures will be weighted in alignment with the Group’ s strategy for each year. A substantial  
part of the total bonus will be based on quantitative KPIs. Further details of the measures, 
weightings and targets applicable for a given period are provided in the Annual Remuneration 
Report for that year
Directors have the choice 
to take a bonus in shares or 
cash, in full or part as follows:
Up to 150% of salary if taken 
entirely in shares;
or
Up to 100% of salary if taken 
entirely in cash
LTIP Awards may be granted in the form of nil cost options, conditional share awards or, at the  
Committee’ s discretion, be settled in cash 
At the end of the performance period, performance against the targets is calculated, and the 
percentage of awards that will vest is determined
Unless the Committee determines otherwise, vested awards will then be subject to an additional 
holding period before participants are entitled to receive their shares. A holding period will  
normally last for two years, unless the Committee determines otherwise
Malus and clawback provisions apply to the LTIP 
The awards will be subject to performance targets measured over a three-year period. It is intended 
that these performance measures are aligned to strategic objectives and shareholder value
The current performance measures are:
• TSR measured relative to a relevant index of peers; and
• NAV growth
Threshold vesting is 25% of the award . The detailed targets are set out in the Annual Remuneration Report
Maximum value 150% of salary 
at date of grant in normal 
circumstances
Maximum value 200% of salary 
in exceptional circumstances 
such as executive recruitment 
(this has not been used to 
date)

PLANS
Executive directors are eligible to participate in other share plans, which are offered on

BENEFITS
Each executive director currently receives:
• car allowance
• private medical cover
• life insurance
• permanent health insurance
Other benefits may be provided if considered reasonable and appropriate by the  
Committee, including, but not limited to, housing allowance and relocation allowance
There is no maximum value. 
Benefits are set at a level 
which the Committee 
determines is reasonable and

Annual bonus targets
Maximum bonus of up to 150% of salary (if taken in shares) and 100% of salary (if taken in cash).
Disclosure of annual bonus targets for the year ending 30 September 2018 is deemed to be commercially sensitive and therefore the actual targets are not 
set out in this report. A range for the rental growth target is being introduced with a threshold level for achievement. The targets will be disclosed 
retrospectively next year, provided they are no longer commercially sensitive.

The Committee considers specific disclosure of targets regarding the 
achievement of rental levels, the speed of completing letting or delivery 
of specific projects or transactions would be prejudicial to the interests of 
shareholders. As a consequence of the geographic concentration of the Group’ s 
portfolio, disclosure of such targets could have a material adverse impact on the

LTIP awards of 125% of salary will be granted in December 2017. Performance will be measured over a three-year period which commenced on 1 October 2017. 
A two-year post-vesting holding period will apply to these awards.
The performance measures will remain the same as those applicable to awards made last year and are as set out on page 95.
Non-executive directors’ fees from 1 December 2017
Non-executive director fees are reviewed every two years and were reviewed this year to take effect from 1 December 2017. 
Fees for the Chairman were increased to £225,000. Fees for non-executive directors were increased to £57,000. There is an additional fee of £10,000 
where a non-executive director chairs a committee and for the Senior Independent Director (if not already in receipt of a Committee Chairman fee). 
There was no change to that fee. The Chairman does not receive an additional fee for chairing the Nomination Committee.

1  Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme: Directors elected to take their annual bonus for 
the year ended 30.9.2016 in shares which were purchased in the market. The face value 
is calculated using the price paid to acquire the shares, being £8.91028. No further 
performance criteria are applied to share awards under this scheme.
2  LTIP: Awards of nil cost options are made by the Committee at 125% of salary divided by 
the average share price over five days prior to the date of grant. The face value is 
calculated using the average share price used to determine the number of shares 
awarded, being £9.026 (the average share price over the five days prior, up to and 
including 5.12.16). There is a three year performance period (targets below) with a two

Review of past performance 
The chart below shows the TSR for the Company compared with the FTSE 350 REIT Index, of which the Company is a constituent, over nine years. The 
Committee uses this index as one measure of performance for awards of shares under the LTIP , as it considers this is an appropriate measure against which 
the relative performance of the Company should be compared for the purposes of considering executive directors’ remuneration. 
The table below the TSR chart details the Chief Executive’ s single total figure of remuneration over the same period.

Greenhouse gas reporting 
We report our greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with UK legislation. 
The figures relate to landlord controlled common parts such as staircases. 
The numbers are therefore minimal. 
Overall, energy consumption has increased by a small amount. Due to the 
increased use of renewable energy in the national grid, greenhouse gas 
emissions in the portfolio decreased by 18% from 1,565.5 tonnes to  
1,288 tonnes.

1  For the reporting year we have again followed the UK Government environmental reporting guidance and used the 2017 UK Government’ s Conversion Factors for Company Reporting. 
Greenhouse gas emissions are reported using the following parameters to determine what is included within the reporting boundaries in terms of landlord and tenant consumption:
  S c o p e 1 – direct emissions includes whole building gas data. Fugitive emissions from air conditioning are included where it is the landlord’ s responsibility within the common parts.  
There are no company vehicles to report within Scope 1.
  S c op e 2 – indirect energy emissions includes purchased electricity for the head office and landlord controlled common parts areas and a small number of buildings where  
the occupied areas and common parts are on the same meter. Electricity used in refurbishment projects has also been recorded.  104
GOVERNANCE  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
 Dir ect ors’ 
 responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the Group and 
Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company 
law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 ‘accounting 
policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors’ and then apply them 
consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state that the Group and Company has complied with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it  
is inappropriate to do so.
Directors’ responsibility statement under 
the Disclosure and Transparency Rules
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 68 to 
69 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
•  the Group and Company financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
•  the Strategic Report contained on pages 1 to 64 of the Annual Report 
includes a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group and Company, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
Directors’ statement under the  
UK Corporate Governance Code
The Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’ s performance, business model and strategy. 
 The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the Group’ s and Company’ s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’ s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. 
Each of the directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge the Annual 
Report:
•   presents information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; and
•  provides additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements of IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
Group’ s and Company’ s financial position and performance.
 A copy of the financial statements of the Group is placed on the Company’ s 
website.
Information published on the internet is accessible in many countries with 
different legal requirements.

appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, 
going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the 
annual report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you 
whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
•    the disclosures in the annual report set out on pages 61 to 63 that 
describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed or 
mitigated;

they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity;
•    the directors’ statement set out on page 118 in the financial statements 
about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any 
material uncertainties to the entity’ s ability to continue to do so over a 
period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements;
•    whether the directors’ statement in relation to going concern required 
under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
•    the directors’ explanation set out on page 64 in the annual report as to 
how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions.

Overview of our audit approach
Key Audit 
Matters
• The valuation of investment property (including properties within the Longmartin joint venture)
• Revenue recognition including the timing of revenue recognition, and the treatment of rents and incentives
Audit scope The Group operates in London’ s West End and consists of a single reportable segment across eleven statutory entities. All of the 
Group’ s companies were included in the scope of the audit. The Group audit team performed direct testing of the Longmartin joint 
venture balances which are included in the Group.
Materiality • Overall Group materiality: £36m which represents 1% of total assets.
•  Specific Group materiality: £3.7m which represents 5% of operating profit before investment property valuation movements and 
net finance costs.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period 
and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which 
had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.
RISK OUR RESPONSE TO THE RISK KEY OBSERVATIONS  
COMMUNICATED TO THE  
AUDIT COMMITTEE
Risk: The valuation of investment property 
£3,407m (plus £231m being the Group’ s share in 
the Longmartin joint venture)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (pages 82 
to 84); Accounting policies (page 120); and Note 9 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements (pages 
123 to 124)
The valuation of investment property (including 
properties held in the joint venture) requires 
significant judgement and estimates by management 
and the external valuers. Any input inaccuracies 
or unreasonable bases used in these judgements 
(such as in respect of estimated rental value and 
yield profile applied) could result in a material 
misstatement of the statement of comprehensive 
income and balance sheet.
There is also a risk that management may 
unduly influence the significant judgements 
and estimates in respect of property valuations 
in order to achieve property valuation and 
other performance targets to meet market 
expectations or bonus targets.
Our audit procedures around the valuation of investment property included:
•  We understood and assessed the design and implementation of the 
Group’ s controls over data used in the valuation of the investment 
property portfolio and management’ s review of the valuations.
•  We evaluated the competence of the external valuers which included 
consideration of their qualifications and expertise, as well as their 
independence.
•  We performed testing over the inputs to the valuations. For a sample 
of properties we tested the contracted rent and key lease terms by 
agreeing this back to lease agreements. 
We have audited the inputs, 
assumptions and review the 
methodology used by the external 
valuers. We conclude that the 
inputs and methodology applied are 
reasonable and that the external 
valuations are an appropriate 
assessment of the fair value of 
investment properties at 30 
September 2017.
We did not identify any exceptions 
or material errors in the input 
testing for the sample we tested.
We conclude that the valuation of 
each of the assets in the sample 
tested by our Chartered Surveyors 
are within a reasonable range.
We conclude that management 
provided an appropriate level of 
review and challenge over the 
valuations but we did not identify 
evidence of undue management 
influence.
•  The Group audit team includes Chartered Surveyors who tested a sample of 
properties. They challenged the valuation approach and assumptions. The 
sample size they tested accounted for 84% of the fair value of investment 
properties (including investment properties held in the Longmartin joint 
venture). Our Chartered Surveyors compared the equivalent yields applied 
to each property to an expected range of yields taking into account market 
data and asset specific considerations. They also considered whether the 
other assumptions applied by the external valuers, such as the estimated 
rental values, tenant incentives and development costs to complete were 
supported by available data such as recent lettings and occupancy levels.

RISK OUR RESPONSE TO THE RISK KEY OBSERVATIONS  
COMMUNICATED TO THE  
AUDIT COMMITTEE
•  Together with our Chartered Surveyors, we met with the external 
valuers to discuss the findings from our audit work described above 
and to seek further explanations as required. We also discussed the 
impact of current market conditions on the property valuations.
•  In respect of the properties not in the sample tested by our Chartered 
Surveyors (16% of the fair value), we performed detailed analytical 
procedures on a property-by-property basis. This involved forming 
an expectation of the fair value of each property in the portfolio by 
reference to relevant external market data relating to capital growth 
rates. We investigated further the valuations of those properties which 
were not in line with our initial expectations which included further 
discussions with management and the external valuers and, where 
appropriate, involvement of our Chartered Surveyors. 
•  We made enquiries of the external valuers and inspected their terms 
of reference to confirm that they had not been subject to undue 
influence or direction from management.
•  We utilised our detailed analytical procedures and work of the 
Chartered Surveyors described above in order to assess for evidence 
of undue management influence.
•  We performed site visits accompanied by our Chartered Surveyors for 
a sample of properties (focusing primarily on development properties) 
which enabled us to assess the stage of completion of, and gain 
specific insights into, these refurbishments/developments.
•  For development appraisals, we vouched the costs incurred to date, 
and agreed the cost to complete estimates to approved budgets and 
contractual arrangements.
Risk: Revenue recognition, including the 
timing of revenue recognition, and the 
treatment of rents and incentives
£103m of rents receivable (FY16: £98m)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (pages 
82 to 84); Accounting policies (page 119); 
and Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (page 121)
Market expectations and profit based targets 
may place pressure on management to distort 
revenue recognition. This may result in 
overstatement or deferral of revenues to 
assist in meeting current or future targets or 
expectations.
In order to distort rental income, 
management could manipulate the deferred 
revenue balance or the IFRS rent adjustment 
for lease incentives.
•  We performed detailed testing for a sample of leases by agreeing 
the annual rent back to the terms of the lease agreements.
•  For a sample of leases, we tested that the lease income, including 
the treatment of lease incentives, is on a straight-line basis, and in 
accordance with SIC-15 Operating Leases – Incentives.
•  We performed substantive analytical procedures and found that 
the revenue recognised by the Group and each of the operating 
companies was materially consistent with our expectations 
developed from rents in the tenancy schedules.
•  We assessed whether the revenue recognition policies adopted 
complied with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
•  We performed audit procedures specifically designed to address the 
risk of management override of controls including journal entry testing 
to confirm the processing and timing of journals to record revenue is 
consistent with our expectations.
We audited the timing of revenue 
recognition, treatment of rents 
and incentives, and assessed 
the risk of management override. 
Based upon the audit procedures 
performed, we conclude that 
revenue has been recognised 
on an appropriate basis in 
the year. 108
GOVERNANCE  INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
An Overview of the scope of our audit 
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity within the 
Group. T aken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation 
of the group, effectiveness of group-wide controls and changes in the business environment when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming 
our audit opinion. 
The table below sets out the materiality, performance materiality and threshold for reporting audit differences applied on our audit:
BASIS MATERIALITY PERFORMANCE  
MATERIALITY
AUDIT  
DIFFERENCES
Overall 1% of total assets £36.0m £27.0m £1.8m
Specific 
Applicable for account balances not related to investment 
properties, loans & borrowings and derivatives
5% of operating profit before 
investment property valuation 
movements and net finance costs
£3.7m £2.8m £0.2m
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the 
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a 
basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of 
uncorrected misstatements that we judged would be material for the 
financial statements as a whole. We determined that total assets would be 
the most appropriate basis for determining overall materiality given that key 
users of the Group’ s financial statements are primarily focussed on the 
valuation of the Group’ s assets; primarily the investment property portfolio. 
This provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk 
assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material 
misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit 
procedures. For planning purposes this was initially based on the total assets 
as at 30 September 2016. 
We assessed that for account balances not related to investment properties 
(either wholly owned or within the joint venture), loans & borrowings and 
derivatives, a misstatement of less than overall materiality for the financial 
statements could influence the economic decisions of users. We have 
determined that specific materiality for these areas should be based on 
operating profit before investment property valuation movements and net 
finance costs. We believe that it is appropriate to use a profit-based 
measure for specific materiality as profit is also a focus of users of the 
financial statements. 
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and, as the 
actual value of total assets increased from that which we had used as the 
initial basis for determining overall materiality (primarily due to the increase 
in property valuations from the annual revaluation), we increased our 
materiality threshold to £36.0m, as noted in the table above, which 
represents 1.0% of total assets of £3.6bn as at 30 September 2017.
In the prior year audit we adopted an overall materiality of £33.0m based on 
1% of total assets. We also applied a specific materiality of £3.9m based on 
5% of operating profit before investment property valuation movements 
and net finance costs.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. 
It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the 
Group’ s overall control environment, our judgement is that overall 
performance materiality and specific performance materiality (i.e. our 
tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance) for the 
Group should be 75% (2016: 50%) of the respective materiality. We have 
increased our set performance materiality from 50% to 75% in the current 
year due to few uncorrected adjustments being identified in the 2016 audit, 
and no weaknesses being identified in our walk-through testing of key 
control processes. Our objective in adopting this approach is to confirm that 
total detected and undetected audit differences do not exceed our 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being 
clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee any uncorrected audit differences on investment property 
valuations in excess of £1.8m, as well as uncorrected audit differences in 
excess of £0.2m that relate to our specific testing of the other account 
balances not related to investment properties, loans & borrowings and 
derivatives. These are set at 5% of their respective planning materiality. We 
also agreed to report differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative 
measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant 
qualitative considerations in forming our opinion. 109

Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report including the Strategic report Overview, Strategic report Annual 
Review, Governance and Other information (including Shareholder 
information, Portfolio analysis, Basis of valuation, Summary report by the 
valuers, Sustainability and the Glossary of terms) set out on pages 1 to 104 
and 139 to 147, other than the financial statements and our auditor’ s report 
thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is 
to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the 
other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are 
required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility 
to specifically address the following items in the other information and to 
report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information 
where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions:
•    Fair , balanced and understandable set out on page 104 – the statement 
given by the directors that they consider the annual report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’ s 
performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with 
our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
•    Audit Committee reporting set out on pages 82 to 84 – the section 
describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
•    Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code set out on page 74 – the parts of the directors’ statement required 
under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’ s compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by 
the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R (2) do not properly 
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
•  the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for 
the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements and those reports have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements;
•  the information about internal control and risk management systems in 
relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital 
structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 in the Disclosure 
Rules and Transparency Rules sourcebook made by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (the FCA Rules), is consistent with the financial statements and 
has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements; and
•  information about the Company’ s corporate governance code and 
practices and about its administrative, management and supervisory 
bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of 
the FCA Rules.
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company 
and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified material misstatements in:
• the strategic report or the directors’ report; or
•  the information about internal control and risk management systems in 
relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital 
structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the FCA Rules
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to 
which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
•  the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit
•  a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the Company 110
GOVERNANCE  INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
Responsibilities of directors 
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on 
page 104 the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view in 
accordance, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for 
assessing the Group and Company’ s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to 
liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’ s responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’ s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.  
Explanation as to what extent the audit 
was considered capable of detecting 
irregularities, including fraud
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are; to identify and assess 
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud; 
to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks 
of material misstatement due to fraud, through designing and implementing 
appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected 
fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the 
prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with 
governance of the entity and management. 
Our approach was as follows: 
•  We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that 
are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant 
frameworks which are directly relevant to specific assertions in the 
financial statements are those that relate to the reporting framework 
(IFRS, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code) and 
the relevant tax regulations in the United Kingdom, including the UK REIT 
regulations. 
•  We understood how the Company is complying with those frameworks 
through enquiry with management, and by identifying the Company’ s 
policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. 
We also identified those members of management who have the primary 
responsibility for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, and for 
reporting any known instances of non-compliance to those charged with 
governance. 
•  We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’ s financial statements to 
material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by reviewing the 
Company’ s risk register, enquiry with management and the Audit 
Committee during the planning and execution phases of our audit. 
•  Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify 
non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved 
the following:
 -  Inquire of members of senior management, and when appropriate, 
those charged with governance regarding their knowledge of any 
non-compliance or potential non-compliance with laws and regulations 
that could affect the financial statements.
 -  Reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance. 
 -  Obtaining and reading correspondence from legal and regulatory bodies 
including HRMC. 
This report is made solely to the Company’ s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’ s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’ s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we 
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’ s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.  
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’ s website at 
https:/ /www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part 
of our auditor’ s report.
Other matters we are required to 
address
•    We were appointed by the Company on 15 October 2015 to audit the 
financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2016 and 
subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 2 years, 
covering the years ending 30 September 2016 to 30 September 2017. Our 
audit engagement letter was refreshed on 30 October 2017.
•    The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’ s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group or the Company and we remain independent of the 
Group and the Company in conducting the audit.  
•    The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit 
Committee.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
Shaftesbury PLC (the Company) is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The 
address of the registered office is given on page 103. The Company is the ultimate parent company of the Shaftesbury PLC Group (the Group). The Company 
has not presented its own Statement of Comprehensive Income, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company made a profit of 
£57.7 million (2016: £282.9 million) in the year. 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and 
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared in Pounds Sterling and 
under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and derivative financial instruments. 
Going concern
The Group’ s business activities, together with the factors affecting performance, financial position and future development are set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 1 to 64. The financial position of the Group including cash flow, liquidity, borrowings, undrawn facilities and debt maturity analysis is set out 
on pages 54 to 57. The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 
months from the date these financial statements were approved. Therefore, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.
Critical judgements, assumptions and estimates
The Group’ s significant accounting policies are stated below. Not all of these significant accounting policies require the directors to make difficult, subjective 
or complex judgements or estimates. However, the directors consider the valuation of investment properties to be critical because of the level of 
complexity, judgement or estimation involved and its impact on the financial statements. These judgements involve assumptions or estimates in respect of 
future events. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Group’ s wholly-owned portfolio is valued by its external valuers, Cushman & Wakefield. Knight Frank LLP value the investment properties owned by the 
Longmartin joint venture. The valuations are used as the basis for the fair value of investment properties. 
The valuation of the Group’ s property portfolio is inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location and 
the expected future rental income. As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are 
made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility or low transaction flow in the commercial 
property market. Cushman & Wakefield and Knight Frank LLP make a number of assumptions in forming their opinion on the valuation of our investment 
properties, which are detailed in the Basis of Valuation on pages 142 to 143. These assumptions are in accordance with the RICS Valuation - Global 
Standards. However, if any assumptions made by the external valuers prove to be incorrect, this may mean that the value of the Group’ s properties differs 
from their valuation reported in the financial statements, which could have a material effect on the Group’ s financial position. See note 9 for further 
information.

b)  The following new Standards and amendments to existing Standards are relevant to the Group, are not yet effective in the year ended 30 September 
2017 and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’ s financial statements:
STANDARD OR INTERPRETATION EFFECTIVE FROM
Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of cash flows - disclosure initiative 1 January 2017
Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification of share-based payment transactions 1 January 2018
IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
This standard deals with, amongst other things, the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Having carried out an assessment of the 
standard, the Group believes the main impact will be the measurement and presentation of trade receivables in the Group financial statements, and 
balances due from subsidiaries in the Company financial statements. Having considered expected credit losses and sources of forward-looking data, we do 
not currently expect any impact will be material.
IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers
This standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control passes to a customer. In our case, the standard is most applicable to the 
recognition point for service charge income and disposals of investment properties. As the standard excludes rental income, which falls within the scope of 
IFRS 16 – Leases, it is not expected that IFRS 15 will have a significant impact on the Group’ s financial statements. There may be changes to presentation and 
disclosure.
IFRS 16 - Leases
For operating leases in excess of one year, this standard requires lessees to recognise a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability representing the 
obligation to make lease payments. The right-of-use asset is assessed for impairment annually and is amortised on a straight-line basis. The lease liability is 
amortised using the effective interest method. Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged from current accounting. Therefore, since the Group is 
primarily a lessor, this standard does not significantly impact the Group’ s financial statements. However, for the Company, it will result in the recognition of a 
right-to-use asset and corresponding lease liability, which we estimate at approximately £3 million, in the year when the standard becomes effective.
c)  There are no other Standards or Interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company is exposed to variable returns and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. The accounting policies of the 
subsidiaries are consistent with those adopted by the Group.
In the Company’ s Balance Sheet, investments in subsidiaries are included at cost less any provision in respect of impairment loss.
Net property income
Revenue comprises rents receivable from tenants under operating leases, recognised on an accruals basis, and recoverable expenses incurred on behalf of 
tenants, where the Group acts as principal. Rents are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Value added tax is excluded from all 
amounts. Income arising as a result of rent reviews is recognised when agreement of new terms is reasonably certain.
Premiums receivable from tenants to surrender their lease obligations are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The cost of any incentives given to lessees to enter into leases is spread on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable period of the lease, being the 
earlier of its expiry date or the date of the first break option. Lease incentives are usually in the form of rent-free periods. 
Irrecoverable property costs are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when they arise.
Employee benefits
Share-based remuneration
The cost of granting share options to employees is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income based on the fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of the net asset value (non-market based) vesting condition is calculated when the options are granted, using the modified binomial option 
pricing model. At the end of each reporting period, the directors review their estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on actual 
and forecast net asset values. The impact of any revision to original estimates is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity. 
The fair value of the total shareholder return (market based) vesting condition is calculated when the options are granted using the Monte Carlo simulation 
option pricing model, using various assumptions as set out in note 20. The fair value is charged on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. No 
adjustment is made to the original estimate for market based conditions after the date of grant, regardless of whether the options vest or not.
The amount charged in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is credited to the share-based payments reserve. Following the exercise of share options, 
the charges previously recognised in respect of those options are released from the share-based payments reserve to retained earnings. 
Pension contributions
Payments to defined contribution plans are charged as an expense to the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they fall due.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
1 Accounting policies continued
Investment properties
Investment properties are initially recognised on acquisition at cost, including related acquisition costs, and are revalued annually to reflect fair value. Fair 
value is determined either by external professional valuers or by the directors in the case of properties sold shortly after the period end. The fair value, as 
determined by the valuers, is reduced for any unamortised lease incentive balances.
Gains or losses arising on the revaluation of investment properties are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Depreciation is not provided in 
respect of investment properties.
Additions to properties include costs of a capital nature only. Expenditure is classified as capital when it results in future economic benefits which are 
expected to accrue to the Group. All other property expenditure is written-off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Premiums payable to tenants in connection with the surrender of their lease obligations are capitalised if they arise in connection with a value-enhancing 
project, otherwise they are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Amounts received by way of compensation for dilapidations from tenants vacating properties are credited against the cost of reinstatement works. Where 
the Group has no intention of carrying out such works, the amounts received are credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Purchases and sales of investment properties are recognised in the financial statements when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are 
transferred. 
All of the Group’ s leases to its tenants are operating leases except where the Group grants long leasehold interests to tenants, in which case, as substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the tenant, the property is not recognised as an investment property.
Acquisitions
Where properties are acquired through corporate acquisitions and there are no significant assets (other than investment property) and liabilities, and 
without a business being acquired, the acquisition is treated as an asset acquisition. In all other cases, the acquisition is treated as a business combination.
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are those entities over which the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. The Group has one joint venture, the 
investment in which is accounted for using the equity method. On initial recognition the investment was recognised at cost. Subsequently, the carrying 
amount is increased or decreased to recognise the Group’ s share of the profit or loss of, and dividends from, the joint venture. The Group’ s investment in 
the joint venture is presented separately on the Balance Sheet and the Group’ s share of the joint venture’ s post-tax profit or loss for the year is also 
presented separately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where there is an indication that the Group’ s investment in its joint venture may be impaired, the Group evaluates the recoverable amount of its 
investment, being the higher of the joint venture’ s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value an 
impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
If the Group’ s share of losses in the joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless 
it has legal or constructive obligations to make payments on behalf of the joint venture.
In the Company’ s Balance Sheet, the investment in its joint venture is stated at cost less any provision for impairment loss. 
Trade receivables and payables 
Trade receivables and trade payables are recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment in respect of 
trade receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on-demand bank deposits. 
Cash held on deposit which has certain conditions restricting its use and is not available on demand, liquid or readily convertible, is classified within other 
receivables.
Borrowings and costs of raising finance
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and are subsequently held at amortised cost. Issue costs and premiums are 
written-off to the Statement of Comprehensive Income using an effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments, comprising interest rate swaps for hedging purposes, are measured at fair value. Movements in fair value are recognised in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Segmental information
The Group’ s properties, which are all located in London’ s West End, are managed as a single portfolio. Its properties, which are of a similar type, are 
combined into villages. All of the villages are geographically close to each other and have similar economic features and risks. In view of the similar 
characteristics and the reporting of all investment, income and expenditure to the Board at an overall Group level, the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8 
have been applied to give one reportable segment.
The Board assesses the performance of the reportable segment based on net property income and investment property valuation. Financial information 
provided to the Board is prepared on a basis consistent with these financial statements. 121

Investment properties were valued at 30 September 2017 by qualified professional valuers, being members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors 
(RICS), working for Cushman & Wakefield, Chartered Surveyors, acting in the capacity of external valuers. 
All properties were valued on the basis of fair value and highest and best use, in accordance with the RICS Valuation - Global Standards, which incorporate, 
the International Valuation Standards and the RICS UK Valuation Standards edition current at the valuation date and IFRS 13. When considering a property’ s 
highest and best use, the valuer considers its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable. Where the highest and best use 
differs from the existing use, the valuer considers the use a market participant would have in mind when formulating the price it would bid and reflects the 
cost and likelihood of achieving that use.
The fair value of the Group’ s investment properties has primarily been determined using a market approach, which provides an indication of value by 
comparing the subject asset with similar assets for which price information is available. The external valuer uses information provided by the Group, such as 
tenancy information and capital expenditure expectations. In deriving fair value, the valuer also makes a series of assumptions, using professional judgement 
and market observations. These assumptions include equivalent yields and rental values (ERVs) applicable to the properties. Equivalent yields are based on 
current market prices, depending on, inter alia, the location and use of the properties. ERVs are calculated using a number of factors which include current 
rental income, market comparatives and occupancy levels. Whilst there is market evidence for these inputs, and recent transaction prices for similar 
properties, there is still a significant element of estimation and judgement. As a result of adjustments made to market observable data, these significant 
inputs are deemed unobservable.
Since the key inputs to the valuation are unobservable, the Group considers all its investment properties fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in IFRS 
13. The Group’ s policy is to recognise transfers between hierarchy levels as at the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. 
There have been no transfers during the year (2016: none).
The key assumptions made by the valuers are set out in the Basis of Valuation on pages 142 to 143. 
The major inputs to the external valuation are reviewed by the senior management team. In addition, the valuer meets with external auditors and the Audit 
Committee. Further details of the Audit Committee’ s responsibilities in relation to valuations can be found in the Audit Committee Report on pages 82 to 
84.
A summary of the Cushman & Wakefield report can be found on pages 144 to 145.
Fees were agreed at fixed amounts in advance of the valuations being carried out. It is noted that Cushman & Wakefield acted as letting agents for 
Shaftesbury Carnaby PLC, Shaftesbury Soho Limited and Shaftesbury Chinatown PLC in the year. The fees payable by the Group to Cushman & Wakefield do 
not constitute a significant part of their fee income.  124

Sensitivity analysis
As noted in the critical judgements, assumptions and estimates section on page 118, the valuation of the Group’ s property portfolio is inherently subjective. 
As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which 
may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility or low transaction flow in the commercial property market.
The Group’ s properties are all located in London’ s West End and are virtually all multi-use buildings, usually configured with commercial uses on the lower 
floors and office and/or residential uses on the upper floors. Cushman & Wakefield value properties in their entirety and not by use, consequently the 
sensitivity analysis below has been performed on the Group’ s portfolio as a whole.

These key unobservable inputs are inter-dependent. All other factors being equal, a higher equivalent yield would lead to a decrease in the valuation of a 
property, and an increase in the ERV would increase the capital value, and vice versa.

Amounts due from/to subsidiaries have been restated at 30 September 2016 to present these balances on a gross basis. This has no impact on the net

Other financial instruments
The Group’ s mortgage bonds and secured term loans are held at amortised cost in the Balance Sheet. The fair value of these financial instruments is in 
excess of book value. This excess, which is not recognised in the reported results for the year, is £16.2 million (2016: £52.5 million). The fair values have been 
calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using the relevant reference gilt and appropriate market spread. The valuation technique falls within 
Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy in IFRS 13.
The fair values of the Group’ s and Company’ s cash and cash equivalents, and those financial instruments included within trade and other receivables, 
interest bearing borrowings (excluding the mortgage bonds and the secured term loans), and trade and other payables are not materially different from the 
values at which they are carried in the financial statements.  131

Management of financial risks (Group and Company)
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on their contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group reviews the creditworthiness of potential tenants prior to entering into contractual arrangements. Where appropriate, tenants are required to 
provide cash deposits to mitigate the potential loss in the event of default. Deposits held are referred to in note 13. The Group has a large and diverse 
tenant base so that tenant credit risk is widely spread.
Provision is made in full where recovery of financial assets is, in the opinion of the directors, uncertain. The carrying amount of financial assets, net of 
provisions for impairment, represents the Group’ s maximum exposure to credit risk. Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired are expected to 
be fully recoverable.
Where cash deposits are held, they are placed with one of the Group’ s existing facility providers.
Liquidity risk
The Board keeps under review the Group’ s funding requirements, available facilities and covenant compliance to ensure it has sufficient funds available to 
meet its existing commitments and to extend its portfolio through investment and acquisition of additional properties. The Group’ s policies regarding 
finance and its current financial position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 56 to 57. 
Market risk
Market risk arises from the Group’ s use of interest bearing financial instruments, and is the risk that future cash flows from financial instruments will 
fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and credit costs. The Group’ s policy is to minimise market risk through long-term fixed rate debt. The Board keeps 
under review the Group’ s market risk, particularly in light of expectations of future interest rate movements. 
Interest rate risk
At 30 September 2017, the Group’ s drawn borrowings consisted entirely of fixed rate debt. Given this, the Group’ s exposure to changes in long-term interest 
rates and the potential impact on the Group’ s results and equity is considered to be insignificant. This does not take into account valuation movements on 
the Group’ s investment properties as a result of movements in long-term interest rates, which would be reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income.
Capital risk management
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity and net borrowings, including cash held on deposit. The type and maturity of the Group’ s borrowings is 
set out in note 16 and the Group’ s equity structure is set out in the Statement of Changes in Equity. The Group regularly reviews its loan covenant 
compliance.
The Group’ s capital management objectives are to continue as a going concern and to provide enhanced shareholder returns whilst maintaining an 
appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles. The Group’ s capital structure such as levels of gearing and 
loan-to-value ratio are discussed in the Strategic Report on pages 56 to 57.

The Statement of Changes in Equity is set out on page 117.
The following describes the nature and purpose of each of the reserves within equity.
RESERVE DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE
Share premium Share premium is the amount by which the fair value of the consideration received for ordinary shares exceeds 
the nominal value of shares issued, net of expenses.
Share-based payments reserve The equity-settled remuneration expense charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income is credited to 
the share-based payments reserve. Upon exercise of options, the expense previously recognised is transferred 
to retained earnings.
Retained earnings Cumulative gains and losses recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Transfers from the  
share-based payments reserve are also credited to this account.
The Company’ s retained earnings at 30 September 2017 include amounts distributable of £218.0 million (2016 as restated: £316.5 million). The prior year 
figure has been restated to reflect realised losses on cancelled interest rate swap contracts prior to 30 September 2016. 133

plus the cost of commitment fees on undrawn bank facilities of 0.69% (2016: 0.70%). At 30 September 2017, the undrawn bank facilities totalled £275.0 
million (2016: £59.3 million). For total debt, the blended cost of debt is 3.26% (2016: 4.52%) and includes the impact of our share of debt in our joint 
venture of £60 million (2016: £60 million), upon which interest is charged at 4.43% (2016: 4.43%).

As disclosed in note 1 to the financial statements, all of the Group’ s properties are in one geographic location and are managed as a single portfolio. As such, we do 
not report on a segmental basis. Like-for-like calculations of growth in values and rents are therefore stated on an aggregated basis.

Note: We do not capitalise property nor administrative expenses. The figures above include vacancy costs. Given the nature of our portfolio, it is impractical to separate these out. 
Investment properties
Whilst our portfolio is geographically concentrated in London’ s West End, it is granular in nature, with almost 600, generally small, buildings, often clustered 
in contiguous blocks. It is not practical to provide detailed property-by-property information recommended by EPRA’ s BPR. However, an analysis of our 
portfolio, split by destination and occupier use, is set out on pages 142 to 143. 
We own 100% of our properties, except for property held by our Longmartin joint venture, in which we have a 50% interest. The breakdown of our 
wholly-owned portfolio between freehold and long leasehold ownership is set out on page 123.
At 30 September 2017, we had 772 commercial and 516 residential tenants, with no individual tenant representing a material amount of our current 
annualised income. The ten largest commercial tenants represented just 10.5% of current annualised income. As our tenant base is so granular, we do not 
believe listing the top ten tenants, nor a detailed analysis of tenant business sector is useful. However, the analysis on pages 142 to 143 sets out details of 
income and rental values by destination and occupier use.
EPRA vacancy by occupier use is set out on pages 40 to 41.
Development disclosures
Our wholly-owned portfolio is all within Conservation Areas and around 20% of our buildings are listed. We do not carry out material speculative developments. 
Our capital expenditure commitments are low, representing an average of 1.1% of portfolio value over the past five years. Included in this are numerous 
small schemes, and no one scheme is material. 
At 30 September 2017, we had one larger scheme underway, details of which are set out on page 49. An overview of assets held for, or undergoing, 
refurbishment is set out on pages 48 to 49. 142

Notes
1.  The fair values at 30 September 2017 (the “valuation date”) shown in 
respect of the individual villages are, in each case, the aggregate of 
the fair values of several different property interests located within 
close proximity which, for the purpose of this analysis, are combined 
to create each village. The different interests within each village were 
not valued as a single lot.
2.  Current income includes total annualised actual and ‘estimated 
income’ reserved by leases. No rent is attributed to leases which 
were subject to rent-free periods at the valuation date. Current 
income does not reflect any ground rents, head rents nor rent 
charges and estimated irrecoverable outgoings at the valuation date. 
‘Estimated income’ refers to gross estimated rental values in respect 
of rent reviews outstanding at the valuation date and, where 
appropriate, ERV in respect of lease renewals outstanding at the 
valuation date where the fair value reflects terms for a renewed lease.
3.  ERV is the respective valuers’ opinion of the rental value of the 
properties, or parts thereof, reflecting the terms of the relevant 
leases or, if appropriate, reflecting the fact that certain of the 
properties, or parts thereof, have been valued on the basis of vacant 
possession and the assumed grant of a new lease. Where appropriate, 
ERV assumes completion of developments which are reflected in the 
valuations. ERV does not reflect any ground rents, head rents nor rent 
charges and estimated irrecoverable outgoings. 
4.  The percentage of current income and the percentage of ERV in each 
of the use sectors are expressed as a percentage of total income and 
total ERV for each village.
5.  Average unexpired lease length has been calculated by weighting the 
leases in terms of current rent reserved under the relevant leases 
and, where relevant, by reference to tenants’ options to determine 
leases in advance of expiry through effluxion of time.
6.  Where mixed uses occur within single leases, for the purpose of this 
analysis, the majority use by rental value has been adopted.
7.  The initial yield is the net initial income at the valuation date 
expressed as a percentage of the gross valuation. Yields reflect net 
income after deduction of any ground rents, head rents and rent 
charges and estimated irrecoverable outgoings at the valuation date.
8.  The topped-up initial yield, ignoring contractual rent-free periods, 
has been calculated as if the contracted rent is payable from the 
valuation date and as if any future stepped rental uplifts under leases 
had occurred.
9.  Equivalent yield is the internal rate of return, being the discount rate 
which needs to be applied to the expected flow of income so that the 
total amount of income so discounted at this rate equals the capital 
outlay at values current as of the valuation date. The equivalent yield 
shown for each village has been calculated by merging together the 
cash flows and fair values of each of the different interests within 
each village and represents the average equivalent yield attributable 
to each village from this approach.
10.  The tone of rental values and yields is the range of rental values or 
yields attributed to the majority of the properties.
11.  All commercial floor areas are net lettable. All residential floor areas 
are gross internal. 
12.  For presentation purposes some percentages have been rounded to 
the nearest integer.
13.  The analysis includes accommodation which is awaiting, or 
undergoing, refurbishment or development and is not available for 
occupation at the date of valuation. 
14.  The analysis excludes a non-core asset, acquired as part of a portfolio 
during the year. 144
STRATEGIC REPORT  OTHER INFORMATION  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
Summary report
by the valuers
T o the directors of Shaftesbury PLC 
In accordance with your instructions, we have undertaken a valuation of the 
various commercial and residential freehold and long leasehold property 
interests as at 30th September 2017 (the “Valuation Date”) held by Shaftesbury 
Carnaby PLC, Shaftesbury Covent Garden Limited, Shaftesbury Chinatown 
PLC, Shaftesbury Soho Limited, Shaftesbury AV Limited, Shaftesbury CL 
Limited, Shaftesbury West End Limited and Helcon Limited, which are 
subsidiary companies (collectively referred to as the “Subsidiary Companies”) 
of Shaftesbury PLC (the “Company”), as referred to in our Valuation Reports 
dated 24 November 2017 (“our Reports”). Our Reports were prepared for 
accounts purposes.
All properties have been subject to external inspections between January 
and October 2017 and a number were subject to internal inspections.
We confirm that the valuations and Reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the RICS Valuation – Global Standards which incorporate 
the International Valuation Standards (“IVS”) and the RICS UK Valuation 
Standards (the “RICS Red Book”) edition current at the Valuation Date. It 
follows that the valuations are compliant with IVS. We confirm that all valuers 
who have contributed to the valuation have complied with the requirements 
of PS 1 of the RICS Red Book. We confirm that we have sufficient current 
knowledge of the relevant markets, and the skills and understanding to undertake 
the valuation competently. We confirm that Charles Smith has overall 
responsibility for the valuations and is in a position to provide an objective 
and unbiased valuation and is competent to undertake the valuations. 
Finally, we confirm that we have undertaken the valuations acting as an 
External Valuer as defined in the RICS Red Book.
In accordance with PS 2.5 and UKVS 4, we are required to make certain 
disclosures in connection with this valuation instruction and our relationship 
with the Company and the Subsidiary Companies. Charles Smith has been 
the signatory of valuation reports addressed to the Company and the 
Subsidiary Companies since 2013. Cushman & Wakefield Debenham Tie 
Leung Limited (“C&W”) has been carrying out this valuation instruction for 
the Company, and now the Subsidiary Companies, for a continuous period 
since 1996. As well as preparing our Reports, we also undertake valuations  
of certain of the properties referred to in our Reports for other purposes, 
such as secured lending and for inclusion in shareholders’ circulars. 
On 1st September 2015, DTZ acquired Cushman & Wakefield and the 
combined group now trades under the Cushman & Wakefield brand. 
Cushman & Wakefield’ s financial year end is 31st December. The proportion 
of fees payable by the Company to the Cushman & Wakefield group in the 
financial year to 31st December 2016 was less than 5%. We anticipate that 
the proportion of fees payable by the Company to the Cushman & Wakefield 
group in the financial year to 31st December 2017 will remain at less than 5%.
Prior to 1st September 2015, there had been no fee-earning instructions 
between DTZ and the Company or the Subsidiary Companies, other than 
valuation instructions, for in excess of four years. Prior to 1st September 
2015, Cushman & Wakefield were appointed, until recently, as retail agents 
by Shaftesbury Soho Limited and Shaftesbury Carnaby PLC. C&W are 
currently appointed as retail agents on behalf of Shaftesbury Chinatown PLC 
in respect of the property known as Central Cross.
In accordance with the provisions of VPS3 of the RICS Red Book edition 
current at the Valuation Date, in undertaking our valuations we have lotted 
together certain individual properties to form a separate property (each 
referred to as a “Property”, collectively as the “Properties”) in the manner 
we consider to be most likely to be adopted in the case of an actual sale.  
We consider that lotting the properties together on the basis reflected in 
our valuations would allow a purchaser to capitalise on the estate management 
advantages and opportunities available from such comprehensive ownership.
A high proportion of the total value of the Subsidiary Companies’ properties 
and Properties is accounted for by properties and Properties situated in 
adjacent and/or adjoining locations in four specific areas of the West End of 
London: Carnaby Street and its environs, Chinatown and the adjoining area 
immediately west of Wardour Street (south of its junction with Shaftesbury 
Avenue), and the areas around Seven Dials in the western part of Covent 
Garden and a block of properties to the east of the Central Covent Garden 
Piazza with its main frontage to Wellington Street. These areas are all 
dominated by retail and restaurant uses. In our opinion, at the Valuation 
Date, this particular unusual confluence of ownership and use characteristics 
may cause some prospective purchasers to regard parts of the portfolio 
when combined as having a greater value than the aggregate of the individual 
values of the combined properties and Properties which make up those parts.
As required by the provisions of the RICS Red Book, in undertaking our 
valuations, we have valued each property or Property separately, rather 
than valuing the portfolio as a whole or in combinations of parts. The “total” 
valuation figure below is the aggregated value of the separate properties or 
Properties within the various categories of tenure referred to below.
All valuations were on the basis of Fair Value. We have assessed Fair Value in 
accordance with VPS4 item 7 of the RICS Red Book. Under these provisions, 
the term “Fair Value” means the definition adopted by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) in IFRS 13, namely “The price that 
would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date”.
Under IFRS 13, The Fair Value Hierarchy, the property we have valued is 
designated as Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs have been designated as 
unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to 
the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing 
for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or 
liability at the measurement date. An entity develops unobservable inputs 
using the best information available in the circumstances, which might 
include the entity’ s own data, taking into account all information about 
market participant assumptions that is reasonably available (IFRS 13:87-89).
Summary report 
by the valuers 145
STRATEGIC REPORT  OTHER INFORMATION  SUMMARY REPORT BY THE vALUERS  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
Our opinion of the Fair Value of each of the properties has been primarily 
derived using comparable recent market transactions on arm’ s length terms.  
We have not made any allowance for vendor’ s sale costs nor for any tax 
liabilities which may arise upon the disposal of any of the properties or 
Properties. We have made deductions to reflect purchasers’ normal 
acquisition costs.
A full explanation of the Assumptions made in our valuations and details of 
the sources of information are contained within our Reports.
We have measured certain of the properties, or parts of properties, either 
on site or by scaling from floor plans. The Company, its managing agents or 
professional advisors have provided us with the floor areas of the remaining 
properties or parts of properties.
We have read some of the leases and related documents provided to us in 
respect of the commercial properties. Where we have not read leases, we 
have relied on tenancy information provided by the Company, its managing 
agents or professional advisors.
Certain properties were subject to works of repair or refurbishment at 30th 
September 2017, or were subject to outstanding retentions and fees in 
respect of projects already completed at that date. In these instances, the 
Company advised us of the amount of the outstanding costs. The costs will 
be borne by the Company as they are not recoverable from tenants. We 
have reflected these costs in our valuations. The total amount of such costs 
is £11,494,050 and details of the individual sums are included in our Reports.
As referred to above, we have lotted together certain individual properties 
to form a number of separate Properties. In the case of five Properties 
which comprise a number of individual properties, the majority of such 
properties are held freehold but certain of them are held on long leases. In 
order to divide our valuation of these Properties between the categories of 
freehold and long leasehold, we have undertaken notional apportionments 
of value between the freehold elements and the long leasehold elements 
which together comprise the relevant Properties. The amounts arising from 
these notional apportionments of value have been included in the figures 
representing the freehold and long leasehold categories below. The 
amounts arising from the notional apportionments do not themselves 
represent the Fair Value of the two elements.
The Subsidiary Companies own a number of properties on a freehold basis 
where they also hold long leasehold interests within the freehold and have 
not merged the interests. For the purposes of the freehold/long leasehold 
split below, we have included such properties within the freehold category.
Having regard to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the aggregates of 
the Fair Values, as at 30th September 2017, of the freehold and long 
leasehold property interests owned by the Company and the Subsidiary 
Companies, subject to the Assumptions and comments in our Reports 
dated 24 November 2017, were as follows: 
Freehold Properties £3,133,015,000 
(Three billion, one hundred and thirty-three 
million and fifteen thousand pounds) 
Long leasehold  
Properties
£285,925,000 
(Two hundred and eighty-five million, nine  
hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds)
Total £3,418,940,000 
(Three billion, four hundred and eighteen 
million, nine hundred and forty thousand 
pounds)
A long lease is one with an unexpired term in excess of 50 years.

for the specific purpose to which they refer and are for their use only.

As a REIT, we do not pay UK corporation tax in respect of rental profits and 
chargeable gains relating to our property rental business. However, we are 
required to distribute at least 90% of the qualifying income (broadly 
calculated using the UK tax rules) as a PID.
Certain categories of shareholder may be able to receive the PID element of 
their dividends gross, without deduction of withholding tax. Categories 
which may claim this exemption include: UK companies, charities, local 
authorities, UK pension schemes and managers of PEPs, ISAs and Child Trust 
Funds.
Further information and the forms for completion to apply for PIDs to be 
paid gross are available on the Group’ s website or from the registrar. 
Where the Group pays an ordinary dividend this will be treated in the same 
way as dividends from non-REIT companies. The 2017 final dividend is being 
paid entirely as an ordinary dividend.
