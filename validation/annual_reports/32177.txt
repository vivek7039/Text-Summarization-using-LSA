03 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017
The Group delivered another robust 
performance in FY2017 . The sale of Debt 
Management, completed in March 2017 , 
has simpliﬁed and focused the Group 
on its two principal businesses, both 
of which performed well. Private Equity 
delivered very strong returns, driven 
by signiﬁcant portfolio earnings growth. 
Infrastructure continues to execute its 
updated strategy effectively, generating 
good returns with a strong pipeline of 
new business.
Market environment
FY2017 was dominated by unexpected 
political events, including the UK’s decision 
to leave the EU and the result of the US 
presidential election. These events created 
volatile conditions, but with supportive 
debt markets and high volumes of 
capital still seeking attractive investment 
opportunities in both Private Equity 
and Infrastructure, the market environment  
remains intensely competitive. Under these 
conditions, our permanent capital base, 
strong balance sheet and long-established 
business networks in our target sectors 
and geographies represent a distinct 
competitive advantage. They enable the 
Group to be agile and opportunistic while 
remaining focused on investment discipline 
and effective asset management.
Performance and dividend
The Group’s total return increased by 
93% to £1,592 million (2016: £824 million). 
Net asset value increased to 604 pence 
per share (31 March 2016: 463 pence) and 
our return on opening shareholders’ funds 
was 36% (2016: 22%). A strong market 
for realisations meant that we were, as 
anticipated, net divestors during FY2017 . 
We repaid our €331 million bond in March 
2017 and ended the year with a net cash 
balance of £419 million and liquidity of 
£1,323 million (31 March 2016: net cash of 
£165 million and liquidity of £1,352 million).
In recognition of the strong level of cash 
realisations (including the proceeds 
from the sale of our Debt Management 
business) and taking into account the 
strength of the investment pipeline, the 
Board has recommended a ﬁnal dividend 
of 18.5 pence per share (2016: 16 pence 
per share) for FY2017 . This is made up 
of the balance of the base dividend 
(8 pence per share, after the 8 pence 
interim dividend paid in January 2017) 
and an additional ﬁnal dividend of 10.5 
pence per share. The total dividend for 
the year of 26.5 pence per share reﬂects 
the Board’s continuing conﬁdence in 
the Group’s future prospects and cash 
generation capability.
Board changes
I am pleased to welcome Stephen Daintith, 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer of Rolls-Royce 
Holdings, who joined the Board on 
1 October 2016. Stephen brings ﬁnancial, 
operating and international experience 
across a range of relevant sectors, 
including consumer and digital, and has 
already made a strong contribution to the 
Board and its committees.
Martine Verluyten has decided not to 
seek re-election at the Annual General 
Meeting on 29 June 2017 . I would like to 
thank Martine for her valuable contribution 
since 2012 during a period of signiﬁcant 
transformation for the Group.
Outlook
We enter FY2018 with a capable and 
experienced team of investors, a strong 
balance sheet, a high performing 
portfolio of assets, a good pipeline 
of new investment opportunities and 
a broadened platform in Infrastructure 
with good growth prospects. I am 
conﬁdent that the Group will remain 
opportunistic but disciplined as we 
navigate what promises to be another 
year of signiﬁcant uncertainty.
Simon Thompson
Chairman
Chairman’s  
statement
 Our clear strategy and focus on 
investment discipline and effective asset 
management delivered strong returns 
in FY2017 .  Overview
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 04
Chief Executive’s  
review
We continued to make very strong 
progress at 3i in FY2017 . Our ﬁnancial 
results were excellent and underpinned 
by strong fundamentals. 
Our Private Equity investment portfolio 
has undergone a major transformation 
over the last ﬁve years as we have sold 
many of the weaker, legacy assets and 
made new investments in good quality 
companies at attractive prices.
Our Infrastructure team has also been 
busy and assembled a sizeable economic 
infrastructure portfolio for 3i Infrastructure 
plc (“3iN”), as well as pursuing a number 
of new initiatives to broaden our 
investment capability.
We sold our Debt Management business 
for £270 million during the year, as we were 
not conﬁdent that this business would 
meet our return requirements and justify 
its relative complexity in a more onerous 
regulatory environment in the future.
A measure of the success of these changes 
can be seen in this year’s ﬁnancial results;  
3i generated a total return on shareholders’ 
funds of £1,592 million, or 36% (2016: £824 
million, or 22%), ending the year with a 
NAV per share of 604 pence (31 March 
2016: 463 pence). Our results include the 
beneﬁt of currency movements; 71% of 
the Group’s assets are denominated in 
euros or US dollars and we generated a 
£297 million gain (2016: £143 million gain) 
from the weakness of sterling in the year. 
Cash realisations, including the proceeds 
from the sale of Debt Management, were 
strong at £1,308 million and we saw a good 
step forward in cash investment to £638 
million. We ﬁnished the year with net cash 
of £419 million (31 March 2016: £165 million) 
and have announced a further good lift in 
the pay out to shareholders.
A high quality Private Equity 
investment portfolio
Our plan with new Private Equity 
investments is simple, but the execution 
is not and requires diligence, discipline 
and good judgement. We aim to double 
the earnings of new investments under 
our ownership through operational 
improvements, international growth and 
careful M&A strategies. This year, 93% 
of our portfolio companies by value grew 
their earnings (2016: 84%).
Action was the strongest performer 
again; it is a very special company and a 
low price, consumer champion. As a fast 
growth, disruptive retailer, Action has been 
transformed by the successful execution 
of its international expansion strategy. 
Store openings increased from 52 in 2012 
to 197 in 2016 and Action now has more 
than 890 stores and annual sales in excess 
of €2.6 billion. The compound annual 
growth rates for sales and EBITDA since 
2012 exceed 30%, like for like growth rates 
are 6%–7% per annum and cash ﬂow is 
strong. This sector-leading performance 
under our ownership has already resulted 
in cash distributions to 3i equivalent to  
4.9x our original investment.
There is still plenty of runway for expansion 
at Action and potential for further rapid 
value growth for 3i. Action has been 
welcomed in each country it has opened 
in and its store opening programme 
now covers six countries and more new 
stores are planned in 2017 over 2016. 
Action is also set to open its fourth 
and ﬁfth distribution centres in 2017 . 
Such material growth requires strong 
operational capability and Action, with 
support from 3i, is focused on managing 
the risks associated with this rapid 
growth by enhancing its teams and other 
resources in logistics, direct sourcing, 
IT and inventory control to meet the 
increasing demands of the business.
But 3i is not just about Action. The  
portfolio we have constructed in recent 
years, our 2013–16 vintage, produced a 
gross investment return of 29% in FY2017 , 
and is already a top quartile performer, 
valued on a multiple of 1.7x (31 March 
2016: 1.5x).
 
FY2017 was another important year 
for 3i. Our Private Equity and Infrastructure 
businesses performed well and we simpliﬁed 
the Group by selling our Debt Management 
platform. Our efforts over the last few years 
in reshaping the portfolio mean we are now 
able to focus on active asset management 
and origination.  Overview Private Equity Infrastructure

The performance of Scandlines has 
accelerated since our further investment 
in 2013. We expect further delays to the 
competing Rødby Puttgarten tunnel 
project, while the business continues to 
generate good levels of cash ﬂow and 
earnings growth. 
A fundamental part of our investment 
strategy is to facilitate the international 
expansion of our portfolio companies. 
Since our investment in 2013, ATESTEO, 
the world’s leading drivetrain testing 
services provider to the automotive 
industry, has increased the utilisation  
of its testing facilities in Germany and 
expanded its Chinese footprint. As a result, 
its Chinese capacity has doubled and 
sales have increased by more than 100%. 
The outlook looks promising, with further 
expansion in China and North America 
in progress.
Aspen Pumps, Audley Travel, Basic-Fit,  
Q Holding and Euro-Diesel also performed 
well, with strong, organic earnings growth. 
However, it is inevitable that there will 
be some challenges in any broad-based 
Private Equity portfolio and our high 
street retailer, Christ, suffered from 
declining footfall.
As mentioned earlier, we have refocused 
our model and have largely exited the 
older and often minority investments that 
we invested in before the strategic review 
in 2012. Many of these assets have required 
a great deal of asset management. Some, 
but not all, have been a signiﬁcant drag on 
the value growth of our portfolio over the 
last few years.
In August 2016, we became aware 
of accounting irregularities at Agent 
Provocateur which had concealed its true 
ﬁnancial position and lack of liquidity. 
We wrote down the investment to nil 
and the business was subsequently sold 
through an administration process, with 
the proceeds being insufﬁcient to return 
any value to 3i, resulting in a total write-
down in the year of £49 million.
In total, our Private Equity realisation 
activity produced approximately 
£1 billion of cash proceeds this 
year (2016: £718 million) at good 
return multiples and we now own 
a leaner, higher-performing portfolio 
of 37 assets and three quoted stakes 
(2016: 47 assets and ﬁve quoted stakes).
Our permanent capital is a distinct 
competitive advantage. It ensures we 
can be ﬂexible and opportunistic and it is 
a fundamental aspect of our differentiated 
strategy. It enables us to hold assets for 
longer periods if we believe that there 
is potential for additional value creation. 
This is particularly important in an 
economic environment where there are 
limited opportunities for attractive new 
investment at sensible prices.
We are well established in continental 
Europe and were the ﬁrst private equity 
ﬁrm to set up a number of ofﬁces across 
Europe. Our brand and local investment 
teams are held in high regard in these 
markets and we enjoy good visibility 
over the deal ﬂow in our chosen sectors. 
As the requirements of managing the 
older assets have diminished, we have 
been able to source and complete more 
new investment opportunities. 
We completed new investments in 
BoConcept, Schlemmer and Ponroy 
Santé together with a further investment 
in Q Holding to support its acquisition of 
Degania in FY2017 . A German investment, 
Lampenwelt, and a Dutch investment, 
Hans Anders, were announced in March 
2017 and April 2017 respectively and 
should complete by the end of June 2017 . 
We also announced an investment in 
Formel D in May 2017 .
A year of exceptional 
investment activity 
in Infrastructure
Our Infrastructure business has 
achieved good growth since 3iN’s 
change of strategy and update to its 
return target, announced in May 2015. 
Although the infrastructure market is 
very competitive, particularly for larger 
economic infrastructure assets, 3iN’s 
revised investment strategy enabled the 
business to compete with conﬁdence for 
assets that ﬁtted its current mid-market 
remit. We advised 3iN on £479 million 
of new investments in total in the year 
and have recruited selectively to ensure 
that we have the strength and depth to 
manage the investment portfolio, as well 
as boost origination.
To support this expansion, we maintained 
our 34% share of 3iN in its June 2016 
capital raise, the proceeds of which have 
since been fully invested. The 3iN shares 
have performed strongly, generating 
a total shareholder return of 16% in the 
year (2016: 13%). Overview
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 06
Chief Executive’s  
review
continued
Over the last year, we have been working 
on a number of new fund platforms, one 
in North America and two in Europe, to 
broaden our capabilities and deal ﬂow and 
complement our mandate as investment 
adviser to 3iN.
In Europe, we announced the launch of 
a new £700 million fund, managed by 3i, 
to purchase a portfolio of assets from the 
EISER Global Infrastructure fund. Post year 
end, 3i invested £35 million in this fund, 
alongside two pension fund investors. 
Our Infrastructure business manages two 
funds dedicated to operational PPP and 
renewables projects, one of which was 
coming to the end of its investment life. 
In April 2017 , we seeded a new fund with 
substantially all of its remaining assets. 
3i has committed up to €40 million to 
this fund alongside a group of external 
investors and we expect a ﬁnal close 
later on in the year. We launched our 
North American Infrastructure business 
in March 2017 as a natural and key 
strategic extension of 3i’s established 
European platform. 
Continuing to focus  
on driving performance
Following our successful disposal of Debt 
Management we have a more streamlined 
investment capability, focused on Private 
Equity and Infrastructure, and built on 
our proprietary capital foundation, with 
a growing fund management capability 
in Infrastructure. The broader macro-
economic back-drop has improved over 
the last year and we see generally decent 
GDP growth ahead in our main markets  
of northern Europe and North America.
However, the market for new investment 
remains challenging. High asset valuations, 
together with intense competition from 
corporate buyers and other private 
equity investors, mean that maintaining 
our selective and disciplined approach is 
essential in order to continue to generate 
attractive returns.
Outlook
3i is now performing as it should, with 
careful investment and active asset 
management generating very strong 
returns. The broader environment 
remains volatile and challenging but we 
remain conﬁdent in our ability to deliver 
continued, good growth for shareholders. 
We have strong investment capabilities in 
both our divisions and our well-established 
international network, together with 
our proprietorial approach, give us real 
competitive advantage.
We will avoid complacency and maintain 
our disciplined approach to investment 
and the costs of our platform, as well 
as maintaining our focus on the mid 
market where we see the most attractive 
opportunities. This approach should 
underpin high returns for shareholders, 
together with healthy cash dividends.
I would like to thank the 3i team for their 
hard work and contribution to what has 
been an excellent year for the Group.  
3i is now a much more balanced and 
resilient business, with a clear strategy 
and a well-funded balance sheet.

Action
Action is Europe’s fastest growing  
non-food retailer with more than 890 
stores in six countries. It offers over  
6,000 different items, with more than 
150 new products a week and its 
range includes an increasing number 
of A-brands and own-label products.
Action offers its customers more than 
they expect, for less than they imagine. 
The combination of a wide and ever-
changing range of products at the lowest 
possible prices, as well as friendly and 
motivated staff, is what makes Action 
a unique retail formula. More than half 
of the people that shop at Action arrive 
home with more products than they 
initially planned to buy.
Action’s model is successful because 
it is simple. There is a single formula for 
all of its stores, regardless of location. 
Its product range consists of 13 
categories, with products sourced from 
over 400 suppliers, offered at low prices 
due to Action’s scale and highly efﬁcient 
supply chain. It buys in large volumes and 
stocks its stores daily from its distribution 
centres in the Netherlands and France.
For Action, 2016 was a record breaking 
year. It opened its third distribution 
centre, its 100th store in Germany and its 
200th store in France. In total, 197 stores 
were opened in 2016 and another 6,000 
people were employed in six countries, 
taking the total headcount to 35,000. 
In 2012, Action employed 11,500 people.
The charts below demonstrate that 
Action is an outstanding company. It is 
well positioned in the growing non-food 
discount market with superior earnings 
and cash conversion capability relative  
to its peers.

FY2017 progress Key risks
• Another year of strong performance with a GIR in Private Equity of  
£1,624 million or 43% and a Group GIR of £1,755 million or 40%
• Action performed strongly, opening 197 new stores in calendar year 2016  
and continuing to show growth in like-for-like sales 
• 2013–16 vintage investments, such as ATESTEO, Audley Travel and 
Aspen Pumps delivered a GIR of 29% 
• 3iN delivered a TSR of 16% and Infrastructure generated £59 million  
of cash income to the Group
• Material devaluation of sterling resulted in a gain on translation of £269 million
• Investment rates or quality of new investments are lower 
than expected
• Subdued M&A activity and/or reduced prices in 3i’s core sectors 
could impact timing of exits and cash returns
• Operational underperformance in the portfolio companies impacts 
earnings growth and exit plans
• Sterling materially strengthens against the euro and US dollar;  
at 31 March 2017 , 71% of the portfolio was denominated in euros  
or US dollars
• Private Equity generated proceeds of £982 million from the disposal 
of nine companies, the reﬁnancing of two assets and the full realisation 
of three quoted stakes
• We sold our Debt Management business to Investcorp for cash proceeds 
of £270 million
• Subdued M&A activity in our core sectors reduces investor appetite 
for our assets
• Macro-economic uncertainty limits investor appetite for the 
Private Equity asset class
• Debt markets become less supportive of leveraged buyouts
• Invested £478 million (2016: £365 million) in three new Private Equity investments 
and in a further investment in Q Holding to support its acquisition of Degania
• Supported 3iN’s capital raise in June 2016, investing £131 million (2016: nil) to 
maintain our 34% stake
• Competition from other private equity investors, as well as trade and 
other strategic buyers, could make it more challenging to source 
investments at prices that will meet our return targets 
• Failure to attract, invest in and retain the right investment executives 
impacts our ability to originate and manage assets
• Failure to maintain and develop our network of advisers and business 
leaders reduces the quality of potential deal ﬂow
• Continued to beneﬁt from Debt Management’s cash income in the  
ﬁrst half of the year
• Operating cash proﬁt from Private Equity, Infrastructure and the retained  
Debt Management investments was £5 million
• Measure redeﬁned in FY2017 to be cash income less cash expenses 
(previously it was deﬁned as cash income less accrued expenses)
• Portfolio performance, and therefore portfolio income is weak
• Reduced ability to generate interest and dividend income in a  
private equity structure
• Investor appetite in a volatile macro-economic environment
• New Infrastructure initiatives do not generate sufﬁcient fee income 
• Unplanned increase in the cost base; for example legal, compliance 
or regulatory costs
• 30% increase in NAV per share to 604 pence (31 March 2016: 463 pence) 
• Excellent GIR from Private Equity
• Performance is strong with or without the beneﬁt of foreign 
exchange movements
• Ongoing geo-political uncertainty further dampens investor sentiment
• Implications of the UK’s decision to leave the EU and further negative 
implications of the US presidential election 
• Wider G20 political and economic uncertainty impacts 3i’s portfolio 
companies and valuations
• TSR of 71% as share price increased by 64% in the year, together with the  
ﬁnal FY2016 dividend of 16.0 pence and interim FY2017 dividend of 8.0 pence 
• Net divestment, strong balance sheet and closing net cash support a full year 
dividend of 26.5 pence
• Lower NAV due to investment underperformance or political 
and economic uncertainty
• Investor appetite in a volatile macro-economic environment
2 Operating cash proﬁt has been redeﬁned in the year and the FY2016 comparative restated. The rationale for the change together with the revised calculation is explained on page 43.

Business review
Private Equity performed very strongly in 
FY2017 . Although it was a year of political 
change, with ﬁnancial markets subject to 
periods of signiﬁcant volatility, our portfolio 
generated excellent returns with a GIR 
of £1,624 million or 43% on the opening 
portfolio (2016: £1,011 million, 32%).  
We recognised value growth in excess 
of £1.25 billion, with strong performance 
from assets such as Action and Scandlines, 
together with very good progress from 
investments made in the more recent  
2013–2016 vintage. With over 81% of 
the portfolio denominated in euros or 
US dollars, the sharp fall in sterling that 
followed the UK’s decision to leave the EU 
resulted in a translation gain of £248 million 
(2016: £168 million).
Investment activity
We completed three new investments in the year and made  
a material further investment. 
In July 2016, we invested DKK1,144 million (£132 million) in 
BoConcept, an urban living brand headquartered in Denmark. 
This was a public-to-private transaction where the majority 
of the shares were owned by the founding family. In August 2016, 
we invested €182 million (£155 million) in Schlemmer, a global 
leader in cable management solutions for the automotive 
industry, headquartered in Germany. In January 2017 , we 
completed our €141 million (£122 million) investment in Ponroy 
Santé, a manufacturer of natural healthcare and cosmetics 
products. All three companies have strong market positions and 
3i will use its experience to help them expand internationally, 
maximise market opportunities and drive operational efﬁciencies.
An important component of enhancing the strategic value 
of our investments is our ability to enable transformative M&A 
in our portfolio companies. In December 2016, we invested 
£62 million in Q Holding to support its acquisition of Degania. 
This transaction almost doubles Q Holding’s medical revenues 
and diversiﬁes its product mix and geographic exposure. 
The availability of capital, together with favourable debt ﬁnancing 
terms, continues to attract investors to the Private Equity asset 
class and so our price discipline remains essential. Our local 
teams have been able to ﬁnd an interesting range of investment 
opportunities, both for 3i and its portfolio companies, particularly 
in Europe.
In addition to the £478 million investment in the year to 31 March 
2017 , we announced investments in Lampenwelt (€120 million), 
a German online lighting retailer and Hans Anders (€200 million), 
a leading optical retailer in the Benelux, in March 2017 and April 
2017 respectively. Both investments should complete by the end 
of June 2017 . We also announced an investment in Formel D,  
the leading quality services provider for the automotive industry, 
in May 2017 .

Realisations activity
As market conditions remained favourable, we had a very strong 
year for realisations and generated £982 million of proceeds at an 
average money multiple of 3.7x. We disposed of nine unquoted 
investments, including older investments such as Mayborn, 
Lekolar and Polyconcept, and more recent investments such 
as Geka. We also took advantage of supportive equity market 
conditions to exit or reduce a number of quoted holdings, 
generating proceeds of £154 million (2016: £111 million). 
We continue to reﬁnance our most cash generative assets 
where appropriate for the business, and where market 
conditions allow. Due to Action’s strong growth and cash ﬂow 
generation, it was able to de-lever rapidly during 2016 ahead 
of a €1.675 billion reﬁnancing in December 2016. The proceeds 
were used to reﬁnance the existing debt and fund a distribution 
to shareholders. As a result, 3i received £187 million of proceeds. 
Since investment, Action has returned £526 million of 
reﬁnancing proceeds to 3i, a 4.9x sterling cash return 
on the original investment. 
In addition, we took the opportunity to reﬁnance the debt in 
ATESTEO in June 2016. Its strong EBITDA growth since our 
investment facilitated a reﬁnancing and return of £48 million to 3i.
During the year, we completed the successful exits of Mayborn 
(3.5x) and Amor (2.3x). Both had been valued on an imminent 
sales basis at 31 March 2016. In March 2017 , Agent Provocateur 
went into administration, giving rise to a realised loss of 
£49 million on our investment. In aggregate, we generated total 
realised proﬁts of £38 million in the year, an uplift over opening 
value of 5%, excluding reﬁnancings (2016: £67 million and 14%). 
We continue to make good progress towards our longer-term 
plan to hold a portfolio of 30 to 40 assets. As at 31 March 2017 , 
the portfolio had reduced to 37 assets and three quoted stakes 
(31 March 2016: 47 assets and ﬁve quoted stakes).

Portfolio valuation
The strong performance of the portfolio resulted in unrealised 
value growth of £1,274 million (2016: £690 million).
Performance
The continued strong performance of the investments valued on 
an earnings basis resulted in an increase in value of £827 million 
(2016: £460 million) with the most signiﬁcant contribution coming  
from Action. For its year ended 31 December 2016, Action reported 
sales of €2.675 billion (a 34% increase over 2015), a 37% increase 
in operating EBITDA, and 6.9% like-for-like sales growth and 
opened 197 new stores in six countries. Action has delivered 
EBITDA CAGR growth in excess of 30% p.a. since 3i’s investment 
in 2011. Since 2013, our previous valuations have used run-
rate adjusted earnings for the 12 months to the quarter end 
preceding the reporting period. For the valuation of Action 
at 31 March 2017 , we have reﬁned our valuation methodology 
better to reﬂect its consistent ﬁnancial delivery. As is typical 
for retail businesses, Action prepares its results in four weekly 
periods. At 31 March 2017 , we are valuing this investment using 
run-rate earnings to 26 March 2017 , the closest period end to 3i’s. 
The valuation earnings increased by 33% in the last 12 months 
and, as at 31 March 2017 , Action was valued at £1,708 million 
(2016: £902 million). As the largest Private Equity investment 
by value, it represented 35% of the Private Equity portfolio 
(2016: 24%). 
The investments in our 2013–16 vintage are delivering good 
earnings growth, with assets such as ATESTEO, Aspen Pumps, 
Audley Travel, Q Holding and Euro-Diesel showing good value 
uplifts in the year. 
We invested in ATESTEO in 2013 and have transformed it 
from an owner-managed diversiﬁed engineering company 
into a world leading testing and industrial specialist for the 
automotive industry. Its earnings have almost doubled under 
our ownership; driven by a 30% increase in testing capacity 
through opening a new facility in Germany and the expansion 
of its Chinese operations. 
Aspen Pumps is the global leader in the design and assembly 
of condensate removal pumps, accessories for air conditioning 
(“AC”) installers and rooftop support systems for AC products. 
It had a strong 2016, ﬁnancially and operationally, as it continued 
to gain market share in its core markets. It also completed two 
small acquisitions, designed to allow direct control of  
its distribution channels and product bolt-ons.

Euro-Diesel designs and assembles standby power supply 
systems for data centres and other customers for whom power 
security is critical. The business performed well in 2016 and the 
order book for 2017 is promising. 
Macro-economic developments are impacting a small number of 
our investments, especially those exposed to capital expenditure 
in the oil and commodities sector (Dynatect) or weaker consumer 
sentiment and decelerating tourist ﬂows which have reduced 
spending on the high street in Europe (Christ). 
Overall, the majority of the portfolio (93% of assets valued on 
an earnings basis, as well as Scandlines and Basic-Fit) grew their 
earnings in the year (2016: 84%). One investment was valued 
using forecast earnings at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: two), 
representing 2% of the portfolio by value (31 March 2016: 3%). 
Chart 1 shows the earnings growth of our top 20 assets.
Overall, net debt across the portfolio increased to 3.1x EBITDA 
(31 March 2016: 2.9x) principally due to the reﬁnancing of Action. 
Chart 2 shows the ratio of net debt to EBITDA by portfolio value 
at 31 March 2017 .
Multiple movements
Due to its consistent ﬁnancial and operational outperformance, 
we increased the post discount run-rate multiple used to value 
Action from 14.0x at 31 March 2016 to 16.0x post discount 
at 31 March 2017 . As at 31 March 2017 , a 1.0x movement of 
Action’s multiple would increase or decrease the valuation of 
3i’s investment by £135 million. Excluding Action, the weighted 
average EBITDA multiple declined to 10.6x before liquidity 
discount (2016: 10.8x) and was 9.9x after liquidity discount 
(2016: 10.1x). The decline in multiple is principally due to  
Basic-Fit, which listed in June; it was previously valued using  
a multiple materially higher than the portfolio average at 
31 March 2016, and is now held on a quoted basis. 
When setting multiples, we consider factors such as exit plans, 
relative performance and investment size. As a result of market 
volatility in the year, we continued our practice of adjusting 
multiples down, relative to their comparable set, in 14 out of the 
22 companies (2016: 17 out of 29) valued on an earnings basis. 
The pre-discount multiples used to value the portfolio ranged 
between 5.0x and 16.8x (2016: 6.5x and 14.7x) and the post-
discount multiples ranged between 4.8x and 16.0x (2016: 5.5x  
and 14.0x). 
The combined effect of changes in multiples across the portfolio 
resulted in an increase in value of £239 million in the period 
(2016: £95 million increase).

Uplift to imminent sale
We announced the sale of MKM in March 2017 and recognised an 
increase in value of £8 million. The sale is expected to complete 
by the end of June 2017 .
In October 2016, we announced an implementation agreement 
to sell ACR to two Shenzhen government sponsored investment 
companies, subject to regulatory and other approvals. This 
approval process remains ongoing and, as a result, we did 
not value ACR on an imminent sales basis as at 31 March 2017 . 
Its valuation movement in FY2017 is classiﬁed within the other 
movements on unquoted investments category.
Discounted cash ﬂow (“DCF”)
As at 31 March 2017 , the largest Private Equity investment valued 
on a DCF basis was Scandlines, valued at £538 million (31 March 
2016: £369 million). It generated value growth of £155 million due 
to continued strong trading, the expectation of further delays in 
the opening date of a competing tunnel on its key route between 
Rødby and Puttgarden, as well as a modest reduction in its 
weighted average cost of capital. 
 
Quoted portfolio
The Private Equity quoted portfolio generated an unrealised 
value gain of £43 million (2016: £7 million loss) in the year.
Basic-Fit’s strong FY2016 ﬁnancial and operational performance, 
resulting in the business ending the year with 419 clubs and 
1.2 million members, was reﬂected in the share price increasing 
from its June 2016 IPO price of €15.00 to close at €16.27 and an 
unrealised value gain of £51 million in the year. 3i’s remaining 
stake was valued at £184 million at 31 March 2017 .
Assets under management
The value of Eurofund V (“EFV”), covering buyout investments 
made in the period between 2007 and 2012, continued to grow 
and at 31 March 2017 the fund had a gross money multiple  
of 2.2x (31 March 2016: 1.7x). 
Investments made since the change in investment strategy in 
2012, including the further investment in Scandlines, are making 
good progress with a sterling multiple of 1.7x at 31 March 2017 
(31 March 2016: 1.5x). 
The value of 3i’s Proprietary Capital increased to £4.8 billion in 
the year (2016: £3.7 billion). The value of the portfolio including 
third-party capital increased to €8.1 billion (2016: €7 .0 billion). Financial review, Risk and

Business review 
Infrastructure contributed a gross investment 
return of £87 million, or 17% on the 
opening portfolio (2016: £47 million, 8%). 
This was driven by 3iN’s strong share price 
appreciation together with good levels of 
dividend and fee income from both 3iN  
and the other funds managed by the team.
In May 2016, 3iN announced a 7 .55 pence per share annual 
dividend target for FY2017 , as well as a £350 million capital 
raise. Both initiatives were well received and the ﬁnal amount 
raised in the placing, gross of fees, was £385 million. 3i invested 
£131 million in this placing to maintain its 34% stake in 3iN. 
The shares were offered at 165 pence per share and closed  
at 189 pence on 31 March 2017 , generating a total shareholder 
return for investors in that placing of 17%. 
We made excellent progress in sourcing assets in 3iN’s target 
markets of economic infrastructure and greenﬁeld projects. 
In total we advised 3iN on £479 million of new investment in the 
year (2016: £193 million). 3iN completed six new investments: 
Wireless Infrastructure Group, TCR, Valorem, the Hart van Zuid 
greenﬁeld PPP project, the A27/A1 greenﬁeld PPP project and 
Inﬁnis. As a result, all of the proceeds from the capital raise 
were deployed. 
Overall, the 3iN portfolio continues to perform well and the 
company generated a total return of 9% in the year (2016: 14%). 
Under the terms of the investment advisory agreement, 3iN  
paid an advisory fee of £25 million to 3i (2016: £16 million),  
with the increase attributable to new investment activity, and 
a NAV-based performance fee of £4 million (2016: £20 million). 
Of this, £3 million (2016: £15 million) was accrued as payable  
to the team. 
Investment portfolio performance
The Group’s infrastructure portfolio consists primarily of its  
34% stake in 3iN. 
3iN’s share price performed strongly in the year as the yield 
offered by 3iN continues to be attractive to investors in the 
current low interest rate environment. 3iN’s TSR for the year was 
16% (2016: 13%) and 3iN generated £23 million (2016: £21 million) 
of dividend income for 3i. 3i also has an investment in the 3i 
India Infrastructure Fund, where the team continues to focus 
on managing this portfolio to maximise value for fund investors. 
In total, the Infrastructure portfolio generated unrealised value 
growth of £59 million (2016: £22 million).

Assets under management
Infrastructure AUM increased to £2.9 billion (31 March 2016:  
£2.3 billion) principally due to 3iN’s fundraising and strong 
portfolio performance. 
We are focused on managing the 3iN portfolio actively and 
embedding the new assets to ensure that they meet or exceed 
the investment plan. While we continue to see a good ﬂow of 
new investment opportunities, there remains strong demand 
for infrastructure assets as capital ﬂows towards more defensive 
sectors. In this environment, we remain disciplined and focused 
on maintaining a balanced and attractive portfolio in 3iN.
We remain committed to the importance of our 3iN mandate  
and sourcing and managing its attractive portfolio of assets.  
To broaden 3i’s infrastructure strategy, and generate increased 
cash income for the Group in the medium term, we have also 
announced several complementary new initiatives. In each 
case, we are adding resources to ensure that the new initiatives 
are successful, and that our focus on the 3iN mandate is not 
compromised. We launched a new £700 million fund to purchase 
assets from the EISER Global Infrastructure Fund. In addition,  
we announced a new fund, the 3i European Operational Projects 
Fund SCSP . 3i will provide seed capital of c.£35 million to each  
of these funds. Finally, we announced the launch of a  
US Infrastructure platform in March 2017 . Corporate

Strong ﬁnancial performance
FY2017 was another year of strong ﬁnancial performance. It was also the year in which we sold our Debt Management business 
to Investcorp. The sale of Debt Management completed on 3 March 2017 and the business we sold to Investcorp is classiﬁed as 
discontinued operations throughout this report. We retained the CLO investments not required for regulatory or contractual purposes, 
as well as investments in the Global Income Fund and Senior Loan Fund. These investments are classiﬁed within Other in the Financial 
review and our segmental reporting.
We generated an excellent gross investment return from Private Equity, Infrastructure and the retained Debt Management investments 
of £1,755 million (2016: £1,051 million) and an operating proﬁt before carried interest of £1,675 million (2016: £911 million). This was 
driven by the strong unrealised value growth from our investments, together with the positive impact of foreign exchange translation. 
Total return was £1,592 million, or a proﬁt on opening shareholders’ funds of 36% (2016: £824 million or 22%) and, as a result, the diluted 
NAV per share at 31 March 2017 increased by 30% to 604 pence (31 March 2016: 463 pence).

Alternative performance measures (“APMs”)
In October 2015, the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) published guidelines about the use of APMs. These are 
ﬁnancial measures such as KPIs that are not deﬁned under IFRS. In our Strategic report we describe our ﬁnancial performance under 
our Investment basis, which is itself an APM, and use a number of other measures which, on account of being derived from the 
Investment basis, are also APMs. Further information about our use of APMs, including the applicable reconciliations to the IFRS 
equivalent where appropriate, is provided in page 43, and should be read alongside our Investment basis to IFRS reconciliation. 
Our APMs are gross investment return as a percentage of the opening investment portfolio value, cash realisations, cash 
investment, operating cash proﬁt, net cash/(debt) and gearing. Corporate

Realised proﬁts
Supportive market conditions, together with the co-incidental 
maturity of our exit pipeline, resulted in realised proceeds 
of £1,005 million (2016: £796 million). Proﬁts on disposal of 
£38 million (2016: £72 million) were net of the £49 million realised 
loss on Agent Provocateur which was sold after it was entered 
into administration in March 2017 . This, combined with the fact 
that the successful exits of Mayborn and Amor were valued on 
an imminent sales basis at 31 March 2016, meant realisations 
(excluding reﬁnancings) were achieved at an uplift over opening 
value of 5% (2016: 13%) in the year.
Unrealised value movements
The unrealised value movement of £1,342 million (2016: £690 million) 
was due to strong earnings growth in a number of our Private 
Equity assets. Action contributed £911 million to value growth 
and we also saw improved performance from Private Equity 
investments in our 2013–16 vintage, such as Scandlines (a further 
investment in 2013), ATESTEO, Basic-Fit and Euro-Diesel.

Further information on the Private Equity and Infrastructure 
valuations is included in their respective Business reviews.
Portfolio income
The portfolio generated income of £106 million during the year 
(2016: £115 million). The increase in dividends from 3iN (up from 
£21 million to £23 million) was offset by a reduction in dividends 
from Private Equity, as income in FY2016 included a signiﬁcant 
dividend from Scandlines as well as dividends from older assets 
which have been sold. Interest income on loans in Private Equity 
reduced to £50 million (2016: £59 million) due to the timing of 
asset disposals or IPOs relative to the completion of our three 
new investments. Portfolio fees were broadly stable as the 
increase in deal fees on new investments completed in the year 
was offset by abort costs incurred on prospective transactions.
Fees receivable from external funds
Fees increased to £46 million (2016: £41 million) due to increased 
fee income from 3iN. 3i, as investment adviser, receives a fee for 
sourcing and completing new investments for 3iN; 3iN completed 
six new investments in FY2017 and invested £479 million 
(2016: four investments and £193 million). 
Operating expenses
Operating expenses were £117 million (2016: £107 million), 
principally due to a £4 million increase in the Infrastructure team’s 
share of the 3iN fee income referred to above. The share-based 
payment expense also increased by £3 million due to the strong 
performance of 3i Group’s share price.
We continue to invest in the front ofﬁce capability in Private 
Equity and Infrastructure but remain disciplined on cost. 
We expect that expenses in FY2018 will be broadly double  
the second half costs of £63 million.
Operating cash proﬁt
 
Operating cash proﬁt is a Group KPI; by covering the operating 
costs of running our business with income, we reduce the 
dilution of shareholder returns. Since its introduction in 2012, 
this measure has been deﬁned as cash portfolio and fee income 
less accrued operating expenses, the latter being used as it was 
not considered to be materially different from cash operating 
expenses. The deﬁnition has been updated to be cash portfolio 
income and fee income less cash expenses. The principal non-
cash expense now excluded from the measure is share-based 
payments; these have become signiﬁcantly more material since 
the measure was originally implemented, as more compensation 
is delivered in the form of shares, and as the share price 
has increased.

Excluding the Debt Management business sold to Investcorp, 
3i made an operating cash proﬁt of £5 million in the year 
(2016: £9 million loss). Cash income increased to £121 million 
(2016: £108 million) principally due to the increase in the third-
party capital fees in Infrastructure to £37 million (2016: £29 million). 
The Debt Management business was a signiﬁcant contributor to 
the Group’s operating cash proﬁt. Including the contribution of 
the Debt Management business, the Group made an operating 
cash proﬁt of £33 million in the year (2016: £37 million). Financial review, Risk and Corporate responsibility

Net interest payable
Gross interest payable was £49 million (2016: £47 million), of 
which £15 million related to interest charges on the €331 million 
bond which was repaid in March 2017 . The undrawn revolving 
credit facility was extended by one year to September 2021 at 
no additional cost, following an agreement with all but one of the 
participating banks. The total amount of the facility is £329 million 
(31 March 2016: £350 million). 
Interest receivable on cash balances was £2 million (2016: £4 million).
Carried interest and performance fees
We receive carried interest from third-party funds and pay a 
portion to participants in our carry plans. We also pay carried 
interest to participants on our proprietary capital invested. 
The accounting recognition of carried interest is driven by the 
valuation of the underlying investment portfolio and is accounted 
for by assuming that all investments are realised at the balance 
sheet value.
Our carried interest plans pay cash to participants when the 
underlying investments are realised, for example through a 
disposal or a reﬁnancing event, but only when a performance 
hurdle has been met. Due to the length of time between 
investment and realisation, the schemes are usually active for 
a number of years and their participants are both current and 
previous employees of 3i.
We generated a very strong gross investment return of 
£1,624 million in Private Equity (2016: £1,011 million) and this 
material valuation uplift has resulted in signiﬁcant increases in 
our carried interest balances in FY2017 . The consequence of this 
year’s valuation increase is that our largest Private Equity fund, 
EFV, went through its performance hurdle and consequently we 
recognised signiﬁcant carried interest receivable. A share of this 
receivable is accrued as carried interest payable to the associated 
plan participants. The strong run of realisations from investments 
made between 2010 and 2012 that have completed over the last 
few years meant that we went through the cash hurdle on the 
Group’s associated proprietary capital plan (the so-called Buyouts 
2010–12 carried interest scheme) and began paying carried 
interest to its participants for the ﬁrst time this year.

We typically accrue carried interest payable on 3i’s investment 
portfolio at between 10% and 15% of gross investment return. 
The majority of assets by value are now held in schemes that 
would have met their performance hurdles, assuming that the 
portfolio was realised at the 31 March 2017 valuation. 
We accrued carried interest payable of £431 million (2016:  
£171 million) for Private Equity, of which £202 million relates to  
the carry plan participant’s share of carried interest receivable 
from EFV (2016: £48 million). Carried interest payable accrued  
on 3i’s investment portfolio was £229 million (2016: £123 million). 
£159 million (31 March 2016: £71 million) of this £229 million 
balance relates to the carry payable on the Buyouts 2010–12 plan, 
which includes Action. 
Carried interest is only paid to participants when the hurdles 
are passed in cash terms and then only when the cash proceeds 
are actually received following a realisation or reﬁnancing 
event. During the year, £127 million of cash was paid out to the 
participants in the Private Equity plans (2016: £9 million). Of this 
£98 million related to the carry payable on the Buyouts 2010–12 
scheme which went through its cash hurdle in the year.
3iN pays a performance fee based on 3iN’s NAV on an annual 
basis, subject to a hurdle rate of return and a high watermark. 
The continued good performance of the assets held by 3iN 
resulted in the recognition of £4 million (2016: £20 million) of 
performance fees receivable. Carried interest of £3 million was 
accrued as payable to the Infrastructure team. 
Overall, the effect of the income statement charge, the cash 
movement, as well as the currency translation meant that the 
balance sheet carried interest and performance fees payable 
increased to £685 million (31 March 2016: £404 million) and the 
receivable increased to £366 million (31 March 2016: £122 million).

Net foreign exchange movements
At 31 March 2017 , 71% of the Group’s net assets were 
denominated in euros or US dollars. Following the result of 
the UK’s referendum on its membership of the EU and the 
subsequent weakening of sterling against the euro and the  
US dollar, the Group recorded a total net foreign exchange 
gain of £297 million (2016: £143 million) in the year. 
The Group is a long-term investor and does not hedge its foreign 
currency denominated portfolio. Where possible, ﬂows from 
currency realisations are matched with currency investments. 
Short-term derivative contracts are used occasionally and 
typically to hedge investments and realisations between signing 
and completion.
The net foreign exchange gain also reﬂects the translation 
of non-portfolio net assets, including non-sterling cash held 
at the balance sheet date.

Pension
On an IAS 19 basis the pension scheme remains in a surplus. 
There was a re-measurement loss on the Group’s pension scheme 
of £22 million during the year (2016: £6 million loss). The liability of 
the Group’s UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme increased in the 
year following a decrease in the discount rate. This was partially 
offset by an increase in the underlying asset valuations.
During the year, the Trustees of the 3i Group Pension Plan 
implemented a buy-in transaction, which is a bulk annuity 
purchase that partially reduces member longevity risk while 
improving the investment returns of the pension scheme. 
The transaction is expected to improve the actuarial funding 
position of the plan, which in turn inﬂuences the future cash 
contributions by 3i. The transaction resulted in an accounting 
charge in accordance with IAS 19 of £14 million.
The triennial valuation of the scheme’s funding position at 
30 June 2016 is underway and will be completed no later than 
30 September 2017 .
Tax
The Group’s parent company has operated in the UK as an 
approved investment trust company since its listing on the 
London Stock Exchange in 1994. An approved investment trust 
is a UK investment company which is required to meet certain 
conditions set out in the UK tax rules to obtain and maintain its 
tax status. This approval allows certain investment proﬁts of the 
Company, broadly its capital proﬁts, to be exempt from tax in the 
UK. Approved investment trust companies are particularly suited 
for investment vehicles as their tax status allows them to ensure 
that their shareholders do not suffer double taxation of their 
investment returns. The Group recognised a tax credit in the 
period of £3 million (2016: nil).
Sale of Debt Management
On 3 March 2017 , we completed the sale of our Debt 
Management business to Investcorp for total proceeds of 
£270 million. The sale comprised the entire Debt Management 
fund management business, which had teams based in London 
and New York, and the CLO investments required by the buyer 
for regulatory and contractual purposes. We retained the CLO 
investments in excess of those requirements. During the period 
between signing and completion we continued to support CLO 
warehouses in the US and Europe, and the outstanding balances 
of £33 million were repaid in full on completion. In addition,  
we retained our investments in the Global Income Fund and  
the Senior Loan Fund.

The transaction was signed on 25 October 2016, and the 
economic beneﬁt of the fund management business and relevant 
CLO equity interest transferred with effect from 1 October 2016. 
The total return from discontinued operations of £91 million 
(2016: £27 million) includes the economics of the business up  
to 30 September 2016, compensation for the period to closing 
and the proﬁt on disposal.
The £270 million of proceeds was split between £232 million  
for the sale of the subsidiaries, proceeds of £22 million from  
the sale of directly held investments in CLO equity and 
warehouses and £16 million for the settlement of an inter-
company loan. Financial review, Risk and Corporate responsibility

Net cash is calculated as cash and cash equivalents and 
deposits less total loans and borrowings. As at 31 March 2017 , 
net cash was £419 million (2016: £165 million). The increase 
reﬂects the signiﬁcant level of realisations which, including the 
proceeds of the sale of Debt Management, were £1,275 million 
(2016: £796 million). The balance will reduce by c.£272 million 
(c.€320 million) when the signed investments in Hans Anders 
and Lampenwelt complete (expected by the end of June 2017). 
Subject to shareholder approval, the ﬁnal dividend of £178 million 
will also be paid in July 2017 .
Liquidity
Liquidity remained strong at £1,323 million (31 March 2016:  
£1,352 million) after the repayment of our €331 million bond 
in March 2017 . Liquidity comprised cash and deposits of 
£994 million (31 March 2016: £1,002 million) and undrawn facilities 
of £329 million (31 March 2016: £350 million).

Gearing nil nil
On 17 March 2017 , the €310 million outstanding balance of the 
€331 million bond was repaid out of cash resources. This reduced 
the total gross debt outstanding to £575 million as at 31 March 
2017 (31 March 2016: £837 million). As a result, the annual interest 
cost on the remaining bonds will reduce to £35 million per annum 
in FY2018 (2017: £49 million). 
Gearing
Gearing is deﬁned as net debt as a percentage of the Group’s net 
assets. As the Group was in a net cash position at 31 March 2017 
and 2016 under both the Investment basis and IFRS, gearing 
was nil.
Key accounting judgements and estimates
In preparing these accounts, the key accounting judgement 
relates to the carrying value of our investment assets which 
are stated at fair value.
Given the importance of this area the Board has a separate 
Valuations Committee to review the valuation policy, process 
and application to individual investments. However, asset 
valuations for unquoted investments are inherently subjective, 
as they are made on the basis of assumptions which may not 
prove to be accurate. At 31 March 2017 , 84% by value of the 
investment assets were unquoted (31 March 2016: 85%).
The valuation of the Proprietary Capital portfolio is a primary 
input into the carried interest payable and receivable balances, 
which are determined by reference to the valuation at 31 March 
2017 and the underlying investment management agreements.
Accounting for investment entities 
An assessment is required to determine the degree of 
control or inﬂuence the Group exercises and the form of any 
control to ensure that the ﬁnancial treatment of investment 
entities is accurate. The introduction of IFRS 10 resulted in a 
number of intermediate holding companies being presented 
at fair value, which has led to reduced transparency of the 
underlying investment performance. As a result, the Group 
continues to present a non-GAAP Investment basis set of 
ﬁnancial statements to ensure that the commentary in the 
Strategic report remains fair, balanced and understandable.

37 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 Background to Investment basis 
ﬁnancial statements
The Group makes investments in portfolio companies directly, 
held by 3i Group plc, and indirectly, held through intermediate 
holding company and partnership structures (“Investment 
entity subsidiaries“). It also has other operational subsidiaries 
which provide services and other activities such as employment, 
regulatory activities, management and advice (“Trading 
subsidiaries”). The application of IFRS 10 requires us to fair 
value a number of intermediate holding companies that were 
previously consolidated line by line. This fair value approach, 
applied at the intermediate holding company level, effectively 
obscures the performance of our proprietary capital investments 
and associated transactions occurring in the intermediate 
holding companies. The ﬁnancial effect of the underlying 
portfolio companies and fee income, operating expenses and 
carried interest transactions occurring in Investment entity 
subsidiaries are aggregated into a single value. Other items 
which were previously eliminated on consolidation are now 
included separately.
To maintain transparency in our report and aid understanding we 
introduced separate non-GAAP “Investment basis” Statements 
of comprehensive income, ﬁnancial position and cash ﬂow in 
our 2014 Annual report and accounts. The Investment basis is an 
APM and the Strategic report is prepared using the Investment 
basis as we believe it provides a more understandable view of 
our performance. Total return and net assets are equal under the 
Investment basis and IFRS; the Investment basis is simply a “look 
through” of IFRS 10 to present the underlying performance. 
Reconciliation of Investment basis and IFRS 
A detailed reconciliation from the Investment basis to IFRS 
basis of the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income,

Notes:
1 Applying IFRS 10 to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income consolidates the line items of a number of previously consolidated subsidiaries into a single line item “Fair value 
movements on investment entity subsidiaries”. In the “Investment basis” accounts we have disaggregated these line items to analyse our total return as if these Investment entity subsidiaries 
were fully consolidated, consistent with prior years. The adjustments simply reclassify the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income of the Group, and the total return is equal under 
the Investment basis and the IFRS basis. 
2 Realised proﬁts, unrealised proﬁts, and portfolio income shown in the IFRS accounts only relate to portfolio companies that are held directly by 3i Group plc and not those portfolio 
companies held through Investment entity subsidiaries. Realised proﬁts, unrealised proﬁts, and portfolio income in relation to portfolio companies held through Investment entity 
subsidiaries are aggregated into the single “Fair value movement on investment entity subsidiaries” line. This is the most signiﬁcant reduction of information in our IFRS accounts. 
3 Foreign exchange movements have been reclassiﬁed under the Investment basis as foreign currency asset and liability movements. Movements within the Investment entity subsidiaries 
are included within “Fair value movements on investment entities”.
4 Other items also aggregated into the “Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries” line include fees receivable from external funds, audit fees, administration expenses, 
carried interest and tax.
5 Comparatives for the year ended 31 March 2016 have been re-presented to reﬂect the classiﬁcation of the Group’s Debt Management business sold to Investcorp as discontinued operations.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 40 Notes:
1 Applying IFRS 10 to the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position aggregates the line items into the single line item “Investment in investment entities”. In the Investment basis we have 
disaggregated these items to analyse our net assets as if the Investment entity subsidiaries were consolidated. The adjustment reclassiﬁes items in the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial 
position. There is no change to the net assets, although for reasons explained below, gross assets and gross liabilities are different.
 The disclosure relating to portfolio companies is signiﬁcantly reduced by the aggregation, as the fair value of all investments held by Investment entity subsidiaries is aggregated into 
the “Investments in investment entities” line. We have disaggregated this fair value and disclosed the underlying portfolio holding in the relevant line item, ie, quoted equity investments 
or unquoted equity investments.
 Other items which may be aggregated are carried interest and other payables, and the Investment basis presentation again disaggregates these items.
2 Intercompany balances between Investment entity subsidiaries and trading subsidiaries also impact the transparency of our results under the IFRS basis. If an Investment entity subsidiary 
has an intercompany balance with a consolidated trading subsidiary of the Group, then the asset or liability of the Investment entity subsidiary will be aggregated into its fair value, while the 
asset or liability of the consolidated trading subsidiary will be disclosed as an asset or liability in the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position for the Group. 
3 Investment basis ﬁnancial statements are prepared for performance measurement and therefore reserves are not analysed separately under this basis.
4 The IFRS basis is audited and the Investment basis is unaudited.

Notes:
1  The Consolidated cash ﬂow statement is impacted by the application of IFRS 10 as cash ﬂows to and from Investment entity subsidiaries are disclosed, rather than the cash ﬂows to and from 
the underlying portfolio.
 Therefore in our Investment basis ﬁnancial statements, we have disclosed our cash ﬂow statement on a “look through” basis, in order to reﬂect the underlying sources and uses of cash ﬂows 
and disclose the underlying investment activity.
2 There is a difference between the change in cash and cash equivalents of the Investment basis ﬁnancial statements and the IFRS ﬁnancial statements because there are cash balances held  
in Investment entity subsidiary vehicles. Cash held within Investment entity subsidiaries will not be shown in the IFRS statements but will be seen in the Investment basis statements.

We assess our performance using a variety of measures that are not speciﬁcally deﬁned under IFRS and are therefore termed APMs. 
The APMs that we use may not be directly comparable with those used by other companies. Our Investment basis is itself an APM.
The explanation of and rationale for the Investment basis and its reconciliation to IFRS is provided on pages 38 to 42.

Risk management
Effective risk management underpins the 
successful delivery of our strategy. Integrity, 
rigour and accountability are central to our 
values and culture at 3i and are embedded 
in our approach to risk management.
Understanding our risk appetite and culture
As both an investor and asset manager, 3i is in the business of 
taking risk in order to seek to achieve its targeted returns for 
investors and shareholders. The Board approves the strategic 
objectives that determine the level and types of risk that 3i is 
prepared to accept. The Board reviews 3i’s strategic objectives 
and risk appetite at least annually. 
3i’s risk appetite policy, which is consistent with previous years,  
is built on rigorous and comprehensive investment procedures 
and conservative capital management. 
Culture
Integrity, rigour and accountability are central to our values 
and culture and are embedded in our approach to risk 
management. Our Investment Committee, which has oversight 
of the investment pipeline development and approves new 
investments, signiﬁcant portfolio changes and divestments, 
is integral to embedding our institutional approach across the 
business. It ensures consistency and compliance with 3i’s ﬁnancial 
and strategic requirements, cultural values and appropriate 
investment behaviours. Members of the Executive Committee 
have responsibility for their own business or functional areas and 
the Group expects individual behaviours to meet the Group’s 
high standards of conduct. All employees share the responsibility 
for upholding 3i’s strong control culture and supporting effective 
risk management. Senior managers, typically those who report 
to Executive Committee members, are required to conﬁrm their 
individual and business area compliance annually. In addition, 
all staff are assessed on how they have demonstrated 3i’s values 
as part of their annual appraisal. 
The following sections explain how we control and manage the 
risks in our business. They outline the key risks, our assessment 
of their potential impact on our business in the context of the 
current environment and how we seek to mitigate them. 
Risk appetite 
Our risk appetite is deﬁned by our strategic objectives. 
We invest capital in investment opportunities that will 
deliver capital returns and portfolio and fund management 
cash income to cover our costs, and increase returns to 
our investors. 
Investment risk 
The substantial majority of the Group’s capital is invested in 
Private Equity. Before the Group commits to an investment, 
we assess the opportunity using the following criteria:
• return objective: individually assessed and subject to  
a minimum target of 2x money multiple over three to 
ﬁve years;
• geographic focus: core markets of northern Europe and 
North America;
• sector expertise: focus on Business Services, Consumer 
and Industrials; and
• vintage: invest up to £750 million per annum in four to seven 
new investments in companies with an enterprise value 
range of €100 million to €500 million at investment.
Investments made by 3iN need to be consistent with 
3iN’s overall return target of 8% to 10% over the medium 
term and generate a mix of capital and income returns. 
Other infrastructure investments made by the Group should 
be capable of delivering capital growth and fund management 
fees which together generate mid-teens returns. 
Capital management
3i adopts a conservative approach to managing its capital 
resources as follows:
• There is no appetite for structural gearing at the Group 
level, but short-term tactical gearing will be used. 
• The Group does not hedge its currency exposure but it 
does match currency realisations with investments where 
possible and takes out short-term hedges occasionally 
to hedge investments and realisations between signing 
and completion. 
• We have limited appetite for the dilution of capital returns 
as a result of operating and interest expenses. Both Private 
Equity and Infrastructure generate cash income to mitigate 
this risk.

Approach to risk governance
The Board is responsible for risk assessment, the risk management 
process and for the protection of the Group’s reputation and 
brand integrity. It considers the most signiﬁcant risks facing 
the Group and uses quantitative analyses, such as the vintage 
control which considers the portfolio concentration by revenue, 
geography and sector, and liquidity reporting, where appropriate. 
Non-executive oversight is also exercised through the Audit and 
Compliance Committee which focuses on upholding standards 
of integrity, ﬁnancial reporting, risk management, going concern 
and internal control. The Audit and Compliance Committee’s 
activities are discussed further on pages 69 to 73.

Risk management
continued
The Board has delegated the responsibility for risk oversight to 
the Chief Executive. He is assisted by the Group Risk Committee 
(“GRC”) in managing this responsibility, and guided by the 
Board’s appetite for risk and any speciﬁc limits set. The GRC 
maintains the Group risk review, which summarises the Group’s 
principal risks, associated mitigating actions and key risk 
indicators, and identiﬁes any changes to the Group’s risk proﬁle. 
The risk review is updated quarterly and the Chief Executive 
provides quarterly updates to each Audit and Compliance 
Committee meeting where the Committee members contribute 
views and raise questions. The last risk review was completed 
in May 2017 .
The risk framework is augmented by a separate Risk Management 
Function which has speciﬁc responsibilities under the FCA’s 
Investment Funds Sourcebook. It meets ahead of the GRC 
meetings to consider the key risks impacting the Group, 
and any changes in the relevant period where appropriate. 
It also considers the separate risk reports for each Alternative 
Investment Fund (“AIF”) managed by the Group, including areas 
such as portfolio composition, portfolio valuation, operational 
updates and team changes, which are then considered by 
the GRC. 
Assurance over the robustness and effectiveness of the Group’s 
overarching risk management processes and compliance with 
relevant policies is provided to the Audit and Compliance 
Committee through the independent assessment by Internal 
Audit and the work of Group Compliance on regulatory risks. 
Assurance over the robustness of the Group’s valuation policy 
is provided by the Valuations Committee, whose report can 
be found on pages 74 to 76.
In addition to the above, a number of other committees 
contribute to the Group’s overall risk governance structure, 
as set out on page 45.
Risk management framework
The Group’s risk management framework is designed to support 
the delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives.
The key principles that underpin risk management in the 
Group are:
• the Board and the Executive Committee promote a culture in 
which risks are identiﬁed, assessed and reported in an open, 
transparent and objective manner; 
• the Investment Committee ensures a centralised process-led 
approach to investment; and
• the over-riding priority is to protect the Group’s long-term 
viability and reputation and produce sustainable, medium 
to long-term cash-to-cash returns. 
Managing the Group’s Environmental, Social and Governance 
(“ESG”) risks is central to how we do business and a key part 
of our risk management framework. It also forms part of our 
half-yearly portfolio company reviews as described in the 
Valuations Committee report on page 74. 
In practice, the Group operates a “three lines of defence” 
framework for managing and identifying risk. The ﬁrst line 
of defence against outcomes outside our risk appetite is 
the business function and the respective Managing Partners 
across Private Equity and Infrastructure, and Debt Management 
(until 3 March 2017). 
Line management is supported by oversight and control 
functions such as ﬁnance, human resources and legal which 
constitute the second line of defence. The compliance 
function is also in the second line of defence; its duties include 
reviewing the effective operation of our processes in meeting 
regulatory requirements. 
Internal audit provides independent assurance over the operation 
of controls and is the third line of defence. The internal audit 
programme includes the review of risk management 
processes and recommendations to improve the internal 
control environment.  Corporate

Risk review process
The Group risk review process includes the monitoring of key 
strategic and ﬁnancial metrics considered to be indicators of 
potential changes in the Group’s risk proﬁle. The review includes, 
but is not limited to, the following reference data:
• Group and business line KPIs;
• portfolio analysis; 
• risk reports for managed AIFs; and
• quarterly Group risk log.
In addition to the above, the GRC considers the impact of any 
changes and developments to its risk proﬁle, strategic delivery 
and reputation quarterly.
The GRC uses the above to identify its principal risks. It then 
evaluates the impact and likelihood of each risk, with reference 
to associated measures and key performance indicators. 
The adequacy of the mitigation plans is then assessed and, 
if necessary, additional actions are agreed and then reviewed 
at the subsequent meeting. 
A number of focus topics are also agreed in advance of each 
meeting. In FY2017 , the GRC covered the following:
• a preliminary analysis of the potential impact of the UK’s 
decision to leave the EU on the Group; 
• a refresh of the Group’s risk review process and reporting;
• an update on ESG issues and themes, especially with respect 
to its portfolio companies;
• a review of the Group’s stress tests to support its Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (“ICAAP”) and 
Viability Statement;
• a review of the Group’s IT framework including cyber security; 
• the proposed risk disclosures in the 2017 Annual report and 
accounts; and
• an overview of the main risk management aspects 
of the Group’s remuneration and performance 
management structures. 
There were no signiﬁcant changes to the Group’s approach to 
risk governance or its operation in FY2017 but we have continued 
to reﬁne our framework for risk management where appropriate, 
including further steps to monitor our investment in Action.

 Principal risks and mitigations
Aligning risk to our strategic objectives
Review of principal risks
The disclosures on the following pages are not an exhaustive 
list of risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, but rather 
a summary of those principal risks which are under active review 
by the GRC and Board, and are believed to have the potential 
to affect materially the achievement of the Group’s strategic 
objectives and impact its ﬁnancial performance, reputation 
and brand integrity. 
Although the business environment over the last 12 months has 
been challenging, given the political and economic uncertainty 
and volatile market conditions, there has been no signiﬁcant 
change to our risk management approach or risk appetite. 
The sale of our Debt Management business, which completed on 
3 March 2017 , will allow the Group to focus on proprietary capital 
investment, its advisory relationship with 3iN, as well as new fund 
management initiatives in Infrastructure. The sale of the Debt 
Management business has reduced the regulatory complexity 
of the Group as it is no longer subject to the CRDIV regime.
The Group believes that its consistent strategy of focusing 
on core sectors and geographies, its institutional process-
led approach to investment and strong culture will help it to 
navigate what it expects will be another challenging year for 
ﬁnancial markets.
External
The external environment remains difﬁcult. There has been a 
signiﬁcant amount of uncertainty in the Eurozone and the wider 
emerging markets economies, fuelled by a challenging global 
macro-economic context and ongoing geo-political tensions. 
There has been a signiﬁcant amount of uncertainty in the global 
economy over the last year and in particular following the result 
of the US election and the UK’s referendum on its membership 
of the EU. This has been shown by the signiﬁcant volatility seen in 
foreign exchange and quoted markets this year. Our well-funded 
balance sheet and diverse portfolio of international companies 
position us well to address the wider implications of the EU 
referendum as they unfold. 
Notwithstanding this, large amounts of capital are focused on 
Private Equity and Infrastructure which requires us to be diligent 
and selective in our investment approach.
The Group is subject to a range of regulatory and tax reporting 
requirements. In particular, as a multinational investment 
company, the changes to the tax landscape require careful 
monitoring as countries begin to consider and adopt the 
recommendations made by the OECD’s Base Erosion and Proﬁt 
Shifting (“BEPS”) project. The UK has been among the ﬁrst to 
adopt a number of the BEPS recommendations, including the tax 
deductibility for corporate interest expense, the tax treatment 
of hybrid instruments and country-by-country reporting. 
The Group continues to monitor these tax developments. 
Whilst the increased reporting is expected to lead to an increase 
in the Group’s interaction with the tax authorities in the various 
jurisdictions in which it operates, it is not currently expected 
to lead to a signiﬁcant change in the Group’s overall tax proﬁle.
Managing these requirements is a priority and regular updates 
are provided to the Executive Committee and the Board. To date, 
whilst complex to interpret and implement, they have had limited 
practical impact on 3i’s ability to deliver its strategy. 
Investment
Investment risks are those in respect of speciﬁc asset investment 
decisions and the subsequent performance of an investment 
or exposure concentrations across business line portfolios. 
They could materially impact our ability to achieve our strategic 
objectives. To mitigate these risks, we focus on Private Equity 
and Infrastructure sectors and geographies where our expertise 
and network can drive signiﬁcant outperformance. 
Our overarching objectives are to source attractive investment 
opportunities at the right price and execute their investment 
plans successfully.
The investment case presented at the outset includes the 
expected beneﬁt of operational improvements, growth 
initiatives and M&A activity that will be driven by our investment 
professionals together with the portfolio company’s management 
team. It will also include a view on the likely exit strategy 
and timing. 
The execution of this investment case is monitored through two 
key review processes. Our monthly portfolio monitoring reviews 
current performance against budget and prior year and a set 
of trafﬁc light indicators and KPIs. Our semi-annual reviews focus 
on the longer term plan for the investment together with any 
strategic developments. 
Finally, we recognise the need to plan and execute a successful 
exit at the optimum time for the portfolio company’s development, 
taking consideration of market conditions. This risk is closely 
linked to the economic environment noted above. Exit plans are 
refreshed where appropriate in the semi-annual portfolio reviews 
and the divestment process is clearly deﬁned and overseen by 
the Investment Committee.

step of the investment and realisation process. Corporate

In addition, there are a number of risks speciﬁc to each business 
line as follows:
Private Equity
Regular and robust portfolio monitoring procedures remain 
critical given the volatile economic backdrop and as the 
investment portfolio becomes more concentrated. The Private 
Equity partners’ detailed monthly portfolio monitoring meeting 
is attended by the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance 
Director. In addition, the Valuations Committee reviews the 
valuation assumptions of our more material assets quarterly. 
Individual portfolio company failures could have adverse 
reputational consequences for the Group, even though the value 
impact may not be material. We review our internal processes 
and investment decisions in light of actual outcomes on an 
ongoing basis. 
Infrastructure
Infrastructure remains focused on investing selectively within 
its target sectors and developing both organic and inorganic 
growth opportunities. The Infrastructure business was very active 
in FY2016 and FY2017 , where 3iN saw particularly strong levels of 
investment, and a £385 million capital raise, in FY2017 . In addition, 
the team has launched three initiatives in Europe and North 
America to broaden its coverage of the infrastructure sector 
in areas of the market complementary to the core investment 
focus of 3iN, which remains the primary investment vehicle for 
the business line. To mitigate risks associated with managing 
this strong growth in 3iN and the wider infrastructure business, 
the team has invested in its origination and asset management 
capability through new hires and internal promotions to Partner 
and Director level in Europe and an Infrastructure team in 
the US, and has enhanced its ﬁnance, strategy and investor 
relations teams. Further hires will be made in FY2018. We also 
hold monthly portfolio monitoring meetings and bi-annual 
investment reviews. 
Operational
Following an external review of 3i’s cyber security capabilities 
and controls, the Group implemented a number of new 
protection and detection tools. This, together with a major 
upgrade to our IT infrastructure, has delivered a more robust 
cyber security framework.
The Board also received regular updates on ESG risks and 
whether our investors’ skill sets and business development 
capabilities could support the Group’s strategic delivery. 
Detailed resource plans are in place at the business line level 
and the Board conducts an annual review of the Group’s 
organisational capability and succession plans (which include 
contingencies against loss of key staff). The last review was 
conducted in September 2016.
Viability statement
The Directors have assessed 3i’s viability over a three-year 
period to March 2020. 3i conducts its strategic planning over 
a ﬁve-year period; this statement is based on the ﬁrst three 
years, which provides more certainty over the forecasting 
assumptions used. 3i’s strategic plan, ICAAP and associated 
principal risks (as set out on pages 50 to 53 of the Strategic 
report) are the foundation of the Directors’ assessment. 
The assessment is overseen by the Group Finance Director 
and is subject to challenge by the GRC, review by the Audit 
and Compliance Committee and the Board. 
Our Group strategic plan projects the performance, net asset 
value and liquidity of 3i over a ﬁve-year period and is presented 
at the Directors’ annual strategy away day and updated 
throughout the year as appropriate. At the strategy away day, 
the Directors consider the strategy and opportunities for, 
and threats to, each business line and the Group as a whole. 
The outcome of those discussions is included in the next 
iteration of the strategic plan which is then used to support 
the viability assessment.
The Group’s ICAAP and viability testing considers multiple 
severe, yet plausible, scenarios including a severe downside 
economic scenario and the impact of a material single asset 
event. The severe downside used in FY2017 assumes that the 
global economy enters a severe recession; global equities 
fall and long-term interest rates reach new lows. The material 
single asset event considers the impact of a signiﬁcant asset 
experiencing a severe downturn in performance. 
We project the amount of capital we need in the business to 
cover our risks, including ﬁnancial and operational risks, under 
such stress scenarios. Our analysis shows that, while there may 
be a signiﬁcant impact on the Group’s reported performance 
in the short term under these scenarios, the resilience and 
quality of our balance sheet is such that solvency is maintained 
and our business remains viable.
Taking the inputs from the strategic planning process, 
the ICAAP and its stress scenarios, Directors reviewed an 
assessment of the potential effects of 3i’s principal risks on 
its current portfolio and forecast investment and realisation 
activity and the consequent impact on 3i’s capital and liquidity. 
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet all their liabilities as they 
fall due up to at least March 2020. Financial review, Risk and Corporate responsibility

 Corporate responsibility
A responsible employer
Recruiting, retaining and developing our talent is one of our 
most important priorities. We work towards that objective by 
communicating openly and consistently with our employees, 
providing training and opportunities for career advancement, 
rewarding our employees fairly and by encouraging employees 
to give direct feedback to senior management. We are a 
meritocracy and our employees are recruited, promoted  
and rewarded on the basis of merit, ability and performance.
We recognise the importance of providing a supportive working 
environment and of providing a healthy work/life balance for all 
our employees. 3i has a suite of human resources policies and 
procedures covering areas including recruitment, vetting and 
performance management, equal opportunities and diversity, 
family-friendly policies, medical insurance and health screening, 
health and safety and ﬂexible working, and appropriate processes 
to monitor their application. Summaries of a number of these 
policies can be found on our website.
Human rights
Whilst 3i does not have a formal human rights policy, our 
policies are consistent with internationally-proclaimed human 
rights principles. We comply fully with applicable human rights 
legislation in the countries in which we operate, for example 
covering areas such as freedom of association and the right to 
collective bargaining, equal remuneration and protection against 
discrimination. For all matters relating to human rights, we comply 
with local laws, and if those laws provide lesser protection than 
UK law, we apply the principles enshrined in UK law. 3i is an equal 
opportunities employer and has clear grievance and disciplinary 
procedures, an employee assistance programme and an 
independent, external “whistle blowing” hotline service.
We are committed to ensuring that the businesses we invest in 
comply with all applicable laws in relation to their employees 
(amongst other things) and, where appropriate, that they work 
towards meeting relevant international standards (such as the 
ILO Fundamental Conventions) where those are more stringent. 
We also encourage our business partners and suppliers to adopt 
the same standards with respect to human rights.
3i is committed to achieving its strategic 
and investment objectives while behaving 
responsibly as an employer, as an investor 
and as an international corporate citizen. 
We take responsibility for our actions, 
carefully consider how others will be affected 
by our choices and ensure that our values 
and ethics are integrated into our formal 
business policies, practices and plans. 
Our corporate responsibility strategy 
is deﬁned by three key priorities:
1.  Recruit and develop a diverse pool 
of talent
2. Invest responsibly
3.  Embed responsible business practices 
throughout the organisation
This section aims to provide a brief summary 
of our approach to corporate responsibility. 
For more information, please see our Corporate 
responsibility report, available on our website. 
Further information on our approach to corporate 
responsibility, including summaries of relevant policies,

Equal opportunity and diversity
3i is fully committed to being an equal opportunities employer, 
and is opposed to all forms of unlawful and unfair discrimination. 
We believe that there are great beneﬁts to be gained from having 
a diverse and varied workforce. We do not set speciﬁc diversity 
targets, but seek to ensure that our corporate culture and policies 
create an inclusive work environment that helps to bring out the 
best in any qualiﬁed person. 
3i’s Equal Opportunities and Diversity policy establishes that all 
3i employees (temporary and permanent), contract workers and 
job applicants are treated fairly and are offered equal opportunity 
in selection, training, career development, promotion 
and remuneration. 
Achieving better gender diversity is important to 3i, and we 
believe we are making good progress in that respect, within the 
constraints imposed by being a small organisation with limited 
staff turnover. At 31 March 2017 , 3i had a total of 241 employees. 
The breakdown by gender was as follows:
(number) Total
3
Male Female
All 3i employees 241 142 99
3i Group Directors
1
963
Senior managers
2
38 28 10
1 Includes non-executive Directors who are not 3i employees.
2 “Senior managers” excludes Simon Borrows and Julia Wilson (who are included as 
Directors of 3i Group plc) and includes 23 people who were directors of undertakings 
included in the consolidated Group accounts, of whom 19 were male and four were female.
3 We sold our Debt Management division with effect from 3 March 2017. The average number 
of employees for FY2017 was 281. 
The McGregor-Smith review on Race in the Workplace, published 
on 28 February 2017 , highlighted the under-employment and 
under-promotion of people of Black or Minority Ethnic (“BME”) 
background in UK businesses and makes the case for more 
inclusive organisations. The review noted that, while one in 
eight of the UK working age population in 2015 was from a BME 
background, BME individuals made up only 10% of the workforce 
and held only 6% of top management positions. The review 
contained a number of wide-ranging recommendations, including 
one for listed companies and all businesses and public bodies 
with more than 50 UK-based employees to publish a breakdown 
of their UK-based employees by race and pay band, and to 
publish aspirational targets and report against these annually. 
These recommendations have not been made mandatory.
As at 31 March 2017 , the representation of UK-based BME 
employees as a percentage of total 3i employees was ahead 
of the one in eight proportion of people of BME background 
in the UK working age population. In addition, the proportion 
of employees of BME background as at 31 March 2017 in mid 
to higher salary brackets also exceeded one in eight. 
Employee engagement
We encourage a culture of open communication between our 
employees and senior and executive management. We beneﬁt 
from being a small organisation, operating in a relatively ﬂat 
structure, with few hierarchies. The members of our Executive 
Committee have an open-door policy and know most employees 
by name. 
We promote and facilitate the ownership of 3i shares among 
employees through variable compensation or share investment 
plans. As a result, most of our employees are shareholders in the 
Company and feel invested in the success of the organisation.
We pride ourselves on the engagement and the sense of 
ownership we have fostered over the years, which has resulted 
in low unplanned turnover rates.

2 During the year, 3i sold its Debt Management business, which employed approximately 
50 people, to Investcorp, and closed its Stockholm operations. The impact of these 
changes is excluded from the calculation of the employee turnover rate. 
Graduate training scheme
Our graduate recruitment scheme, designed to develop our next 
generation of world-class investment professionals and business 
leaders, was launched in 2015. We are a small organisation, 
however we believe this programme is important in fostering 
a distinctive 3i culture. Our ﬁrst ﬁve graduate analysts joined us 
in 2015, a further ﬁve joined us in September 2016 and a further 
three will join us in September 2017 . The top performers on 
the programme are offered the opportunity to be fast-tracked 
directly into our business.
A responsible investor
With fewer than 250 employees globally, as a company we have 
a relatively small impact in terms of the environment and other 
corporate responsibility issues. However, with assets under 
management of approximately £10 billion we recognise that our 
decisions as an investor potentially matter to a broad range of 
people. We are, therefore, committed to investing responsibly 
and believe that:
• the effective assessment of ESG matters has a positive effect 
on the value of our investee companies and of 3i Group itself;
• compliance with local laws and regulations may not be enough 
to meet global expectations, deliver value and enhance our 
reputation and license to operate; and
• it is vital that we seek to identify all material ESG risks and 
opportunities through our due diligence at the point we invest 
and effectively manage those risks and opportunities during 
the period of 3i’s investment. Financial review, Risk and Corporate responsibility
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 56
UNPRI
Since 2011 we have been signatories to the UN Principles 
for Responsible Investment. 
Our Responsible Investment policy
We have a clear and comprehensive Responsible Investment 
(“RI”) policy which is embedded into our investment and portfolio 
monitoring processes. In our experience, companies with high 
ESG standards are typically better run, better at identifying and 
managing their business risks and generate better earnings 
growth. This policy sets out the businesses and activities in 
which 3i will not invest, as well as minimum standards in relation 
to ESG matters which we expect new portfolio companies to 
meet, or to commit to meeting over a reasonable time period. 
The policy applies to all our investments, irrespective of their 
country or sector.
Our RI policy has been integrated into our investment and 
portfolio management processes and procedures and is 
supported by detailed guidance notes, a global network of 
specialist external advisers and dedicated internal resource.
3i commits to use its inﬂuence as an investor to promote 
a commitment in our investee companies to:
• comply, as a minimum, with applicable local and international 
laws and regulations and, where appropriate, relevant 
international standards (such as the IFC Performance Standards 
and the ILO Fundamental Conventions), where these are more 
stringent than applicable laws;
• mitigate any adverse environmental and social impacts and 
enhance positive effects on the environment, workers and 
relevant stakeholders; and
• uphold high standards of business integrity and good 
corporate governance.
For more information on our approach to Responsible Investing, 
including a summary of our Responsible Investment policy, 
please visit www.3i.com.
A good corporate citizen
As a company, we strive to embed responsible business practices 
throughout the organisation. Good corporate citizenship is 
achieved not only by having robust policies and processes in 
place, but also by promoting the right values and culture within 
our organisation. 
All employees are assessed annually against our corporate 
values and have a responsibility to be aware of, and abide 
by, 3i’s compliance, behaviour and environmental, ethical 
and social policies and procedures. For more information on 
our values, policies and processes, please see our Corporate 
responsibility report.
Governance
Good corporate governance is fundamental to 3i and its activities 
and is critical to the delivery of value to our stakeholders. For full 
details of our governance structure and processes, please see 
the Corporate Governance section of this report.
Transparency
As a publicly-listed company, 3i operates within a framework 
of formal legal and regulatory disclosure requirements as 
well as meeting the high expectations for transparency of 
our shareholders, fund investors, staff and the media. We are 
committed to communicating both our ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial 
performance in a clear, open and comprehensive manner.
Anti-bribery and corruption
3i does not offer, pay or accept bribes and we only work with third 
parties whose standards of business integrity are substantively 
consistent with ours. We expect the businesses we invest in to 
operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and, 
where appropriate, work towards meeting relevant international 
standards where these are more stringent. This includes, in 
particular, upholding high standards of business integrity, avoiding 
corruption in all its forms and complying with applicable anti-
bribery, anti-fraud and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.
Modern slavery
3i published its slavery and human trafﬁcking statement, 
as required by section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, 
in September 2016 and will update this statement by the 
end of September 2017 . 3i is committed to ensuring that:
• there is no slavery and human trafﬁcking in any part of its 
business or supply chains; and
• the companies in which it invests are similarly committed 
to ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafﬁcking in any 
part of their business or supply chains.
During FY2016, we commissioned KPMG to conduct a review 
of 30 portfolio companies (being those which are not directly 
subject to the Modern Slavery Act themselves) based on public 
records to identify whether any might have a higher risk of 
exposure to slavery or human trafﬁcking. This review found no 
reports of, or references to, slavery in any of the 30 companies 
reviewed. Of these, 12 were identiﬁed as operating in countries 
or sectors with an inherently higher risk of exposure to slavery – 
10 of these companies are in 3i’s residual India/Asia portfolio. 
We will carry out further work to better understand the potential 
risks in relation to these companies.

Environmental impact
This section has been prepared in accordance with our regulatory 
obligation to report greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions pursuant 
to Section 7 of the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. 
During the year to 31 March 2017 , our measured Scope 1 and 2 
emissions (location-based) totalled 959.8 tCO
2
e. This comprised:
Scope FY2017 FY2016
1 191.0 252.4
2Location-based 768.8 854.2
2Market-based
1
174.8 544.4
1 Emissions from the consumption of electricity outside the UK and emissions from 
purchased electricity are calculated using the market-based approach using supplier-
speciﬁc emission factors are reported in tCO2 rather than tCO2e due to the availability 
of emission factors. 
This is equivalent to 3.4 tCO
2
e per full-time equivalent employee, 
based on an average of 281 employees during the year 
(2016: 4.0 tCO
2
e; 276 employees). Overall our Scope 1 and 2 
emissions decreased by 13% in the year. 
Our emissions have been veriﬁed to a reasonable level of 
assurance by an external third party according to the  
ISO 14064-3 standard.
We quantify and report our organisational GHG emissions in 
alignment with the World Resources Institute’s Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and in 
alignment with the new Scope 2 Guidance, which is the most 
signiﬁcant update to the Corporate Standard since its inception. 
We consolidate our organisational boundary according to the 
operational control approach, which includes all our ofﬁces. 
We have adopted a materiality threshold of 5% for GHG reporting 
purposes. The GHG sources that constituted our operational 
boundary for the year to 31 March 2017 are: 
• Scope 1: natural gas combustion within boilers and fuel 
combustion within leased vehicles; and
• Scope 2: purchased electricity and heat consumption for our 
own use.
In some cases, where data is missing, values have been estimated 
using either extrapolation of available data or data from the 
previous year as a proxy. 
The new Scope 2 Guidance requires that we quantify and report 
Scope 2 emissions according to two different methodologies 
(“dual reporting”): (i) the location-based method, using average 
emissions factors for the country in which the reported operations 
take place; and (ii) the market-based method, which uses the 
actual emissions factors of the energy procured. 
Whilst we have a very low footprint on the environment, we are 
committed to reducing it further. In our London ofﬁce, where 
approximately two-thirds of our employees are based and 
which accounts for 80% of our overall electricity consumption, 
we purchase all of our electricity from 100% renewable sources. 
Community
Success in our business relies on being able to recruit, motivate 
and retain a talented group of professionals, drawn from a diverse 
and representative background. We believe that diverse teams 
drawn from different sectors of society have a broader outlook 
and are better equipped to originate attractive investment 
opportunities and manage our portfolio. We therefore focus 
our charitable activities on the disadvantaged, on young 
people and on education, aiming to equip young people from 
all backgrounds with the tools and opportunities to pursue a 
successful career. The charities we partner with are supported 
on the basis of their effectiveness and impact. We also support 
staff giving and sponsorship through matching donations. 
Our charitable giving for the year to 31 March 2017 totalled 
£288,000.
Further details of the charities we support are available in our 
Corporate responsibility report.
External benchmarking
We believe that it is important to evidence our commitment 
to operating responsibly and to show how we are performing. 
Accordingly, we provide information to shareholders and other 
interested stakeholders. 
Sustainability indices
We have been a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Indices and of the FTSE4Good Index Series since 2001 and 2011 
respectively. In addition, 3i became a member of the Ethibel 
Sustainability Index (ESI) Excellence Europe in September 2016 
and was reconﬁrmed as a constituent of that index in March 2017 .
Carbon Disclosure Project
The Carbon Disclosure Project is an international, not-for-proﬁt 
organisation providing a framework which enables businesses to 
disclose their greenhouse emissions and other metrics voluntarily. 
3i has been making annual submissions to the Carbon Disclosure 
Project since 2006. 
In 2016, 3i was the winner of the “Most improved” award for CDP 
responders based in the UK, having improved its score from 94D 
in 2015 to A- (Leadership) in 2016.

The Board is responsible to shareholders for the overall 
management and oversight of the Group to ensure its 
long-term success. In particular, the Board is responsible 
for approving the Group’s strategy, setting the Group’s risk 
appetite, monitoring performance, and maintaining an effective 
system of risk management and internal controls. The Board is 
also responsible for ensuring that the Group has the necessary 
people, resources and structures to deliver the strategy.

Chairman
Corporate governance statement
The Company seeks to comply with established best practice in the ﬁeld of corporate governance. The Board has adopted core values and global policies which set 
out the behaviour expected of staff in their dealings with shareholders, customers, colleagues, suppliers and others who engage with the Company. 
Throughout the year, the Company complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) published by the Financial Reporting Council 
in September 2014 which is available on the FRC website.
Good corporate governance is fundamental 
to the way that 3i, and its investee companies, 
conduct business. Particularly in the current 
volatile economic and political environment, 
effective oversight of strategy, people and 
risk management are vital to the delivery of 
long-term, sustainable value to the Group’s 
stakeholders. The Board must also remain 
responsive to the evolving regulatory 
environment and changing societal 
expectations of business.

The role of the Board
Board and Committee structure
The Board is responsible for ensuring that there is an effective 
organisational and reporting structure in place such that there are 
clear reporting lines within the Group and well deﬁned roles and 
responsibilities. This is to ensure that the right decisions are being 
made with involvement from the right people.
The Board is assisted by various Principal Committees of the 
Board which report to it regularly. The membership and activities 
of the Audit and Compliance Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee, the Valuations Committee and the Nominations 
Committee are described in their separate reports on pages 
68 to 94.
The Board reviews membership of these Committees regularly 
and aims to ensure that undue reliance is not placed on particular 
Directors. These Board Committees have clearly deﬁned terms 
of reference which are available at www.3i.com.
Day-to-day management of the Group is the responsibility of the 
Chief Executive. To assist him in this role, the Chief Executive has 
established a number of additional management Committees 
which are outlined in the Risk section of the Strategic report 
on page 45.

How the Board operates
The Board and its Committees meet regularly, operating 
to an agreed timetable. Meetings are usually held in London.
Directors are expected to attend all the regular scheduled 
meetings of the Board and the Committees on which they serve, 
and to devote enough time to perform their duties. Before each 
Board and Committee meeting, relevant reports and papers, 
including ﬁnancial performance data and detailed updates on 
the progress and implementation of the strategic plan where 
appropriate, are circulated to Directors. The Board is able to 
discuss these reports and updates and to challenge directly the 
Executive Directors and other senior management, who attend 
all or part of the Board meetings where relevant.
The principal matters considered by the Board during the year 
(in addition to matters formally reserved to the Board) included:
• The Group’s strategic plan, related KPIs and annual budget;
• Regular reports from the Chief Executive;
• Sale of the Group’s Debt Management business;
• Reviews of and updates on the Group’s Private Equity,

• Regular reports from the Board’s Committees;

requested by the Directors from time to time.

Composition of the Board
The Nominations Committee is responsible for reviewing the 
composition of the Board and making recommendations for 
appointments to the Board. The Committee considers the 
balance of skills, experience and knowledge needed in order  
to enhance the Board and support the Company in the execution 
of its strategy. Details of the work undertaken by the Committee 
are set out on page 68.
Appointment and re-election of Directors
The Nominations Committee is responsible for leading the 
process of appointing new directors to the Board. Subject to 
the Company’s Articles of Association, the Companies Acts and 
satisfactory performance evaluation, non-executive Directors are 
appointed for an initial three-year term. Before the third and sixth 
anniversaries of ﬁrst appointment, the Director discusses with 
the Board whether it is appropriate for a further three-year term 
to be served.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, the minimum 
number of Directors is two and the maximum is 20, unless 
otherwise determined by the Company by ordinary resolution. 
Directors are appointed by ordinary resolution of shareholders or 
by the Board. The Company’s Articles of Association provide for 
Directors to retire by rotation at an AGM if they were appointed 
by the Board since the preceding AGM, they held ofﬁce during 
the two preceding AGMs but did not retire at either of them,  
they held non-executive ofﬁce for a continuous period of nine 
years or more at the date of that AGM, or they choose to retire 
from ofﬁce. Shareholders can remove any Director by special 
resolution and appoint another person to be a Director in their 
place by ordinary resolution. Shareholders can also remove 
any Director by ordinary resolution of which special notice has 
been given.
Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, retiring 
Directors are eligible for reappointment. The ofﬁce of Director 
is vacated if the Director resigns, becomes bankrupt or is 
prohibited by law from being a Director or where the Board 
so resolves following the Director suffering from ill-health 
or being absent from Board meetings for 12 months without 
the Board’s permission.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(“the Code”), all Directors are subject to reappointment every 
year. Accordingly, at the AGM to be held on 29 June 2017 , all 
the Directors will retire from ofﬁce. All the Directors are eligible 
for and (save for Ms M G Verluyten who will step down from the 
Board at the end of the AGM) seek reappointment. The Board’s 
recommendation for the reappointment of Directors is set out 
in the 2017 Notice of AGM.
Directors
Directors’ biographical details are set out on pages 60 and 61. 
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, six non-executive 
Directors and two Executive Directors. Mr S R Thompson, 
Mr J P Asquith, Ms C J Banszky, Mr S A Borrows, Mr P Grosch, 
Mr D A M Hutchison, Ms M G Verluyten and Mrs J S Wilson 
served as Directors throughout the year under review. 
Mr S W Daintith was appointed as a non-executive Director 
on 1 October 2016.
Mr J P Asquith served as Senior Independent Director (“SID”) 
throughout the year. The SID supports the Chairman and 
meets with him regularly. He is also available to the Company’s 
shareholders in relation to any concerns that they may not have 
been able to resolve through the channels of Chairman, Chief 
Executive or Group Finance Director, or where the shareholder 
considers these channels are inappropriate.
In addition to fulﬁlling their legal responsibilities as Directors, 
non-executive Directors are expected to bring an independent 
judgement to bear on issues of strategy, performance, resources 
and standards of conduct, and to help the Board provide the 
Company with effective leadership. Further details of their role 
are set out on page 62. Non-executive Directors are expected 
to make available sufﬁcient time to meet the requirements of the 
appointment. The average time commitment is expected to be 
around 15 days a year together with additional time for serving 
on the Board’s Committees.
The Board’s discussions, and its approval of the Group’s strategic 
plan and annual budget, provide the non-executive Directors 
with the opportunity to contribute to and validate management’s 
plans and assist in the development of strategy. The non-
executive Directors receive regular management accounts, 
reports and information which enable them to scrutinise 
the Company’s and management’s performance against 
agreed objectives.

Directors’ independence
All the non-executive Directors (other than the Chairman (who 
was independent on appointment) and Mr P Grosch) were 
considered by the Board to be independent for the purposes 
of the Code in the year to 31 March 2017 . Mr P Grosch is not 
considered independent because of his links with the Group’s 
Private Equity business including his position as chairman of 
Euro-Diesel, a company in which the Group is invested.
The Board reviews non-executive Director independence at 
least annually, having regard to the potential relevance and 
materiality of a Director’s interests and relationships. Other than 
for Mr P Grosch, no Director was materially interested in any 
contract or arrangement subsisting during or at the end of the 
ﬁnancial period that was signiﬁcant in relation to the business 
of the Company. Mr P Grosch receives director’s fees from and 
is a shareholder in Euro-Diesel, a company in which the Group 
is invested.
Training and advice
The Company has a training policy which provides a framework 
within which training for Directors is planned with the objective 
of ensuring Directors understand the duties and responsibilities 
of being a director of a listed company. All Directors are required 
to keep their skills up to date and maintain their familiarity with 
the Company and its business continually. Presentations on 
different aspects of the Company’s business are made regularly 
to the Board. On appointment, all non-executive Directors 
have discussions with the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
following which appropriate brieﬁngs on the responsibilities 
of Directors, the Company’s business and the Company’s 
procedures are arranged. The Company provides opportunities 
for non-executive Directors to obtain a thorough understanding 
of the Company’s business by meeting members of the senior 
management team who in turn arrange, as required, visits to 
investment or support teams.
The Company has procedures for Directors to take independent 
legal or other professional advice in relation to the performance 
of their duties. In addition, Directors have access to the 
advice and services of the General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, who advises the Board, through the Chairman, 
on governance matters.
Performance and evaluation
During the year, the Board conducted its annual evaluation of 
its own performance and that of its committees and individual 
Directors. The evaluation had been externally facilitated in the 
previous year by Lintstock Limited. On this occasion, the process 
was conducted internally by the Chairman with support from 
Lintstock Limited. The Chairman held one-to-one interviews 
with Directors informed by the results of a questionnaire 
prepared by Lintstock Limited which was completed by all Board 
members and the Company Secretary. He reported the results 
of the evaluation to the Board and proposed an action plan for 
discussion and agreement. Overall, the evaluation concluded that 
the Board continued to perform well, but some areas for further 
improvement were identiﬁed and agreed. It also identiﬁed for 
further Board attention matters seen as the top strategic issues 
to be faced over the next three to ﬁve years. 
The topics covered by the evaluation included: 
• consideration of Board composition;
• Board dynamics;
• time management and Board support;
• the performance of the Board’s Committees;
• the Board’s strategic and operational oversight; 
• risk management and internal control; 
• succession planning and human resources management; and
• priorities for change.
During the review Directors identiﬁed areas for further 
broadening of the Board’s expertise through recruitment as 
opportunities arise. Priorities for the Board for the coming year 
were agreed. Areas requiring greater time for Board discussion 
and areas for additional Board reporting were also agreed. 
In his role as Senior Independent Director, Mr J P Asquith led a 
review by the Directors of the performance of the Chairman and 
subsequently reported back to the Board and provided feedback 
to the Chairman.
A succession and contingency plan for executive leadership 
is prepared by management and reviewed periodically by the 
Board. The purpose of this plan is to identify suitable candidates 
for succession to key senior management positions, agree their 
training and development needs, and ensure the necessary 
human resources are in place for the Company to meet 
its objectives. Corporate Governance
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 66
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and 
internal control, including for the determination of the nature 
and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take to achieve 
its strategic objectives and for ensuring that an appropriate 
culture has been embedded throughout the organisation. 
Risk management and internal control systems cannot eliminate 
all risks but it is the role of the Board to ensure such systems are 
robust and effective and take account of such risks. In addition 
such systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide 
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Through the regular meetings of the Board and the schedule of 
matters reserved to the Board or its duly authorised Committees 
for decision, the Board aims to maintain full and effective 
control over appropriate strategic, ﬁnancial, operational and 
compliance issues.
The Board has put in place an organisational structure with 
clearly deﬁned lines of responsibility and delegation of authority. 
The Board considers and approves a strategic plan and budget 
on an annual basis and receives regular updates. In addition, 
there are established procedures and processes for planning and 
controlling expenditure and the making of investments. There are 
also information and reporting systems for monitoring the 
Group’s businesses and their performance.
The Group Risk Committee is a management committee formed 
by the Chief Executive and its purpose is to identify and assess 
the principal risks faced by the business, in the context of the 
Group’s risk appetite, and oversee the mitigation or management 
of those risks. This process was in place for the year to 31 March 
2017 and up to the date of this report. Details of the risk 
management framework can be found in the Risk section  
of the Strategic report on pages 44 to 53.
The overall risk management and internal control process is 
regularly reviewed by the Board and the Audit and Compliance 
Committee and complies with the Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting issued by the Financial Reporting Council. The Audit 
and Compliance Committee performed its annual review of the 
system’s effectiveness and reported its conclusions to the Board. 
The process has been in place for the year under review and up 
to the date of approval of this Annual report and accounts 2017 . 
Financial reporting
In the context of the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems, there are speciﬁc processes in place 
in relation to Financial Reporting, including:
• comprehensive system of key control and oversight processes, 
including regular reconciliations, line manager reviews and 
systems’ access controls;
• updates for consideration by the Audit and Compliance 
Committee of accounting developments, including draft and 
new accounting standards and legislation;
• a separate Valuations Committee which considers the Group’s 
investment valuation policies, application and outcome;
• approval of the Group’s budget by the Board and a 
comprehensive system of ﬁnancial reporting to the Board, 
based on the annual budget with monthly reporting of actual 
results, analysis of variances, scrutiny of key performance 
indicators and regular re-forecasting;
• reports from Internal Audit on matters relevant to the ﬁnancial 
reporting process, including periodic assessments of internal 
controls, processes and fraud risk;
• independent updates and reports from the external Auditor on 
accounting developments, application of accounting standards, 
key accounting judgements and observations on systems 
and controls;
• appointment of experienced and professional staff, both by 
recruitment and promotion, of the necessary calibre to fulﬁl 
their allotted responsibilities; and 
• appropriate Board oversight of external reporting.

Approach to Investor Relations
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining a 
purposeful relationship with shareholders. The Group has a 
comprehensive Investor Relations programme to help existing 
and potential investors to understand its activities, strategy 
and ﬁnancial performance. The Chief Executive and the Group 
Finance Director meet with the Company’s principal shareholders 
to discuss relevant issues as they arise. The Chairman is 
available to maintain a dialogue with shareholders on strategy, 
corporate governance and Directors’ remuneration as required. 
Non-executive Directors are invited to attend the Company’s 
presentations to analysts and are offered the opportunity to 
meet shareholders.
Board oversight
The Executive Directors brief the Board on a regular basis on 
the implementation of the Investor Relations programme and 
on feedback received from analysts and investors. Any signiﬁcant 
concern raised by shareholders in relation to the Group is also 
communicated to the Board. In addition, research reports 
published by investment banks on 3i are circulated to the Board 
on a regular basis.
The Board also receives periodic feedback from existing 
shareholders and potential investors through 3i’s corporate 
brokers, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays.
Investor Relations programme
Meetings with principal shareholders
The Executive Directors meet with the Group’s principal 
shareholders on a twice yearly basis, following the publication 
of annual and half-yearly results and as required during the year. 
The Chairman and Senior Independent Director are also available 
to meet with shareholders as required. The Investor Relations 
team also manages a programme of engagement with smaller 
shareholders, implemented through regular presentations 
and meetings.
Meetings with potential investors
During the year, the Executive Directors and the Investor Relations 
team held regular meetings with potential investors internationally 
to communicate the strategy and performance of 3i.
Annual and half-yearly results presentations
The Executive Directors present the annual and half-yearly 
results to institutional investors and analysts. These presentations 
are webcast live on 3i’s website, and the on-demand webcast 
remains available on the website for a period of 12 months.
Capital markets day
The 2016 capital markets day, held in June, consisted of a 
presentation to signiﬁcant shareholders and analysts by senior 
3i executives and the management team of Action, the largest 
investment by value in our Private Equity portfolio. This event 
was held in London. The presentation was focused on the Action 
business model and strategy and on Action’s recent ﬁnancial 
performance. The presentation materials used on the day were 
made available on 3i’s website to enable those investors and 
analysts that could not attend to access the information provided 
at the meeting.
Industry conferences
Throughout the year, the Executive Directors also participated in 
a number of industry conferences organised by investment banks 
for their institutional investor base. These included conferences 
organised by Morgan Stanley, Société Générale, KBW, Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Cazenove and Citi.
Individual investors
Individual investors are encouraged to engage with the Group 
and provide feedback through the Investor Relations team and 
the Company Secretary, whose contact details are available on 
the website.

3i’s website provides a brief description of 3i’s history, current 
operations and strategy, as well as an archive of over 10 years of 
news and historical ﬁnancial information on the Group and details 
of forthcoming events for shareholders and analysts. Annual and 
half-yearly results presentations are also webcast live and 
on-demand on 3i’s website.
Annual General Meeting
The Company also uses its AGM as an opportunity to 
communicate with its shareholders. At the Meeting, business 
presentations are generally made by the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive. The Chairmen of the Remuneration, Audit 
and Compliance, and Nominations Committees are generally 
available to answer shareholders’ questions. Business to be 
discussed at the meeting is notiﬁed to shareholders in advance 
through the Notice of Meeting and covers matters such as the 
annual election of Directors, the appointment of the Auditor and 
the dividend declaration. During the meeting, shareholders are 
also asked to approve the ﬁnancial statements and reports of the 
Directors and the Auditor. In addition, shareholders are asked to 
approve the Directors’ remuneration report. The 2016 Notice of 
AGM was dispatched to shareholders not less than 20 working 
days before the Meeting. At that Meeting, voting on each 
resolution was taken on a poll and the poll results were made 
available on the Company’s website.

Martine Verluyten Member since January 2012
During the year, the Nominations Committee held three 
meetings. Attendance of members at those meetings is shown 
in the table on page 63.
The principal role of the Committee is to ensure that the Board 
has the requisite skills and experience to enable the Group to 
deliver its current and future strategic objectives. To this end,  
the Committee regularly reviews the balance and composition  
of the Board, and develops appropriate succession plans, 
including contingency plans.
The Company has a formal, rigorous and transparent process for 
the appointment of Directors, with the objective of identifying the 
skills and experience required of new Directors, and identifying 
and appraising suitable candidates. In the case of non-executive 
Directors, the appraisal includes an assessment of whether 
potential candidates have sufﬁcient time available to fulﬁl their 
roles. Specialist recruitment consultants assist the Committee 
with this process. The Committee’s recommendations for 
appointment are put to the full Board for approval.
During the year, the Committee considered a number of 
candidates for appointment as non-executive Director and 
recommended to the Board the appointment of Stephen 
Daintith, who was subsequently appointed as a Director on 
1 October 2016.
Further to the publication of the Davies Report on Women on 
Boards, and Code Provision B.2.4, the Board strongly supports 
the principle of boardroom diversity, of which gender is one 
important aspect. The Board’s aim is to have a diverse Board 
in terms of gender, industry experience, skills and educational 
background, and nationality. The Board makes appointments 
on merit and against objective criteria. External search 
consultancies engaged by the Company are instructed to put 
forward for all Board positions a diversity of candidates including 
female candidates. External search consultants engaged by 
the Committee during the year were The Zygos Partnership. 
The Zygos Partnership had no other connections with the 
Company during the year.

The Committee is composed of independent non-executive 
Directors, with recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. 
In particular, the Board is satisﬁed that the Chairman has the 
recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience as outlined in the 
Financial Reporting Council’s Corporate Governance Code. 
Further detail on each non-executive Director’s experience 
can be found in the Directors’ biographies on pages 60 and 61.
The Committee schedules six meetings per annum and four 
of the meetings are coordinated with 3i’s external reporting 
timetable. The attendance of members at meetings is shown 
in the table on page 63.
Invitations to attend the meetings are regularly extended to 
the Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group 
General Counsel, Group Financial Controller, the Head of Internal 
Audit, the Head of Compliance and the external Auditor, Ernst 
& Young LLP . Invitations are given to other members of senior 
management including the Head of Tax and Head of IT as 
appropriate. The Chairman of the Committee meets the majority 
of these individuals separately during the course of the year.
During the year, the Committee held private discussions with 
each of the Group Finance Director, the Head of Internal Audit, 
the Head of Compliance, and the external Auditor in the absence 
of management.

Committee report
continued
In addition to the areas of signiﬁcant accounting judgement  
and monitoring the effectiveness of 3i’s risk management,  
the Committee particularly focused on a number of topics:
Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)
Since the implementation of IFRS 10 in FY2014, 3i has presented 
its results under its non-GAAP Investment basis as well as 
preparing IFRS ﬁnancial statements. However, the Investment 
basis contains APMs and is itself an APM. Management prepared 
a report for the Committee which reviewed the rationale and 
presentation of the Group’s APMs. This review considered 
the guidelines issued by the European Securities and Markets 
Authority (“ESMA”) in the year and the Group’s compliance with 
them. In addition, the Committee also reviewed the rationale  
for the changes in the calculation of operating cash proﬁt and 
Assets under Management (AUM).
Upcoming changes in IFRS
The Committee considered future changes to accounting 
standards (in particular, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 16 Leases).
Taxation
The Committee receives an annual update on the Group’s 
taxation status as well as a more general update from the Head 
of Tax on the status of current and upcoming legislative and 
regulatory changes. This year’s report covered the potential 
impact of a number of tax transparency initiatives that have come 
into force, the current disclosure provided on the Group’s website 
as well as the FRC’s thematic review on tax disclosures.
Disposal of the Debt Management business
The Committee reviewed management papers on the 
discontinued operations disclosure and the proﬁt on disposal.
Going concern and viability
The Directors are required to make a statement in the Annual 
report as to 3i’s long-term viability. The Committee provides 
advice to the Board on the form and content of the statement, 
including the underlying assumptions. At year end, the 
Committee evaluated a report from management setting out 
its view of 3i’s long-term viability and content of the proposed 
Viability Statement. This report was based on the Group’s  
ﬁve-year strategic plan and covered forecasts for investments and 
realisations, liquidity and leverage, including forecast outcomes 
of the stress test of the plan and forecast capital and liquidity 
performance against an assessment of the Group’s risk proﬁle. 
The three year period was chosen as it provided more certainty 
on the Group’s performance.
Taking into account the assessment of the Group’s stress testing 
results and its risk appetite statement (as disclosed on page 44), 
the Committee agreed to recommend the viability statement and 
three-year viability period to the Board for approval. Audited ﬁnancial

Areas of accounting judgement and control focus
The Committee pays particular attention to matters it considers 
to be important by virtue of their size, complexity, level of 
judgement and potential impact on the ﬁnancial statements 
and wider business model. 
Signiﬁcant areas of accounting and control focus considered 
by the Committee are detailed in the table below, alongside 
the actions taken by the Committee (with appropriate input, 
guidance and challenge from the external Auditor) to address 
these issues/judgements.
Area of signiﬁcant attention What the Committee reviewed and concluded
Valuation of the Proprietary Capital investment portfolio  
The most material area of judgement in the ﬁnancial statements, and 
noted as a signiﬁcant risk by the external Auditor, relates to the 
valuation of the unquoted Proprietary Capital investment portfolio, 
which at 31 March 2017 was £4,782 million, or 82% of net assets, under 
the Investment basis.
In recognition of the importance of this area the Board has a separate 
Valuations Committee to review the valuations policy, process and 
application to individual investments. This Committee provides 
quarterly reports to the Committee and the Board.
On behalf of the Board, the Committee examined quarterly reports 
from the Chairman of the Valuations Committee and the Group Finance 
Director, with particular focus on the assumptions supporting the 
unquoted asset investments, any valuation uncertainties and the 
proposed disclosure in the ﬁnancial statements. 
The 2017 Annual Report includes a separate report from the Valuations 
Committee. The detail on the key valuation considerations and the 
review and challenge undertaken in the year is included in the 
Valuations Committee Report on page 74 to 76.
Carried interest payable and receivable  
The valuation of the Proprietary Capital portfolio is a primary input 
into the carried interest payable and receivable balances, which are 
determined by reference to the valuation at 31 March 2017 . 
During the year, we went through the hurdle to recognise carried 
interest receivable from EFV on an accounting basis. We are also 
through the hurdle to pay carried interest payable to investment teams 
on 3i’s proprietary capital invested.
Internal Audit reviews carry plan distributions made to plan participants 
before the payments are made and summaries of the work done are 
included in updates to the Committee.
The Committee reviewed the carried interest payable and receivable 
as part of the overall summary prepared by management to support 
the 2017 Annual report and accounts.
Fair, balanced and understandable and the presentation of 3i’s results 
Under the UK Corporate Governance Code the Board should establish 
arrangements to ensure the Annual report presents a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group’s position and prospects.
The Group prepares the non-GAAP Investment basis ﬁnancial 
statements to ensure that its results remained understandable.
The Committee reviewed the Half-yearly and full year ﬁnancial 
statements as well as the Quarterly Performance Updates with 
management, focusing on the integrity and clarity of disclosure 
and to ultimately enable the Board to provide the fair, balanced and 
understandable conﬁrmation to shareholders in the 2017 Annual report.
A report summarising the considerations for the 2017 Annual report was 
reviewed by the Committee in advance of the year end and a summary 
of the detailed procedures undertaken was prepared alongside the 2017 
Annual report.
Cognisant of the ESMA guidelines on APMs as well as the FRC’s thematic 
review, the Committee reviewed a detailed paper from management on 
the Group’s APMs which include the Investment basis. 
The external Auditor also conﬁrmed that the inclusion of the Investment 
basis remained consistent with the prior year. Corporate Governance

Risk and internal control reviews
The Committee is responsible on behalf of the Board for 
overseeing the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems. It monitors the activities of the Group 
Risk Committee (“GRC”), the risk management processes in 
place and the activities of the Internal Audit function, including its 
reporting on the effectiveness of controls, the use of the Group’s 
whistleblowing facility and compliance with the UK Bribery Act.
A report summarising each quarterly GRC meeting, along with 
the risk report considered, is provided to the Committee for 
review and discussion. The risk report details the principal risks, 
which are derived from the Group Risk process, along with 
commentary on how the exposure to these risks has moved in 
the quarter. The Committee also monitors Internal Audit activity 
quarterly, covering change management and other areas of 
identiﬁed higher risk. 
The Director, Internal Audit prepares a report on the internal 
controls for presentation to the Committee. The review 
documents the components of the internal control framework 
and highlights the key developments in the year. A commentary 
on the operation of the internal control framework over the year is 
also independently prepared by Internal Audit. The effectiveness 
of such controls is reviewed by Internal Audit annually, either 
through dedicated procedures or in the course of other Internal 
Audit reviews over the course of the year. Group Compliance 
carries out desk-based monitoring, business unit and 
thematic reviews in relation to compliance policies and other 
regulatory matters.
The Group maintains a framework of controls related to key 
ﬁnancial processes, including the preparation of consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements, and management of the associated risks. 
The Group’s control policies and procedures, which are in 
accordance with the Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance 
on risk management, internal control and related ﬁnancial and 
business reporting has been in place throughout the ﬁnancial 
year and up to the date on which this report was approved. 
Internal audit 
The Committee continued to monitor the scope, activity, and 
resources of the Group’s internal audit function including whether 
the current operating model remained effective and concluded 
that it remained appropriate. 
During the year the Committee approved the annual internal 
audit plan. It also received a report from the Director, Internal 
Audit at each meeting summarising the audits concluded in the 
period and updates on outstanding agreed actions from previous 
reports. The Director, Internal Audit meets the Committee 
privately as well as meeting regularly with the Audit Committee 
Chairman throughout the year. 
The Committee Chairman engaged an external provider in 
FY2017 to carry out an external quality assessment review of 3i’s 
internal audit function. They noted that 3i generally conforms to 
The Institute of Internal Auditors Standards; the highest rating 
available for an internal audit activity. 
External audit
Ernst & Young LLP has been the Group’s statutory external 
Auditor since before the Group was listed on the London Stock 
Exchange in 1994. The Committee assesses the independence 
and objectivity, qualiﬁcations and effectiveness of Ernst & Young 
LLP on an annual basis. The Committee also concludes on 
whether to recommend the reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP 
as Auditor to the Board.
The total audit fee for the year was £1.9 million (2016: £2.0 million). 
The Committee is satisﬁed that this fee is appropriate. 
The Committee oversees the Group’s policy on the provision 
of non-audit services by the external Auditor.  Audited ﬁnancial

Auditor independence
The Group has a policy for setting out what non-audit services 
can be purchased from the ﬁrm appointed as external 
Auditor. The aim of the policy is to support and safeguard 
the objectivity and independence of the external Auditor 
and to comply with the FRC’s Ethical Standards for auditors 
(“Ethical Standards”) as updated in June 2016. It also ensures 
that where fees for approved non-audit services are greater 
than a pre-determined limit, they are subject to the Committee 
Chairman’s prior approval. 
The Policy permits certain non-audit services to be purchased, 
following approval, when the Committee continues to see 
beneﬁts for the Group in engaging Ernst & Young LLP . 
Examples of this include:
• Work that is closely related to the external audit;
• A detailed understanding of the Group is required; 
• Ernst & Young LLP is able to provide a higher quality and/or 
better value service than other potential providers.
The key principle of our policy is that permission to engage 
the external Auditor will always be refused when a threat to 
independence and/or objectivity is perceived. The Committee 
Chairman is asked to approve all assignments to be allocated to 
Ernst & Young LLP over the deﬁned limit, other than those related 
to due diligence undertaken as part of the Group’s investment 
process. Appointments in relation to the investment process 
are independent of the audit team and are reviewed separately 
by the Investment Committee. Ernst & Young LLP inform the 
Group of all due diligence engagements before they accept 
them and all material due diligence commitments are reported 
to the Committee Chairman. 
Ernst & Young LLP has reviewed its own independence in line 
with these criteria and its own ethical guideline standards. 
This includes due diligence processes undertaken within the 
Group’s investment activities. Ernst & Young LLP has conﬁrmed 
to the Committee that following its review it is satisﬁed 
that it has acted in accordance with relevant regulatory and 
professional requirements. 
Details of the non-audit fees paid to the Auditor are disclosed in 
Note 6 to the ﬁnancial statements. The Committee concluded 
that all of these fees fell within its criteria for engaging Ernst 
& Young LLP and does not believe they pose a threat to the 
Auditor’s independence or objectivity. 
Assessing external audit effectiveness
The Committee reviews the effectiveness of Ernst & Young LLP 
through the use of questionnaires completed by management, 
by considering the extent of their contribution at its meetings 
throughout the course of the year, and in one-to-one meetings. 
The Committee Chairman met Ernst & Young LLP’s Head of Audit 
Quality for UK Financial services and their Head of Assurance for 
UK Financial services to discuss their approach to audit quality 
and what assurance had been taken in connection with their 
audit of 3i.
The FY2017 evaluation also reviewed the quality of the audit 
process, the use of Ernst & Young LLP’s valuation practice 
to support the audit of the portfolio valuations, the technical 
knowledge of the team and the staff turnover within the  
Ernst & Young LLP audit team and the Committee concluded  
that the audit was effective.
Audit tender
As noted in the FY2016 report, the Committee reviewed its audit 
tender timetable and delayed the tender until no later than 2020. 
The scale of the current engagements across the Group and its 
portfolio companies with the ﬁrms that may participate in any 
tender, as well as the complexities around how the rules would 
apply to private equity investment, meant that the Committee 
concluded that it would be appropriate to use the full transitional 
arrangements in relation to auditor rotation, as outlined by the 
Financial Reporting Council. The Committee currently expects 
that Ernst & Young LLP will be retained until 2020. The lead audit 
partner was replaced in 2016 to provide continuity until 2020, 
when mandatory rotation will be required. 3i is in compliance 
with the requirements of The Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 
2014, in the year ended 31 March 2017 .

The Valuations Committee reports to the Audit and Compliance 
Committee and the Board on the valuation of the Group’s 
investment assets. It reviews and challenges the assumptions 
behind management’s proposed asset valuation.
The Committee’s activity is principally focused on the Private 
Equity investments as a high level of judgement is required 
to value the unquoted portfolio. As in previous years, the 
Committee devoted less time to Infrastructure due to the fact 
that its principal investment during FY2017 was its shareholding 
in 3i Infrastructure plc which is quoted. The Committee 
actively reviewed the value of the assets in the Group’s Debt 
Management business until its disposal completed on 3 March 
2017 and will continue to review the valuation of the remaining 
positions until they are sold. 
The Committee is responsible for keeping the Group’s valuation 
policy under review and recommending any changes to the 
policy to the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board. 
The policy is reviewed at least annually with the last update 
in January 2017 . The Group’s valuation policy is based on the 
International Private Equity and Valuation (“IPEV”) guidelines 
which set out recommended practice for fair valuing unquoted 
investments within the IFRS framework and incorporates 
references to AIFMD where appropriate.
Overview of the valuation process  
during the year
The Group’s valuation process remained substantially unchanged 
in FY2017 . The Committee met four times, coinciding with the 
Group’s external reporting obligations, and received a detailed 
report from the Group Finance Director at each meeting 
recommending the proposed valuation of the Group’s investment 
portfolio. This report highlighted the main drivers of value 
movement analysed between performance, multiple movements 
and other factors. At each meeting the Committee also reviewed 
selected assets for detailed discussion; examples of such assets 
covered during the year included Action, Scandlines, Christ, 
Weener Plastic, Audley Travel, ATESTEO, Agent Provocateur 
and ACR. Where relevant, the Committee also received updates 
on signiﬁcant issues such as the ﬁrst review of the impact of the 
UK’s decision to leave the EU on our UK assets. 
In advance of the full-year and half-year reporting, management 
hold individual portfolio company reviews with the respective 
investment teams. Non-executive Directors, including members 
of the Valuations Committee, attended a signiﬁcant proportion 
of the meetings held in September 2016 and March 2017 and 
were represented at all of the top ﬁve Private Equity portfolio 
company review meetings. 
Meetings are open to all Directors and attended by other 
members of the Executive Committee as required, the Group 
Financial Controller and the external Auditor. The Committee 
Chairman meets the Group Finance Director and Group 
Financial Controller in advance of each meeting to discuss 
the key valuation assumptions and will also meet members 
of Investment Committee on an ad hoc basis. In addition, the 
Committee Chairman met privately with the external Auditor 
in advance of each meeting to discuss the output of their review 
and towards the end of the year to discuss their approach to the 
year-end audit.

Outside of the regular quarterly valuation process, the Board 
approved a material revaluation of Action, which was announced 
on 30 June 2016, as a result of third-party interest in the 
investment and its continued growth and ﬁnancial trajectory. 
The Committee Chairman and other Committee members 
reviewed and discussed the valuation proposal with management 
ahead of its approval by the Board.
External audit
As part of its external audit, Ernst & Young LLP reviews the 
proposed investment portfolio valuation to determine that 
the valuation policy is being complied with and that there 
is consistent application and support for the underlying 
assumptions. As part of their year-end audit, and to support their 
opinion on the Financial statements as a whole, Ernst & Young 
LLP’s specialist valuations team review a selection of Private 
Equity investments to provide assurance on their overall audit 
conclusion on the appropriateness of 3i’s portfolio valuation. 
FY2017 update
More information on our valuation methodology, including deﬁnitions and rationale, is included in the Portfolio valuation  
– an explanation section on pages 158 and 159.
The Committee focused on the following signiﬁcant issues in the year:
Area of judgement What the Committee did
Private Equity
Earnings and multiple assumptions
The majority (78%) of the portfolio is valued using a multiple of 
earnings. This requires judgement as the earnings of the portfolio 
company may be adjusted so that they are considered “maintainable” . 
There is also a signiﬁcant degree of judgement in selecting the 
appropriate set of comparable quoted companies to determine the 
appropriate multiple to generate an enterprise value. Multiples are 
selected by reference to quoted comparable companies, M&A 
transactions and input in certain cases from corporate ﬁnance advisers. 
We also take into account growth proﬁle, geographic location, business 
mix, degree of diversiﬁcation and leverage/reﬁnancing risk. The multiple 
implied by the quoted comparables may be adjusted if, in certain cases, 
the longer-term view (cycle or exit plan) supports the use of a different 
multiple. This has been a particularly important exercise in light of 
the increased volatility experienced in the quoted equity markets 
over the period under review. 
Earnings data is received monthly from Private Equity portfolio 
companies and monitored closely by management. Actual earnings 
may then be adjusted in management’s proposed valuations, for 
example, to reﬂect a full year’s trading of an acquired business, 
removing proﬁt from discontinued activities, any forecast uncertainty  
or to exclude exceptional transaction costs. Material adjustments are 
highlighted to the Committee in the quarterly report for review and 
approval, including the use of March 2017 run-rate earnings for the 
Action valuation.
Management continued to adjust a signiﬁcant proportion of multiples 
used if the longer term view (of the exit or multiple) supports the use  
of a different multiple. Notable changes in multiples in a quarter are 
presented to the Committee and adjustments are reviewed by the 
Committee at each meeting. 
Imminent sale assets
At any point in time it is likely that a number of potential exit 
processes from the portfolio are underway. Judgement is applied by 
management as to the likely eventual exit proceeds and certainty of 
completion. This means that in some cases an asset may not be moved 
to an imminent sales basis until very shortly before completion; in other 
cases the switch may occur on signing. However, as a general rule an 
asset moves to an imminent sale basis only when a process is materially 
complete and the remaining risks are estimated to be small, given the 
amount of completion risk around unquoted equity transactions.
Assets that are within active sales processes are reviewed by the 
Committee including details such as the timeline to potential 
completion, the number and make-up of bidders for investments, 
execution and due diligence risks and regulatory or competition 
clearance issues. Management propose a treatment for each asset 
which the Committee reviews.
Although not an area of valuation judgement, the Committee actively 
reviews the results of the back-testing that management prepares on 
assets disposed in each quarter to reconcile the price achieved with the 
carrying value at the last balance sheet date. This acts as a hindsight 
test of the fair value applied to assets in the quarters up to disposal.
Assets valued using a DCF basis
For assets valued using DCF techniques the key valuation judgements 
relate to longer-term assumptions that drive the underlying business 
plan and cash ﬂows and the decision on the appropriate discount rates.
 
Material assumptions and changes to these assumptions are reviewed 
by the Committee. This may include third-party support if available. 
Sensitivity to assumptions is also noted.
Discount rates are selected by management with reference to market 
transactions, weighted average cost of capital calculations and other 
public data. Any material changes are reviewed by the Committee and 
external advice is sought from time to time. Corporate Governance

As part of its challenge and review process, the Committee:
• considered the management information provided to 
support the Committee’s review of the valuations, including 
management’s responses to any challenges raised by the 
Committee members or the external Auditor;
• sought assurance from the external Auditor as to whether and 
how they had considered each of these areas; and
• reviewed the consistency of the views of management and 
the external Auditor.
The Committee was satisﬁed that the application of the policy 
and process was appropriate during the applicable period, 
and recommended the portfolio valuation to the Audit and 
Compliance Committee and the Board at each quarter end 
for approval by the Board.
Portfolio trends
At least annually the Committee Chairman and management 
conduct a review of the valuation outcomes in the portfolio 
over the preceding three years. The Committee Chairman and 
Group Finance Director reported to the Board in May 2017 on  
the key observations.

 Directors’ remuneration report
Statement by the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman
As Remuneration Committee Chairman, I am pleased to 
introduce the Directors’ remuneration report for the ﬁnancial 
year 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017 (“the year”) and to provide 
some details of the background against which the Committee’s 
decisions have been taken in the year. References to “FY2018” 
relate to the ﬁnancial year 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018.
This year’s report contains two sections, being the annual report 
on remuneration and a new proposed Directors’ remuneration 
policy which will be presented for approval at the 2017 AGM.
Performance in the year
I am pleased to report that this has been another successful 
year for the Company with management delivering strong 
results across the board which are reﬂected in the Committee’s 
decisions concerning the Executive Directors’ remuneration. 
These decisions are underpinned by a balanced scorecard 
of both ﬁnancial and strategic measures agreed by the 
Committee in May 2016. While the facts driving our assessment 
of performance against that balanced scorecard are available 
elsewhere in this Annual report, we have summarised them here 
for ease of reference.
In addition to driving the excellent performance recorded 
in Private Equity and Infrastructure in FY2017 , the team also 
executed the successful sale of the Debt Management business 
to Investcorp half way through the year in accordance with the 
agreed strategy. As noted below, the Committee adjusted the 
threshold and target metrics for operating cash proﬁt  
and Investment to take account of the timing of this sale.
Portfolio return
Exceptional performance of the Private Equity portfolio, as well 
as very strong returns from the Infrastructure portfolio, generated 
a gross investment return of £1,755 million (2016: £1,051 million) 
or 40% of opening portfolio value. This was an outstanding 
performance against target and industry benchmarks. This year, 
93% of our portfolio companies by value grew their earnings in 
FY2017 , while 3iN’s investment return of 9.4% was at the upper 
end of its 8% to 10% target range. Weighted annualised TSR 
on our investment in 3iN, including the rights issue, was 16% 
for the year.
Investment
Investment levels within our Private Equity business increased 
through the year, while still maintaining a disciplined and 
selective approach to new investments, resulting in £409 million 
being deployed through three new investments in Schlemmer, 
BoConcept and Ponroy Santé, as well as a further £62 million 
investment in Q Holding. The Infrastructure business advised 
3iN on the acquisition of £479 million of investments. They also 
announced a £700 million fund for both 3i Group and third 
parties to purchase assets from the Eiser Global Infrastructure 
Fund. The Committee set a business as usual target for new 
fund launches in the Debt Management CLO business at the 
beginning of the year but this was removed in the light of the 
Board’s decision to sell the business.
Operating proﬁt
Annual operating cash proﬁts remained positive at £33 million 
in FY2017 (2016: £37 million) despite a reduction of £9 million, 
resulting from the timing of the sale of the Debt Management 
business, reﬂecting the budgeted cash income from that area 
in the second half of the year. Operating cash proﬁts were 
supported by the performance of the Debt Management 
business in the ﬁrst half, combined with strong fee and 
dividend income from the Infrastructure business and good 
dividend and interest income from the Private Equity portfolio. 
Operating expenses, including Debt Management, decreased 
by 3% from £134 million in FY2016 to £130 million in FY2017 .
Strategy and people
The principal strategic achievement of the year was the 
successful disposal of the Debt Management business, 
which was accomplished at a good price in a controlled and 
disciplined process by the in-house team without the need for 
an external adviser. Meanwhile, we continued to strengthen 
our investment capabilities through new hires and talent 
management in both remaining businesses.
 
Our remuneration framework ensures 
alignment with shareholders’ interests and 
rewards the achievement of our strategic 
objectives.  Corporate Governance

The proposed Remuneration policy  
and FY2018 implementation
The current Remuneration policy was approved at the 2014 
AGM, which means that the Company is required to submit its 
policy for the next binding vote at the 2017 AGM. Over the three 
years in which the existing policy has operated, management 
have delivered exceptional returns for shareholders. In absolute 
terms, management have delivered total shareholder returns 
to 31 March 2017 of just under 104%, corresponding to 26.8% 
compound per annum. In relative terms, this performance puts  
3i in the 94th percentile of the FTSE 250 and the 97th percentile 
of the FTSE 100.
Over the same period, the bonus opportunity for the Executive 
Directors has remained capped, growing by 3% per annum. 
Across the annual bonus and LTIP , 80% of awards have been 
delivered in the form of deferred shares and the appreciation 
of these shares prior to vesting has been a signiﬁcant component 
in total remuneration for the Executive Directors at no additional 
cost to the Company (see chart).
The Remuneration Committee believes that total shareholder 
return (“TSR”) continues to be an appropriate metric for 
measuring longer-term performance in an investment business 
such as 3i. The Committee has reviewed the suitability of the 
vesting proﬁle of the absolute TSR metric in light of the economic 
environment and the need to ensure that Executives do not take 
excessive risk. We have concluded that the 10% to 18% range 
remains a demanding test of medium-term performance.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the existing policy 
has been demonstrably effective in aligning Executive Directors’ 
interests with those of shareholders and therefore no material 
changes to the existing policy are proposed at this time. 
The overall remuneration framework and incentive levels will 
remain the same. However, taking into account feedback from 
our investors and current best market practice, the shareholder 
requirement for the Group Finance Director has been increased 
to 200% of base salary.
Changes in the year
During the year, the Committee considered the structure of 
the Executive Directors’ remuneration and concluded that 
the existing relatively low level of base salary, coupled with 
a substantial variable element, is one that allows the Committee 
more ﬂexibility to align annual remuneration to the Company’s 
performance in this highly competitive sector. Neither of the 
Executive Directors is entitled to participate in the Group’s 
carried interest schemes.
During FY2017 , 3i has worked to ensure that it continues to 
comply with changes in regulation. The Group must comply with 
the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), 
which requires the Company to deliver variable remuneration to 
certain staff in a particular form. The two Executive Directors are 
considered to be AIFMD Identiﬁed Staff, and as such, 60% of their 
annual bonuses will be delivered in deferred 3i Group plc shares 
which vest in equal instalments over four years. The remaining 
40% will be delivered half in cash bonus and half in 3i Group plc 
shares which are subject to a six-month retention period.
The Committee reviewed the level of disclosure it makes through 
the annual performance metrics and the impact on remuneration. 
The FY2017 scorecard, which the Committee uses as a prompt 
and guide to judgement of performance, has been improved 
with half of the scorecard being linked to quantitative measures 
(Portfolio returns and Operating performance). As shown 
on page 80, these metrics have been set with threshold and 
maximum levels.
The Committee remains committed to maintaining a remuneration 
framework which rewards progress in meeting the Group’s 
strategic objectives. We will also continue to monitor and comply 
with relevant guidelines and regulatory changes.

T = Target E = Expectation
* These expectations are not disclosed as they are commercially sensitive.
Consistent with last year, the Board set expectations rather than targets for some metrics. This is because the timing of acquisitions 
and disposals is highly sensitive to market conditions, and a more prescriptive approach would run the risk of creating perverse 
incentives for executives. For example, to achieve a target level of realisations may result in the earlier sale of assets than would 
otherwise be appropriate, or to achieve a target level of investments may result in investing at inﬂated prices. Adjusting for the timing 
of the sale of the Debt Management business, the expectations the Board set for realisations and investment were met or exceeded  
in each case.
In light of the achievements detailed above, and the exceptional performance of the Group in the year, the Committee awarded 
Mr Borrows a bonus in respect of FY2017 of £2,283,800 (being 95% of his maximum bonus opportunity), and awarded Mrs Wilson 
a bonus in respect of FY2017 of £1,010,770 (being 92.5% of her maximum bonus opportunity). In each case, 20% of the award will be 
paid in cash immediately, 20% will be delivered as shares with a retention period of six months and the remaining 60% will be deferred 
into the Company’s shares vesting in equal instalments over four years. Annual bonus awards are subject to the malus/clawback policy. 
The differential between the Executive Directors’ bonus percentages reﬂects the wider contribution of Mr Borrows to strategic and 
investment outcomes. Audited ﬁnancial

Share Incentive Plan
During the year Mrs Wilson participated in the HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan which allowed employees to invest up to £150 per 
month from pre-tax salary in ordinary shares (“partnership shares”). For each partnership share, the Company grants two free ordinary 
shares (“matching shares”) which are normally forfeited if employment ceases within three years of grant. Dividends are reinvested in 
further ordinary shares (“dividend shares”).
During the year Mrs Wilson purchased 292 partnership shares, and received 584 matching shares and 564 dividend shares at prices 
ranging between £4.83 and £7 .26 per share, with an average price of £6.28.
Pension arrangements
Mr Borrows and Mrs Wilson receive pension beneﬁts on the same basis as other employees of the Company. During the year they 
received salary supplements in lieu of pension of £16k and £46k respectively.
Payments to past Directors
Mr Queen, who resigned as Chief Executive on 16 May 2012, retained interests in arrangements relating to his previous roles 
as Managing Partner, Infrastructure and Managing Partner, Growth Capital. During the year he received payments under those 
arrangements totalling £186k together with a return of a capital commitment of €89k. It is anticipated that he will receive a further 
payments during 2017 of £335k and €106k from these arrangements. 
Payments for loss of ofﬁce
No payments to Directors for loss of ofﬁce have been made in the year.
Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests
The Company’s share ownership and retention policy requires Executive Directors to build up over time, and thereafter maintain, 
a shareholding in the Company’s shares equivalent to at least 3.0 times gross salary in the case of the Chief Executive and 2.0 times 
gross salary for the Group Finance Director. In addition, shareholding targets have been introduced for other members of Executive 
Committee at the 1.5 times their gross salary levels and for partners in the Group’s businesses at 1.0 times their gross salaries.
Details of Directors’ interests (including interest of their connected persons) in the Company’s shares as at 31 March 2017 are shown 
below. The share price on 31 March 2017 was £7 .495.

Statement of implementation of the remuneration policy in the coming year
As explained in the statement by the Committee Chairman, we are seeking approval for a new remuneration policy at the 2017 AGM. 
The table below sets out how the Committee intends to operate the remuneration policy in FY2018, on the basis that it is approved 
by shareholders at the 2017 AGM. 
Policy element Implementation of policy during FY2018
Base salary A Group-wide 3% increase to salaries will take place in FY2018, which will also be applied to Executive Director 
salaries. Effective from 1 July 2017 , salaries for the Executive Directors will therefore be as follows:
• Chief Executive: £619,030 (+3%)
• Group Finance Director: £450,203 (+3%)
Pension No changes to the current arrangements are proposed for FY2018. The Executive Directors will continue to receive 
a pension contribution or salary supplement as follows:
• Chief Executive: £16k 
• Group Finance Director: 12% of salary
Beneﬁts No changes to the current arrangements are proposed for FY2018.
Beneﬁts will continue to include a car allowance, provision of health insurance and any Share Incentive Plan matching 
share awards.
Annual bonus The maximum annual bonus opportunities for FY2018 will remain unchanged, in line with the remuneration policy, 
as follows:
• Chief Executive: 400% of salary
• Group Finance Director: 250% of salary
Any bonus will be awarded based on a balanced scorecard of both ﬁnancial and strategic measures agreed by 
the Committee, alongside a consideration of the wider context of personal performance (including values and 
behaviours), risk, market and other factors.
Measures for the FY2018 scorecard are based 90% on ﬁnancial measures (50% portfolio return, 30% investment 
management and 10% operating performance) and 10% on strategic and people objectives. They are calibrated 
to current business strategy and will evolve year-on-year as the Group’s situation and priorities develop.
The Committee considers that the speciﬁc targets and expectations contained within the FY2018 scorecard are 
commercially sensitive and therefore will not be disclosed in advance. We will report to shareholders next year 
on performance and the resulting bonus outturns.
At least 50% of any bonus award will be deferred into shares vesting in equal instalments over four years.
Awards are subject to the Company’s malus and clawback policy.
Long-term incentive plan Awards under the long-term incentive plan in FY2018 will remain unchanged and be made as follows:
• Chief Executive: 400% of salary
• Group Finance Director: 250% of salary
Performance will be measured over a three-year period and will be determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
Performance measures remained unchanged from the previous year and will be as follows:
50% of the award is based on absolute TSR measured over the performance period, and vests:
• 0% vesting below 10% p.a. TSR;
• 20% vesting at 10% p.a. TSR;
• Straight-line vesting between 10% and 18% p.a. TSR; and
• 100% vesting at 18% p.a. TSR.
50% of the award is based on relative TSR measured against the FTSE 350 Index over the performance period, 
and vests:
• 0% for below median performance against the index;
• 25% for median performance against the index;
• 100% for upper quartile performance against the index; and
• Straight-line vesting between median and upper quartile performance.
Awards are subject to the Company’s malus and clawback policy.
Shareholding requirements Shareholding requirements will be as follows:
• Chief Executive: 300% of salary
• Group Finance Director: 200% of salary  Corporate Governance

Non-executive Director fees The fees for the Non-executive Directors for FY2018 will be:
Chairman fee:  £280,000 plus £30,000 in 3i shares
Non-executive Directors:
Board membership fee: £50,000 plus 3,000 3i shares

Committee chairman:  £20,000
Committee member: £8,000
Committee fees are payable in respect of the Audit and Compliance Committee, Remuneration Committee and 
Valuations Committee.
Malus and Clawback policy Long-term incentive awards and deferred bonus share awards made during the year to Executive Directors 
(and certain other Senior Executives), may be forfeited or reduced prior to vesting in exceptional circumstances 
on such basis as the Committee considers fair, reasonable and proportionate. This would include, but is not limited 
to, material misstatement of Group ﬁnancial statements, or cases where an individual is deemed to have caused 
a material loss for the Group as a result of reckless, negligent or wilful actions or inappropriate values or behaviour.
The Group may recover amounts that have been paid or released from awards (including cash bonus awards), as 
long as a written request for the recovery of such sums is made in the two-year period from the date of payment or 
release and in circumstances where either (a) there has been a material misstatement of Group ﬁnancial statements 
or (b) the Group suffers a material loss, and (in either case) the Committee considers that there is reasonable 
evidence to show that the misstatement or loss has been caused by the individual’s reckless, negligent or wilful 
actions or inappropriate values or behaviours.

Policy report
Remuneration policy table
The table below summarises the policy in respect of each element of the Company’s remuneration for Executive and non-executive 
Directors effective from the date of the 2017 Annual General Meeting. This policy will be put forward for shareholder approval at the 
2017 Annual General Meeting in accordance with section 439A of the Companies Act 2006.
This policy remains materially unchanged from the policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting. While the 
Committee will consider the appropriateness of the Remuneration policy annually to ensure it continues to align with the business 
strategy, there is no current intention to revise the policy more often than every three years, unless required to through changes 
to regulations or legislation.

to strategic objectives Operation Opportunity
Performance 
metrics
Base salary
• To provide a ﬁxed 
element of pay at 
a level that aids the 
recruitment, retention 
and motivation of high 
performing people.
• To reﬂect their 
role, experience 
and importance 
to the business.
• Salaries are normally reviewed annually 
by the Committee, with any changes 
usually becoming effective from 1 July.
• These are reviewed by taking into 
account a number of factors, including:
 – performance of the Company and 
individual;
 – wider market and economic 
conditions;
 – any changes in responsibilities; and
 – the level of increases made across 
the Company.
• Whilst there is no maximum salary level, 
increases are generally considered in 
the context of those awarded to other 
employees and the wider market.
• Higher increases may be awarded in 
exceptional circumstances. For example, 
this may include a change  
in size, scope or responsibility of role, or 
development within the role or a speciﬁc 
retention issue. 
• The annual base salary for each Executive 
Director is set out in the Annual report on 
Remuneration for the year.
• None, although the 
Committee considers 
when setting salary 
levels the breadth 
and responsibilities 
of the role as well 
as the competence 
and experience 
of the individual.
Pension
• To provide contributions 
to Executive Directors 
to enable them to 
make long-term 
savings to provide post-
retirement income.
• Pension contributions 
are provided to both 
support retention and 
recruit people of the 
necessary calibre.
• Participation in the deﬁned contribution 
pension scheme (3i Retirement Plan) or 
cash equivalent.
• Prior to 2011 Executive Directors were 
eligible for membership of the  
3i Group Pension Plan, a deﬁned beneﬁt 
contributory scheme. Pension accrual 
ceased for all members with effect from 
5 April 2011, although a link to ﬁnal salary 
is maintained for existing accrual up to 
the date of leaving the Company.
• Executive Directors receive a pension 
contribution or cash allowance of 
12% of pensionable salary.
• For those Executive Directors who were 
members of the 3i Group Pension Plan, 
their deferred pension will change to 
reﬂect the deferred pension available 
on leaving, payable from age 60. 
• Details for the current Executive 
Directors are set out in the Annual 
report of remuneration for the year.
• N/A
Beneﬁts
• To provide market 
competitive beneﬁts 
at the level needed to 
attract and retain high 
performing people.
• To provide health 
beneﬁts to support 
the well being 
of employees.
• Executive Directors are entitled to 
a combination of beneﬁts, including 
a non-pensionable car allowance, private 
medical insurance, an annual health 
assessment and life assurance.
• The Remuneration Committee may 
remove beneﬁts that Executive Directors 
receive or introduce other beneﬁts if it is 
appropriate to do so.
• Whilst there is no maximum level 
of beneﬁts, they are generally set at 
an appropriate market competitive 
level, taking into account a number of 
factors including market practice for 
comparable roles within appropriate 
pay comparators.
• The Remuneration Committee may 
review the beneﬁts for an existing or 
new Executive Director at any point.

Annual bonus
• To incentivise the 
achievement of the 
Group’s strategic 
objectives on an 
annual basis.
• Deferral into shares 
reinforces retention

by encouraging  
longer-term focus 
and risk alignment.
• Bonus awards are considered annually 
based on performance in the relevant 
ﬁnancial year.
• All performance targets are reviewed and 
set by the Committee early in the year.
• Awards are determined by the 
Committee after the year based 
upon the actual performance 
against these targets.
• No more than 50% of any bonus award 
is paid as cash.
• At least 50% of any bonus award will be 
deferred into shares vesting in equal 
instalments over four years.
• Deferred bonus awards may be granted 
in the form of conditional share awards, 
options or forfeitable shares. Awards 
may also be settled in cash.
• Participants receive the value of 
dividends in cash on the shares 
which are subject to the award. 
• Awards are subject to the malus/
clawback policy (as set out in the 
Notes on page 90).
• Maximum bonus of 400% of salary 
for the Chief Executive.
• Maximum bonus of 250% of salary 
for the Group Finance Director.
• Performance is assessed 
against a balanced 
scorecard which aligns 
with the strategic 
objectives of the Group. 
• The targets can be a range 
of ﬁnancial, business line 
speciﬁc, personal, risk and 
other key Group targets.
• The Committee uses the 
scorecard as a prompt 
and guide to judgement 
and considers the 
performance outcomes 
in the wider context of 
personal performance 
(including values and 
behaviours), risk, market 
and other factors.
• Details of the annual 
performance targets 
(and performance against 
targets) are shown 
within the Annual report 
of remuneration.
Long-term Incentive Plan
• Alignment of reward with 
long-term, sustainable 
Company performance 
and the creation of 
shareholder value 
over the longer-term.
• The combination of 
total shareholder return 
targets and strategic 
performance measures 
balance internal and 
external perspectives 
of performance, and 
align participants with 
shareholders’ interests.
• All performance targets, along with 
relative weightings, are reviewed 
and set by the Committee prior 
to awards being made.
• The Committee may make an award 
in the form of forfeitable shares, 
conditional share awards, stock 
appreciation rights, or options under 
the plan. Awards may be settled in cash.
• Award levels are determined by 
reference to individual performance 
prior to grant.
• Awards vest subject to the Group’s 
achievements against the performance 
targets over a ﬁxed three-year period.
• To the extent that shares vest, they 
are released 50% on or around (but 
not earlier than) the third anniversary 
of grant, and 25% on or around 
(but not earlier than) the fourth 
and ﬁfth anniversaries of grant.
• The Committee may determine that 
participants may receive the value 
of dividends in cash or shares which 
would have been paid on the shares 
that vest under awards. 
• Performance share awards are subject 
to the malus/clawback policy (as set out 
on the next page).
• Awards granted in respect of a ﬁnancial 
year will have a face value of up to 400% 
of salary for the Chief Executive.
• Awards granted in respect of a ﬁnancial 
year will have a face value of up to 250% 
of salary for the Group Finance Director.
• Normally, no payment will be made 
for below threshold performance. 
Between 20% and 25% of the award vests 
at threshold performance, depending 
upon the performance condition.
• The scorecard used 
to measure the 
performance links at least 
half of the award to total 
shareholder returns and 
the balance, if any, to 
strategic objectives set 
by the Board.
• The achievement 
against these targets 
is measured over 
a three-year period 
and is determined 
by the Committee.

Shareholding requirements
• To create alignment 
with shareholders 
by encouraging 
longer-term focus.
• Executive Directors are required to build 
up over a reasonable period of time, 
and thereafter maintain, a shareholding 
in the Company’s shares. Vested shares 
(net of income tax and National Insurance 
contributions) under the Deferred Bonus 
Plan and Long-term Incentive Plan 
should be retained until the shareholding 
requirement is met.
• In addition, shareholding targets 
exist for other members of the Executive 
Committee and for staff designated as 
“partners” in the Group’s businesses.
• The Committee retains the 
ability to introduce additional 
retention conditions.
• The shareholding targets for the 
Executive Directors are:
 – Chief Executive – 3.0 times salary
 – Group Finance Director – 2.0 times 
salary
• Executive Committee members have 
a target of 1.5 times salary and selected 
“partners” 1.0 times salary.

Notes to the Remuneration policy table
Performance conditions
The Committee selected the performance conditions used for determining the annual bonus and LTIP awards as they align directly 
with the short and long-term strategy of the business. These conditions are set annually by the Committee at levels that take into 
account the Board’s business plan.
Changes to the policy operated in FY2017
There have been no major changes to the remuneration policy from that which was applied during the year, other than an increase 
in the shareholding requirement of the Finance Director from 150% to 200% of base salary.
Consistency with policy for all employees
All employees are eligible to receive salary, pension contributions and beneﬁts and to be considered for a discretionary annual bonus, 
with the maximum opportunities reﬂecting the role and seniority of each employee. Other members of the Executive Committee 
are subject to the same bonus deferral arrangements as the Executive Directors. Higher-earning members of staff below Executive 
Committee have a portion of their bonus deferred into shares vesting in equal instalments over a three-year period.
Within each of the Group’s businesses, senior members of staff have a signiﬁcant part of their compensation linked to the long-term 
performance of the Group’s and its clients’ investments through carried interest schemes or similar arrangements. 
Co-investment and carried interest plans
Executive Directors, other than the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, are permitted to participate in carried interest plans 
and similar arrangements. This was approved by shareholders on 4 July 2001 and 6 July 2011 when approving the Group’s Long-term 
Incentive Plan. No current Executive Director beneﬁts from these arrangements.
Malus/Clawback policy
The Committee has agreed a policy, which applies to long-term incentive awards and deferred bonus share awards made during the 
year to Executive Directors (and certain other Senior Executives), under which awards may be forfeited or reduced prior to vesting in 
exceptional circumstances on such basis as the Committee considers fair, reasonable and proportionate. This would include, but is not 
limited to, material misstatement of Group ﬁnancial statements, or cases where an individual is deemed to have caused a material loss 
for the Group as a result of reckless, negligent or wilful actions or inappropriate values or behaviour.
The Group may recover amounts that have been paid or released from awards (including cash bonus awards), as long as a written 
request for the recovery of such sums is made in the two-year period from the date of payment or release and in circumstances where 
either (a) there has been a material misstatement of Group ﬁnancial statements or (b) the Group suffers a material loss, and (in either 
case) the Committee considers that there is reasonable evidence to show that the misstatement or loss has been caused by the 
individual’s reckless, negligent or wilful actions or inappropriate values or behaviours.
The Committee may make minor changes to this policy, which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid in its operation 
or implementation without seeking shareholder approval for a revised version of this Policy report.

Non-executive Directors – Fees
Purpose and link  
to strategy Operation Opportunity
• To attract and retain 
high performing 
non-executive Directors 
of the calibre required.
• Non-executive Directors receive a basic annual fee. 
• The fee is delivered in a mix of cash and shares.
• The Chairman’s fee is reviewed annually by 
the Committee.
• Fees are benchmarked against other companies 
of comparable size and against listed ﬁnancial 
services companies.
• The Board is responsible for determining all other 
non-executive Director fees, which are reviewed 
annually to ensure they remain appropriate.
• Fees are set at a level which is considered appropriate 
to attract and retain the calibre of individual required 
by the Company but the Company avoids paying more 
than necessary for this purpose. 
• Additional fees are paid for the following  
roles/duties:
 – Senior Independent Director
 – Committee Chairman
 – Committee membership
• Committee fees are payable in respect of the Audit 
and Compliance Committee, Remuneration Committee 
and Valuations Committee.
Recruitment policy
In determining remuneration arrangements for new executive appointments to the Board (including internal promotions), the 
Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors, including the calibre of the individual, the nature of the role, local market 
practice, the individual’s current remuneration package, 3i remuneration policy, internal relativities and existing arrangements for 
other Executive Directors. For external appointments, some variation may be necessary in order to attract the successful candidate 
and to reﬂect particular skills or experience speciﬁcally required.
The maximum level of variable pay (as expressed as a multiple of base salary) which may be awarded to new Executive Directors in 
respect of their appointment shall be no more generous than the combined maximum limits expressed in the Remuneration policy 
table above in respect of the Chief Executive, with an appropriate mix between annual bonus and LTIP opportunity, excluding any 
awards made to compensate the Executive Director for awards forfeited by their previous employer.
It may be necessary to compensate the new Executive Director for variable pay being forfeited from their current employer. 
The Committee’s intention is that any such award would be no more generous than the awards being forfeited and would 
be determined on a comparable basis at the time of grant, including the pay out schedule and performance conditions, 
where appropriate.
In determining whether it is appropriate to use such judgement, the Committee will ensure that any awards made are in the best 
interests of both the Company and its shareholders. The Committee is at all times conscious of the need to pay no more than 
is necessary, particularly when determining buy out arrangements.
For both internal and external appointments, it may be deemed appropriate to buy out awards held in carried interest or other 
asset-related incentive arrangements. The Committee’s intention is that any such buy out would be at a fair value at the time 
of appointment. 
In the event of the appointment of a new non-executive Director, remuneration arrangements will normally be in line with those 
detailed in the relevant table above. Corporate Governance
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 92
Service contracts
The main terms of the service contracts of the Executive Directors who served in the year were as follows:
Provision Policy
Notice period • 12 months’ notice if given by the Company
• 6 months’ notice if given by the Executive Director
• Company policy is that Executive Directors’ notice periods should not normally exceed one year.  
Save for these notice periods the contracts have no unexpired terms.
Dates of contracts • Mr S A Borrows – 17 May 2012
• Mrs J S Wilson – 1 October 2008
Termination payments • Mr Borrows’ contract entitles the Company to terminate employment without notice subject to making 12 monthly  
payments thereafter equivalent to monthly basic pay and beneﬁts less any amounts earned from alternative employment.
• All Directors’ contracts entitle the Company to give pay in lieu of notice.
Remuneration 
and beneﬁts
• The operation of all incentive plans, including being eligible to be considered for an annual bonus and Long-term 
Incentive Plan awards, is non-contractual.
• On termination of employment outstanding awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules.
The Chairman and the non-executive Directors do not have service contracts or contracts for services. Their appointment letters 
provide for no entitlement to compensation or other beneﬁts on ceasing to be a Director. Service contracts are available for inspection 
at the Company’s headquarters in business hours.
Payment for loss of ofﬁce
As outlined above, the Committee must satisfy any contractual obligations agreed with the Executive Directors. Details of the 
Directors’ notice periods are shown alongside the service contract information. 
An Executive Director may be eligible to receive a time pro-rated annual bonus in respect of the year up until he or she ceased 
employment. In determining whether to award any bonus, the Committee will assess performance during the ﬁnancial year 
up to the date of cessation of active involvement in their management role. 
The treatment of outstanding share awards is governed by the relevant share plan rules. The following table and the note below 
it summarise the leaver categories and the impact on the share awards which employees (including Executive Directors) may hold.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of ofﬁce 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above, where the terms of that payment were agreed (i) before the 
2014 policy came into effect or (ii) before this policy came into effect, provided that the terms of payment were consistent with 
the shareholder approved Directors’ remuneration policy in force at the time they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when the relevant 
individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the 
individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes “payments” includes the Committee satisfying awards of 
variable remuneration and, in relation to an award or option over shares, the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time the 
award is granted.

Awards normally lapse in full.
If the Committee decides in 
exceptional circumstances 
that the awards should vest

may be imposed.
1  The treatments set out in the table above apply to all employees and are expected to operate in the vast majority of cases. The Plan rules retain discretion for the Committee to reduce 
awards in exceptional circumstances to Good Leavers or permit vesting (in whole or in part) of awards which would otherwise lapse to Bad Leavers. The Committee will report on the use 
of this discretion if it is exercised in relation to any Executive Director.
Change of control
If there is a takeover or winding up of the Company, awards will vest to the extent determined by the Committee.

The assumptions made in preparing these graphs are that:
• Minimum – this includes only the ﬁxed elements of pay, 
being base salary, beneﬁts and pension;
• Actual – this represents the remuneration received by each 
Executive Director for their performance in the year;
• Maximum – this is calculated as the ﬁxed elements and the 
maximum Annual Bonus and Long-term Incentive Plan awards; 
and
• Remuneration arising as a result of share price movements or 
rights to dividends and other distributions have been excluded.
Consideration of wider employee pay
As part of the annual Committee agenda, the Committee reviews 
the overall pay and bonus decisions in aggregate for the Group. 
This ensures that the pay and conditions in the wider Group are 
taken into account when determining Directors’ pay. In particular:
• Salary increases awarded over time to other employees are 
taken into account when considering salary increases for the 
Executive Directors; and
• The bonus awards made to Directors are considered and made 
in the context of discretionary bonus awards made within the 
business. These are based upon Company performance, and 
are closely correlated to the Executive Director bonus awards.
The Company does not consult with employees when preparing 
the Executive Director remuneration policy. However, a number 
of our employees are shareholders and so are able to express 
their views in the same way as other shareholders.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee has remained engaged with shareholders 
during the period since 2014, and will continue to be 
mindful of shareholder views when evaluating and setting 
ongoing remuneration strategy, and commits to consulting 
with shareholders prior to any signiﬁcant changes to 
remuneration policy.

This section of the Directors’ report

Corporate governance
Throughout the year, the Company complied with the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) published 
by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2014 and which 
is available on the FRC website.
The Group’s internal control and risk management systems 
including those in relation to the ﬁnancial reporting process  
are described on page 66.
Details on the appointment and replacement of Directors are 
set out on page 64.
The Board’s responsibilities and processes
The composition of the Board and its Committees as well as 
the Board’s key responsibilities and the way in which it and its 
Committees work are described on pages 60 to 66. The Board is 
responsible to shareholders for the overall management of the 
Group and may exercise all the powers of the Company subject 
to the provisions of relevant statutes, the Company’s Articles of 
Association and any directions given by special resolution of the 
shareholders. The Articles of Association empower the Board to 
offer, allot, grant options over or otherwise deal with or dispose of 
the Company’s shares as the Board may decide. The Companies 
Act 2006 authorises the Company to make market purchases 
of its own shares if the purchase has ﬁrst been authorised by a 
resolution of the Company.
At the AGM in June 2016, shareholders renewed the Board’s 
authority to allot ordinary shares and to repurchase ordinary 
shares on behalf of the Company subject to certain limits. 
Details of the authorities which the Board will be seeking  
at the 2017 AGM are set out in the 2017 Notice of AGM.
Matters reserved for the Board
The Board has approved a formal schedule of matters reserved to 
it and its duly authorised Committees for decision. These include 
matters such as the Group’s overall strategy, strategic plan 
and annual operating budget; approval of the Company’s 
ﬁnancial statements and changes to accounting policies or 
practices; changes to the capital structure or regulated status 
of the Company; major capital projects or changes to business 
operations; investments and divestments above certain limits; 
policy on borrowing, gearing, hedging and treasury matters; 
and adequacy of internal control systems.
Investment policy
The current investment policy is set out below.
• 3i is an investment company which aims to provide its 
shareholders with quoted access to private equity and 
infrastructure returns. Currently, its main focus is on making 
quoted and unquoted equity and/or debt investments in 
businesses and funds in Europe, Asia and the Americas. 
The geographies, economic sectors, funds and asset classes 
in which 3i invests continue to evolve as opportunities are 
identiﬁed. Proposed investments are assessed individually 
and all signiﬁcant investments require approval from the 
Group’s Investment Committee. Overall investment targets 
are subject to periodic reviews and the investment portfolio 
is also reviewed to monitor exposure to speciﬁc geographies, 
economic sectors and asset classes.
• 3i seeks to diversify risk through signiﬁcant dispersion 
of investments by geography, economic sector, asset 
class and size as well as through the maturity proﬁle 
of its investment portfolio.
• Although 3i does not set maximum exposure limits for asset 
allocations, it does have a maximum exposure limit that, 
save as mentioned below, no investment will be made unless 
its cost does not exceed 15% of the investment portfolio 
value as shown in the last published valuation. A further 
investment may be made in an existing investee company 
provided the aggregate cost of that investment and of 
all other investments in that investee company does not 
exceed 15% of the investment portfolio value as shown in 
the last published valuation. A higher limit of 30% will apply 
to the Company’s investment in 3i Infrastructure plc. For the 
avoidance of doubt, 3i may retain an investment even if its 
carrying value is greater than 15% or 30% (as the case may be) 
of the portfolio value at the time of an updated valuation. 
• Investments are generally funded with a mixture of debt and 
shareholders’ funds with a view to maximising returns  
to shareholders, whilst maintaining a strong capital base.  
3i’s gearing depends not only on its level of debt, but also  
on the impact of market movements and other factors on the 
value of its investments. The Board takes this into account 
when, as required, it sets a precise maximum level of gearing. 
The Board has therefore set the maximum level of gearing at 
150% and has set no minimum level of gearing. If the gearing 
ratio should exceed the 150% maximum limit, the Board will 
take steps to reduce the gearing ratio to below that limit as 
soon as practicable thereafter. 3i is committed to achieving 
balance sheet efﬁciency.
Additional statutory and 
corporate governance information Corporate Governance
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 96
Additional statutory and 
corporate governance information
continued
The UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules require 3i, as a 
closed-ended investment fund, to publish an investment policy. 
Shareholder approval is required for material changes to this 
policy. Non-material changes can be made by the Board. 
Since publication of the Annual report and accounts 2016 the 
Board has made one non-material change to the ﬁrst sentence 
of the policy by deleting reference to debt management returns. 
This sentence previously referred to 3i providing “its shareholders 
with quoted access to private equity, infrastructure, and debt 
management returns.” This change reﬂects the sale during the 
year of the Group’s debt management business. 
Rights and restrictions attaching to shares
A summary of the rights and restrictions attaching to shares 
as at 31 March 2017 is set out below.
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by 
special resolution of the shareholders in a general meeting. 
Holders of ordinary shares enjoy the rights set out in the Articles 
of Association of the Company and under the laws of England 
and Wales. Any share may be issued with or have attached 
to it such rights and restrictions as the Company by ordinary 
resolution or, failing such resolution, the Board may decide.
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend, speak and 
vote at general meetings and to appoint proxies and, in the 
case of corporations, corporate representatives to attend, speak 
and vote at such meetings on their behalf. To attend and vote 
at a general meeting a shareholder must be entered on the 
register of members at such time (not being earlier than 48 hours 
before the meeting) as stated in the Notice of general meeting. 
On a poll, holders of ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for 
each share held. 
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s 
Annual report and accounts, to receive such dividends and other 
distributions as may lawfully be paid or declared on such shares 
and, on any liquidation of the Company, to share in the surplus 
assets of the Company after satisfaction of the entitlements of 
the holders of any shares with preferred rights as may then be 
in issue.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of fully paid shares in the 
Company, save as follows. The Board may decline to register: 
a transfer of uncertiﬁcated shares in the circumstances set out 
in the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001; a transfer to 
more than four joint holders; a transfer of certiﬁcated shares 
which is not in respect of only one class of share; a transfer which 
is not accompanied by the certiﬁcate for the shares to which it 
relates; a transfer which is not duly stamped in circumstances 
where a duly stamped instrument is required; or a transfer 
where in accordance with section 794 of the Companies Act 
2006 a notice (under section 793 of that Act) has been served 
by the Company on a shareholder who has then failed to give 
the information required within the speciﬁed time. In the latter 
circumstances the Company may make the relevant shares 
subject to certain restrictions (including in respect of the ability 
to exercise voting rights, to transfer the shares validly and, except 
in the case of a liquidation, to receive the payment of sums due 
from the Company). 
There are no shares carrying special rights with regard to 
control of the Company. There are no restrictions placed on 
voting rights of fully paid shares, save where in accordance with 
Article 12 of the Company’s Articles of Association a restriction 
notice has been served by the Company in respect of shares 
for failure to comply with statutory notices or where a transfer 
notice (as described below) has been served in respect of shares 
and has not yet been complied with. Where shares are held on 
behalf of former or current employees under employee share 
schemes, those participants can give instructions to the holder 
of such shares as to how votes attached to such shares should 
be exercised.
In the circumstances speciﬁed in Article 38 of the Company’s 
Articles of Association the Company may serve a transfer notice 
on holders of shares. The relevant circumstances relate to:  
(a) potential tax disadvantage to the Company, (b) the number 
of “United States Residents” who own or hold shares being 75 
or more, or (c) the Company being required to be registered 
as an investment company under relevant US legislation. 
The notice would require the transfer of relevant shares and 
pending such transfer the rights and privileges attaching to 
those shares would be suspended. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders 
of its securities that may restrict the transfer of shares or exercise 
of voting rights. 
Major interests in ordinary shares 
Notiﬁcations of the following major voting interests in the 
Company’s ordinary share capital (notiﬁable in accordance with 
Chapter 5 of the FCA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules or 
section 793 Companies Act 2006) had been received by the 
Company as at 31 March 2017 and 1 May 2017 .

until the Company’s AGM in 2017 or 29 September 2017 , 
if earlier. This authority was not exercised in the year. Details  
of the authorities which the Board will be seeking at the 2017 
AGM are set out in the 2017 Notice of AGM.
As detailed in Note 16 to the Accounts, as at 31 March 2016 
the Company had in issue Notes issued under the 3i Group plc 
£2,000 million Note Issuance Programme.
The Articles of Association also speciﬁcally empower the Board 
to exercise the Company’s powers to borrow money and to 
mortgage or charge the Company’s assets and any uncalled 
capital and to issue debentures and other securities.
Portfolio management and voting policy 
In relation to unquoted investments, the Group’s approach 
is to seek to add value to the businesses in which the Group 
invests through the Group’s extensive experience, resources 
and contacts and through active engagement with the Boards 
of those companies. In relation to quoted investments, the 
Group’s policy is to exercise voting rights on all matters affecting 
its interests. 
Tax and investment company status
The Company is an investment company under section 833 of 
the Companies Act 2006. HM Revenue & Customs has approved 
the Company as an Investment Trust under section 1158 of the 
Corporation Tax Act 2010 and the Company directs its affairs  
to enable it to continue to remain so approved.
3i Investments plc
3i Investments plc acts as investment manager to the Company 
and certain of its subsidiaries. Contracts for these investment 
management and other services, for which regulatory authorisation 
is required, provide for fees based on the work done and costs 
incurred in providing such services. These contracts may be 
terminated by either party on reasonable notice.
3i Investments plc also acts as investment adviser to 
3i Infrastructure plc under a contract which provides for the 
services to be provided and the related fees which are payable. 
3i Investments plc is authorised by the FCA to, among other 
things, manage Alternative Investment Funds (“AIFs”). It is 
currently the Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”) 
of ﬁve AIFs. In compliance with regulatory requirements, 
3i Investments plc has ensured that a depository has been 
appointed for each AIF. This is Citibank Europe plc, UK Branch. 
The Annual report and accounts meet the investor disclosure 
requirements as set out in FUND 3.2.2R, 3.2.3R, 3.2.5R and 3.2.6R 
of the FCA’s Investment Funds sourcebook for 3i Group plc as 
a standalone entity. The Company’s proﬁt for the year is stated 
in its Statement of changes in equity and its Financial position 
is shown on page 105. The Company performs substantially all 
of its investment related activities through its subsidiaries and 
therefore the Group’s Consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income is considered to be more useful to investors than a 
Company statement.
Furthermore, in some instances the relevant FUND disclosures 
have been made in relation to the Group on a consolidated basis 
rather than in respect of 3i Group plc as a standalone entity. 
This is because 3i Group plc, as a standalone entity, operates 
through its group subsidiaries and therefore reporting on the 
Group’s activities provides more relevant information on the 
Company and its position. There have been no material changes 
to the Company’s operations in the past year. 
Although the disclosures required by FUND 3.2.2R, 3.2.3R, 
3.2.5R and 3.2.6R of the FCA’s Investment Funds sourcebook 
are covered in this Annual report they are also, for convenience, 
summarised on the 3i website at www.3i.com. This will be 
updated as required and changes noted in future Annual reports.
The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive requires 
3i to comply with certain reporting obligations. A summary 
of the remuneration policy of 3i can be found on the 
Company’s website.
The total amount of remuneration paid by 3i to its staff for the 
year was £88 million, of which £41 million was ﬁxed remuneration 
and £47 million was variable remuneration. The aggregate total 
remuneration paid to AIFM Identiﬁed Staff for the year was 
£23 million, of which £22 million was paid to Senior Management 
and £1 million was paid to other AIFM Identiﬁed Staff.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 8.0 pence per ordinary share in respect 
of the year to 31 March 2017 was paid on 4 January 2017 . 
The Directors recommend a ﬁnal dividend of 18.5 pence 
(comprising a base dividend of 8.0 pence and an additional 
dividend of 10.5 pence) per ordinary share be paid in respect 
of the year to 31 March 2017 to shareholders on the Register 
at the close of business on 16 June 2017 .
The trustee of The 3i Group Employee Trust (“the Employee 
Trust”) has waived (subject to certain minor exceptions) dividends 
declared on shares in the Company held by the Employee Trust 
and the Trustee of The 3i Group Share Incentive Plan has waived 
dividends on unallocated shares in the Company held by it.
Directors’ conﬂicts of interests 
and Directors’ indemnities 
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid conﬂicts of interest with 
the Company. The Company’s Articles of Association enable 
Directors to approve conﬂicts of interest and include other 
conﬂict of interest provisions. The Company has implemented 
processes to identify potential and actual conﬂicts of interest. 
Such conﬂicts are then considered for approval by the Board, 
subject, if necessary, to appropriate conditions. 
As permitted by the Company’s Articles of Association during 
the year and as at the date of this Directors’ report, there were 
in place Qualifying Third-Party Indemnity Provisions (as deﬁned 
under relevant legislation) for the beneﬁt of the Company’s 
Directors and for the beneﬁt of directors of one associated 
company and Qualifying Pension Scheme Indemnity Provisions 
for the beneﬁt of the directors of one associated company.  Corporate Governance

Directors’ employment contracts
Mr S A Borrows and Mrs J S Wilson each have employment 
contracts with the Group with notice periods of 12 months where 
notice is given by the Group and six months where notice is given 
by the Director. Save for these notice periods their employment 
contracts have no unexpired terms. None of the other Directors 
has a service contract with the Company.
Employment 
The employment policy of the Group is one of equal opportunity 
in the selection, training, career development and promotion of 
employees, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic 
origin, religion and whether disabled or otherwise.
3i treats applicants and employees with disabilities fairly and 
provides facilities, equipment and training to assist disabled 
employees to do their jobs. Arrangements are made as necessary 
to ensure support to job applicants who happen to be disabled 
and who respond to requests to inform the Company of any 
requirements. Should an employee become disabled during 
their employment, efforts would be made to retain them in their 
current employment or to explore the opportunities for their 
retraining or redeployment within 3i. Financial support is also 
provided by 3i to support disabled employees who are unable 
to work, as appropriate to local market conditions. 
3i’s principal means of keeping in touch with the views of 
its employees is through employee appraisals, informal 
consultations, team brieﬁngs and staff conferences. 
Managers throughout 3i have a continuing responsibility to 
keep their staff informed of developments and to communicate 
ﬁnancial results and other matters of interest. This is achieved 
by structured communication including regular meetings 
of employees. 
3i is an equal opportunities employer and has clear grievance 
and disciplinary procedures in place. 3i also has an employee 
assistance programme which provides a conﬁdential, free and 
independent counselling service and is available to all UK staff 
and their families in the UK. 
3i’s employment policies are designed to provide a competitive 
reward package which will attract and retain high quality 
staff, whilst ensuring that the relevant costs remain at an 
appropriate level. 
3i’s remuneration policy is inﬂuenced by 3i’s ﬁnancial and other 
performance conditions and market practices in the countries 
in which it operates. All employees receive a base salary and 
are also eligible to be considered for a performance-related 
annual variable incentive award. For those members of staff 
receiving higher levels of annual variable incentive awards, a 
proportion of such awards is delivered in 3i shares, vesting over 
a number of years. Remuneration policy is reviewed by the 3i 
Group plc Remuneration Committee, comprising 3i Group plc 
non-executive Directors.
Where appropriate, employees are eligible to participate in  
3i share schemes to encourage employees’ involvement in 3i’s 
performance. Investment executives in the Private Equity business 
line may also participate in carried interest schemes, which allow 
executives to share directly in future proﬁts on investments. 
Similarly, investment executives in the Infrastructure business 
lines may participate in asset-linked and/or fee-linked incentive 
arrangements. Employees participate in local state or company 
pension schemes as appropriate to local market conditions. 
Political donations 
In line with Group policy, during the year to 31 March 2017 no 
donations were made to political parties or organisations, or 
independent election candidates, and no political expenditure 
was incurred.
Signiﬁcant agreements 
As at 31 March 2017 , the Company was party to one agreement 
subject to a renegotiation period on a change of control of 
the Company following a takeover bid. This agreement is a 
£329 million multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility Agreement 
dated 5 September 2014, between the Company, Barclays Bank 
PLC and a number of other banks. The Company is required to 
notify Barclays Bank PLC, as agent bank, within ﬁve days, of a 
change of control. This opens a 20-day negotiation period to 
determine if the Majority Lenders (as deﬁned in the agreement) 
are willing to continue the facility. Failing agreement, amounts 
outstanding would be repayable and the facility cancelled.
Going concern
The Directors have acknowledged their responsibilities in relation 
to the ﬁnancial statements for the year to 31 March 2017 .
After making enquiries, the Directors considered it appropriate to 
prepare the ﬁnancial statements of the Company, and the Group, 
on a going concern basis. 
Audit information
Pursuant to section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006, each 
of the Directors conﬁrms that:
(a) so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware; and
(b) they have taken all steps they ought to have taken to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s Auditor is aware of 
such information.
Appointment of Auditor
In accordance with section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, 
a resolution proposing the reappointment of Ernst & Young 
LLP as the Company’s Auditor will be put to members at the 
forthcoming AGM. Audited ﬁnancial

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report 
and accounts in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law 
and those International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”)

Under Company Law the Directors must not approve the Group 
ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they present 
fairly the ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows 
of the Group for that period. The Directors consider that this 
Annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for

International Accounting Standard 8: Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then apply 
them consistently;
(b) present information, including accounting policies,  
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable  
and understandable information; 
(c) provide additional disclosures when compliance with

insufﬁcient to enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s ﬁnancial 
position and ﬁnancial performance; 
(d) state that the Group has complied with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the ﬁnancial statements; and 
(e) make judgements and estimates that are reasonable.
The Directors have a responsibility for ensuring that proper 
accounting records are kept which are sufﬁcient to show and 
explain the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the Group ﬁnancial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
In accordance with the FCA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules, 
the Directors conﬁrm to the best of their knowledge that: 
(a) the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with 
applicable accounting standards, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and 
(b) the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

3i Group plc is registered in England with company 
number 1142830.

  Audited ﬁnancial statements
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 108
Reporting entity
3i Group plc (the “Company”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The Consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements (“the Group accounts”) for the year to 31 March 2017 comprise the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and  
its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, “the Group”). 
The Group accounts have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with section 395 of the Companies Act 
2006 and the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The Company has taken 
advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its Company statement of comprehensive 
income and related Notes. 
A number of accounting policies are disclosed below, but where possible, they have been shown as part of the Note to which they 
speciﬁcally relate in order to assist the reader’s understanding. 
A Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
The Group and Company accounts have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with all relevant IFRSs as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, endorsed 
by the European Union (“EU”). 
The following standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued with implementation dates, subject to EU endorsement  
in some cases, which do not impact on these ﬁnancial statements:
Effective for annual periods beginning on or after
IAS 7 Disclosure initiative (amendments to IAS 7 – Statement of Cash Flows) 1 January 2017
IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
The impact of future standards and amendments on the ﬁnancial statements is being assessed by the Group and the Company. 
The Group does not anticipate that IFRS 9 and IFRS 16 will have a material impact on its results. The detailed assessment of the extent 
to which IFRS 15 may affect the carried interest receivable recognition in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements is ongoing.
B Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as disclosed in the Directors’ report and presented to the 
nearest million.
C Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control, as deﬁned by IFRS 10, is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, 
to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group effectively obtains control. They are de-consolidated from the 
date that control ceases. 
3i Group plc is an investment entity and, as such, does not consolidate the investment entities it controls. Most of the Group’s interests 
in subsidiaries are recognised at fair value through proﬁt or loss. Those subsidiaries which provide investment related services, such as 
advisory, management or employment services, are not classiﬁed at fair value through proﬁt and loss and continue to be consolidated 
unless they are deemed investment entities, in which case they are fair valued. 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. Under the acquisition method of 
accounting, with some limited exceptions, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair 
values at the date of acquisition. Any non-controlling interest is measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportion of the net assets acquired. Acquisition related costs are accounted for as expenses when incurred. Any excess of the cost 
of acquisition over net assets is capitalised as goodwill. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated 
upon consolidation.

(ii) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but not control, over the ﬁnancial and operating policies. 
Investments that are held as part of the Group’s investment portfolio are carried in the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position 
at fair value even though the Group may have signiﬁcant inﬂuence over those companies. 
(iii) Composition of the Group
The Group comprises several different types of subsidiaries. The Group re-assesses the function performed by each type of subsidiary 
to determine its treatment under the IFRS 10 exception from consolidation on an annual basis. The types of subsidiaries and their 
treatment under IFRS 10 are as follows:
General Partners (GPs) – Consolidated
General Partners provide investment management services and do not hold any direct investments in portfolio assets. These entities 
are not investment entities. 
Investment managers/advisers – Consolidated
These entities provide investment related services through the provision of investment management or advice. They do not hold any 
direct investments in portfolio assets. These entities are not investment entities. 
Holding companies of investment managers/advisers – Consolidated
These entities provide investment related services through their subsidiaries. Typically they do not hold any direct investment 
in portfolio assets and these entities are not investment entities. 
Limited Partnerships and other intermediate investment holding structures – Fair valued 
The Group makes investments in portfolio assets through its ultimate parent company as well as through other limited partnerships 
and corporate subsidiaries which the Group has created to align the interests of the investment teams with the performance of the 
assets through the use of various carried interest schemes. The purpose of these limited partnerships and corporate holding vehicles, 
many of which also provide investment related services, is to invest for investment income and capital appreciation. These partnerships 
meet the deﬁnition of an investment entity and are classiﬁed at fair value through proﬁt and loss.
Portfolio investments – Fair valued
Under IFRS 10, the test for accounting subsidiaries takes wider factors of control as well as actual equity ownership into account. 
In accordance with the investment entity exception, these entities have been held at fair value with movements in fair value being 
recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Structured entities – Fair valued
The Group has retained interests in a number of unconsolidated structured entities, being CLO equity investments, and their current 
carrying value and a description is included in Note 29. 
D Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The reported results of the Group are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation 
of its ﬁnancial statements. UK company law and IFRS require the Directors, in preparing the Group’s ﬁnancial statements, to select 
suitable accounting policies, apply them consistently and make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent. 
The Group’s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and expectation of future events and are reviewed 
periodically. The actual outcome may be materially different from that anticipated. 
The judgements, assumptions and estimates involved in the Group’s accounting policies that are considered by the Board  
to be the most important to the portrayal of its ﬁnancial condition are the following:
(a) The fair valuation of the investment portfolio
The investment portfolio is held at fair value. Given the importance of this area, the Board has a separate Valuations Committee to 
review the valuations policies, process and application to individual investments. A report on the activities of the Valuations Committee 
is included in the Governance section of the Annual report.  Audited ﬁnancial statements
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 110
(b) Assessment as an investment entity
Entities that meet the deﬁnition of an investment entity within IFRS 10 are required to account for most investments in controlled 
entities, as well as investments in associates and joint ventures, at fair value through proﬁt and loss.
The Board has concluded that the Company continues to meet the deﬁnition of an investment entity as its strategic objective 
of investing in portfolio investments and providing investment management services to investors for the purpose of generating 
returns in the form of investment income and capital appreciation remains unchanged. 
The Group is required to determine the degree of control or inﬂuence the Group exercises and the form of any control to ensure  
that the ﬁnancial treatment is accurate. Further detail on our review of our application of IFRS 10 can be found in the Reconciliation  
of Investment basis to IFRS section. 
(c) Valuation of the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
The Group also considers the valuation of the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes in accordance with IAS 19 to be a signiﬁcant estimate. 
The Group reviews its assumptions annually with its independent actuaries. 
E Other accounting policies 
(a) Revenue recognition
Gross investment return is equivalent to “revenue” for the purposes of IAS 1. It represents the overall increase in net assets from 
the investment portfolio net of deal-related costs and includes foreign exchange movements in respect of the investment portfolio. 
Investment income is analysed into the following components:
I.  Realised proﬁts or losses over value on the disposal of investments are the difference between the fair value of the consideration 
received less any directly attributable costs, on the sale of equity and the repayment of interest income from investment portfolio, 
and its carrying value at the start of the accounting period, converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date 
of disposal.
II.  Unrealised proﬁts or losses on the revaluation of investments are the movement in the fair value of investments between the start 
and end of the accounting period converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date of fair value assessment.
III.  Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries are the movements in the fair value of Group subsidiaries which are 
classiﬁed as investment entities under IFRS 10. The Group makes investments in portfolio assets through these entities which  
are usually limited partnerships or corporate subsidiaries. 
IV.  Portfolio income is that portion of income that is directly related to the return from individual investments. It is recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that there will be economic beneﬁt and the income can be reliably measured. The following speciﬁc 
recognition criteria in accordance with IAS 18 must be met before the income is recognised:
• Dividends from equity investments are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income when the 
shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. Income received on the investment in the most junior ranked 
level of CLO capital is recognised as a dividend. £26 million was received in the year (2016: £31 million) from continuing and 
discontinued operations. 
• Interest income from investment portfolio is recognised as it accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective 
interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash ﬂows through the expected life of the 
ﬁnancial asset to the asset’s carrying value. When the fair value of an investment is assessed to be below the principal value of 
a loan the Group recognises a provision against any interest accrued from the date of the assessment going forward until the 
investment is assessed to have recovered in value. Income received on the instruments in the most junior level of CLO capital 
is recognised as a dividend as detailed above. £26 million was received in the year (2016: £31 million) from continuing and 
discontinued operations.
• Fee income is earned directly from investee companies when an investment is ﬁrst made and through the life of the investment. 
Fees that are earned on a ﬁnancing arrangement are considered to relate to a ﬁnancial asset measured at fair value through proﬁt 
or loss and are recognised when that investment is made. Fees that are earned on the basis of providing an ongoing service to 
the investee company are recognised as that service is provided.
V.  Foreign exchange on investments arises on investments made in currencies that are different from the functional currency of the 
Group entity. Investments are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. At each subsequent reporting 
date investments are translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.

presentational currency, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the closing 
rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange 
over the year and exchange differences arising are taken to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The statements of ﬁnancial position of subsidiaries and associates denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling 
at the closing rates. The statements of comprehensive income for these subsidiaries and associates are translated at the average 
rates and exchange differences arising are taken to other comprehensive income. Such exchange differences are reclassiﬁed to the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the subsidiary or associate is disposed of.
Exchange movements in relation to forward foreign exchange contracts are included within exchange movements in the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, where appropriate. No forward foreign exchange contracts were held in the current year and 
in 2016 a £14 million loss was recognised in exchange movements.
(c) Treasury assets and liabilities 
Short-term treasury assets and short and long-term treasury liabilities are used in order to manage cash ﬂows and minimise the overall 
costs of borrowing. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, short-term deposits and amounts held in money market funds, which are readily 
convertible into cash and there is an insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value. Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the balance 
sheet when the relevant Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. De-recognition occurs when 
rights to cash ﬂows from a ﬁnancial asset expire, or when a liability is extinguished. Audited ﬁnancial statements

Operating segments are the components of the Group whose results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision 
maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. 
The Chief Executive, who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker, managed the Group on the basis of business 
divisions determined with reference to market focus, geographic focus, investment funding model and the Group’s management 
hierarchy. A description of the activities, including products and services offered by these divisions and the allocation of resources,  
is given in the Strategic report. For the geographical segmental split, revenue information is based on the locations of the assets held.
The segmental information that follows is presented on the basis used by the Chief Executive to monitor the performance of the 
Group. The reported segments are Private Equity, Infrastructure and other, where other comprises the residual investments retained 
following the sale of our Debt Management business.

7 Income taxes
Accounting policy: 
Income taxes represent the sum of the tax currently payable, withholding taxes suffered and deferred tax. Tax is charged or 
credited in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly  
to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt within equity.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable proﬁt for the year. This may differ from the proﬁt included in the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years 
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
To enable the tax charge to be based on the proﬁt for the year, deferred tax is provided in full on temporary timing differences, 
at the rates of tax expected to apply when these differences crystallise. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available against which temporary differences can be set off. All deferred tax 
liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets, where appropriate, in accordance with the provisions of IAS 12.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
The main rate of UK corporation tax is to be reduced from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 , and further to 17% from 1 April 2020.  
These changes will affect future UK corporate taxes payable and the rate at which deferred tax assets are expected to reverse.

Excess unutilised tax losses arising in the period 6 5
Total income tax (credit)/charge in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income (3) 2
The affairs of the Group’s parent company are directed so as to allow it to meet the requisite conditions to continue to operate as an 
approved investment trust company for UK tax purposes. An approved investment trust company is a UK investment company which 
is required to meet certain conditions set out in the UK tax rules to obtain and maintain its tax status. This approval allows certain 
investment proﬁts of the Company, broadly its capital proﬁts, to be exempt from tax in the UK. Approved investment trust companies 
are particularly suited for investment vehicles as their tax status allows them to ensure that their shareholders do not suffer double 
taxation of their returns. 
Including a net tax charge of nil (2016: £2 million credit) in the fair valued entities, the Group recognised a total tax credit of £3 million 
(2016: nil) under the Investment basis.

At 31 March 2017 , the Group had carried forward tax losses of £1,390 million (31 March 2016: £1,375 million), capital losses of £93 million 
(31 March 2016: £88 million) and other temporary differences of £94 million (31 March 2016: £69 million). It is uncertain that the Group 
will generate sufﬁcient or relevant taxable proﬁts in the foreseeable future to utilise these amounts and therefore no deferred tax asset 
has been recognised in respect of these losses. Deferred income taxes are calculated using an expected rate of corporation tax in the 
UK of 19% (2016: 19%). Portfolio and

The Group’s dividend policy was updated in May 2016. The Group will pay a base dividend of 16 pence per share and an additional 
ﬁnal dividend which is based on cash realisations, the investment pipeline and the balance sheet at year end. The Group will only pay 
an additional ﬁnal dividend if gross debt is less than £1 billion and gearing is less than 20%, to maintain its conservative approach. Audited ﬁnancial statements

9 Dividends continued
The distribution policy covers the Group’s total annual dividend, which is split between a base dividend (16 pence per share) and 
an additional dividend. The dividend can be paid out of either the capital reserve or the revenue reserve subject to the investment 
trust rules which state that at least 85% of revenue must be distributed by the Company.
10 Investment portfolio
Accounting policy: 
Investments are recognised and de-recognised on the date when their purchase or sale is subject to a relevant contract and the 
associated risks and rewards have been transferred. The Group manages its investments with a view to proﬁting from the receipt  
of investment income and capital appreciation from changes in the fair value of investments.
All investments are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and are subsequently measured at fair value,  
in accordance with the Group’s valuation policies. 
Quoted investments are designated at fair value through proﬁt and loss and subsequently carried in the Consolidated statement 
of ﬁnancial position at fair value. Fair value is measured using the closing bid price at the reporting date, where the investment 
is quoted on an active stock market.
Unquoted investments, including both equity and loans are designated at fair value through proﬁt and loss and are subsequently 
carried in the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position at fair value. Fair value is determined in line with 3i’s valuation policy, 
which is compliant with the fair value guidelines under IFRS and the International Private Equity and Venture Capital (IPEV) Valuation 
Guidelines, details of which are available in “Portfolio valuation – an explanation” on pages 158 and 159.
Interest bearing loans accrue interest which is either settled in cash or capitalised on a regular basis and included as part of the 
principal loan balance. The capitalisation of accrued interest is treated as part of investment additions during the year. If the fair 
value of an investment is assessed to be below the principal value of the loan the Group recognises a fair value reduction against 
any interest income accrued from the date of the assessment going forward. “Capitalisation at nil value” is the term used to 
describe the capitalisation of accrued interest which has been fully provided for. These transactions are disclosed as additions 
to portfolio cost with an equal reduction made where loan notes have nil value.
In accordance with IFRS 10, the proportion of the investment portfolio held by the Group’s unconsolidated subsidiaries is presented as 
part of the fair value of investment entity subsidiaries, along with the fair value of their other assets and liabilities. A reconciliation of the 
fair value of Investments in investment entities is included in Note 11.

11 Investments in investment entity subsidiaries
Accounting policy: 
Investments in investment entity subsidiaries are accounted for as ﬁnancial instruments at fair value through proﬁt and loss.
These entities are typically limited partnerships and other intermediate investment holding structures which hold the Group’s 
interests in investments in portfolio companies (Investment Entity Holding Companies). The fair value can increase or reduce 
from either cash ﬂows to/from the investment entities or valuation movements in line with the Group’s valuation policy. 
Substantially all of these entities meet the deﬁnition of a Fund under the IPEV guidelines and the fair value and unit of account of 
these entities is their net asset values. There were no adjustments to the subsidiaries’ net asset values in the year. 
We determine that in the ordinary course of business, the net asset values of an investment entity subsidiary are considered to be 
the most appropriate to determine fair value. At each reporting period, we consider whether any additional fair value adjustments 
need to be made to the net asset values of the investment entity subsidiaries. These adjustments may be required to reﬂect market 
participants’ considerations about fair value that may include, but are not limited to, liquidity and the portfolio effect of holding 
multiple investments within the investment entity subsidiary. There was no particular circumstance to indicate that a fair value 
adjustment was required and after due consideration we concluded that the net asset values were the most appropriate reﬂection 
of fair value at 31 March 2017 .

A 5% movement in the closing book value of investments in investment entities would have an impact of £174 million (31 March 2016:  
£134 million). 
Restrictions
3i Group plc, the ultimate parent company, receives dividend income from its subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability 
to transfer funds from these subsidiaries to the Group except for a cash balance of £56 million held on escrow in an investment entity 
subsidiary for the carried interest payable. 
Support
3i Group plc continues to provide, where necessary, ongoing support to its investment entity subsidiaries for the purchase of portfolio 
investments. During the year, there were net cash ﬂows to the Group as noted in the table above. The Group’s current commitments 
are disclosed in Note 24. Audited ﬁnancial statements

12 Fair values of assets and liabilities
Accounting policy: 
Financial instruments, other than those held at amortised cost, are held at fair value and are designated irrevocably at inception. 
In particular, 3i designates groups of ﬁnancial instruments as being at fair value when they are managed, and their performance 
evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, and where information 
about the groups of ﬁnancial instruments is reported to management on that basis.

(B) Valuation
The fair values of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values with the exception 
of loans and borrowings. The fair value of the loans and borrowings is £741 million (31 March 2016: £967 million), determined with 
reference to their published market prices. The carrying value of the loans and borrowings is £575 million (31 March 2016: £837 million). Portfolio and

Valuation hierarchy
The Group classiﬁes ﬁnancial instruments measured at fair value in the investment portfolio according to the following hierarchy:
Level Fair value input description Financial instruments
Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) from active markets Quoted equity instruments
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that  
are observable either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly  
(ie derived from prices)
Fixed rate loan notes
Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data Unquoted equity instruments and loan instruments
Unquoted equity instruments and debt instruments are measured in accordance with the IPEV Guidelines with reference to the 
most appropriate information available at the time of measurement. Further information regarding the valuation of unquoted equity 
instruments and debt instruments can be found in the section Portfolio valuation – an explanation on pages 158 and 159.

The above disclosure only relates to the investment portfolio and the investments in our investment entity subsidiaries. We determine 
that in the ordinary course of business, the net asset values of an investment entity subsidiary are considered to be the most 
appropriate to determine fair value. The underlying portfolio is valued under the same methodology as directly held investments,  
with any other assets or liabilities within investment entity subsidiaries fair valued in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. 
Note 11 details the Directors’ considerations about the fair value of the underlying investment entity subsidiaries.

Other movements include the effects of foreign exchange.
On a continuing basis, unquoted investments valued using Level 3 inputs also had the following impact on the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income: realised losses over value on disposal of investment of £26 million (2016: £10 million (realised proﬁt)), 
dividend income of £24 million (2016: £46 million) and foreign exchange gains of £63 million (2016: £40 million). 
Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation – an explanation 
section. On an IFRS basis, of assets held at 31 March 2017 , classiﬁed as Level 3, 33% (31 March 2016: 28%) were valued using a multiple 
of earnings and the remaining 67% (31 March 2016: 72%) were valued using alternative valuation methodologies. 
Assets move between Level 1 and Level 3 primarily due to an increase or decrease in observable market activity related to an input 
which is primarily when an unquoted equity investment lists on a quoted market exchange.
Valuation multiple – The valuation multiple is the main assumption applied to a multiple of earnings based valuation. The multiple is 
derived from comparable listed companies or relevant market transaction multiples. Companies in the same industry and geography 
and, where possible, with a similar business model and proﬁle are selected and then adjusted for factors including liquidity risk, growth 
potential and relative performance. They are also adjusted to represent our longer term view of performance through the cycle or 
our exit assumptions. The value weighted average earnings multiple used when valuing the portfolio at 31 March 2017 was 10.23x 
(2016: 9.83x). 
If the multiple used to value each unquoted investment valued on an earnings multiple basis as at 31 March 2017 decreased by 5%, the 
investment portfolio would decrease by £18 million (31 March 2016: £19 million) or 1% (31 March 2016: 1%). If the same sensitivity was 
applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have a negative impact of £224 million (31 March 2016: £173 
million) or 6% (31 March 2016: 6%). 
If the multiple increased by 5% then the investment portfolio would increase by £16 million (31 March 2016: £19 million) or 1% (31 March 
2016: 1%). If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have a positive impact 
of £215 million (31 March 2016: £172 million) or 5% (31 March 2016: 6%).
Alternative valuation methodologies – There are a number of alternative investment valuation methodologies used by the Group, 
for reasons speciﬁc to individual assets. The details of such valuation methodologies, and the inputs that are used, are given in the 
Portfolio valuation – an explanation section on pages 158 and 159. 
Each methodology is used for a proportion of assets by value, and at year end the following techniques were used under an IFRS basis: 
41% DCF (31 March 2016: 30%), 4% broker quotes (31 March 2016: 18%), 2% imminent sale (31 March 2016: 11%), 10% industry metric  
(31 March 2016: 10%) and 10% other (31 March 2016: 3%). 
If the value of all of the investments valued under alternative methodologies moved by 5%, this would have an impact on the 
investment portfolio of £44 million (31 March 2016: £45 million) or 3% (31 March 2016: 3%). If the same sensitivity was applied to the 
underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have an impact of £7 million (31 March 2016: £9 million) or 0.2% (31 March 
2016: 0.3%).  Portfolio and

13 Carried interest and performance fees
Accounting policy:
Carried interest and performance fees receivable
The Group earns a share of proﬁts (“carried interest and performance fees receivable”) from funds which it manages on behalf  
of third parties. These proﬁts are earned when the funds meet certain performance conditions.
Carried interest and performance fees receivable include amounts receivable from Private Equity and Infrastructure. Each scheme 
is separately reviewed at the balance sheet date, and an accrual for carried interest receivable is made once the performance 
conditions would be achieved if the remaining assets in that fund were realised at fair value. 
Fair value of the assets is determined using the Group’s valuation methodology and is measured at the balance sheet date. 
An accrual is made equal to the Group’s share of proﬁts in excess of the performance conditions, taking into account the cash 
already returned to fund investors and the fair value of assets remaining in the fund.
The performance fee receivable from 3iN is based on 3iN’s most recently published NAV subject to a performance hurdle and  
a high water mark. 
Carried interest and performance fees payable
The Group offers investment executives the opportunity to participate in the returns from investments subject to certain 
performance conditions. “Carried interest and performance fees payable” is the term used for amounts payable to executives 
on these investment-related transactions. 
A variety of asset pooling arrangements are in place so that executives may have an interest in one or more carried interest plans. 
Carried interest payable is accrued if its performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved if the 
remaining assets in that plan were realised at fair value. An accrual is made equal to the executive’s share of proﬁts in excess of the 
performance conditions in place in the carried interest plan, discounted to reﬂect the likely actual cash payment date, which may 
be materially later than the time of the accrual.
The Infrastructure performance fee is accrued when the Group becomes contractually liable to make payments to the team. 
Under IFRS 10, where carried interest payable reduces the fair value of an investment entity subsidiary, that movement is recorded 
through “Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries” . At 31 March 2017 , an additional £538 million of carried interest 
payable was recognised in the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position of these investment entity subsidiaries (31 March 
2016: £299 million).

14 Intangible assets
Accounting policy:
Fund management contracts, such as those acquired by the Group in connection with the acquisition of a subsidiary, 
are stated at their fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, included in operating expenses,  
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the fund management contract, typically ﬁve to 10 years.
Goodwill is recognised on the acquisition of subsidiaries when the cost of acquisition exceeds the net assets acquired. Goodwill 
is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment, and is assessed annually for impairment.

16 Loans and borrowings
Accounting policy: 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received. After initial recognition, these are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated 
future cash ﬂows through the expected life of the liabilities. Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished.

to September 2021 in the current ﬁnancial year, following an agreement with all but one of the participating banks. The £329 million 
facility has no ﬁnancial covenants. 
During the year, the €331 million outstanding of the Company’s €350 million ﬁxed rate notes were repaid in full.
All of the Group’s borrowings are repayable in one instalment on the respective maturity dates. None of the Group’s interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are secured on the assets of the Group. 
The fair value of the loans and borrowings is £741 million (31 March 2016: £967 million), determined with reference to their published 
market prices. The loans and borrowings are included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
In accordance with the FCA Handbook (FUNDS 3.2.2. R and Fund 3.2.6. R), 3i Investments plc, as AIFM of the Company is required  
to calculate leverage in accordance with a set formula and disclose this to investors. In line with the relevant requirements, leverage  
for the Group is 115% (31 March 2016: 116%) and the Company is 107% (31 March 2016: 119%) under both the gross method and 
commitment method. The leverage for 3i Investments plc is 100% (31 March 2016: 100%) under both the gross method and the 
commitment method.
Under the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (“SFTR”) and AIFMD, 3i is required to disclose certain information relating 
to the use of securities ﬁnancing transactions (“SFTs”) and total return swaps. At 31 March 2017 , 3i was not party to any transactions 
involving SFTs or total return swaps. Audited ﬁnancial statements

17 Provisions
Accounting policy:
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation of uncertain timing or amount as a result of past events and 
it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of that obligation can be made. 
The provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the amount to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and 
are discounted to present value if the effect is material. Changes in provisions are recognised in the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income for the period.

The provision for redundancy relates to staff reductions communicated prior to 31 March 2017 . Most of the provision is expected to be 
utilised in the next year.
The Group has a number of leasehold properties whose rent and unavoidable costs exceed the economic beneﬁts expected to be 
received. These costs arise over the period of the lease, and have been provided for to the extent they are not covered by income from 
subleases. The leases covered by the provision have a remaining term of up to three years. The property provision also includes an 
estimate of the costs required to restore leased property to its original condition at the end of the lease term.

Capital constraints
The Group is generally free to transfer capital from subsidiary undertakings to the parent company subject to maintaining each 
subsidiary with sufﬁcient reserves to meet local statutory/regulatory obligations. No signiﬁcant constraints (apart from those shown  
in Note 11) have been identiﬁed and the Group has been able to distribute proﬁts in a tax-efﬁcient manner.
The Group’s regulated capital requirement is reviewed regularly by the Board of 3i Investments plc, an investment ﬁrm that is regulated 
by the FCA. The last submission to the FCA demonstrated a signiﬁcant consolidated capital surplus in excess of the FCA’s prudential 
rules. The Group’s capital requirement is updated regularly following approval of the Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP) report by the Board of 3i Investments plc. The Group complies with the Individual Capital Guidance as agreed with 
the FCA and operates with a signiﬁcant regulatory capital surplus. The Group’s Pillar 3 disclosure document can be found

During the year to 31 March 2017 , £5 million (2016: £5 million) was recognised as an expense in the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income in respect of operating leases. There was no impact (2016: nil) on the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income in respect of subleases, as the difference between future lease and sublease obligations was already provided 
for in prior years (refer to Note 17). The total future sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases are

The Group and Company are contractually committed to these investments, however they were not completed prior to 31 March 2017 . 
These commitments are due within one year and are subject to change prior to investment completion.
Operating lease commitments are detailed in Note 23.
25 Contingent liabilities
Accounting policy:
Contingent liabilities are potential liabilities where there is even greater uncertainty, which could include a dependency on events 
not within the Group’s control, but where there is a possible obligation. Contingent liabilities are only disclosed and not included 
within the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position.
The Company has provided a guarantee to the Trustees of the 3i Group Pension Plan in respect of liabilities of 3i plc to the Plan. 3i plc 
is the sponsor of the 3i Group Pension Plan. On 4 April 2012, the Company transferred eligible assets (£150 million of ordinary shares 
in 3i Infrastructure plc) as deﬁned by the agreement to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. The Company will retain all income 
and capital rights in relation to the 3i Infrastructure plc shares, as eligible assets, unless the Company becomes insolvent or fails to 
comply with material obligations in relation to the agreement with the Trustees, all of which are under its control. The fair value of 
the assets held by this subsidiary at 31 March 2017 was £265 million (31 March 2016: £187 million) of which £53 million relates to the 
investment made as part of 3iN’s capital raise in June 2016.
At 31 March 2017 , there was no material litigation outstanding against the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings. Audited ﬁnancial statements

26 Retirement beneﬁts
Accounting policy:
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt plans are charged to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income  
as they fall due.
For deﬁned beneﬁt retirement plans, the cost of providing beneﬁts is determined using the projected unit method with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability/asset, calculated using the 
discount rate used to measure the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation, is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. Re-measurement gains or losses are recognised in full as they arise in other comprehensive income.
A retirement beneﬁt deﬁcit is recognised in the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position to the extent that the present value  
of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligations exceeds the fair value of plan assets.
A retirement beneﬁt surplus is recognised in the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position where the fair value of plan assets 
exceeds the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligations limited to the extent that the Group can beneﬁt from that surplus.
Retirement beneﬁt plans
(i) Deﬁned contribution plans
The Group operates a number of deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt plans for qualifying employees throughout the Group.  
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group. The employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in France are 
members of a state managed retirement beneﬁt plan operated by the country’s government. 3i Europe plc’s French branch 
is required to contribute a speciﬁc percentage of payroll costs to the retirement beneﬁt scheme to fund these beneﬁts.
The total expense recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income is £3 million (2016: £3 million), which represents 
the contributions paid to these deﬁned contribution plans. There were no outstanding payments due to these plans at the balance 
sheet date.
(ii) Deﬁned beneﬁt plans
The Group operates a ﬁnal salary deﬁned beneﬁt plan for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK (“the Plan”). The Plan 
is approved by HMRC for tax purposes and is operated separately from the Group and managed by an independent set of Trustees, 
whose appointment and powers are determined by the Plan’s documentation.
Membership of the Plan has not been offered to new employees joining 3i since 1 April 2006. The Plan was closed to the future accrual 
of beneﬁts by members with effect from 5 April 2011, although the ﬁnal salary link is maintained on existing accruals. Members of the 
Plan have been invited to join the Group’s deﬁned contribution plan with effect from 6 April 2011. The deﬁned beneﬁt plan is a funded 
scheme, the assets of which are independent of the Company’s ﬁnances and are administered by the Trustees. The Trustees are 
responsible for managing and investing the Plan’s assets and for monitoring the Plan’s funding position. As the Plan is now closed  
to future accrual, measures have been taken to de-risk the Plan through changes to its investment policy. 
The valuation of the Plan has been updated on an IAS 19 basis by an independent qualiﬁed actuary as at 31 March 2017 .
Employees in Germany and Spain are entitled to a pension based on their length of service. 3i Deutschland GmbH and the 
German and Spanish branches of 3i Europe plc contribute to individual investment policies for their employees and have agreed 
to indemnify any shortfall on an employee’s investment policy should it arise. The total value of these investment policies intended 
to cover pension liabilities is £1 million (31 March 2016: £1 million) and the future liability calculated by German and Spanish actuaries 
is £23 million (2016: £21 million). The amounts recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year and 
other comprehensive income for these schemes are a £1 million expense (2016: £1 million expense) and a nil gain (2016: £2 million 
gain), respectively. Portfolio and

The Plan’s assets are predominantly invested with Legal and General Investment Management in quoted and liquid funds. The 
annuity contract is provided by Pension Insurance Corporation as a result of a buy-in transaction completed by the 3i Pension Plan 
Trustees during the year. The buy-in, which is a bulk annuity purchase, reduces member longevity risk for those pensioners covered 
while improving investment returns over the assets used to fund the purchase. This contract provides an exact match for the member 
beneﬁts insured and covers two in ﬁve pensioners. The fair value of the insurance policy is calculated using the same assumptions and 
methodology as used to calculate the value of the pension liability as at 31 March 2017 . 
The Plan’s assets do not include any of the Group’s own equity instruments nor any property in use by the Group.

The principal assumptions made by the actuaries and used for the purpose of the year end valuation of the Plan were as follows:
2017 2016
Discount rate 2.5% 3.5%
Expected rate of salary increases 5.8% 5.7%
Expected rate of pension increases 0% to 3.4% 3.2% to 3.4%
Retail Price Index (RPI) inﬂation 3.3% 3.2%
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inﬂation 2.3% 2.2%
In addition, it is assumed that members exchange 25% of pension for lump sum at retirement on the conversion terms in place 
at 31 March 2017 with an allowance for the terms to increase in future. The duration of the Plan’s deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the 
accounting date was around 22 years. 
The post-retirement mortality assumption used to value the beneﬁt obligation at 31 March 2017 is 80% of the S1NA Light tables 
allowing for improvements from 2003 in line with the CMI 2012 core projections with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1.5% 
(unchanged from 31 March 2016). The life expectancy of a male member reaching age 60 in 2037 (31 March 2016: 2036) is projected 
to be 33.7 (31 March 2016: 33.6) years compared to 31.4 (31 March 2016: 31.3) years for someone reaching 60 in 2017 . Portfolio and

The sensitivity of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:
 Impact on retirement beneﬁt surplus
 Change in assumption 2017 2016
Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% Decrease by £10 million Decrease by £10 million
Retail Price Index (RPI) inﬂation Increase by 0.1% Decrease by £7 million Decrease by £7 million
Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Decrease by £13 million Decrease by £15 million
The above sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption whilst all others remain constant. In practice this is unlikely to 
occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Through its deﬁned beneﬁt plan the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most signiﬁcant of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility A fall in the value of the Plan’s assets may reduce the value of the deﬁned beneﬁt surplus and could affect the future 
funding requirements. To reduce the volatility of the Plan’s assets, the Trustees have implemented an investment 
strategy that reduces the Plan’s equity holdings by switching them to bonds over time. The Plan’s assets are also 
diversiﬁed across different asset classes and during FY2017 it purchased an annuity contract that is an exact match  
for a proportion of the Plan’s liabilities.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Plan’s IAS 19 deﬁned beneﬁt obligation. However, the Plan holds 
a proportion of its assets in corporate bonds and so any increase in the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation would be partially 
offset by an increase in the value of the Plan’s assets.
Inﬂation risk The Plan’s deﬁned beneﬁt obligations are linked to inﬂation, and higher inﬂation will lead to higher liabilities. The 
majority of the Plan’s assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inﬂation, meaning that an increase 
in inﬂation could reduce or eliminate the deﬁned beneﬁt surplus.
Life expectancy The Plan’s obligations are to provide beneﬁts for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an 
increase in the Plan’s deﬁned beneﬁt obligation.
As the Plan was closed to future accrual of beneﬁts by members with effect from 5 April 2011, the Group ceased to make regular 
contributions to the Plan in the year to 31 March 2012.
The results of the triennial actuarial funding valuation as at 30 June 2013 showed that the Plan had an actuarial surplus of £1 million at 
30 June 2013 and as a result the Group was not required to make contributions to the Plan in respect of that valuation. The contingent 
asset arrangement entered into during FY2013, details of which are provided in Note 25, remains in place. The next triennial actuarial 
funding valuation exercise, based on the ﬁnancial position of the Plan as at 30 June 2016 commenced during FY2017 . The exercise is 
required to be completed by 30 September 2017 .
During the early part of FY2017 the Group ﬁnalised its programme, launched in the prior year, to offer the Plan’s members ﬂexibility 
in how they take their pension beneﬁts.  Audited ﬁnancial statements

27 Share-based payments
Accounting policy: 
The Group has equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment transactions with certain employees. Equity-settled schemes 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant, which is then recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
over the period that employees provide services, generally the period between the start of performance period and the vesting 
date of the shares. The number of share awards expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and services 
conditions included in the terms of the award will be met.
Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate model which takes into account the exercise price of the option (if any), the current 
share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and any other relevant 
factors. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the 
price of the shares of 3i Group plc. The charge is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reﬂect the actual number of forfeitures, 
cancellations and leavers during the year. The movement in cumulative charges since the previous balance sheet is recognised  
in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Liabilities arising from cash-settled share-based payment transactions are recognised in the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income over the vesting period. They are fair valued at each reporting date. The cost of cash-settled share-based 
payment transactions is adjusted for the forfeitures of the participants’ rights that no longer meet the plan requirements as well 
as for early vesting.
Share-based payments are in certain circumstances made in lieu of annual cash bonuses or carried interest payments. The cost 
of the share-based payments is allocated either to operating expenses (bonuses) or carried interest depending on the original 
driver of the award. Executive Director Long-Term Incentives are allocated to operating expenses.
The total cost recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income is shown below:

3 Recognised in operating expenses and/or carried interest.
The features of the Group’s share schemes for Executive Directors are described in the Report of the Board on Directors’ remuneration 
on pages 88 and 90. To ensure that employees’ interests are aligned with shareholders, a signiﬁcant amount of variable compensation 
paid to higher earning employees is deferred into shares that vest over a number of years. For legal, regulatory or practical reasons 
certain participants may be granted “phantom awards” under these schemes, which are intended to replicate the ﬁnancial effects of 
a share award without entitling the participant to acquire shares. The carrying amount of liabilities arising from share-based payment 
transactions at 31 March 2017 is £6 million (31 March 2016: £4 million). 
For the share-based awards granted during the year, the weighted average fair value of those options at 31 March 2017 was 436 pence 
(31 March 2016: 457 pence).
The main assumptions for the valuation of certain share-based awards with market conditions attached comprised:

28 Financial risk management
Introduction
A review of the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Risk section on pages  
44 to 53. This Note provides further detail on ﬁnancial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk section where applicable, and 
includes quantitative data on speciﬁc ﬁnancial risks.
The Group is a highly selective investor and each investment is subject to an individual risk assessment through an investment 
approval process. The Group’s Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework set out in the Risk section. 
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group and both the Group and the Company share  
the same ﬁnancial risks. 
Financial risks
Concentration risk
3i seeks to diversify risk through signiﬁcant dispersion of investments by geography, economic sector, asset class and size as well 
as through the maturity proﬁle of its investment portfolio. Although 3i does not set maximum limits for asset allocation, it does have 
a maximum exposure limit for the cost of new investments. This is detailed in the Investment policy on page 95 in the Corporate 
Governance section. Quantitative data regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio across geographies can be found in the 
Segmental analysis in Note 1 and in the 20 large investments table on pages 156 and 157 .
Credit risk
The Group is subject to credit risk on its unquoted investments, derivatives, cash and deposits. The Group’s cash and deposits are 
held with a variety of counterparties with 85% of the Group’s surplus cash held on demand in AAA rated money market funds and 
4% held in deposit accounts with an initial notice period of greater than 90 days. The balance is held on short-term deposit with banks 
with a credit rating of A- or higher.
The credit quality of unquoted investments, which are held at fair value and include debt and equity elements, is based on the ﬁnancial 
performance of the individual portfolio companies. The credit risk relating to these assets is based on their enterprise value and is 
reﬂected through fair value movements. Further detail can be found in the Price risk – market ﬂuctuations disclosure in this Note and 
the sensitivity disclosure to changes in the valuation assumptions is provided in the valuation section of Note 12. 
Liquidity risk
The liquidity outlook is monitored monthly by management and regularly by the Board in the context of periodic strategic reviews 
of the balance sheet. The new investment pipeline and forecast realisations are closely monitored and assessed against our vintage 
control policy. These are noted in the risk mitigation section on pages 51 and 53 of the Risk section. The table on the next page 
analyses the maturity of the Group’s gross contractual liabilities. Audited ﬁnancial statements

Forward foreign exchange contracts
At 31 March 2017 , there were no forward foreign exchange contracts in place (31 March 2016: none). 
The Company disclosures are the same as those for the Group with the following exceptions; carried interest and performance 
fees payable within one year is nil (31 March 2016: nil) and trade and other payables within one year is £506 million (31 March 
2016: £417 million).
Market risk
The valuation of the Group’s investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within 
the portfolio but the valuation and other items in the ﬁnancial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted 
market ﬂuctuations. The Group’s sensitivity to these items is set out below.
(i) Interest rate risk
On the liability side, the direct impact of a movement in interest rates is limited to any drawings under the committed multi-currency 
facility as the Group’s outstanding debt is ﬁxed rate. The sensitivities below arise principally from changes in interest receivable on 
cash and deposit. 
An increase of 100 basis points, based on the closing balance sheet position over a 12-month period, would lead to an 
approximate increase in total comprehensive income of £10 million (2016: £10 million increase) for the Group and £9 million income 
(2016: £9 million) for the Company. In addition, the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates through changes 
to the ﬁnancial performance and valuation of portfolio companies and valuation of residual debt management investments caused 
by interest rate ﬂuctuations. 
(ii) Currency risk
The Group’s net assets in euro, US dollar, Danish krone, Indian rupee and all other currencies combined are shown in the table below. 
This sensitivity analysis is performed based on the sensitivity of the Group’s net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange 
rates assuming a 10% movement in exchange rates against sterling. The sensitivity of the Company to foreign exchange risk is not 
materially different from the Group. Portfolio and

(iii) Price risk – market ﬂuctuations
The Group’s management of price risk, which arises primarily from quoted and unquoted equity instruments, is through the careful 
consideration of the investment, asset management and divestment decisions at the Investment Committee. The Investment 
Committee’s role in risk management is discussed further in the Risk section. A 15% change in the fair value of those investments 
would have the following direct impact on the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income:

the Company has related parties in respect of its subsidiaries. Some of these subsidiaries are held at fair value (unconsolidated 
subsidiaries) due to the treatment prescribed in IFRS 10. 
Related parties

Investments
The Group makes investments in the equity of unquoted and quoted investments where it does not have control but may be able 
to participate in the ﬁnancial and operating policies of that company. IFRS presumes that it is possible to exert signiﬁcant inﬂuence 
when the equity holding is greater than 20%. The Group has taken the investment entity exception as permitted by IFRS 10 and has 
not equity accounted for these investments, in accordance with IAS 28, but they are related parties. The total amounts included for 
investments where the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence but not control are as follows:

Unconsolidated structured entities
The application of IFRS 12 requires additional disclosure on the Group’s exposure to unconsolidated structured entities. 
The Group has exposure to a number of unconsolidated structured entities as a result of its investment activities across its Private 
Equity and Infrastructure business lines. These structured entities fall into two categories, namely CLOs and closed end limited 
partnerships (Private Equity and Infrastructure funds). 
The nature, purpose and activities of these entities are detailed below along with the nature of risks associated with these entities  
and the maximum exposure to loss. 
CLO structured entities
The Group used to manage CLO vehicles as part of its Debt Management business. These funds predominantly invested in senior 
secured loans and are ﬁnanced by investors seeking credit rated, structured, investment returns. 
The Group, as the then manager, invested into the equity tranche of these funds and has retained the stakes that were not sold to 
Investcorp. These positions are held at fair value.
The risk and maximum exposure to loss arising from the Group’s involvement with these entities are summarised below:

At 31 March 2016, the carrying amount of assets and maximum loss exposure of unquoted investments was £154 million. The carrying 
amount of liabilities was nil.
The Group earned distributions of £31 million (2016: £31 million) and fee income of £21 million (2016: £33 million) during the year from 
CLO structured entities. This includes continuing and discontinued operations.
Closed-end limited partnerships
The Group manages a number of closed-end limited partnerships, which are primarily Private Equity or Infrastructure focused, in 
return for a management fee. The purpose of these partnerships is to invest in Private Equity or Infrastructure investments for capital 
appreciation. Limited Partners, which in some cases may include the Group, ﬁnance these entities by committing capital to them and 
cash is drawn down or distributed for ﬁnancing investment activity. 
The Group’s attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value, fees receivable are recognised on an accruals basis and carried 
interest is accrued when relevant performance hurdles are met. 
The risk and maximum exposure to loss arising from the Group’s involvement with these entities are summarised below:

Regulatory information relating to fees
3i Investments plc acts as the AIFM of 3i Group plc. In performing the activities and functions of the AIFM, the AIFM or another 
3i company may pay or receive fees, commissions or non-monetary beneﬁts to or from third parties of the following nature:
Transaction fees: 3i companies receive monitoring and directors’ fees from portfolio companies. The amount is agreed with the 
portfolio company at the time of the investment but may be re-negotiated. Where applicable, 3i may also receive fees on the 
completion of transactions such as acquisitions, reﬁnancings or syndications either from the portfolio company or a co-investor. 
Transaction fees paid to 3i are included in portfolio income.
Payments for third-party services: 3i companies may retain the services of third-party consultants; for example for an independent 
director or other investment management specialist expertise. The amount paid varies in accordance with the nature of the service 
and the length of the service period and is usually, but not always, paid/reimbursed by the portfolio companies. The payment may 
involve a ﬂat fee, retainer or success fee. Such payments, where borne by 3i companies, are usually included in portfolio income. 
Payments for services from 3i companies: One 3i company may provide investment advisory services to another 3i company 
and receive payment for such services. 
30 Subsidiaries and related undertakings 
IFRS 10 deems control, as opposed to equity ownership, as the key factor when determining what meets the deﬁnition of a 
subsidiary. If a group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, then under IFRS 10 
it has control. This is inconsistent with the UK’s Companies Act 2006, where voting rights being greater than 50% is the key factor 
when identifying subsidiaries. 
Under IFRS 10, 30 of the Group’s portfolio company investments are considered to be accounting subsidiaries. As the Group applies 
the investment entity exception available under IFRS 10, these investee companies are classiﬁed as investment entity subsidiaries. 
The Companies Act 2006 requires disclosure of certain information about the Group’s related undertakings. Related undertakings are 
subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and other signiﬁcant holdings. In this context, signiﬁcant means either a shareholding greater 
than or equal to 20% of the nominal value of any class of shares or a book value greater than 20% of the Group’s assets. 
The Company’s related undertakings at 31 March 2017 are listed below.

31 Discontinued operations
On 3 March 2017 , the Group completed the disposal of its Debt Management business to Investcorp and received cash proceeds 
of £270 million. Included within the cash proceeds was £33 million which related to the repayment of loans provided to Debt 
Management to fund two CLO warehouses. At 31 March 2017 , the Group retained residual stakes in a number of CLO funds which 
were not required by Investcorp for risk retention or other contractual requirements together with its holdings in the Global Income 
Fund and the Senior Loan Fund. These investments are treated as continuing operations and there were no assets held for sale 
on 31 March 2017 . Since the publication of the Half-yearly report 2016 and following completion of the transaction on 3 March 2017 ,   Audited ﬁnancial statements

it is now expected that some of the investments not sold to Investcorp will be retained beyond the 12 month period prescribed by  
IFRS 5. Accordingly they are no longer classiﬁed as assets held for sale and have been included in continuing operations in these 
ﬁnancial statements. As these investments are held at fair value through proﬁt or loss, the reclassiﬁcation out of held for sale had 
no impact on the carrying value of these investments.
The disposal group fulﬁlled the requirement of IFRS 5 to be classiﬁed as “discontinued operations” in the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, the results of which are set out below.

Overview of our audit approach
Risks of material misstatement • Incorrect valuation of unquoted proprietary investments.
• Incorrect calculation of carried interest.
• Incorrect recognition of portfolio income and of realised proﬁts on disposal of investments.
•  Incorrect accounting treatment of the sale of the Debt Management business and calculation of the proﬁt 
on disposal.
The ﬁrst two risks are considered to be signiﬁcant risks, consistent with the 2016 audit.
Audit scope •  The Group is principally managed from one location in London. All core functions, including ﬁnance and 
operations, are located in London. The Group operates eight international ofﬁces which are primarily 
responsible for deal origination and investment portfolio monitoring.
•  The Group comprises 67 consolidated subsidiaries and 45 investment entity subsidiaries. Monitoring and 
control over the operations of these subsidiaries, including those located overseas, is centralised in London.
•  The London based Group audit team performed direct audit procedures on all items material to the Group 
ﬁnancial statements. Our audit sample covered 99% of the investment portfolio and 99% of carried interest 
accruals.
Materiality • Overall Group materiality is £58m (2016: £44m) which represents 1% of net assets.
What has changed •  Incorrect accounting treatment of the sale of the Debt Management business and calculation of the proﬁt 
on disposal is included as a risk of material misstatement. We have included this risk in the 2017 audit as the 
sale of the Debt Management business is a signiﬁcant unusual transaction for the Group, outside the normal 
course of business.  Audited ﬁnancial statements

Our assessment of risk of material misstatement 
We identiﬁed the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed 
the procedures below which were designed in the context of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express 
any opinion on these individual areas.
Risk Our response to the risk
Group and parent company risk
Incorrect valuation of unquoted proprietary investments 
Refer to the Audit and Compliance Committee report (pages 
69 to 73); Signiﬁcant accounting policies (pages 108 to 111); 
and Notes 10, 11 and 12 of the ﬁnancial statements (pages 
120 to 124)
The proprietary investment portfolio comprises a number 
of unquoted securities. In the Consolidated statement of 
ﬁnancial position these are shown both as Investments (which 
are held directly by consolidated subsidiaries of the Group 
and Parent Company), and as Investments in investment 
entity subsidiaries (which are typically limited partnerships 
and other holding structures). In the Company statement of 
ﬁnancial position these are shown both as investments (which 
are held directly by the Parent Company), and as Investments 
in investment entities (which are included within the Interests 
in Group entities line item).
The Group adopts a valuation methodology based on the 
International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation 
Guidelines (‘IPEV Guidelines’) – December 2015, in 
conformity with IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement. Owing 
to the unquoted and illiquid nature of these investments, 
the assessment of fair valuation is subjective and requires 
a number of signiﬁcant and complex judgments to be made 
by management. The exit value will be determined by the 
market at the time of realisation and therefore despite the 
valuation policy adopted and judgments made by 
management, the ﬁnal sales value on realisation may differ 
materially from the valuation at the year end date. 
There is the risk that inaccurate judgments made in the 
assessment of fair value, in particular in respect of; earnings 
multiples, the application of liquidity discounts, calculation of 
discount rates and the estimation of future maintainable 
earnings, could lead to the incorrect valuation of the 
unquoted proprietary investment portfolio. In turn, this could 
materially misstate the value of the investment portfolio in 
the Statement of ﬁnancial position, the Gross investment 
return and Total return in the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and the Net asset value per share.
There is also the risk that management may inﬂuence the 
signiﬁcant judgments and estimations in respect of unquoted 
proprietary investment valuations in order to meet market 
expectations of the overall Net asset value of the Group. 
Our procedures extended to testing 99% of the related amount.
We obtained an understanding of management’s processes and controls for 
determining the fair valuation of unquoted proprietary investments by performing 
walkthrough procedures. This included discussing with management the valuation 
governance structure and protocols around their oversight of the valuation process 
and corroborating our understanding by attending Valuations Committee meetings. 
We have identiﬁed key controls in the process, assessed the design adequacy and 
tested the operating effectiveness of those controls. We relied on controls over 
portfolio company and comparable company data used in the valuation of 
unquoted investments.
We compared management’s valuation methodology to IFRS and the IPEV 
guidelines. We sought explanations from management where there are judgments 
applied in their application of the guidelines, discussed and assessed their 
appropriateness. 
With the assistance of our valuations specialists, we formed an independent range 
for the key assumptions used in the valuation of a sample of unquoted investments 
within the private equity business line, with reference to relevant industry and market 
valuation considerations. We derived a range of fair values using our assumptions 
and other qualitative risk factors. We compared these ranges to management’s fair 
values, and discussed our results with both management and the Valuations 
Committee. 
With respect to unquoted investments in the private equity business line, on a 
sample basis we corroborated key inputs in the valuation models, such as earnings 
and net debt to source data. We also performed the following procedures on key 
judgments made by management in the calculation of fair value:
•  assessed the suitability of the comparable companies used in the calculation 
of the earnings multiples;
•  challenged management on the applicability of adjustments made to earnings 
multiples, obtained rationale and supporting evidence for adjustments made; 
•  performed corroborative calculations to assess the appropriateness of discount 
rates; and
•  discussed the adjustments made to calculate future maintainable earnings and 
corroborated this to supporting documentation. 
On a sample basis, we veriﬁed the valuation of unquoted investments retained from 
the Debt Management business to broker quotes and other data from third party 
pricing sources used by management in the calculation of fair value.
We checked the mathematical accuracy of the valuation models on a sample basis. 
We recalculated the unrealised proﬁts on the revaluation of investments impacting 
the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
We discussed with management and understood the rationale for any differences 
between the exit prices of investments realised during the year and the prior year 
fair value, to further assess the reasonableness of the current year valuation 
assumptions and methodology adopted by management.
Key observations communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee:
The valuation of the unquoted proprietary investment portfolio is determined to be within a reasonable range of fair values. All valuations tested 
have been recognised in accordance with IFRS and the IPEV Guidelines. Appropriate inputs to the valuations were used and the valuations 
calculated by management are within a reasonable range. Based on our procedures performed we had no material matters to report to the Audit 
and Compliance Committee.

Incorrect calculation of carried interest 
Refer to the Audit and Compliance Committee report 
(page 69 to 73); and Notes 11 and 13 of the ﬁnancial 
statements (pages 121 and 125)
Carried interest receivable is an accrual of the share of the 
proﬁts from funds managed by the Group on behalf of third 
parties. Carried interest payable is an accrual of amounts 
payable to investment executives in respect of the returns 
on successful investments both from Group proprietary 
capital and third-party capital. Carried interest is only paid 
on realisation of investments. 
Carried interest receivable and payable is calculated as 
a percentage of the proﬁts that would be achieved, if the 
investments within each fund or scheme were realised at fair 
value at the year end date, subject to the relevant hurdle 
rates or performance conditions being met. 
Judgment is required in determining the fair value of the 
investment portfolio (as described in the preceding risk 
section) and therefore, whether hurdles or performance 
conditions have been achieved. 
There are multiple carried interest arrangements in place and 
investment executives may participate in more than one 
scheme. These arrangements have been structured over 
multiple periods and include different pools of investments. 
The process of calculating carried interest receivable and 
payable relies on manual calculations. 
Due to the complexities inherent in the arrangements and 
the manual nature of the recognition process, there is a risk 
that the carried interest calculations are incorrectly calculated 
or recognised in the wrong period.
Our procedures extended to testing 99% of the related amount.
We obtained an understanding of management’s processes and controls for 
the calculation of carried interest by performing walkthrough procedures, and 
discussing with management the governance structure and protocols around their 
oversight of the carried interest arrangements. Given the manual nature of the 
calculation, although controls were deemed to be designed effectively, we adopted 
a substantive approach to our testing.
We agreed a sample of calculation methodologies to their respective terms and 
conditions set out in the underlying agreements. 
Our audit procedures on the fair value of the underlying investments are described 
in the preceding risk section. We performed analytical procedures comparing the 
performance of the reference investments in each fund or scheme, taking into 
account the investment realisations, to the related accruals in the ﬁnancial 
statements. 
On a sample basis we:
•  recalculated the returns on the fund or scheme to test that hurdles or performance 
conditions had been met where carried interest was being accrued;
•  recalculated the carried interest accruals for mathematical accuracy and agreed 
the investment fair values to our audit work on the fair value of the investment 
portfolio, the fee rates to the relevant agreements and realised gains to our audit 
work on realised proﬁts;
•  determined the reasonableness of investment exit dates with reference to our 
audit work on the fair value of the investment portfolio and our understanding 
of the life cycle of the relevant investments, and then compared this against the 
anticipated payment dates used to discount the carried interest accrual; and
• veriﬁed the resulting cash ﬂows to approvals and bank statement payments.
Key observations communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee:
Our audit procedures did not identify any matters regarding the recognition of carried interest in accordance with IFRS. All calculations tested 
have been performed in accordance with contractual terms. Based on our procedures performed we had no material matters to report to the 
Audit and Compliance Committee. Audited ﬁnancial statements

and Notes 2 and 11 of the ﬁnancial statements (page 115 and 
121)
Portfolio income is directly attributable to the return from 
investments. This includes: dividends from investee 
companies and income from loans and receivables.
Realised proﬁts originate from disposals of investments. 
Realised proﬁts are calculated as the difference between the 
net proceeds and the investment’s fair value at the beginning  
of the year.
Market expectations and revenue based targets may place 
pressure on management to inﬂuence the recognition of 
portfolio income or realised gains. This may result in 
overstatement or deferral of revenues to assist in meeting 
current or future targets or expectations.
Our procedures extended to testing 69% of the related amount.
We obtained an understanding of management’s processes and controls around 
accounting for portfolio income and realised gains by performing walkthrough 
procedures. We identiﬁed key controls in the processes, assessed design adequacy 
and tested operating effectiveness of those controls. Controls were deemed to be 
designed and operating effectively. 
We performed detailed testing on a sample of transactions to conﬁrm whether they 
had been appropriately recorded in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. 
For portfolio income, on a sample basis, we:
• agreed dividends from investee company to the dividend notice; and
• recalculated interest income based on the terms of the underlying agreements. 
For realised gains, on a sample basis, we:
•  analysed the contract and terms of the sale to determine whether the Group had 
met the stipulated requirements, conﬁrming that the net proceeds and therefore 
the realised proﬁt over opening value could be reliably measured; and
•  re-performed management’s calculations to determine mathematical accuracy 
and conﬁrmed the collection of the net proceeds by agreeing the cash receipt 
to bank statements.
For all samples selected for testing we veriﬁed that revenue is recognised when the 
signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
We performed enquiries of management and read minutes of meetings throughout 
the year and subsequent to the year end in order to address the risk of management 
override of controls to defer revenue recognition. 
Key observations communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee:
Our audit procedures did not identify any material matters regarding the recognition of portfolio income and of realised proﬁts on disposal of 
investments. All transactions tested have been recognised in accordance with contractual terms and IFRS. Based on our procedures performed 
we had no material matters to report to the Audit and Compliance Committee.

Refer to the Audit and Compliance Committee report (pages 
69 to 73); and Note 31 of the ﬁnancial statements (pages 147 
to 148)
The sale of the Debt Management business completed on 
3 March 2017 . The transaction resulted in a proﬁt on disposal 
and discontinued operations recorded within the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
The sale of the Debt Management business, is a transaction 
outside the normal course of business for the Group and has 
a number of associated risks, including: the complex and 
manual nature of the calculation of proﬁt on disposal, and the 
complexities involved in accounting in accordance with IFRS 5 
– Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations (IFRS 5).
We performed the following procedures:
•  read the contract and terms of the sale to verify that the Group met the 
requirements to derecognise the disposal group;
•  re-performed management’s calculations of the proﬁt on disposal, 
checked mathematical accuracy and veriﬁed collection of the net proceeds and

•  performed testing over the amounts classiﬁed on the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income as income from a discontinued operation, for accuracy 
and for compliance with IFRSs; and
•  reviewed the accounting treatment of the disposed Debt Management business 
line and related disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements, for compliance with IFRS 5. 
Key observations communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee:
Our audit procedures did not identify any material matters regarding the sale of the Debt Management business and calculation of the proﬁt on 
disposal. The transaction has been recognised and disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with contractual terms and IFRS. Based on our 
procedures performed we had no material matters to report to the Audit and Compliance Committee.

The scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for 
each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We take into 
account size, risk proﬁle, the organisation of the group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment 
and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
The investment portfolio balance is the most material part of the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position. Monitoring and control 
over the valuation of investments is exercised by management centrally in London, and as such is audited wholly by the London based 
Group audit team. Monitoring and control over the operations of the subsidiaries within the Group, including those located overseas, 
is centralised in London. The Group audit team performed all the work necessary to issue the Group and Parent company audit 
opinion, including undertaking all of the audit work on the risks of material misstatement identiﬁed above. 
Involvement with component teams 
All audit work performed for the purposes of the audit was undertaken by the Group audit team.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identiﬁed misstatements on 
the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the 
economic decisions of the users of the ﬁnancial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our 
audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £58m (2016: £44m), which is 1% (2016: 1%) of net assets. We believe that net assets 
provides us with a consistent year on year basis for determining materiality, and is the most relevant measure to the stakeholders 
of the entity. 
We calculated materiality during the planning stage of the audit then reassessed it based on the 31 March 2017 net asset value, 
and adjusted our audit procedures accordingly. 
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgment was 
that performance materiality was 50% (2016: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely £29m (2016: £22m). This is at the lower end of 
the range of 50% to 75%. In arriving at 50%, we considered the judgmental nature of the valuations in the Consolidated statement 
of ﬁnancial position and the relative value of transactions recorded in the other primary statements, to ensure that total uncorrected 
and undetected audit differences in all accounts did not exceed our materiality of £58m.
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identiﬁed misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit and Compliance Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess 
of £2.9m (2016: £2.0m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the 
Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report. Audited ﬁnancial statements

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 99, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements;
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
ISAs (UK and Ireland) reporting We are required to report to you if, in our opinion, ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the annual 
report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited ﬁnancial statements; or 
•  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group 
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
• otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report whether we have identiﬁed any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired in the course of performing the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual 
report and accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the entity’s performance, business model and strategy; and whether the 
annual report appropriately addresses those matters that we communicated to the Audit and Compliance 
Committee that we consider should have been disclosed.
Companies Act 2006 reporting In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have identiﬁed no material misstatements in the Strategic Report or Directors’ Report. 
We are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
•  the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Listing Rules review requirements We are required to review:
•  the directors’ statement in relation to going concern, set out on page 98 and longer-term viability, set out 
on page 49; and
•  the part of the Corporate Governance statement relating to the company’s compliance with the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code speciﬁed for our review.
Conclusion in respect of all matters on which we are required to report by exception:
We have no exceptions to report in respect of any of the responsibilities above.

Statement on the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten  
the solvency or liquidity of the entity
ISAs (UK and Ireland) reporting We are required to give a statement as to whether we have anything material to add or to draw attention to 
in relation to:
•  the directors’ conﬁrmation in the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the

solvency or liquidity;
•  the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated;
•  the directors’ statement in the ﬁnancial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identiﬁcation of any material 
uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date 
of approval of the ﬁnancial statements; and
•  the directors’ explanation in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as 
to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualiﬁcations or assumptions.
Conclusion
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to in respect of the above.

20 Large investments
The 20 investments listed below account for 89% of the portfolio at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: 70%). This table does not include 
two investments that have been excluded for commercial reasons. For each of our investments we have assessed whether they classify 
as accounting subsidiaries under IFRS and/or subsidiaries under the UK Companies Act. This assessment forms the basis of our 
disclosure of accounting subsidiaries in the ﬁnancial statements. 
The UK Companies Act deﬁnes a subsidiary based on voting rights, with a greater than 50% majority of voting rights resulting in an 
entity being classiﬁed as a subsidiary. IFRS 10 applies a wider test and, if a Group is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee then it has control, 
and hence the investee is deemed an accounting subsidiary. Controlled subsidiaries under IFRS are noted below. None of these 
investments are UK Companies Act subsidiaries.
In accordance with Part 5 of The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Regulations 2013 (“the Regulations”), 3i Investments plc, 
as AIFM, requires all controlled portfolio companies to make available to employees an annual report which meets the disclosure 
requirements of the Regulations. These are available either on the portfolio company’s website or through ﬁling with the relevant 
local authorities.

Portfolio valuation – an explanation
Policy
The valuation policy is the responsibility of the Board, with 
additional oversight and annual review from the Valuations 
Committee. Our policy is to value 3i’s investment portfolio 
at fair value and we achieve this by valuing investments on 
an appropriate basis, applying a consistent approach across 
the portfolio. The policy ensures that the portfolio valuation 
is compliant with the fair value guidelines under IFRS and, in 
so doing, is also compliant with the guidelines issued by the 
International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation board 
(the “IPEV guidelines”). The policy covers the Group’s Private 
Equity, Infrastructure and the residual Debt Management 
investment valuations. Valuations of the investment portfolio of 
the Group and its subsidiaries are performed at each quarter end.
Fair value is the underlying principle and is deﬁned as “the price 
that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date” (IPEV 
guidelines, December 2015). Fair value is therefore an estimate 
and, as such, determining fair value requires the use of judgement.
The quoted assets in our portfolio are valued at their closing bid 
price at the balance sheet date. The majority of the portfolio, 
however, is represented by unquoted investments. 
Private Equity unquoted valuation
To arrive at the fair value of the Group’s unquoted Private Equity 
investments, we ﬁrst estimate the entire value of the company 
we have invested in – the enterprise value. We then apportion 
that enterprise value between 3i, other shareholders and lenders.
Determining enterprise value
The enterprise value is determined using one of a selection 
of methodologies depending on the nature, facts and 
circumstances of the investment.
Where possible, we use methodologies which draw heavily 
on observable market prices, whether listed equity markets 
or reported merger and acquisition transactions, and trading 
updates from our portfolio.
As unquoted investments are not traded on an active market, 
the Group adjusts the estimated enterprise value by a liquidity 
discount. The liquidity discount is applied to the total enterprise 
value and we apply a higher discount rate for investments where 
there are more restrictions on our ability to sell at a time of 
our choosing.
The table opposite outlines in more detail the range of valuation 
methodologies available to us, as well as the inputs and 
adjustments necessary for each.
Apportioning the enterprise value between 3i, other 
shareholders and lenders
Once we have estimated the enterprise value, the following steps 
are taken:
1. We subtract the value of any claims, net of free cash balances, 
that are more senior to the most senior of our investments.
2. The resulting attributable enterprise value is apportioned 
to the Group’s investment, and equal ranking investments by 
other parties, according to contractual terms and conditions, 
to arrive at a fair value of the entirety of the investment. 
The value is then distributed amongst the different loan, 
equity and other ﬁnancial instruments accordingly.
3. If the value attributed to a speciﬁc shareholder loan 
investment in a company is less than its carrying value, 
a shortfall is implied, which is recognised in our valuation. 
In exceptional cases, we may judge that the shortfall is 
temporary; to recognise the shortfall in such a scenario  
would lead to unrepresentative volatility and hence 
we may choose not to recognise the shortfall.
Other factors
In applying this framework, there are additional considerations 
that are factored into the valuation of some assets.
Impacts from structuring
Structural rights are instruments convertible into equity or cash 
at speciﬁc points in time or linked to speciﬁc events. For example, 
where a majority shareholder chooses to sell, and we have a 
minority interest, we may have the right to a minimum return  
on our investment.
Debt instruments, in particular, may have structural rights. In the 
valuation, it is assumed third parties, such as lenders or holders 
of convertible instruments, fully exercise any structural rights 
they might have if they are “in the money” , and that the value to 
the Group may therefore be reduced by such rights held by third 
parties. The Group’s own structural rights are valued on the basis 
they are exercisable on the reporting date.
Assets classiﬁed as “terminal”
If we believe an investment has more than a 50% probability 
of failing in the 12 months following the valuation date, we value 
the investment on the basis of its expected recoverable amount 
in the event of failure. It is important to distinguish between 
our investment failing and the business failing; the failure of 
our investment does not always mean that the business has 
failed, just that our recoverable value has dropped signiﬁcantly. 
This would generally result in the equity and loan components 
of our investment being valued at nil. Value movements in the 
period relating to investments classiﬁed as terminal are classiﬁed 
as provisions in our value movement analysis.
Infrastructure unquoted valuation
The primary valuation methodology used for Infrastructure 
investments is the discounted cash ﬂow method (“DCF”). 
Fair value is estimated by deriving the present value of the 
investment using reasonable assumptions of expected future 
cash ﬂows and the terminal value and date, and the appropriate 
risk-adjusted discount rate that quantiﬁes the risk inherent to the 
investment. The discount rate is estimated with reference to the 
market risk-free rate, a risk adjusted premium and information 
speciﬁc to the investment or market sector.
Debt Management valuation – classiﬁed as other
On 3 March 2017 , the Group completed the disposal of its Debt 
Management business to Investcorp for cash consideration of 
£270 million. The remaining CLO assets are held at fair value. 
Fund investments are based on reported NAV. Fair value is 
based on a range of data including broker quotes if available, 
trading data where available, and data from third-party 
valuation providers. Portfolio and

Most commonly used 
Private Equity valuation 
methodology
Used for investments 
which are proﬁtable 
and for which we can 
determine a set of listed 
companies and precedent 
transactions, where 
relevant, with similar 
characteristics
 
Earnings multiples are applied to the earnings of the 
Company to determine the enterprise value
Earnings
Reported earnings adjusted for non-recurring items, 
such as restructuring expenses, for signiﬁcant corporate 
actions and, in exceptional cases, run-rate adjustments 
to arrive at maintainable earnings
Most common measure is earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
Earnings used are usually the management accounts 
for the 12 months to the quarter end preceding the 
reporting period, unless data from forecasts or the latest 
audited accounts provides a more reliable picture of 
maintainable earnings
Action is valued using its run-rate earnings to the closest 
period end as 3i’s
Earnings multiples
The earnings multiple is derived from comparable listed 
companies or relevant market transaction multiples
We select companies in the same industry and, where 
possible, with a similar business model and proﬁle in 
terms of size, products, services and customers, growth 
rates and geographic focus
We adjust for relative performance in the set of 
comparables, exit expectations and other company 
speciﬁc factors
A liquidity discount is 
applied to the enterprise 
value, typically between 
5% and 15%, using factors 
such as our alignment with

For a small proportion of our smaller investments (less than 1% of the portfolio value), the valuation is determined by a more 
mechanical approach using information from the latest audited accounts. Equity shares are valued at the higher of an earnings or 
net assets methodology. Fixed income shares and loan investments are measured using amortised cost and any implied impairment, 
in line with IFRS.
Consistent with IPEV guidelines, all equity investments are held at fair value using the most appropriate methodology 
and no investments are held at historical cost. Portfolio and other information

Boiler room and other scams
In the past, some of our shareholders have received 
unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence concerning 
investment matters from organisations or persons claiming or 
implying that they have some connection with the Company. 
These are typically from overseas based “brokers” who target 
UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to 
be worthless or high risk shares in UK or overseas investments. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports 
into the Company. These approaches are operated out of what 
is more commonly known as a “boiler room” . You may also be 
approached by brokers offering to purchase your shares for an 
upfront payment in the form of a broker fee, tax payment or 
de-restriction fee. This is a common secondary scam operated 
by the boiler rooms.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
• Always ensure the ﬁrm is on the Financial Conduct Authority 
(“FCA”) Register and is allowed to give ﬁnancial advice before 
handing over your money. You can check at www.fca.org.uk/
register;
• Double-check the caller is from the ﬁrm they say they are – ask 
for their name and telephone number and say you will call them 
back. Check their identity by calling the ﬁrm using the contact 
number listed on the FCA Register. This is important as there 
have been instances where an authorised ﬁrm’s website has 
been cloned but with a few subtle changes, such as a different 
phone number or false email address;
• Check the FCA’s list of known unauthorised overseas ﬁrms. 
However, these ﬁrms change their name regularly, so even 
if a ﬁrm is not listed it does not mean they are legitimate. 
Always check that they are listed on the FCA Register; and
• If you have any doubts, call the Financial Conduct Authority 
Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768. If you deal with an 
unauthorised ﬁrm, you will not be eligible to receive payment 
under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

Alternative Investment Funds (“AIFs”) At 31 March 2017 , 
3i Investments plc as AIFM, managed ﬁve AIFs.
Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”) is the regulated 
manager of AIFs. Within 3i, this is 3i Investments plc.
Approved Investment Trust Company This is a particular UK 
tax status maintained by 3i Group plc, the parent company 
of 3i Group. An approved investment trust company is a UK 
company which meets certain conditions set out in the UK tax 
rules which include a requirement for the company to undertake 
portfolio investment activity that aims to spread investment 
risk and for the company’s shares to be listed on an approved 
exchange. The “approved” status for an investment trust must 
be agreed by the UK tax authorities and its beneﬁt is that certain 
proﬁts of the company, principally its capital proﬁts, are not 
taxable in the UK.
Assets under management (“AUM”) A measure of the total 
assets that 3i has to invest or manages on behalf of shareholders 
and third-party investors for which it receives a fee. AUM is 
measured at fair value. The measurement changed in the year 
from residual value to fair value to reﬂect the scale of 3i’s business 
and, in the absence of a third-party fund in Private Equity, it is not 
a measure of fee generating capability.
Base Erosion and Proﬁt Shifting (“BEPS”) Project is an OECD 
initiative that was launched in 2013, at the request of the G20 
countries, to develop speciﬁc, detailed proposals, rules and 
instruments required to equip governments and tax authorities 
to address the BEPS challenge and the proposals were 
delivered to and approved by the G20 leaders in November 
2015. Countries are now in the process of considering and 
implementing changes to their domestic tax laws and 
international tax treaties to give effect to the recommendations 
made by the BEPS project team.
Board The Board of Directors of the Company.
Capital redemption reserve is established in respect of the 
redemption of the Company’s ordinary shares.
Capital reserve recognises all proﬁts that are capital in nature 
or have been allocated to capital. Following changes to 
the Companies Act, the Company amended its Articles of 
Association at the 2012 Annual General Meeting to allow these 
proﬁts to be distributable by way of a dividend.
Carried interest is accrued on the realised and unrealised 
proﬁts generated taking relevant performance hurdles into 
consideration, assuming all investments were realised at the 
prevailing book value. Carried interest is only actually paid or 
received when the relevant performance hurdles are met and 
the accrual is discounted to reﬂect expected payment periods.
Carried interest receivable is generated on third-party capital 
over the life of the relevant fund when relevant performance 
criteria are met.
Collateralised Loan Obligation (“CLO”) A form of securitisation 
where payments from multiple loans are pooled together and 
passed on to different classes of owners in various tranches.
Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) imposes obligations on 
ﬁnancial groups and entities to identify and report details, relating 
to the foreign investors investing in such groups and entities, 
to the local tax authority who then exchange the information 
with the other relevant tax authorities.
Company 3i Group plc.
Country by Country reporting (“CbC Reporting”) refers to a 
requirement for large multinational groups, operating in different 
countries, to ﬁle an annual report detailing certain information 
about the activities of the entities in the Group, on a country by 
country basis, covering the countries in which the Group entities 
operate. This new requirement applies to the Group for its 
accounting periods beginning after 1 April 2016. Portfolio and

movement in the carrying value of Group subsidiaries, classiﬁed 
as investment entities under IFRS 10, between the start and 
end of the accounting period converted into sterling using the 
exchange rates at the date of the movement.
Fair value through proﬁt or loss (“FVTPL ”) is an IFRS 
measurement basis permitted for assets and liabilities which 
meet certain criteria. Gains and losses on assets and liabilities 
measured as FVTPL are recognised directly in the Statement 
of comprehensive income.
Fee income is earned directly from investee companies when an 
investment is ﬁrst made and through the life of the investment. 
Fees that are earned on a ﬁnancing arrangement are considered 
to relate to a ﬁnancial asset measured at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss and are recognised when that investment is made. 
Fees that are earned on the basis of providing an ongoing 
service to the investee company are recognised as that service 
is provided.
Fees receivable from external funds are fees received by the 
Group, from third parties, for the management of Private Equity 
and Infrastructure funds.
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) is US tax 
legislation aimed at preventing offshore tax avoidance by US 
persons. The rules impose obligations on non-US ﬁnancial groups 
and entities to identify and report details relating to US investors 
who have invested in those groups and entities.
Foreign exchange on investments arises on investments made 
in currencies that are different from the functional currency of 
the Group entity. Investments are translated at the exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. At each subsequent 
reporting date investments are translated to sterling at the 
exchange rate ruling at that date.
Gross investment return (“GIR”) includes proﬁt and loss 
on realisations, increases and decreases in the value of the 
investments we hold at the end of a period, any income 
received from the investments such as interest, dividends 
and fee income and foreign exchange movements. GIR is 
measured as a percentage of the opening portfolio value.
Interest income from investment portfolio is recognised as 
it accrues. When the fair value of an investment is assessed 
to be below the principal value of a loan the Group recognises 
a provision against any interest accrued from the date of the 
assessment going forward until the investment is assessed 
to have recovered in value.
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) are 
accounting standards issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (“IASB”). The Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements are required to be prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Investment basis Accounts prepared assuming that IFRS 
10 had not been introduced. Under this basis, we fair value 
portfolio companies at the level we believe provides the most 
comprehensive ﬁnancial information.
The commentary in the Strategic report refers to this basis 
as we believe it provides a more understandable view of 
our performance. Portfolio and other information
