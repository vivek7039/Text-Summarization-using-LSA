3 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Strategic Report Highlights Overview
During 201 7 , London Stock Exchange Group continued 
to make good progress executing its growth strategy, 
delivering another year of strong performance. The 
Group has also addressed several strategic corporate, 
macroeconomic and political events.
In the early part of the year, the Group navigated the 
termination of its attempted merger with Deutsche 
Börse following the European Commission’s 
prohibition decision. We worked hard to find the 
appropriate solutions to the competition review.  
LSEG has always been committed to maintaining 
excellent relationships with all of its stakeholders, 
including the regulators in its significant markets, 
and taking into account all of the relevant factors,  
the Board concluded that it could not meet the late 
stage request from the EU Commission for 
divestment of a key Italian business.
Throughout the merger discussions, the executive 
management remained focused on the performance 
of our business divisions, through organic and 
inorganic growth, as was evident from the acquisition 
of The Yield Book and Citi Fixed Income Indices 
business. The transaction, which completed at the 
end of August, enhances and complements the 
Group’s Information Services data and analytics 
offering and will allow FTSE Russell to capitalise 
further on key industry trends.
Following the UK’s decision to leave the EU, the Group 
continues to ensure that our businesses are well 
prepared for any eventual outcome. As a systemically 
important financial markets infrastructure business, 
the Group has a responsibility to ensure the orderly 
functioning of markets and to ensure continuity of 
service for the benefit of our customers, shareholders 
and other stakeholders. With a strong global footprint 
and significant infrastructure in a number of 
geographies across the UK, Eurozone, US and Asia, 
the Group is extraordinarily well placed to adapt to 
the consequences of the eventual exit terms. On 
behalf of all our stakeholders and partners, the 
Group continues to argue strongly for a defined 
implementation period and the minimisation of the 
fragmentation of systems and processes designed to 
make the financial markets more efficient, stable and 
safe. We also firmly believe that enhanced regulatory 
supervision and regulation on a global scale will far 
outweigh any short term political benefits of location 
based policies for financial markets infrastructure.
Throughout the year, a key focus for the Group was 
planning to ensure that our systems and processes 
were ready for the major changes resulting from  
the implementation of MiFID II, which took effect 
immediately after the year end. All venues went live 
in January 2018 in one of the most extensive 
technology roll-outs the Group has ever undertaken. 
David Warren discusses the opportunities that  
MiFID II presents for the Group as the only financial 
markets infrastructure business operating on  
an Open Access basis elsewhere in this Report.
Governance
The final quarter of the year saw the announcement 
of a process for succession of the Chief Executive.  
In early October, the Board and the Chief Executive, 
Xavier Rolet, confirmed an agreement that he would 
leave the Group by the end of 2018 to ensure a 
smooth transition. Shareholders will recall that Xavier 
“ The Group remains  
well positioned for  
the opportunities  
ahead and remains 
confident of delivering 
further success and  
value for shareholders.”

Rolet had offered to step down in order to smooth the 
path for the planned merger. As a result, following  
the end of the merger process with Deutsche Börse  
in March 201 7 , it was clear to the Board that the Group 
needed clarity over succession. Unfortunately, one 
shareholder requisitioned a General Meeting to seek 
to undo the agreed plan. The Chief Executive’s 
departure was, as a consequence, accelerated, and a 
motion to remove your Chairman proposed by the 
shareholder was firmly defeated. Regrettably, this 
process disrupted the organised succession process 
and caused considerable diversion of time and 
energy. The process of appointing the new Chief 
Executive is now advanced with a strong field of high 
quality candidates. When the new Chief Executive is 
announced and appropriately integrated into the 
Group, I will step down at the AGM in 2019,  
to allow a new team to take the business forward.
The Board firmly believes that it followed appropriate 
governance principles, considering shareholders’ and 
other stakeholders’ interests at all times, but it is 
important that our actions are reviewed and 
consideration is given to any lessons to be learned. 
An external review is being conducted by Simon 
Collins, a former UK Chairman and Senior Partner of 
KPMG, who has the deep experience and technical 
expertise to undertake this work. The Board will share 
the summary of key conclusions with shareholders  
in due course.
As I said at the General Meeting in December, Boards 
must take into account all relevant information in 
making their decisions. It will never be possible for all 
of that information to be in the public domain, much 
as some may wish it to be. That is one reason why 
shareholders delegate decisions to a Board. The 
returns that result from these decisions are not 
achieved risk free. Boards are not committees, but are 
real risk taking bodies providing oversight of executive 
management and guiding the strategic direction  
of the company. I share my further thoughts on 
corporate governance later in this report on page 56. 
The events of the last quarter of 201 7 challenged the 
Board to think deeply about its role, the culture of the 
Company and the actions it takes in the best interests 
of all stakeholders collectively. I am enormously 
grateful for all the time and effort expended by the 
Board members during this period. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code demands that attendance at the 
Board and its committees are logged. In addition to 
Board and Committee meetings, the Non-Executive 
Directors of LSEG attended many more meetings 
during both the possible merger with Deutsche Börse 
and the process of preparation of the notice of the 
December General Meeting than are recorded in our 
Governance report.
At the end of the year, the Board was joined by Val 
Rahmani whose strong technology and business 
background will provide valuable expertise as we 
continue to grow our global business. As noted, in 
November, Xavier Rolet stepped down from his role as 
a Director and CEO. My colleagues and I acknowledge 
the immense contribution he made to the 
development of your Company. There have been no 
other changes to the Board’s composition in 201 7 .
As detailed in the Governance Report on page 56,  
the Board remains committed to further restoring  
the gender diversity of the Board, a process that 
Dividend policy
We operate a sustainable, progressive dividend policy, aiming to operate in a target range of 2.5–3.0x  
dividend cover.

was interrupted by restructuring ahead of the 
possible merger with Deutsche Börse. The Group  
is also a signatory to the UK’s HM Treasury Women  
in Finance Charter to improve gender diversity within 
senior leadership teams and we have set ourselves  
a stretching target of 40% female representation  
in senior roles by the end of 2020. We are currently  
at 33%.
Corporate Social Responsibility 
The Group is in a privileged position at the heart  
of the financial markets and we are pleased to 
support corporates, issuers and investors integrate 
sustainability and diversity as a core part of their 
capital raising and investment decisions. We 
continue to work closely with global and regional 
charities in the communities in which we operate. 
The selected charities focus on helping young  
people to develop vital life skills and we encourage 
employees to become actively involved in their work 
through paid volunteering days. In 201 7 , the Group’s 
Foundation donated £1.4 million to various charities.
Financial Performance
The Group has continued to deliver a strong financial 
performance across its business divisions. Total 
income grew to £1,955 million, up 18%. Adjusted 
operating profit was £812 million, while adjusted  
EPS was 148.7 pence, an increase of 19%.
Consistent with the Group’s capital allocation 
framework, we conducted an on-market share 
buyback of £200 million, an amount broadly 
equivalent to the return we would have made had the 
merger with Deutsche Börse proceeded as planned.
Reflecting the Group’s strong performance and our 
commitment to sustainable, progressive dividends, 
the Board is proposing a final dividend of 37 .2 pence 
per share, resulting in a 19% year-on-year increase  
in the total dividend to 5 1.6 pence per share. The final 
dividend will be paid on 30 May 2018 to shareholders 
on the register as at 4 May 2018.
Conclusion
I would like to thank Board members and all of our 
excellent employees for another successful year in 
the development of this great company. The Group 
remains well positioned for the opportunities ahead 
and remains confident of delivering further success 
and value for shareholders.

5 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Strategic Report Chairman’s statement of The Yield Book, FTSE Russell is the most diverse 
index business globally in product terms and is  
well positioned to seek to benefit from the strong 
underlying industry trends, including the demand  
for broader multi-asset capabilities. As a result, FTSE 
Russell has further enhanced its position as a leading 
global index provider with approximately US$15 
trillion of assets benchmarked to its indexes.
Indexes are firmly embedded across the investment 
process and FTSE Russell has the ability to provide 
customers with a comprehensive product range and 
a deeper data and analytics offering. Institutional 
clients remain the core client base for FTSE Russell. 
The decisions made by these clients around index 
selection, investment products and strategies have  
a great influence on the entire investment sector, 
creating a demand for products and services to 
execute the strategies, for example ETFs and 
structured products, tracking the indexes they use. 
Currently, over US$600 billion of ETF assets under 
management track FTSE Russell indexes. FTSE 
Russell is also well positioned in emerging markets 
with a strong track record of developing country-
focused benchmarks. A number of indexes and 
partnerships were launched over the year including 
in Malaysia, China, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. 
The combination of client relationships and product 
capabilities also drives innovation, often in 
partnership with our customers, in areas such as 
environmental, social and governance (ESG). For 
example, FTSE Russell announced that the world’s 
largest pension fund, The Government Pension 
Executing our Strategy
London Stock Exchange Group delivered another 
strong performance in 201 7 . We continue to 
successfully execute our strategy to grow and 
diversify the Group, operating on an Open Access 
basis in partnership with our customers. We have 
seen growth across all of our core business pillars – 
Intellectual Property, Risk and Balance sheet 
management and Capital Formation – and have 
continued to invest in new initiatives and acquisitions 
to drive further expansion and efficiencies. The Group 
is strategically, operationally and financially well 
positioned to capitalise on a range of opportunities 
ahead and to enhance shareholder returns. 
Confidence in our outlook led us to set financial 
targets at an Investor Update event in June, which  
will deliver growth in Group EBITDA margin to c.55% 
by 2019. 
As a leading financial markets infrastructure group, 
we have continued to grow our global footprint, 
including strengthening our presence in Asia and  
in the United States. We have also made selective 
acquisitions that develop our client offering, while 
meeting our strict strategic and financial criteria. 
This included increasing our majority shareholding  
in LCH, the acquisition of Mergent and the acquisition 
of The Yield Book and Citi Fixed Income Indices, 
which provides opportunities to significantly enhance 
FTSE Russell’s fixed income analytics and index 
business. These acquisitions also help to expand  
LSEG’s presence in the United States, and our global 
distribution capabilities. 
MiFID II Opportunities
The implementation of MiFID II, which took place  
on 3 January 2018, was a key focus for a number  
of our businesses and the transition to the new 
regulatory regime has in overall terms been very 
smooth for LSEG. I would like to thank everyone 
involved in the programme, which was a truly 
collaborative effort across the Group and provides  
us with further opportunities to differentiate 
ourselves with our customers. 
Importantly, MiFID II embeds and recognises Open 
Access as a key principle in financial markets, and is 
one we have been operating under for a number of 
years. The new rules will introduce greater competition 
in financial markets, promoting transparency and 
innovation while helping to reduce costs and leading 
to better risk management. Our Open Access 
philosophy positions us well as we have a proven 
track record of operating businesses in partnership 
with our customers. As we stated in our Investor 
Update in June, a number of these businesses,  
such as LCH, CurveGlobal, Turquoise and MTS, are 
already beginning to benefit from the new MiFID II 
environment and we expect that they will be able  
to further grow their customer offerings.
Intellectual Property
In our Information Services Business, FTSE Russell 
continued to perform strongly delivering double-digit 
revenue growth, up by more than 30%. This is  
a consolidating sector where FTSE Russell has 
successfully differentiated itself through its global 
reach and breadth of offering. With the acquisition  
“ We continue to 
successfully execute  
our strategy to grow  
and diversify the  
Group, operating on  
an Open Access basis  
in partnership with  
our customers”
 David Warren
 Interim Group Chief Executive Officer

Chief Executive’s statement Investment Fund of Japan (GPIF), selected the new 
FTSE Blossom Japan Index as a core ESG benchmark. 
The index uses FTSE Russell’s innovative ESG Ratings 
data model and highlights a growing trend among 
asset owners to integrate ESG considerations into 
their investment strategies.
Also within Information Services, UnaVista, the Group’s 
platform for all matching, validation and reconciliation 
needs, continues to help c.6,000 clients from around 
the world to meet their regulatory reporting including 
additional requirements under MiFID II. 
Risk and Balance Sheet Management
In our Post T rade business, LCH Group achieved 
another strong performance with record volumes 
across multiple clearing services in 201 7 , driven by  
new business as well as additional flow from existing 
customers. SwapClear cleared over US$870 trillion of 
notional driven by significant on-boarding of new 
clients across Europe, the Americas and Asia Pacific. 
The SwapClear service now has more than 1 00 
members and over 200 dealers clearing in 55 countries 
and remains the leading OTC rates liquidity pool in the 
world. Compression volumes also continued to rise, 
with over US$600 trillion compressed, up 59% on 201 6, 
a further example of how the cycle of trading, clearing 
and compressing is becoming increasingly routine. 
The OTC clearing services delivered good, double-digit 
revenue growth in the year.
LCH is well-placed to address capital and margin 
challenges prevailing in the vast FX market, which 
trades around US$5 trillion a day. The introduction  
of new bilateral margin rules has been a catalyst for 
members to start centrally clearing with over US$1 1 
trillion in notional cleared through ForexClear in 201 7 , 
compared to US$3.2 trillion in the previous year. The 
search for greater efficiencies is also driving growth 
in LCH’s repo and CDS clearing services, which both 
continued to expand their product offerings. LCH 
SwapAgent, a new service for the non-cleared 
derivatives market, processed its first trades and  
also extended the efficiencies and infrastructure  
of clearing to the non-cleared Cross-Currency Basis 
Swap market.
The Group’s post trade services in Italy also recorded 
a good performance with Monte Titoli delivering the 
benefits of T2S to its members.
Capital Formation
LSEG’s range of debt and equity markets provides 
firms across the globe with access to deep and liquid 
pools of capital. Our markets in London and Italy 
helped companies raise over £44 billion in new and 
further issues welcoming companies such as Pirelli, 
Allied Irish Bank and Eddie Stobart. London Stock 
Exchange was the largest European exchange with 
108 IPOs in 201 7 and second globally by money 
raised. The ongoing success of London’s AIM market, 
which saw a near 45% increase in new capital raised, 
is also being replicated on AIM Italia with 24 new 
admissions in 201 7 .
Our commitment to support growth SME companies 
was also demonstrated through ELITE, which has 
continued to expand globally, with partnerships 
secured in West Africa, Brazil, China and Saudi  
Arabia in 201 7 . We also confirmed the launch of  
the first ELITE Basket Bond, which is made up of  
10 innovative Italian ELITE companies. Over 700 
companies from across 27 countries are now part  
of the ELITE community and we expect this number 
to continue to grow over the coming year. 
In May, we launched our new International Securities 
Market (ISM) in London, an additional market for the 
issuance of primary debt targeted at institutional  
and professional investors, with a healthy pipeline  
of issuers. London Stock Exchange also continues  
to be at forefront of innovative green finance with  
the number of green bonds issued double that of  
the prior year. 
CurveGlobal, the new interest rate derivatives 
platform, has built a firm foundation since launch 
reflecting a growing appetite for more capital-
efficient and open alternatives to existing derivatives 
trading services. CurveGlobal is proving itself to be a 
highly efficient differentiator in the exchange traded 
derivatives space, offering genuine choice and 
liquidity to the market. Productive partnerships with 
inter-dealer brokers and technology providers are 
also helping to increase flow to the platform. 
Significantly, in the context of Best Execution rules 
under MiFID II, CurveGlobal products listed on LSE 
Derivatives Market (LSEDM) continue to be best price 
or tied the majority of the time.
Our pan-European trading platform, Turquoise, is 
working with customers as they adjust their trading 
strategies in response to MiFID II. Turquoise Plato 
Block Discovery, for example, set new records in  
201 7 with total value traded in the year up 600%  
to €54.5 billion.
LSEG Technology
The main focus of Technology is to underpin and 
support the development of in-house solutions for our 
capital markets, clearing and information businesses. 
Our technology, combined with our deep expertise in 
financial markets infrastructure, enables us to deliver 
market-leading services that put us at the forefront  
of new product ideas and innovation. In 201 7 , we 
announced that we would better position our 
technology offering by bringing several products and 
businesses together under a new LSEG Technology 
brand. As part of the re-organisation, we divested  
2 small technology assets as we focus on the key 
development opportunities ahead.
We have continued to work on the application  
of a range of emerging technologies, including 
distributed ledger technology, cloud-enabled 
computing, machine learning and big data. LSEG 
takes an “active investment” approach, where we  
seek to combine the best of our domain expertise  
in financial markets infrastructure and technology 
with the best of the partner companies we choose  
to work with. For example, we are collaborating with 
IBM to create a distributed shared registry containing 
a record of all shareholder transactions and helping  
to open up new opportunities for trading and investing 
for European SMEs.
Summary
LSEG operates in a dynamic global industry and  
there will continue to be both new challenges and 
opportunities ahead. LSEG continues to perform 
strongly in an evolving macroeconomic, regulatory 
and political environment, including Brexit. With the 
UK set to leave the EU in March next year, LSEG has a 
responsibility to ensure the orderly functioning of our 
markets and to contribute to the financial stability of 
the global economy as a whole. LSEG currently serves 
clients in a number of geographies across the United 
Kingdom, Europe, United States and Asia and, as such, 
we have plans and options for continuing to provide a 
seamless service. Our partnership approach with our 
customers continues to enable us to understand their 
needs against a changing regulatory and market 
backdrop and to develop our products and services  
to help our clients with the challenges they face. 
In summary, our strategic ambition remains the 
same – to deliver best in class capabilities, drive 
global growth and develop our customer partnership 
approach. Our highly capable and experienced 
management team remains focused on the 
opportunities ahead, to deliver the financial targets 
we have set for the next 2 years, while at the same 
time continuing to invest and expand. The Group is 
well positioned for further successful development 
and growth.

data
London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) is a 
global financial markets infrastructure 
provider which operates in multiple regions  
in order to meet our customers’ needs. 
Headquartered in London and with significant 
operations elsewhere across the world in  
North America, Italy, France and Sri Lanka,  
the Group employs approximately 4,900 
people. Global presence is also reflected in  
the geographical distribution of our income,  
with 40% in Sterling, 32% in Euro, 26% in  
US Dollar and 2% in other currencies.
The Group plays a vital economic and social  
role within the global economy through its 
interconnected businesses, enabling companies  
to access funding for growth and development,  
make informed investment decisions and manage 
financial risks. In turn, on a broader macro-economic 
basis, this provides greater efficiency in accessing 
and managing capital, helping to fund innovation, 
generate wealth and create jobs.
How we add value
Our businesses are formed of interconnected 
business areas: 1) Intellectual Property; 2) Risk  
and Balance Sheet Management; and 3) Capital 
Formation. Our presence across the financial markets 
infrastructure value chain allows us to provide a 
platform for serving customers at each and every 
point and meeting a wide range of their needs.  
The model below shows our businesses and the  
key connections between them: 
Intellectual Property:
 – Our Information Services division provides customers 
with an extensive range of valuable information and 
data products, that inform investment decisions and 
capital allocation, including indexes, data on pricing, 
trading and valuations
Risk and Balance Sheet Management:
 – The Group offers a full range of central 
counterparty (CCP) clearing services and collateral 
management solutions which provide strong risk 
management and capital efficiency benefits. These 
allow our buy-side and sell-side customers to 
operate more effectively, enabling increased 
trading and investment activities
Capital Formation:
 – Our Primary Markets provide choice and 
connections between a wide range of issuers and 
investors, enabling domestic and international 
companies to raise capital effectively
 – Our Secondary Markets provide liquid and  
deep access to financial securities to enable 
improved price formation, transparency and 
trading efficiency
Group Technology
Supports the 3 business segments. It delivers financial 
markets infrastructure IT to various businesses within

Our activities across the financial markets value chain
8 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
What we do – our business model  Customer Partnership
 – We believe that aligning our strategy, services  
and products to the needs and interests of our 
customers is central to supporting long-term  
value creation, enabling innovation in products 
which can be rapidly adopted
 – In some businesses, we are joint owners with our 
customers which helps ensure continued relevance 
and uptake of the business within the operating 
landscape, and targeted development goals
Examples:
Several of our operating companies such as LCH, 
Turquoise, CurveGlobal and MTS are owned and 
governed in partnership with our customers who 
have varying minority shareholder interests in each. 
These customers play an active role in shaping the 
services offered by these businesses for the benefit 
of all users.
Open Access
 – Open Access is the principle which lies at the heart 
of free and fair markets, and is enshrined in MiFID II
 – We believe customers should have the choice  
of where they place their business. In particular,  
we support non-discriminatory access to trading 
and clearing infrastructures as we believe this 
provides greater market efficiencies by reducing 
fragmentation and barriers to service uptake 
 – We provide access to all of our markets and products 
for a wide range of users, including those that offer 
competing services to parts of the Group. Access  
to our services is not conditional on taking a suite  
or bundle of different services. This open access 
approach is in contrast to most other exchanges  
and capital markets infrastructure providers
Examples:
LCH provides clearing services to a number of 
non-Group owned equities, derivatives and fixed 
income trading venues such as Nex Group, Euronext 
and Cboe Europe Equities. 
FTSE Russell also licences its indexes to other 
exchange operators, such as CME in the US and the 
Singapore Stock Exchange, enabling them to list and 
trade derivatives products based on our indexes.
Intellectual property
Our proprietary data and the resulting analysis 
generated across our businesses deliver value-add 
products and services that strengthen our 
customers’ ability to make informed risk,  
trading and investment decisions.
Risk management
The management of risk is fundamental to 
maintaining our role as a diversified global financial 
markets infrastructure provider in order to maintain 
stakeholder confidence in our businesses. 
Technology
Secure and stable high-performing technology is 
critical to the operation of the Group’s businesses.  
We continue to invest in our technology in order to 
maintain and enhance the quality, resilience and 
efficiency of our platforms, while also creating 
innovation to serve our customers.
Regulatory expertise
Many of the markets we operate are highly regulated 
and subject to ongoing regulatory change. We have 
proven expertise in operating transparent, efficient 
and well governed market infrastructure in regulated 
markets globally, providing services that are trusted, 
independent and resilient.
Customer trust
Our network of customers and their ongoing input  
to, and support for, our businesses are vital to  
our ability to provide efficient financial markets 
infrastructure across the value chain and underpin 
customers’ success. 
People
Our people are at the heart of what we do – we are 
committed to attracting, developing and retaining 
exceptional talent and capabilities in order to deliver 
on our strategy.
What we need to operate our businesses and deliver value
There are a number of factors that combine to give us competitive advantages: 
NEED HELP?
Like any industry, global financial markets 
infrastructure has its own unique language.  
For that reason, we have included a glossary  
on pages 162–165.
What makes us different – our competitive advantages
In addition to providing businesses of scale across the value chain, our business model incorporates 2 key 
approaches that differentiate us from competitors in the global financial markets infrastructure industry: 
CAPITAL ALLOCATION FRAMEWORK
We use an established internal capital allocation 
framework to help us determine the most effective 
use of capital to support growth in the business, 
including investment in new products and services 
and also acquisitions to further enhance Group 
capabilities. The returns from such investments are 
benchmarked against alternative uses of capital, 
including distribution of cash to shareholders.

1. Globalisation and growing global wealth
2. Changing investment behaviours
3. Customer balance sheet and operational/capital 
constraints
4. Innovative and consolidating competitive 
landscape
5. Regulatory change
1. Globalisation and growing global wealth 
Global wealth continues to grow, with total AUM 
expected to almost double from US$84.9 trillion in  
2016 to US$145.4 trillion by 2025
1
. The distribution  
of wealth has also continued to evolve through 201 7 , 
both regionally and across market participant types. 
Developing markets continue to increase their share 
of the world’s assets – between 2000 and 201 7 their 
share of global wealth increased from 1 1 % to 19%, 
and by 2022 this is expected to reach 22%
2
. The pace 
of growth in these economies is expected to continue 
to outpace that of developed markets, indicating the 
importance of maintaining a global presence as 
customers themselves become more global, and 
serve a geographically wider range of clients.
Implications for LSEG
The Group is a global financial markets infrastructure 
provider and continues to expand its presence and 
establish partnerships in strategically important 
regions to serve customers. Of particular focus are 
the US and Asia, as emphasised by the acquisitions 
of Mergent and The Yield Book, and numerous 
strategic partnerships within China and India which 
facilitate access to emerging markets through  
our hubs.
We are building a global, inter-connected relationship 
management approach with commonality across 
businesses and customer segments. This is reflected 
in both our operations, with offices in 19 countries, 
and the distribution of our income by currency, 
which is increasingly diversified.

2. Changing investment behaviours
While the market is starting to observe an uptick in 
global economic growth
3
, there remains elevated 
geopolitical uncertainty and low volatility. 
Accordingly, investor needs and services required 
from infrastructure providers are evolving. Investors 
are utilising products that facilitate low cost 
investment, driving the observed trends in movement 
of AUM from active to passive management through 
tracking vehicles such as ETPs. The global ETP market 
has seen a five-fold rise in AUM over the last decade 
and is expected to continue to increase through 2018, 
with portfolio managers seeing the potential for 
assets in passive management to almost double from 
the current level of 22%
4
. The importance of data, 
technology and the innovations and efficiencies that 
can be provided with new tools is increasingly 
understood by customers, who are requiring new 
servicing and commercial models to maximise the 
opportunities presented.
Alongside this, the Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) space has received significant 
attention, reflecting both investor appetite to 
incorporate aspects of Sustainable Investment into 
strategies, and political support from legislation and 
initiatives such as the UN Principles for Responsible 
Investment and 2015 Paris Agreement.
Implications for LSEG
LSEG is well positioned for the anticipated further 
growth in assets within passive investment through 
our FTSE Russell business’s low cost, scalable  
model, as well as its global presence and sales.  
Our acquisitions of Mergent and The Yield Book 
expanded our ability to provide customer solutions 
in additional asset classes, with The Yield Book 
increasing the AUM benchmarked to our indexes  
to c.US$15 trillion.
Additionally, the Group’s Sustainable Investment 
models have helped numerous customers launch 
ESG products and raise capital through Green Bonds, 
a product whose profile continues to increase.

Market trends and our response 5. Regulatory change
During 201 7 , significant regulatory initiatives that the 
Group has highlighted in previous reports, impacting 
various businesses, continued to take shape. Other 
regulatory initiatives increased in prominence during 
the past year and are now a significant focus for us, 
in particular cyber security rules and standards, the 
evolution of sustainable investment rules and 
products, and regulatory scrutiny of emerging 
financial technology. All these initiatives evolve in  
the context of the uncertainty caused by the UK 
referendum decision to leave the European Union 
(Brexit) and the potential for significant changes in 
US policy. On the following pages we provide our 
assessment of likely regulatory changes and their 
impacts on the Group.
Brexit update
In December 201 7 , the European Commission (EC) 
recommended to the European Council that it begin 
discussions on the next phase of ‘orderly withdrawal’  
of the UK from the EU. This followed the joint report 
publication by the EU and UK on the key issues relating 
to the Withdrawal Agreement. It was made clear that 
the institution’s position on ‘transitional arrangements’ 
was that they must be time limited and consist of the 
prolongation of the whole EU acquis. Uncertainty 
continues and could impact market sentiment and 
levels of activity including IPOs.
Implications for LSEG
As part of a structured Brexit programme formed  
by the Group, we are engaging with UK and EU  
Brexit policy leads to advise on financial market 
infrastructure considerations. Our key objectives are 
maintaining London’s position as a global financial 
hub, providing continuity of cross-border financial 
services and protecting against policies which may 
result in fragmentation of financial markets. Both 
EU and UK authorities have approached LSEG and 
requested contingency plans for several businesses.
3. Customer balance sheet and operational/
capital constraints
Recent regulation such as MiFID II, Fundamental 
Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) and EMIR has 
iteratively developed, and now captures a wider 
universe of entities; these customers are facing 
significant regulatory change, creating cost, capital, 
risk and conduct challenges alongside difficult 
market conditions. Costs and operational challenges 
are increasing as a result, and customers are evolving 
their operating models and seeking methods of 
reducing inefficiencies in processes.
Implications for LSEG
The Group understands that efficiency is key for 
customers, for both operational processes and 
capital efficiency, so that their efforts can be 
directed to value-creating activities through growth, 
investment decisions and intelligent use of capital. 
Reduced fragmentation and consolidated, 
standardised information greatly help customers 
and the Group is focused on providing solutions that 
solve these issues, such as LCH SwapAgent, LCH 
Spider and Turquoise’s block trading functionality.
Our partnership approach leaves us well positioned 
to play a leading role in addressing customer 
challenges across the industry, and various services 
within the Group are solely focused on assisting 
customers in areas aligned with regulation. While  
low trading volumes may adversely affect our Capital 
Markets businesses, there is potential for increased 
demand for risk management and capital efficiency 
solutions. As customers continue to seek services to 
help manage capital and operational constraints, 
there are opportunities for collaborative and 
innovative solutions, and for LSEG to be central to  
the future shape of financial markets infrastructure.

4. Innovative and consolidating  
competitive landscape
Regulation remains a key driver of client needs  
and service provision, while developments in new 
technologies are facilitating a reordering of 
traditional industry boundaries. Combined with  
the increasing client need for integrated access 
points to various fragmented services, these trends 
are widening the definition of the financial markets 
infrastructure industry, and thereby driving 
consolidation of providers within the competitive 
landscape and encouraging new entrants.
Throughout 201 7 , there have been ongoing 
acquisitions and partnerships across trading, 
information services, post trade and technology 
services as the industry evolves. We expect this  
to continue through 2018, in particular within  
the high-growth areas of data, analytics and risk 
management, with innovation and collaboration 
driving the development of new solutions and 
delivering benefits to customers.
Implications for LSEG
LSEG has been active within the industry in 2017 , 
acting upon our strategic pillars through 
partnerships and inorganic opportunities such as 
the acquisitions of The Yield Book and Mergent,  
to enhance our positioning as a global financial 
markets infrastructure provider. As our product 
diversity and geographic presence has increased,  
so has our capability for understanding client needs 
across the value chain and our ability to respond  
to them. For instance we have facilitated access to 
an expanded set of asset classes, supported SME 
capital-raising through our ELITE programme and 
provided services to further client segments, such  
as LCH’s Sponsored Clearing model. Through 2018 
the Group expects to continue to identify, assess 
and execute organic and inorganic opportunities 
that enhance our existing business, or create new 
opportunities in complementary areas.

13 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Strategic Report Market trends and our response Key legislation
European Market Infrastructure  
Regulation (EMIR) 2.1 (REFIT) 
The EC has proposed a review of EMIR transaction-level 
requirements. In particular, it is introducing thresholds 
for the application of the clearing obligation to 
financial counterparties, extending the exemption  
for pension scheme arrangements and introducing  
an obligation for clearing members to provide  
clearing services under Fair, Reasonable And Non 
Discriminatory (FRAND) commercial terms. It has also 
proposed streamlining trade repositories’ reporting 
requirements. The Commission Proposal still needs to 
be discussed with the other co-legislators (Council and 
Parliament) before final adoption.
EMIR 2.2 – EU and third country CCP supervision 
The EC is proposing to review the supervisory 
framework applicable to EU and third country CCPs. 
Concerning EU CCPs, it will provide ESMA with new 
competences allowing it to review national competent 
authorities’ decisions and potentially amend or reject 
them. Similar powers are attributed to EU central 
banks of issue. Concerning third country CCPs, the 
text proposes to distinguish non-systemic CCPs (Tier 
1) that can be recognised according to the current EU 
regime from systemically important CCPs that have 
to directly comply with EMIR and are subject to direct 
supervision of ESMA. In addition, CCPs considered 
substantially too important to be recognised would 
therefore need to be established in the EU to be able 
to provide services to EU customers. LSEG has 
responded to the Commission Proposal, which still 
needs to be discussed with the other co-legislators 
(Council and Parliament) before final adoption.
Implications for LSEG
LSEG and its customers have raised concerns  
that the mechanism allows the Commission to 
potentially deny the recognition of third country 
CCPs of substantial systemic importance, which 
would penalise EU market participants through less 
choice of services and face higher risks and costs.  
In line with our key objectives to provide continuity 
of cross-border financial services and protect 
against policies which may result in fragmentation 
of financial markets, we consider that a set of 
alternative requirements would provide EU 
authorities with the tools to appropriately monitor 
the risks third country CCPs manage in the EU 
market, without having recourse to denial of 
recognition. LSEG is engaging with the industry and 
policy makers to ensure the right calibration of EMIR 
requirements as well as a smooth and efficient 
supervision of both EU and third country CCPs.
CCP Recovery and Resolution
Authorities in Europe, North America and other major 
jurisdictions, as well as International Standard 
Setters, are working on frameworks for the recovery 
and resolution of CCPs. In the unlikely scenario where 
CCPs face severe distress or failure, this framework 
will ensure that the critical functions of CCPs are 
preserved while maintaining financial stability. At  
the international level, CPMI-IOSCO is leading a work 
stream on CCP resiliency and recovery, while the 
Financial Stability Board (FSB) is conducting the 
analysis on CCP resolution. Final guidance from these 
work streams was published in July 201 7 . In the EU, 
the EC published on 28 November 2016 its legislative 
proposal for CCP recovery and resolution. This 
proposal is currently being reviewed and discussed 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the 
EU. In the US there continues to be increased focus 
by lawmakers and regulators on the systemic 
importance of CCPs and regulation of CCP resiliency, 
recovery and resolution.
Implications for LSEG
Harmonisation of the requirements for CCP’s 
recovery plans, and the introduction of resolution 
plans prepared by the authorities responsible for 
resolving CCPs (i.e. resolution authorities) should 
provide clarity on the impact on CCPs and identify 
the critical functions they must maintain in the 
unlikely event of their failure. LSEG will continue  
to assist the authorities and provide input for the 
development of this framework.
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive/
Regulation (MiFID II) 
MiFID II is the widest ranging of the EU legislative 
initiatives, in terms of its impact on the Group and  
its customers. Scope in relation to LSEG includes  
rules relating to market transparency and trading 
structures, market data provision and publication, 
trading market microstructure, transaction reporting, 
the new SME Growth Market regime, Open Access 
provisions, clearing houses and benchmark providers. 
Implications for LSEG
Since MiFID II entered into force in January 2018, 
the Group believes that the long term impacts have 
been broadly either neutral or positive for the Capital 
Markets businesses, with Open Access potentially 
providing opportunities across all Group segments 
(see section following on Open Access). In our 
Information Services segment, UnaVista should 
start to benefit from increased transaction reporting 
opportunities while provisions relating to 
distribution of some real time data may lead to 
some change in our business and revenue model in 
due course. The extra-territorial impact of MiFID II 
on Asian members of LSEG trading venues is likely 
to become clearer in 2018.
Open Access
Open Access underpins provisions within MiFID II  
that change the way some clearing houses, trading 
venues and index/benchmark providers will need  
to provide their products. The changes, which will 
apply when MiFID II comes into effect, require  
access to be provided to all potential users of trading, 
clearing and indexes, on a non-discriminatory basis.
Implications for LSEG
Open Access remains a key principle that underpins 
our strategy and business model and is fully aligned 
with the way we currently operate. Our clearing 
services already accept trades for clearing that 
originate from venues outside of the Group; some  
of our trading venues already provide choice of 
clearing through alternative CCPs outside the  
Group; and FTSE Russell provides index licences  
to a number of exchange businesses that are 
competitors to our trading venues.
Open Access increases competition across a  
range of services, to the benefit of investors and 
market participants, and potentially provides the 
Group’s relevant businesses with opportunities to 
launch new products and attract new trading and 
clearing flows.
European Supervisory Authorities  
(ESA) Review
The EC has made proposals to significantly transform 
ESA, principally by empowering ESMA to be the 
central supervisor for a range of new financial  
entities including third country CCPs, third country 
benchmark administrators, and data service 
reporting providers, and also the approval authority 
for certain types of prospectus. ESMA would also  
be able to levy fees directly on financial institutions 
even where they are not directly supervised. However 
the prospects for final political agreement on the 
proposal are highly uncertain as there are strong 
objections across the EU member states.
Implications for LSEG
Transformational change to the supervisory 
architecture in the EU presents fewer uncertainties 
for LSEG than other international financial 
institutions. As a global financial market 
infrastructure provider, LSEG is experienced at 
serving customers around the world and working 
closely with multiple regulators across borders.  
We therefore see much potential for introducing 
efficiencies and a more level playing field for 
regulatory implementation across the Single Market 
through the ESA review. At the same time LSEG will 
need to remain engaged in the policy debate in 
order to ensure that decision makers are properly 
informed of market structures and impacts and that 
the design of the new regulatory system is 
calibrated to achieve an appropriate balance 
between pan-European and national supervision. 
14 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Market trends and our response continued Capital Markets Union (CMU) / Green Finance
CMU is a plan by the EC that aims to create deeper 
and more integrated European capital markets. The 
CMU Action Plan sets out work streams designed to 
unlock investment from the EU and the rest of the 
world, improve financing for EU companies and 
investment projects, make the financial system more 
stable, deepen market integration and enhance 
competition. LSEG is closely following development 
of the EU Prospectus Regulation level II, reviews on 
the functioning of the corporate bond market, as well 
as the Commission’s proposal for a prudential regime 
for investment firms including market makers, for a 
pan-European Personal Pension, and for initiatives to 
support SME growth markets. The Commission aims 
to implement measures resulting from all Action Plan 
initiatives by 2019.
The Commission also aims to increase retail 
participation in capital markets through CMU 
initiatives to remove barriers to retail investment.
Regarding green finance and ESG reporting, LSEG 
and FTSE Russell continue to actively contribute  
to this global debate, in particular through the  
EU High Level Expert Group and the UK Green  
Finance Taskforce.
Implications for LSEG
These initiatives may increase activity across  
our Primary and Secondary Markets, and may  
lead to more activity in our post trade businesses. 
Additionally, green finance initiatives present 
enhanced commercial opportunities for FTSE 
Russell ESG indexes.
Benchmarks 
The EU Benchmarks Regulation was proposed to help 
restore confidence in the integrity of benchmarks, in 
the aftermath of the LIBOR scandal, and came into 
effect January 2018. Building on the principles 
agreed by IOSCO, the regulation will impact 
benchmark users, contributors and administrators. 
Apart from interest rate benchmarks, it also covers all 
benchmarks used to reference financial instruments 
admitted to trading or traded on a regulated venue, 
such as energy and currency derivatives, those that 
are used in financial contracts, such as mortgages, 
and those that are used to measure the performance 
of investment funds. The regulation enshrines the 
IOSCO Principles and we view the new rule set 
positively as it raises standards across the industry.
Implications for LSEG
FTSE Russell is a key global benchmarks 
administrator; as such FTSE international Limited 
submitted a draft application at the end of 2017  
to the FCA to be authorised as an EU based 
administrator of benchmarks. 
Technology 
The EC proposed a regulation on a framework for  
the free flow of non-personal data in the EU and a 
regulation on European Union Agency for Network 
and Information Security and Information and 
Communication Technology cybersecurity 
certification. LSEG has responded to the Commission 
Proposals, which still need to be discussed with the 
other co-legislators (Council and Parliament) in view 
of final adoption.
For the financial services industry, regulators in 
major jurisdictions are closely monitoring and 
considering regulatory frameworks on emerging 
financial technology (FinTech), in particular the 
potential uses of distributed ledger technology,  
cloud computing and artificial intelligence. 
Implications For LSEG
Cybersecurity, data protection and flow, and 
emerging technology related regulatory initiatives, 
apply in various degrees to all Group functions, 
either as compliance obligations or constituents of 
the services that we provide to our customers. We 
continue to invest to ensure cyber resiliency and 
compliance with regulations. In addition to 
complying with current cyber and data protection 
requirements, LSEG complies with significant data 
and cyber operational controls and standards 
required under financial services legislation.
Regarding the proposal on the free flow of 
non-personal data, there may be potential benefits 
to the Group by removing data localisation 
requirements and facilitating data portability.
LSEG continues to monitor and engage with 
regulators and leading industry working groups  
on these issues for the development of regulatory 
frameworks.
North America
United States
Certain financial services reforms put in place  
under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act of 2010 will continue  
to be reviewed by Congress and the relevant  
Federal agencies. There are several legislative 
proposals that, if passed, could impact our business  
operations in the US, particularly our post  
trade and capital markets businesses.
We remain closely engaged with the CFTC’s own 
initiative to review the agency rules and regulations to 
improve the effectiveness of their application. A related 
CFTC report with recommendations is expected this 
year. The US T reasury report entitled A Financial 
System That Creates Economic Opportunities: Capital 
Markets published in October 201 7 provides 
recommendations for Congress and relevant financial 
services agencies to begin implementing some of the 
US T reasury’s recommendations in line with the 
Administration’s goals. 
Implications for LSEG
Although the timing and substantive provisions 
remain in development, it is expected that final 
provisions could involve areas that directly or 
indirectly impact our post trade, information 
services and capital markets businesses as well  
as participants in our markets. We do not anticipate 
any major efforts to restrict the mandates for 
central clearing of certain swaps.
Canada
The Capital Markets Stability Act (CMSA), a package 
of reforms to address systemic risks in the financial 
system, including benchmarks and CCPs, remains 
under review in the Parliament. At the regulatory 
level, the Canadian Securities Administrators 
implemented a mandate to clear certain classes  
of interest rate swaps in 201 7 . Although the initial 
impact has not substantially increased cleared 
volumes from Canada, we are closely following  
the review of these provisions. 
Implications for LSEG
Although the timing and substantive provisions  
of the CMSA are not certain, further development 
and passage of these provisions could directly or 
indirectly impact our post trade and information 
businesses as well as participants in our markets.

Introduction 
The Information Services Division (ISD) provides 
financial market participants with timely, reliable  
and accurate market information. ISD offers a wide 
range of services, including global indexes, real time 
pricing data, product identification, reporting and 
reconciliation services. Information Services saw good 
organic growth in 201 7 , executed on and integrated 
acquisitions and continued to expand geographically 
into new areas for future product launches. With the 
acquisition of The Yield Book and Citi Fixed Income 
Indices, FTSE Russell became the largest global 
benchmark provider and leading multi-asset index 
company as measured by assets benchmarked.
In January 201 7 , the Group acquired Mergent,  
a leading global provider of business and financial 
information on public and private companies,  
for US$147 million (£1 19 million). This supports  
the growth of FTSE Russell’s core index offering, 
supplying underlying data and analytics for the 
creation of a wide range of indexes.
In August 201 7 , LSEG completed the acquisition of 
The Yield Book, a fixed income analytics platform, 
and Citi Fixed Income Indices, an index business 
comprising a family of fixed income indexes which 
includes the World Government Bond Index (WGBI), 
from Citigroup for US$679 million (£525 million).
Both acquisitions have been integrating well within 
the Group and allowing FTSE Russell to capitalise 
further on strong growth in multi-asset solutions and 
passive investment strategies, realising revenue and 
cost synergies and extending the Group’s global 
distribution capabilities. The data obtained from 
these acquisitions will support all areas of the Group 
and reduce usage of third parties for market data.  
In particular, we will benefit from the growing client 
demand for ETFs, smart beta or factor-based indexes 
and fixed income indexes.
LSEG completed the sale of the Italy-based 
Information Service Professional Solutions business  
in February 201 7 .

In June 201 7 , FTSE Russell presented at a Group 
Investor Update, where senior managers from 
individual business areas discussed the benchmarks 
and analytics landscape, identified future growth 
drivers and set out our mid-term outlook. In FTSE 
Russell we see double-digit growth continuing to 
2019 and sustainable and attractive margins over the 
same period. The event presentation and videos are 
available on our website: https://www.lseg.com/

Assets benchmarked to FTSE Russell indexes
FTSE Russell’s sales and service teams are fully 
integrated to form one global team that is closely 
aligned and highly engaged with our clients. We 
support clients around investment strategy, asset 
allocation and risk management challenges to  
meet their investment objectives.
FTSE Russell earns approximately 60% of its revenue 
from index data subscriptions, comprising licences, 
data services and analytics with high retention rates. 
The remaining 40% is earned from asset based fees, 
with revenues based on benchmarked assets under 
management (AUM) for ETFs, passive funds and 
contracts traded for index derivatives.
In 201 7 , revenues increased by 33% to £546 million 
(2016: £409 million), up 15% on an organic constant 
currency basis due to continued strong demand for 
our benchmarks including data and analytics, and 
strong growth in the ETF market. Upon the 
integration of FTSE and Russell Indexes after the 
acquisition of Frank Russell Company in 2014, we set 
a 3 year run rate cost synergy target of US$78 million 
and a 5 year run rate revenue synergy target of 
US$48 million. These targets were both delivered 
ahead of schedule in 201 7 . With the acquisitions 
during the year of Mergent and The Yield Book and 
Citi Fixed Income Indices, the focus going forward 
will be integrating both businesses into FTSE Russell.
FTSE Russell is a leading provider of indexes for the 
ETF market, with US$624 billion benchmarked (2016: 
US$452 billion). This is one of the fastest growing 
investment classes with a 6 year CAGR of 21 %. This 
year, 7 companies issued their first ETFs against FTSE 
Russell benchmarks including Fidelity and Franklin 
Templeton. FTSE Russell is also a leading innovator 
and provider of smart beta or factor-based index 
solutions. ETF assets benchmarked to FTSE Russell 
smart beta indexes in 201 7 increased by 26% to 
US$190 billion (2016: US$15 1 billion).
201 7 also saw a number of other significant 
achievements with the geographical expansion  
of FTSE Russell’s services and increased selection  
of FTSE Russell indexes for ETFs. For example in  
July 201 7 , the world’s largest pension fund, the 
Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) of 
Japan selected our new FTSE Blossom Japan Index  
as a core ESG benchmark. The increased uptake 
benchmarking of ESG indexes demonstrates the 
increased demand for, and shift to ESG factors in 
investment criteria.
In the US, futures and options are traded on FTSE 
Russell indexes, Cboe trades options while in 201 7 
futures on the Russell 2000 Index began trading on 
CME’s Globex platform, demonstrating the Group’s 
open access approach.
In China, the first mainland China ETF tracking  
the FTSE China A50 index, issued by Harvest  
Fund Management, was listed on the Shanghai  
Stock Exchange.
In 201 7 , we launched the FTSE Italia PIR Mid Cap 
Total Return Index, a benchmark that measures  
the performance of Italian companies matching  
the requirements of the new personal savings plan 
(PIR) Law introduced in Italy.
In the Middle East the FTSE Saudi Arabia Inclusion 
Index Series was launched, with global, regional and 
country-level indexes designed to support domestic 
and international investors in response to regional 
growth and the opening of the Saudi Arabia capital 
market to Qualified Foreign Investors.
FTSE Russell indexes are licensed globally for 
derivatives trading in across Europe, North America 
and Asia. During the year 210 million contracts 
benchmarked to FTSE Russell indexes were traded, 
5% lower than the previous year, with increased 
activity in the US offset by lower volumes in Europe.
The European Regulation on Indices used as 
Benchmarks in Financial Instruments and Financial 
Contracts (the European Benchmark Regulation) 
applied from 1 January 2018; FTSE International 
Limited submitted an application at the end of 201 7  
to the FCA to be authorised as an EU based 
administrator of benchmarks.

Introduction
LCH is a leading multinational clearing house, with 
clearing operations in the UK, Eurozone, US and an 
expanding presence in the Asia-Pacific region. LCH 
provides services to mitigate counterparty risk across 
multiple asset classes for clearing members and their 
clients, operating through an open access model that 
clears for the Group’s markets and other major 
exchanges and platforms as well as a range of  
OTC markets.
LCH sits in the middle of a trade as the buyer to every 
seller and the seller to every buyer. If either party 
defaults on the trade, LCH owns the defaulter’s risk and 
becomes accountable for its liabilities. Fundamental to 
LCH’s risk process is its collection of quality collateral 
from clearing members and clients as insurance to 
recover or replace defaulted risk. During the life of a 
trade, or that of a portfolio of trades, LCH processes all 
cash flows and marks the trade or book to market, 
calling variation and initial margin in relation to 
prevailing risk of the overall portfolio.
LCH earns its revenue in the OTC derivatives markets 
by charging members either an annual fee for all 
clearing or a lower annual fee with variable fees 
based on volume. Additional fees are levied for 
services such as compression. Clients pay a fee based 
on OTC volume cleared. In non-OTC markets, all users 
pay a fee based on volumes or value cleared. Net 
Treasury Income is earned on cash and securities 
held for margin and default funds.
During the year we increased our majority stake in 
LCH Group from 57 .8% to 65.9% following the sale by 
certain minority holders and as a result of Euronext 
swapping their holding from LCH Group to LCH S.A..
In June 201 7 , LCH presented at a Group Investor 
Update, where senior managers from individual 
business areas discussed the post trade landscape, 
identified future growth drivers and set out our 
mid-term outlook. In OTC clearing we see revenues 
continuing to grow at a double-digit rate to 2019 with 
EBITDA margin approaching 50% by 2019 (2016: 
35.6%). The event presentation and videos are 
available on our website: https://www.lseg.com/

23 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Post T rade Services
LCH
Strategic Report Post Trade Services 201 7 saw LCH benefit from various regulatory 
requirements incentivising clearing, such as 
mandatory swap clearing in Europe and a full year  
of the Uncleared Margin Rules (UMR), alongside the 
development of existing and new services. Examples 
of these include the introduction of clearing for 5 G10 
currency pairs at ForexClear, LCH’s foreign exchange 
clearing service, and the launch of LCH SwapAgent,  
a new service to simplify the processing, margining 
and settlement of non-cleared derivatives.
LCH won 1 1 awards in 201 7 , including Risk Magazine’s 
Clearing House of the Year for the fifth consecutive 
year and Futures and Option World’s (FOW) 
International Awards Clearing House of the Year  
for Europe and Asia.
In 2018, LCH plans to extend its portfolio margining 
solution, LCH Spider, to allow Long Term Interest Rate 
futures to be offset with eligible swaps and Short 
Term Interest Rate futures. 
Total income in constant currency terms increased 
by 21 % as a result of increased Net Treasury Income, 
volumes in OTC client clearing and strong growth in 
RepoClear. In sterling terms, income increased by 
26% to £562 million (2016: £447 million). 
OTC derivatives clearing revenue was up 21 % at £231 
million, an increase of 1 7% on a constant currency 
basis (2016: £191 million). The increase in OTC 
clearing revenue came largely from the growth  
in SwapClear client clearing.
OTC clearing has benefitted from the implementation 
of the Uncleared Margin Rules in the US from 
September 2016, and Europe in February 201 7 . 
Thresholds for users with gross notional amount of 
uncleared OTC derivatives initially set at €3 trillion / 
US$3 trillion are expected to reduce each year, and 
by September 2020 almost all the market will be 
covered with thresholds set at €8 billion / US$8 billion.
Non-OTC clearing revenue was £133 million, up  
7% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong 
growth in fixed income volumes cleared. Other 
revenue, which includes compression services and 
fees for managing non-cash collateral, increased  
by 37% to £68 million (2016: £49 million).
OTC Clearing
SwapClear
SwapClear is a global market leader in OTC interest 
rate swap (IRS) clearing, offering buy and sell-side 
clients access to unparalleled liquidity provided by 
105 members, capital efficiencies from compression 
services and a system of rigorous risk management.
201 7 was another strong year for SwapClear with 
total notional cleared increasing 31 % to a record 
US$87 4 trillion (2016: US$666 trillion). Client clearing 
increased 46% to a record US$203 trillion (2016: 
US$139 trillion) and client trades up 29% to a record 
1,227 ,000 (2016: 952,000).
Factors driving growth have included regulatory 
changes such as mandated EU client clearing and 
Uncleared Margin Rules, increased activity amongst 
existing members and clients, the onboarding of new 
clients and increased use of compression services. 
Interest rate changes in the US and UK were also 
favourable to volumes. In 2018, LCH will further 
expand its SwapClear product offering, with plans  
to introduce Non Deliverable Interest Rate Swaps  
in Chinese Yuan, Korean Won and Indian Rupee, 
subject to regulatory approval.

ForexClear is LCH’s service clearing foreign exchange 
(FX) non-deliverable forwards (NDF) for 12 Emerging 
Market currencies and, launched in November 201 7 ,  
5 G10 currencies. 201 7 also started to see regular

In 2018, ForexClear is to launch a clearing service  
for deliverable OTC FX options, in partnership with 
settlement provider CLS, subject to regulatory 
approval. In 2018 and beyond, new phases of UMR are 
expected to lead to increased use of central clearing 
and other services such as compression services.
CDSClear
CDSClear clears the broadest range of European  
and US credit default swaps (CDS) products allowing 
greater opportunities for capital efficiency through 
margin offsets. 1 08 index series and close to 500 single 
name CDS contracts are eligible for clearing. CDSClear 
is registered as a CCP in Europe under EMIR, and as a 
Derivative Clearing Organization (DCO) with the CFTC 
and a Clearing Agency with the SEC in the US.
Membership has increased in 201 7 , following the 
introduction of the new Select Membership tier, 
bringing the total number of members to 13 (2016: 
12). In March 201 7 , CDSClear onboarded its first 
buyside client. CDSClear also extended its platform  
to include the clearing of credit index options, an 
industry first. In 2018, additional members are 
expected to join the service adding liquidity. 
Total notional cleared increased to €549.2 billion 
(2016: €448.7 billion) supported by new rounds of  
the Uncleared Margin Rules and introduction of the 
European clearing mandate for index CDS.

Non-OTC Clearing
RepoClear
Clearing in repo and cash bond markets increased to 
€87 .5 trillion in 201 7 (2016: €70.8 trillion). LCH fixed 
income service clears across 13 government bond 
markets including the Group’s MTS bond markets 
and third party venues.
In 201 7 , RepoClear launched Sponsored Clearing, a 
service offering buy-side firms direct access to LCH, 
enabling them to reduce their risk and maximise 
balance sheet efficiencies. This year, RepoClear has 
also extended its service in LCH S.A. to offer clearing  
for cash and repo trades on German Bunds and 
Belgian Government bonds, allowing members to 
benefit from settlement netting and risk offsets  
in Euro-based repos through T2S.
Listed Derivatives and Cash Equities
The Listed Derivatives venues cleared by LCH include 
London Stock Exchange Derivatives Market (LSEDM) 
and Euronext Derivatives Markets. Contracts cleared 
in 201 7 increased by 1 1 % to 146.9 million (2016: 
131.9 million). In 201 7 , LCH S.A. signed a 10-year 
long-term agreement with Euronext N.V. for the 
continued provision of clearing services for listed 
financial and commodity derivatives.
In Equities, LCH, one of Europe’s largest equities CCPs 
by volume cleared, offers the broadest venue coverage 
of any European equities CCP , clearing for 24 trading 
venues. The number of trades cleared in 201 7 
increased by 15% to 805 million (2016: 697 million).
Net Treasury Income
Net Treasury Income is the result of interest earned 
on cash assets lodged with the clearing house, on 
margin and default funds. Users of LCH post cash and 
receive an overnight interest rate less a spread. The 
level of funds held is primarily driven by market risk 
under management, volumes cleared and market 
volatility. Income is also driven by short-term interest 
rates predominantly in the US Dollar, Euro and UK 
Sterling money markets. Focus on risk dispersion and 
efficiency means we have increased the number of 
counterparties used for investment with more use of 
central banks and a number of pension funds. The 
type of investment has also expanded to included 
floating rate notes and reverse repos.
Average cash collateral held increased 26% to €84.5 
billion (2016: €67 .0 billion). Total Net Treasury Income 
for LCH for 201 7 increased by 46% to £120 million 
(2016: £82 million). As collateral collected in both 
cash and non-cash continues to grow alongside 
increased usage of LCH’s services, this leads to higher 
levels of Net Treasury Income. LCH may also benefit 
from changes in interest rates, such as the recent 
increases made by the US Federal Reserve and the 
Bank of England, with short-term interest rates, 30  
or 60 days, being higher than the overnight rate.

Introduction
Post Trade Services in Italy are crucial to the 
securities trading industry. Our post trade 
businesses, Monte Titoli and CC&G, provide the 
markets with settlement, depository, custody, risk 
and collateral management, clearing and central 
counterparty (CCP) services in order to mitigate risk 
and ensure the efficient running of capital markets.
The post trade regulatory landscape saw the 
completion of one of the largest infrastructure 
projects launched by the Eurosystem to date: T2S,  
a pan-European platform for securities settlement.  
It removed barriers and eliminated differences 
between domestic and cross-border settlement.
CC&G clearing earns revenue by charging a fee per 
trade or derivative contract cleared, and Net Treasury 
Income is earned on cash and securities held for 
margin and default funds. Monte Titoli settlement 
revenue is earned by charging a fee per trade settled 
and lodged for registration into the buyer’s name. Its 
custody fees are paid by companies based on market 
capitalisation and issuance, with fees paid by 
intermediaries including banks and CCPs based on 
balance of assets held in custody. 
Clearing (CC&G)
CC&G is the Group’s Italian-based provider of risk 
management, open access clearing and CCP services 
to 13 markets, including Borsa Italiana’s markets, 
NEX Group’s BrokerTec and Hi-MTF . CC&G eliminates 
counterparty risk by sitting in the middle of a trade 
as the buyer to every seller and the seller to every 
buyer. CC&G provides services across a diverse range 
of asset classes including equities, ETFs, derivatives, 
close-end funds and fixed income. CC&G has an 
interoperability agreement with LCH S.A. for 
European bond and Repo markets.
Clearing revenues on a constant currency basis fell 
by 14% and in Sterling terms decreased by 8% to  
£39 million (2016: £43 million) largely due to lower 
volumes on platforms served by CC&G. Equity and 
derivatives contract volumes cleared decreased by 
16% to 108.3 million (2016: 129.6 million).

clients connected with Monte Titoli in 201 7 , including 
Banco Posta and ABN Amro who transferred clients’ 
portfolios to accounts maintained with Monte Titoli.
A new innovative fiscal and issuance service was 
launched in 201 7 , which supports Italian issuers 
placing fixed income securities in the US market 
(Rule 144A compliance). This played a key role in  
the success of Unicredit and Wind Tre issuance.

Introduction 
Our position at the heart of the global financial 
community is one of the reasons why a wide range of 
domestic and international companies choose to join 
our markets in London and Milan. Many of the world’s 
leading investment houses and financial institutions 
are based in London, with professional investors 
known for their outward-looking approach offering 
companies from around the world access to a deep 
and wide pool of long-term investment capital. LSEG 
offers leading lit and dark trading platforms in well 
regulated markets.
Our range of primary markets provides choice for 
issuers and investors, enabling companies to raise 
capital efficiently and also increase their visibility 
with a wide group of customers and investors. Our 
secondary markets create a deep pool of liquidity 
and allow active and efficient trading of equity and 
fixed income products through our high-performance 
trading platforms.
Issuers admitted to our primary markets are charged 
admission fees and annual fees based on the market 
value of the securities listed.
In Secondary Markets a fee is charged based on value 
traded for UK equities, Turquoise and MTS fixed 
income markets. On other markets, Italian equities, 
derivatives markets and retail fixed income, a fee is 
charged per trade or contract traded.
Primary Markets Summary
In 201 7 , 194 new companies were admitted to our 
markets (2016: 134), with the total money raised

billion). In London, 83 new companies listed on our

saw over 100 new issues across the year, an increase 
of 54% compared to 2016 and more than anywhere

position as the leading global listing venue for 
international companies. These included J2 
Acquisition, a US investment firm raising £900 
million, and TI Fluid Systems, a manufacturer of 
automotive fluid systems that raised £400 million.

Indian Rupee and Indonesian Rupiah bonds raising 
US$3.9 billion in 201 7 . In total, almost 2,000 bonds 
raised over US$4 15 billion, 68% of which was raised 
by international issuers incorporated outside the UK.
In 201 7 , LSE launched the International Securities 
Market (ISM), a new exchange-regulated multilateral 
trading facility (MTF) for the issuance of primary debt, 
targeted at institutional and professional investors. 
Over the year there were 10 issuances onto ISM.
LSE continued to attract green bond issuances, with 
28 new green bonds issued during the year. The total 
number of green bonds now listed on our markets is 
65, and these have raised US$21.2 billion (2016: 40

Equity Trading
In the UK, 201 7 saw the highest annual value traded 
since 2008, with £1.34 trillion traded (2016: £1.28 
trillion), while the average daily value traded was up 
4% to £5.3 billion (2016: £5.1 billion). In Italy, the 
average daily number of trades decreased by 6% to 
276,000 (2016: 295,000). LSE’s share of lit trading 
increased to 69.7% (2016: 6 1.3%) in part due to a new 
sales and marketing programme, which helped to 
narrow spreads and increase liquidity on exchange. 
There has also been a move towards closing auctions 
on incumbent exchanges by passive investors looking 
to re-weight their portfolios to the end of day prices.
In December 20 1 7 , at the 9th UK-China Economic  
and Financial Dialogue, the UK and Chinese 
governments agreed to accelerate the final 
preparations to launch the London-Shanghai Stock 
Connect. The 2 governments have welcomed the 
proposals by the Shanghai Stock Exchange and  
London Stock Exchange to realise the Connect by 
listing depositary receipts on each other’s markets.  
In 20 1 8, the exchanges, central clearing and depositary 
institutions, and regulators aim to finalise the rules and 
required market preparations to enable governments  
to launch the Connect when conditions permit it.

our markets fell by 4% to £1 78 billion (2016: £186 
billion). ETF trading accounts for around 7% of equity 
trading on LSE and 13% of trading on Borsa Italiana. 
ETFs trade on our platforms in 4 currencies including 
Chinese Renminbi. 
Pre-MiFID II, it was estimated that approximately 
70% of ETF and ETP trading in Europe takes place 
over the counter (OTC). MiFID II subjected these 
products to pre and post trade transparency 
requirements where previously there were none. In 
201 7 , we launched Request for Quote (RFQ) for our 
London market, following its launch in Italy in 2016. 
This is a MiFID II compliant facility for the execution 
of larger trades on-exchange (minimum trade size  
€1 million under MiFID II), with automated reporting 
and clearing.

Derivatives
Derivatives volumes on our markets fell in 201 7 , with 
40.8 million contracts traded (2016: 53.9 million). 
IDEM, the Group’s Italian derivatives market, saw 
trading volumes fall by 30% to 34.1 million contracts 
(2016: 49.0 million). London Stock Exchange 
Derivatives Market (LSEDM) saw increased volumes 
with 6.6 million (2016: 4.9 million) contracts traded  
as volumes increased in International Order Book 
Depositary Receipts options and futures.
CurveGlobal
CurveGlobal, an interest rate derivatives venture 
between London Stock Exchange Group, Cboe, and  
a number of leading dealer banks, has seen over  
2 million lots trade on the platform and reach a 
record level of Open Interest, 162,000 contracts in 
mostly Short-Term Interest Rate futures (STIRs), since 
launching in September 2016. Clearing is offered by 
LCH, allowing trading participants access to a single 
default fund across OTC and listed rates derivatives, 
and portfolio margin through LCH Spider. In 2018, 
LCH Spider II will launch Long-Term Interest Rate 
futures (LTIRs), enabling the offset of LTIRs, STIRs  
and OTC positions to reduce the risk in participants’ 
portfolios and increase margin efficiency. As LSEG is 
a minority shareholder of CurveGlobal, the results of 
CurveGlobal are not consolidated by the Group.
Fixed Income
MTS is a leading regulated electronic trading platform 
for European wholesale Government Bonds and other 
types of fixed income securities. In 201 7 , the value 
traded on MTS Repo, which offers liquidity across all 
the Eurozone repo markets, fell by 8% to €77 .7 trillion 
(201 6: €84.4 trillion). MTS Cash and BondVision’s value 
traded fell by 6% to €3,702 billion (201 6: €3,944 billion).
In 201 7 , MTS launched its new dealer-to-client (D2C) 
Global Collateral Management (GCM) segment for the 
repo market on MTS BondVision, with LCH Ltd signing 
as the first buy-side trading client. GCM introduces 
new functionality to enable direct electronic D2C 
trading for bilateral repo contracts and centrally 
cleared repo contracts via LCH’s Sponsored Clearing 
model for the buy-side.
MTS BondsPro, a web-based, US registered corporate 
bond trading platform, achieved record buy-side 
participation in 201 7 , making up 18% of the total 
executed on BondsPro (2016: 4%). MTS continued  
to engage with clients to enhance their trading 
capabilities by extending availability of the platform 
beyond US trading hours.
Our retail bond markets, including EuroTLX, the UK 
Order Book for Retail Bonds (ORB), and MOT in Italy, 
the most liquid and heavily traded retail fixed income 
platform in Europe, continued to provide liquid markets 
despite a difficult low interest rate environment. Total 
trades were 5.7 million (2016: 6.1 million) with value 
traded at €264 billion (2016: €285 billion).

Key Summary
 – Technology revenues increased by 3% to £91 
million (2016: £88 million) and were unchanged  
on an organic constant currency basis 
 – LSEG Technology was launched; a re-branding  
and re-engineering of our technology businesses. 
We introduced a new Leadership Team, created  
a more nimble and product-driven delivery 
capability, and improved our collaboration with 
innovation teams, all with the aim of better  
serving existing and new customers
 – LSEG Business Services Limited, our shared  
services company, has broadened into services  
for corporate functions
 – Integration underway of Mergent and The Yield 
Book technologies into the broader Group
Introduction 
Technology Services provides the Group and its 
customers, including banks, specialist trading firms 
and other capital market venues with resilient, 
high-speed, low latency trading platforms, post trade 
platforms, real time market data and surveillance 
products and services.
Exchange Technology
Our cash equity and retail bond markets run on the 
latest version of the Millennium Exchange trading 
platform. This technology has reduced our cost base 
and increased the opportunities for customers to 
benefit from enhanced functionality and the further 
expansion of our co-location services. This has 
allowed us to meet the needs of our customers 
quickly and cost effectively.
LSEG completed an extensive programme of change 
in order to ensure its readiness for the implementation 
of MiFID II on 3 January 2018. The programme 
involved a comprehensive assessment across LSEG 
markets to identify the impact of the new regulation 
and implement the necessary changes to technology, 
rules and business processes. All technological 
upgrades were completed and tested with customers 
ahead of MiFID II go-live. 
Following the completed acquisitions of Mergent and 
The Yield Book and Citi Fixed Income Indices in 201 7 , 
their technologies are being integrated with the 
Group’s to utilise new data and analytic capabilities 
internally as well as for our customers. 
Throughout the year we also completed the migration 
of the Bolsa Y Mercados Argentinos to the Millennium 
Exchange platform, and Oslo Børs launched LSE’s new 
Turquoise Lit Auctions functionality on its Millennium 
Exchange trading system. 
The Group continues to assess opportunities that 
exist in Financial Technology (FinTech) such as 
distributed ledger / blockchain, machine learning,  
big data and cloud-computing. LSEG, through Borsa 
Italiana, announced in July, a collaboration with IBM 
to develop a blockchain solution to digitise the 
issuance of securities for unlisted SMEs in Europe. 
This aims to replace paper trading certificates, 
commonly issued by private companies, with  
a more streamlined and transparent process.
LSEG Business Services Limited (BSL), our shared 
services company, provides a range of resilient and 
efficient technology services Group-wide, as well as 
reducing costs by leveraging low cost centres via 
centralised technology operations and back office. 
The BSL shared services model is scalable and as such 
has been extended to corporate functions in 201 7 .
Through our Millennium Exchange technology,  
our UK cash equity continues to exhibit excellent 
technical performance, with the trading systems 
available for 100% uptime during the year (2016: 
100%). The average daily volume of transactions  
for 201 7 was 53 million.

T echnology Services LSEG Technology
LSEG Technology is the new name for our technology 
businesses, which includes MillenniumIT and Gatelab. 
A new Leadership Team has been introduced, and our 
development approach is changing to help us further 
productise the business. Our products will be 
enhanced to reflect an emphasis on innovation in the 
areas of emerging technologies such as Artificial 
Intelligence (AI), large scale data analytics, blockchain 
and distributed ledger technology.
MillenniumIT
MillenniumIT was acquired by the Group in 2009. 
MillenniumIT provides advanced market leading 
capital markets software and has implemented 
solutions for over 40 organisations and exchanges 
worldwide.
A wide range of software solutions are offered by 
MillenniumIT; Millennium Exchange, the flagship 
multi-asset trading platform, through which all of  
the Group’s cash equity and retail bond markets run; 
Millennium Market Data, the real time data and index 
calculation platform; Millennium Surveillance, which 
detects abnormal trading behaviour; and, among 
others, Millennium PostTrade, which offers real time 
clearing, settlement, risk management and  
CSD solutions.
In December 201 7 , LSEG announced that Lanka 
Century Investments (LCI) had acquired full 
ownership of MillenniumIT ESP , a global IT enterprise 
solutions provider, part of the MillenniumIT business. 
LSEG retained MillenniumIT Software, the trading 
technology and software development component  
of the business. 
Gatelab
Gatelab, our Italy and UK-based technology 
company, is a provider of fully MiFID II-compliant 
trading and post trade solutions to the global 
financial community. The products and services 
Gatelab offers to buy-side, sell-side and hedge fund 
partners include multi-asset cross-market electronic 
trading platforms, ultra-low latency pre-trade risk 
market adapters, smart order routing for equities  
and bonds, and post trade deal capture and 
cross-asset margining.
This year, Gatelab became an approved provider of 
risk gateway services for third party clients accessing 
the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). This enables 
users to send orders to the BSE currency derivatives 
segment provided all pre-trade risk checks are met.
Exactpro
In January 2018, Exactpro Systems was divested 
from LSEG. LSEG will remain a significant customer  
of Exactpro, which will provide an independent 
software quality assessment of LSEG’s core programs 
through a multi-year services agreement between 
the 2 companies.
33 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Strategic Report Technology Services The Group fulfils vital economic and social roles in enabling 
companies to access funds for growth and development. As 
such, integrity and trust remain at the core of what we do.
Below, we summarise our approach to Corporate Sustainability (CS), 
including non-financial reporting disclosures, and highlight some of  
the developments over the past year. We have also produced a separate, 
detailed 201 7 CS report, which can be viewed at www.lseg.com/
about-london-stock-exchange-group/corporate-responsibility.
Our Approach
Our CS strategy underlies our business strategy, and has 2 core objectives:
 – To play an essential role in enabling sustainable global economic growth; and
 – To ensure our CS behaviour and actions are consistent with good practice while 
generating long-term value creation
Our CS strategy is executed through 4 pillars: our markets; our services; our 
people; and our communities, using 6 impact areas that direct the Group’s  
focus in all CS activities and initiatives. Executive Committee members lead 
working groups composed of cross-Group colleagues, focused on developing 
specific targets and action plans in each of the 4 pillars. As part of a materiality 
assessment, we have applied this framework to direct our CS approach to identify 
the most relevant and important issues for the Group.
We have seen good progress in our CS performance with our external CS ratings 
remaining in the top quartile when ranked against peers. As our business expands 
and diversifies, we continue to review our approach to sustainability. Our 
objectives for each of our 6 impact areas are set out in the Looking Ahead section 
of our CS Report.

Environment
As a Group, we recognise that we must use resources in ways that deliver the 
long-term sustainability and profitability of the business and have a positive 
impact on the environment. We are taking such factors into account in developing 
products and services that support these aims through companies listed on our 
markets. The Group’s primary greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions arise from energy, 
waste and water in our offices and data centres around the world, from staff travel, 
and indirectly from our supply chain.
During the reporting period, we achieved a 31 % reduction in our absolute carbon 
emissions and a 42% reduction in carbon emissions per Full Time Employee (FTE), 
accelerating our progress from previous years. This significant reduction is 
primarily attributed to our move to over 64% of the Group’s electricity now being 
provided by 100% natural renewable energy.
We take an active approach to emissions management, with our global 
Environmental Management Group measuring GHG impacts across our property 
portfolio, including managed offices where possible. We report beyond the 
mandatory guidelines to include Scope 3 emissions. Performance is reported 
quarterly via our Intranet, and we annually disclose to the CDP , Dow Jones 
Sustainability Indices (DJSI), FTSE4Good and on our website: www.lseg.com.
In June 201 7 , the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) released its reporting recommendations. The Group 
signed the TCFD statement of support, affirming its commitment to support the 
recommendations, and sees them as an important step in driving improved global 
consistency in voluntary global reporting standards. As the Group, and FTSE 
Russell in particular, intends to play a critical role in enabling the flow of 
information envisioned by the TCFD, the recommendations were incorporated  
into FTSE Russell’s climate-related indicators and in the Group ESG Reporting 
Guidance. Going forward, the Group will continue to review the recommendations.

Our wider responsibility In addition to monitoring our environmental impact, we have set environmental 
targets for the next financial year including energy, water, waste and travel, as  
well as long-term science-based targets out to 2030. More information on these  
as well as full details of emissions and reporting methodology can be found in  
our CS report.
Social
People
Attracting, developing and retaining the skills we need to deliver on our strategy  
is vital for the Group. We are unifying our growing company through a number  
of processes and we are dedicated to supporting our employees’ development  
in an environment built on core values of partnership, integrity, innovation  
and excellence.
Employee engagement is of high importance to the continued growth of the 
Group, and in 201 7 this was reflected in our response to the findings of the prior 
year’s colleague engagement survey. 3 key areas on which our employees  
felt we could improve were communication around change, career satisfaction 
and cross-Group collaboration. To address these, we invested in a Group Change 
Framework, designed to help us drive greater consistency and transparency in 
how we manage change. In addition, we developed the Group Career Framework 
for launch in 2018, enabling colleagues to explore opportunities. In 201 7 , we 
launched a focus on wellbeing in the UK, covering 5 areas: physical, mental,  
social purpose, financial and work-life balance. The Mentor Exchange is also 
fostering collaboration and career development by uniting mentors and  
mentees from across the Group. We plan to host our next Group-wide  
employee engagement survey in 2018.
Diversity/Equal Opportunities
We value diversity as a driver for development and innovation. Our operations span 
the globe, with offices in Australia, Canada, France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, 
Malaysia, Mexico, T aiwan, China, Sri Lanka, UAE, the UK and the US. We have 
employees of 72 different nationalities, reflecting both the international scale  
of our business and the diversity of our customer base. In 201 7 , we provided 
unconscious bias training to all colleagues and diversity awareness workshops to 
line managers. We are working to increase diversity and inclusion such as flexible 
working and the disability confident employer scheme. By 2020, we aim to achieve 
a stretch target of 40% female representation for senior management and our 
overall staff numbers.

responsibility
Human Rights
As part of our approach to social responsibility, we adhere to the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights, together with the International  
Labour Organization Conventions and Recommendations, within our working 
environment in each location where we operate. The Group strongly supports 
these conventions, which aim to promote freedom of association and equality, 
and abolish forced labour and child labour. Human rights considerations 
are also included in our Supplier Code of Conduct and Group Corporate 
Responsibility Policy.
The Group has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery. Our ‘Slavery and 
Human trafficking statement’ (published on our website) describes the steps 
taken during 201 7 to improve our supply chain management and procurement 
processes and procedures. Suppliers that make up the top 75% of spend have 
been reviewed for modern slavery risks.
Community
We work to ensure that our activities benefit the communities where we  
are present. We have an active engagement programme with governments, 
inter-governmental agencies and regulators to promote ESG disclosure and 
sustainable practices. We work to support local communities and the  
environment where we have a significant presence.
London Stock Exchange Group Foundation, set up in 2010, provides a primary 
channel for the Group’s charitable giving and a focal point for staff engagement 
with local charities. In 201 7 , the Group donated £1,122,000 to the Foundation, 
and £107 ,000 directly to a number of charities. The Foundation’s approach and 
positioning is aligned with the overall Group CS strategy, while recognising the 
global reach of LSEG’s business model. UNICEF remains a global charity partner, 
and we continue to support the community investment programme. A new UK 
charity partner, School Home Support, was chosen in 201 7 . The charity provides 
access to education and life skills for young people with the aim of enabling them 
to live secure adult lives.
Governance
The Group is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and 
business integrity, and in the past year we have again complied with all of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code’s provisions. The Board will continue to ensure that 
it provides effective leadership and promotes uncompromising standards. For 
further information on governance see pages 62–63.
We face a wide and evolving universe of risks. Our presence in post trade services 
provides exposure to financial market volatility. In addition, we face technology 
risks such as cyber threats, systems resilience and technological innovation,  
and political, regulatory and macro-economic risks, which include the impact  
of our competitors’ actions. Achieving on our growth strategy in this dynamic 
environment requires strong risk management. Our governance and risk 
management structures continue to develop to meet this need (see pages  
42 and 56 for further details).
Anti-bribery and corruption
We have assessed the various risks that the Group faces with regards to employee 
conduct and behaviour. A range of policies are in place, tailored to the needs of the 
Group and regularly reviewed and approved by the Board, including anti-bribery 
and corruption and conflict of interest policies, as part of our wider conduct 
initiatives. New joiners along with existing staff have, throughout the course of 
201 7 , undertaken mandatory compliance testing on these subjects, with 100% 
successful completion across the Group’s operations. The relevance and spirit of 
these policies, along with their communication to staff, is regularly reviewed to 
ensure confidence in meeting expectations and ensuring understanding.
Capital Market Days
We are supporting the implementation of our ESG reporting guidance through 
ESG-focused Capital Market Days. The guidance was published in February 201 7 
and sets out recommendations for ESG reporting. The first Sustainability Day, 
organised by Borsa Italiana, was held in Italy and welcomed over 250 attendees 
and 30 ESG investors. UK Sustainability Day, hosted by LSE, is expected to take 
place in 2018.

Information Services provides global indexes products, real time pricing data, 
product identification, reporting and reconciliation services. Revenue was £736 
million (2016: £595 million).
37 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Strategic Report Financial review FTSE Russell’s revenue was £546 million (2016: £409 million), including first time 
contributions from Mergent and The Yield Book. FTSE Russell revenue increased by 
15%, with performance in line with the Group’s announced double-digit growth 
target for FTSE Russell revenue. This performance was driven by increases in AUM 
levels in benchmarked ETFs and other investable products, as well as strong 
subscription renewal rates and data sales. Following the 201 4 acquisition of Frank 
Russell Company, targets were set for both cost and revenue synergies, and in 201 7 
we achieved the 3 year target of US$78 million for cost synergies on time and met 
the 5 year target for revenue synergies of US$48 million, more than 2 years early. 
Real Time Data revenue increased by 1 % year on year due to a focus on enterprise 
licensing, while the number of terminals decreased by 10% to 180,000 (2016: 
200,000) with the reduction largely in lower yield terminals.
Other Information Services revenues increased by 15%, mainly as a result of 
growth in both UnaVista, driven by continued user base expansion for regulatory 
reporting, trade confirmations and reconciliations especially in anticipation of 
MiFID II implementation in 2018, and SEDOL from continued licence growth. 
Cost of sales rose by 4% mainly as a result of increased data charges and 
partnership costs, both related to growth in FTSE Russell revenues. Gross profit 
margin expanded as a result of revenue growth across the division. 
Operating expenses of £291 million (2016: £204 million) increased by 43%, driven 
by the £32 million net impact of Mergent and The Yield Book acquisitions and 
ISPS disposal, and foreign exchange movements due to the weakening of Sterling 
relative to the US Dollar. Cost increases were partially offset by the synergy 
achievement from the Russell Index acquisition.
Operating profit rose by 14% to £383 million (2016: £337 million), driven largely by 
FTSE Russell revenue growth and contribution from the acquisitions of Mergent 
and The Yield Book.

Post Trade Services – LCH comprises the Group’s majority owned global clearing 
business. Total income was £562 million (2016: £447 million).
OTC clearing revenue increased by 1 7%, driven by SwapClear, predominantly in 
client clearing with trade volume increasing by 29% to 1,227 ,000 (2016: 952,000). 
LCH SwapAgent executed its first trades in 201 7 , having launched in 2016, to 
simplify the processing, margining and settlement of non-cleared derivatives. 
201 7 performance is in line with the Group’s announced double-digit growth 
target for OTC clearing.
Non-OTC clearing revenue increased by 7%, reflecting strong growth in Fixed 
Income volumes cleared. Clearing in repo and cash bond markets increased to 
€87 .5 trillion (2016: €70.8 trillion). In 201 7 , RepoClear launched Sponsored Clearing, 
a service offering buy-side firms direct access to LCH, enabling firms to reduce 
their risk and maximise balance sheet efficiencies. 
Other revenue, which includes non-cash collateral management fees and 
compression services grew by 38%.
Net Treasury Income increased by 39% to £120 million with a 26% increase in 
average cash collateral held to €84.5 billion, due to increase in OTC and RepoClear 
volumes (2016: €67 .0 billion).
Cost of sales increased 47%, mainly due to growth in SwapClear and the associated 
increase in share of surplus. Gross profit increased by 1 7% to £47 4 million. 
Operating expenses increased by 4% with foreign exchange movements due to the 
weakening in Sterling relative to the Euro and higher depreciation from investment 
to support growth, partially offset by the impact of cost saving initiatives.
LCH EBITDA margin increased by 8pp to 44% (2016: 36%), moving towards the 
announced target of c.50% by 2019.
Operating profit increased by 58% to £194 million (2016: £123 million).

Post Trade Services provides clearing (CC&G), settlement and custody activities 
(both Monte Titoli). Total income (excluding inter-segmental income) was £15 1 
million (2016: £147 million). 
38 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Financial review continued CC&G clearing revenues decreased by 14% influenced by a fall in derivatives 
clearing volumes mirroring trading performance on the Italian IDEM market. 
Monte Titoli revenues increased by 6%, due to growth of custody revenues from 
domestic and international clients who transferred their portfolios to Monte Titoli 
accounts, and the benefit of a full year of a new domestic pricing structure 
introduced from May 2016. 
CC&G generates Net Treasury Income by investing the cash margin held, retaining 
any surplus after members are paid a return on their cash collateral contributions. 
Net Treasury Income decreased by 9% mainly due to unfavourable spreads and 
lower cash held in 201 7 . The average daily initial margin at €1 1.1 billion is down  
9% (2016: €12.1 billion) due to lower volatility and volumes from Italian fixed 
income markets.
Cost of sales rose by 28% largely as a result of the discount phase-out of the 
settlement acquisition cost from T2S in November 2016.
Operating expenses decreased by 21 %, driven by the absence of 2016 globeSettle 
impairment costs of £8 million.
Operating profit increased by 34% to £71 million (2016: £53 million).

Capital Markets comprises Primary and Secondary Market activities. Revenue was 
£391 million (2016: £368 million).
Revenue increased by 3%, largely driven by Primary Markets performance, with 
revenue increasing by 19% as UK equity issuance rebounded strongly in the Main 
Market after prior year uncertainty following the UK referendum to leave the 
European Union.
The total amount of capital raised across our markets, both through new and 
further issues, increased by 73% to £44.2 billion (2016: £25.6 billion). There was  
a 45% increase with 194 new issues across our markets (2016: 134). The pipeline  
of companies looking to join our markets continues to look promising.
In Secondary Markets, in the UK average order book daily value traded rose by 4% 
at £5.3 billion (2016: £5.1 billion). Italian equity trading volumes decreased by 6% 
due to lower market volatility at 276,000 trades per day (2016: 295,000). Trading on 
Turquoise, our pan-European equities platform, decreased by 28% in average daily 
equity value traded, against a strong 2016 performance to €3.9 billion (2016: €5.4 
billion), with some offset from growth in the higher margin Block Discovery trading.
Fixed Income, Derivatives and Other revenue decreased by 2%. The result reflects 
a 30% decrease in volumes on the Italian IDEM market, Fixed Income decreased 
with a decline of 6% in MTS Cash and BondVision notional value, and an 8% 
decline in MTS Repo. 
Cost of sales decreased by 30% reflecting lower Turquoise lit book revenues with 
gross profit up by 5%. 
Operating expenses increased by 15% to £195 million (2016: £169 million) with the 
main driver being foreign exchange movements due to the weakening in Sterling 
relative to the Euro. 
Operating profit increased by 2% to £180 million (2016: £1 77 million).

Technology Services provides hosting solutions, client connectivity and software 
products for the Group and third parties. Third party revenue was £91 million 
(2016: £88 million).
Operating expenses increased by 31 % to £84 million (2016: £64 million), driven 
by continued Group technology investment, centralisation of costs and foreign 
exchange movements due to the weakening in Sterling relative to the Euro and  
US Dollar. 
The Technology segment made a loss of £2 million (2016: £12 million profit).
The Group disposed of 2 Technology businesses: MillenniumIT ESP was sold  
on 28 December 201 7 and Exactpro was sold on 1 7 January 2018 post year end. 
These businesses generated a total of £30 million revenue, £22 million of cost  
of sales and £8 million operating cost in 201 7 .

Operating Expenses (Continuing Operations)
£ m
1.  Inorganic includes costs for businesses held for less than 12 months in either period: ISPS, 
Mergent, SwapMatch and The Yield Book
Operating expenses increased by 6%. The Group cost base was adversely affected 
by £43 million of foreign exchange movements arising as a result of translating 
and revaluing its foreign currency costs, assets and liabilities into LSEG’s reporting 
currency of Sterling. The main drivers of the constant currency cost base increase 
were variable staff costs and depreciation. Depreciation, amortisation and 
impairment increased by 34% to £103 million (2016: £77 million excluding £8 
million globeSettle impairment) during the year. A similar increase is expected in 
2018, as the Group continues to invest in core technology, react to regulatory 
change and deliver new products. In 201 7 , the Group achieved the previously 
announced run rate synergy targets for Frank Russell Company and LCH-related 
cost savings. Offsetting this was a £32 million net impact of inorganic items, being 
businesses owned for less than 12 months in either period, principally ISPS, 
Mergent and The Yield Book. The Group continues to exercise strong cost control 
and invest in new products to support growth. 2018 will see the effect of a full year 
of The Yield Book costs and recent Technology disposals.
Share of Loss after Tax of Associates
The £9 million loss reflects an increase in the Group’s share of the operating loss  
of CurveGlobal to 43.38% (2016: 26%) following further investment, and a £4 
million recognition of historic losses due to increased ownership share. Despite 
client focus on MiFID II implementation during 201 7 , CurveGlobal volumes 
continued to grow and open interest at the end of 201 7 was 162,000 contracts 
(2016: 39,000 contracts).
Non-Underlying Items and Purchased Intangible Assets
Amortisation of purchased intangible assets decreased by £4 million to £153 
million (2016: £157 million). Additional charges included £25 million of 
transaction-related costs, £7 million of restructuring costs and £8 million of 
integration costs. These were partially offset by a profit after tax of £7 million 
relating to the disposal of ISPS and MillenniumIT ESP businesses. 
Finance Income and Expense and Taxation
Net finance costs were £62 million, down £1 million on the prior year on a 
continuing basis. 
The effective tax rate (ETR) for the year in respect of continuing underlying 
operations and including the effect of prior year adjustments, is 22.4% (2016: 
22.5%). This reflects reductions in both the UK and Italian tax rates, the mix of 
profits in the Group and finalisation of prior year tax returns. The underlying ETR 
for 201 7 excluding one-off items was 23.4%, and is expected to be similar in 2018.
The contribution of continued underlying operations in the US towards the ETR 
was stable in the period. US tax reform was signed into law in December 201 7 with 
effect from 2018. However, we do not expect the lower Federal tax rate to have a 
material impact on the Group’s combined underlying effective tax rate. In part this 
is due to the manner in which the US acquisitions have been financed and the 
introduction of a new base erosion anti-abuse tax (the BEAT), which will apply to 
intercompany transactions with the wider Group. 
Cash Flow and Balance Sheet
The Group’s business continued to be strongly cash generative during the year, with 
cash generated from continuing activities of £852 million (201 6: £6 18 million).
At 31 December 201 7 , the Group had net assets of £3,752 million (2016: £3,614 
million). The central counterparty clearing business assets and liabilities within 
LCH and CC&G largely offset each other but are shown gross on the balance sheet 
as the amounts receivable and payable are with different counterparties.

At 3 1 December 201 7 , the Group had operating net debt of £1,639 million after 
setting aside £1,042 million of cash and cash equivalents held to support regulatory 
and operational requirements, including regulated cash and cash equivalents at LCH 
Group, and amounts covering requirements at other LSEG companies. Regulatory 
and operational cash increased by £194 million during the period to 3 1 December 
201 7 as a result of over £1 00 million surplus cash held in LCH, due to be distributed 
to LSEG in H1 2018, with the balance comprising cash retained at Monte Titoli (to 
support its CSDR obligations) and other regulatory and operational requirements.
The Group’s gross borrowings increased by £787 million during the period to  
3 1 December 201 7 , primarily due to the acquisitions of The Yield Book and  
Mergent as well as the completion of a £200 million share buy back programme. 
The Group retained total committed bank facilities of £1,200 million during the 
financial year. A new facility of £600 million was arranged on improved terms  
whilst an existing facility, also of £600 million, was extended for a further year  
to November 2022. The new facility is a 5 year commitment with 2 one-year 
extension options available to the Group, subject to lender approval. 
In September 201 7 , the Group took advantage of favourable debt capital market 
conditions and extended its debt maturity profile by issuing €1 billion of bonds  
in 2 €500 million tranches under its updated £2 billion euro medium term notes 
programme. The bonds are unsecured and the tranches are due for repayment in 
September 2024 and September 2029. The coupons are fixed at 0.875% per annum 
40 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Financial review continued and 1.75% per annum respectively. However, €700 million of the proceeds of  
the bonds have been swapped into USD as part of the Group’s objective to match 
earnings in currency and protect key ratios, resulting in an effective blended rate  
of interest of 2.8% per annum overall. The Group redeemed in full LCH Group’s €200 
million Preferred Securities at the first Issuer Call date in May 201 7 ; it also put in 
place a £1 billion euro commercial paper programme later in 201 7 which, at the  
end of the year, remained unutilised.
With over £650 million of undrawn, committed bank lines available, together with 
strong cash generation, the Group continues to be well positioned to fund future 
growth, with scope for further refinancing in 2018/19 to underpin its longer term 
debt capital positioning.

The Group’s interest cover, the coverage of net finance expense by EBITDA 
(consolidated earnings before net finance charges, taxation, impairment, 
depreciation and amortisation, foreign exchange gains or losses and non-
underlying items), increased to 15.5 times (2016: 13.0 times) in the 12 months to 
31 December 201 7 . This was driven primarily by earnings growth with interest 
costs remaining in line with 2016. The Group’s organic cash generation remained 
strong but significant inorganic expansion increased leverage (operating net debt 
to EBITDA updated to account for the EBITDA of acquisitions or disposals 
undertaken in the period) to 1.7 times at 31 December 201 7 (31 December 2016: 
1.1 times). Leverage remains well within the targeted range of 1–2 times.
The Group’s long-term credit ratings were raised on the back of strong growth and 
prudent leverage management. Moody’s and S&P increased their ratings of LSEG 
to A3 and A- respectively and changed their outlooks to stable. LCH Group 
withdrew its rating upon redemption of its Preferred Securities but initiated new 
long term ratings with S&P at LCH Ltd and LCH S.A. to support business lines, with 
both ratings set at A+ with a stable outlook.

The Group’s principal foreign exchange exposure arises as a result of translating  
its foreign currency earnings, assets and liabilities into LSEG’s reporting currency 
of Sterling. For the 12 months to 31 December 201 7 , for continuing operations, the 
main exposures for the Group were its European-based Euro reporting businesses 
and its US based operations, principally FTSE Russell, Mergent and The Yield Book. 
A 10 Euro cent movement in the average £/€ rate for the year and a 10 cent 
movement in the average £/US$ rate for the year would have changed the Group’s 
continuing operating profit for the year before amortisation of purchased 
intangible assets and non-underlying items by approximately £23 million and  
£24 million, respectively.
The Group continues to manage its translation risk exposure by matching the 
currency of its debt to the currency of its earnings, where possible, to ensure its 
key financial ratios are protected from material foreign exchange rate volatility.
Earnings per share
The Group recorded an adjusted basic earnings per share, which excludes 
amortisation of purchased intangible assets and non-underlying items, of  
148.7 pence (2016: 129.7 pence). Basic earnings per share were 146.4 pence  
(2016: 43.5 pence).
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 37 .2 pence per share, which together 
with the interim dividend of 14.4 pence per share paid to shareholders in 
September 201 7 , results in a 19% increase in the total dividend to 5 1.6 pence  
per share. The final dividend will be paid on 30 May 2018 to shareholders on  
the register as at 4 May 2018.

Strategic Report Financial review The management of risk is fundamental to the successful execution 
of our Strategic Plan and to the resilience of our operations. The Group 
adopts a proactive approach to risk management. During 2017 the 
Group has successfully adapted its systems, processes and controls  
to meet several significant changes in the regulatory environment 
including MiFID II and the introduction of the EU Benchmark 
Regulations. Our approach to both regulatory and other changes has 
allowed the Group to continue to support and service its key markets 
and clients and maintain the Group’s standards for delivering stable 
and resilient services that meet our clients’ needs.
LSEG’s Risk Culture
While our formal risk framework codifies the objectives and practices that govern 
our processes, our risk culture determines the manner in which we manage risks 
every day.
Our management culture embeds risk awareness, transparency and 
accountability. A strong emphasis is placed on the timely identification  
and reporting of risk exposures and in the strategic analysis of prevailing or 
anticipated risks. The responsibility for identifying and managing risks rests  
with management and with the Executive Committee, with independent  
oversight from our Group Risk Management Team and from the Group Board Risk 
Committee. Our risk culture is one of our most fundamental tools for effective risk 
management. Our behaviour framework feeds into the criteria that we use to 
assess the effectiveness of our risk culture and the communication, escalation 
and use of risk analysis to make strategic decisions.
Strategic Risk Objectives
LSEG’s Strategic Risk Objectives derive from the strategy of the Group, which is 
defined annually by the Board. The risk objectives of the Group are as follows:
 – Maintaining a strong risk culture throughout the Group: the Risk Management 
Framework is embedded within divisions and functions
 – Maintaining stakeholder confidence: the Group’s stakeholders have confidence 
in its ability to deliver its strategic objectives with robust and effective 
governance and operational controls
 – Maintaining stable earnings growth: the strategic growth of the business is 
delivered in a controlled manner with long-term value enhancement and low 
volatility of underlying profitability
 – Maintaining capital requirements: the Group has sufficient capital resources to 
meet regulatory requirements, to cover unexpected losses and to meet the 
Group’s strategic ambitions
 – Maintaining liquidity: the Group retains or has adequate access to funding to 
meet its obligations, taking into account the availability of funds
 – Monitoring and managing credit risk exposure in conjunction with prevailing 
macroeconomic and geopolitical factors to ensure Group Thresholds limits are 
always adhered to 
 – Ensuring prudent levels of margin, default funds and liquidity arrangements in 
the Group’s CCPs
 – Maintaining operational stability by facilitating orderly market operations:  
the Group’s operations are delivered in a secure and efficient manner  
without disruption
 – Achieving operational excellence consistent with the Group’s aspiration to be 
operationally “best in class”
 – Maintaining physical and IT security to protect the Group’s assets, our people, 
infrastructure, data and other assets
 – Adhering to regulatory requirements: the Group conducts activities at all times 
in full compliance with its regulatory obligations

Current risks on which we continue to focus relate to:
 – Geopolitical Uncertainty: Whilst more information with regard to the timing, 
progress and outcome of the negotiation process of the UK’s future relationship 
with the EU is starting to emerge uncertainty is expected to continue in 2018 as 
the UK government moves into the second phase of negotiations
 – Regulatory Change: Regulatory change affects the operations of the Group as well 
as those of our users and customers and increases regulatory risk through 
increased regulatory compliance risk. Following the requirements of MiFID II and 
MIFIR coming into effect on 3 January 2018, further changes will continue in 2018
 – Transformation: Recent acquisitions increase the transformation risk, whilst 
delivering opportunities to compete globally
 – Liquidity: The repo market has been adversely affected by banks contracting 
their balance sheets in response to leverage restrictions. This continues to impact 
CCPs who use secured investments, such as reverse repos, as mandated under 
EMIR, to maintain sufficient ongoing liquidity and immediate access to funds
 – Security and Resilience: The security and resilience of systems represents a key 
global emerging risk across the whole financial services industry
The Group has an ongoing programme of development and enhancement of its 
Enterprise-wide Risk Management Framework (ERMF). The ERMF metrics and 
indicators include stress testing used to monitor risks against risk appetite to 
respond to emerging or unexpected risks.
Going forward, we will continue to strengthen our Risk Management by building 
on the frameworks we have put in place. Accordingly, we believe the Group is well 
positioned to seek new opportunities in the year ahead.

Group Risk Appetite
LSEG’s Risk Appetite is defined as the level of risk that the Group will accept in 
pursuit of its strategic objectives. The Group Risk Appetite Statement, proposed  
by the Executive Committee, is approved by the Board at least annually and is 
determined in conjunction with the Group’s strategy and aligned to the Strategic 
Risk Objectives. The components of Risk Appetite that relate to Central 
Counterparty Clearing Houses (CCPs) and Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) 
are also approved by the respective Boards within the Group, in compliance with 
EMIR, CSDR and other applicable regulations.
The Group Risk Appetite is cascaded down to each business unit. Regular 
reporting at both Group and Business Unit levels uses Risk Appetite as a 
benchmark that can then be incorporated into the Group Risk Policy Framework.
Risks that are outside Risk Appetite are escalated to Executive Committee members 
and to the appropriate Risk Committee. The Risk Appetite status is also reported  
to the Board Risk Committee and to the Board for all aggregated Group risks.
Three Lines of Defence
LSEG’s risk control structure is based on the ‘3 lines of defence’ model:
 – The First line (Management) is responsible and accountable for identifying, 
assessing and managing risk
 – The Second line (Risk Management and Compliance) is responsible for defining 
the Risk Management process and policy framework, providing challenge to the 
first line on Risk Management activities, assessing risks and reporting to the 
Group Board Committees on risk exposure
 – The Third line (Internal Audit) provides independent assurance to the Board  
and other key stakeholders over the effectiveness of the systems of controls  
and the ERMF
Overall Risk Assessment
Key risk categories include strategic, operational and financial risks. Operational 
risk includes IT risk as well as risk associated with operational processes with 
financial risk including credit, clearing and market risks. We recognise that each  
of these risks, if not properly managed and/or mitigated, could have an impact  
on the Group and on its subsidiaries’ reputation. Indications of the relative sizes  
of these risk types are shown overleaf.
Risk Management Approach
Our approach to managing risks includes a bottom up and a top down approach. 
Key external and internal factors are stress tested across our Group operations to 
assess the potential impact on the financial results, strategic plans and 
operational resilience.
The risk function is centralised at the Group level with the exception of the CCPs 
where each clearing house has its own risk team in compliance with the EMIR 
requirements and CSDs which will be required to have their own risk teams under 
the forthcoming provisions of CSDR. The function’s main role is to maintain a fit for 
purpose Group ERMF and recommend to the Risk Committee and to the Board Risk 
Appetite statements. It also reviews and monitors the risk profile of the Group and of 
its subsidiaries and ensures it remains within Risk Appetite. The function supports 
the Risk Committee members by providing reports on the Group’s risk profile and 
timely escalation of exceptions. It also monitors compliance with rules and 
regulations and develops and maintains frameworks to facilitate the identification, 
assessment, reporting and monitoring of all the principal risks that could materially 
impact the reputation, financial position or operations of the Group.

Strategic Report Risk management oversight Risk Management Cycle
The Group’s Risk Management process is set out in the Risk Management Cycle. 
The key to the cycle is that it both begins with, and feeds back to, the Business 
Strategy – which is ultimately determined by both internal and external drivers. 
This ensures that the management and assessment of risk remains a 
fundamental component of the Group’s strategic decision making process.

The development of an economic capital model, consisting of 4 risk components

assess risk and the economic effects of risk-taking activities. The relative 
contribution of each component to the Group’s total economic capital is shown in 
the chart below. Operational risk represents the largest component of the Group’s 
economic capital; this implies that operational risk is the main source of risk for the 
Group which is expected given that the Group is a market infrastructure business.

Stress Testing Capabilities and Viability Statement
The Group’s viability statement is underpinned by the Group’s stress testing 
process. Under this process, a set of severe but plausible scenarios appropriate  
to the business of the Group and reflecting our principal risks are defined by 
Management, and the financial impact of each on the Group is quantified.  
The stress test scenarios are re-assessed annually and may be updated either 
during this review process or at other times during the year where the external 
environment changes.
A 3 year horizon is used for LSEG’s financial viability statement, consistent with 
the Group’s strategic planning cycle. The scenario impacts were evaluated  
on the Group’s key financial metrics: liquidity headroom; leverage; interest cover; 
and regulatory capital headroom.
In addition, a set of compounded stresses was evaluated to provide further 
confidence on the ongoing financial viability of the Group even under very highly 
stressed environments. The process and final output of the stress tests was 
reviewed by management and by the Board and Audit Committee. They also 
reviewed and discussed ‘reverse’ stress testing, which was performed to assess 
what would be required to breach the Group’s covenants.
The Directors’ financial viability statement is contained in the Directors’ Report  
on page 98.
CCP Risk Management and Oversight
Each of the Group’s CCPs complies with the appropriate regulatory requirements. 
Consequently, they each manage their risk under the governance of their Board of 
Directors and of their internal risk management structure. The Group monitors the 
CCP’s aggregated risks positions by using tools that measure the overall exposure 
to counterparty risk, credit risk (including latent market risk where a default can 
result in a CCP having the market risk inherent in the defaulter’s portfolio) and 
liquidity risk. It uses a bottom-up approach for the monitoring of operational risks.
The Group’s CCPs are managed in accordance with our ERMF , which includes  
a CCP Financial Risk Policy specifying minimum risk standards for margin 
confidence level, default fund cover, liquidity, counterparty concentrations,  
new member assessment, reporting and collateral. This promotes consistency  
in the oversight of our clearing risks while protecting the independence of the 
CCPs’ risk management processes as required by relevant regulation.
CCP Risk Management and Operations
The Group’s CCPs interpose themselves between 2 counterparties in a trade  
and assume the legal counterparty risk for eligible transactions that are cleared 
through their markets. If either party defaults on the trade, the CCP becomes 
accountable for the defaulter’s risk and associated liabilities.
Fundamental to a CCP’s risk process is its collection of high quality and highly 
liquid collateral from clearing members and clients as security for potential 
defaulter risk. The CCPs have in place a variety of margin models, across asset 
classes, to calculate the collateral requirements appropriate to each member’s risk 
position. Clearing members are also required to pledge collateral to the default 
fund(s), the overall size of which, for each clearing service, is computed to at least 
the ‘Cover 2’ level – large enough to cover the 2 members that would create the 
largest liability given a simultaneous default under extreme but plausible market 
conditions – and allocated across the members of the clearing service.
The adequacy of the CCP’s Financial Resources (Margins and Default Fund 
contributions collected from its members) is assessed on at least a daily basis and 
reported regularly in accordance with the CCP Financial Risk Policy using Group 
44 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Risk management oversight continued Risk Appetite as a benchmark. The Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures 
(PFMI) produced by CPMI-IOSCO and EMIR provide the minimum Risk 
Management standards that a CCP should apply; however, LSEG CCPs apply  
more stringent margin confidence levels in most cases.
If a clearing member fails, the collateral collected is used by a CCP to complete the 
trades and fulfil the failed organisation’s obligations. This ensures that the party 
on the other side of the trade is not negatively impacted by the default. The 
margin is calculated to cover market moves up to a certain confidence level.  
If losses exceed the defaulter’s financial resources, then under EMIR Regulation 
the CCP is required to utilise a specified proportion of its own capital ‘skin-in-the-
game’ before it can utilise the assets of non-defaulters. The skin-in-the-game 
represents a proportion of the CCP’s own capital that is sufficient to act as an 
incentive for CCPs to minimise the operational risk related to default management 
and to adopt robust risk management processes. Once the skin-in-the-game has 
been exhausted, further losses are allocated to the non-defaulting members via 
funded member contributions to a mutualised default fund for each asset class  
or group thereof followed by further cash calls known as assessments and then  
a loss distribution waterfall set out in the CCP rulebook. CCP operational risk is 
managed using a bottom-up approach and is aligned with the Group’s operational 
risk management approach.

 – The Board is responsible for determining the Group Risk Appetite. The Board’s 
Risk and Audit Committees receive regular reports presenting the aggregate 
risks of the whole Group measured against the Appetite
 – The ERMF defines roles and responsibilities for risk management oversight  
and activities, including for the Board, the Executive Committee and sub-
Committees thereof
 – The Executive Financial and Operational Risk Committees monitor and report  
on the risk profile of the Group; review and challenge the application of the 
Group risk framework; recommend Risk Appetite Statements to the Executive 
Committee and monitor compliance with the relevant risk policies
 – The Group has a Business Continuity Management framework in place which  
is managed and maintained through a fully established Business Continuity 
Programme. The Business Continuity Programme is overseen by the Business 
Continuity Board, a sub-committee of the Operational Risk Committee. The 
Business Continuity Board receives the self-certification results of all the Group’s 
Business areas
 – The New Product/Market Committee reviews and recommends business cases 
to the Executive Committee ensuring product innovation and new market risks 
are appropriately identified and assessed
Each Group-level risk is owned by a member of the Executive Committee who  
is responsible for managing or mitigating the risk in order to remain within Risk 
Appetite. The Board and the Risk Committee receive presentations on material 
risks and related mitigants as appropriate.
The Reports of the Audit and of the Risk Committees, on pages 65–71, provide 
details on the work carried out to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight 
responsibilities for risk management and systems of internal control.

Global economy 
As a diversified markets infrastructure business, we operate in a broad range of 
equity, fixed income and derivative markets servicing clients who increasingly seek 
global products and solutions. If the global economy underperforms, lower activity 
in our markets may lead to lower revenue.
The UK Brexit negotiations with the EU have added uncertainty into global markets.  
Discussions between the UK and EU continued through 201 7 and the European  
Council finally accepted in December that progress in the first phase of negotiations 
was sufficient to move on and indicated that a transition period should not continue 
beyond the end of 2020.
Stronger economic data and inflation concerns have dominated central bank official  
rate actions. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the Fed Funds  
target rate 3 times during the course of 201 7 . In November the Bank of England (BoE) 
increased the Bank Rate by 25bp. Meanwhile the European Central Bank (ECB) has 
left rates unchanged though commenced a reduction in its quantitative easing 
programme. The expected economic growth could fail to materialise and higher 
rates could lead to a slowdown.
Ongoing geopolitical tensions continue to add uncertainty in the markets. This, 
together with the continuing potential for political change through national elections 
(for instance, the upcoming Italian elections in March 2018), may impact confidence 
and activity levels. This will be monitored closely.
The footprint of the Group has continued to broaden, further 
improving the geographical diversification of the Group’s income 
streams. The Group mitigates the foreign exchange translation 
exposure created by ownership of overseas businesses by 
matching, to the extent possible, the currency of its debt to the 
currency of its income streams. This is supplemented as required 
by a hedging programme using market standard derivative 
instruments. Material foreign currency transactions relate mainly 
to mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and dividend related receipts 
are hedged as required by Group Treasury Policy.
The Group performs regular analysis to monitor the markets and 
the potential impacts of market price movements on the business. 
Activities include Key Risk Indicator tracking, stress testing, and 
hedging. We continue to actively monitor the ongoing 
developments following the result of the UK referendum on leaving 
the EU. Committees have been established to assess and address 
areas of impact on our operations and the Group has formulated 
contingency plans with the objectives of continuity of market 
function and customer service in the event of a hard Brexit.
The Financial Risk Committee closely monitors and analyses 
multiple market stress scenarios and action plans in order  
to minimise any impacts stemming from a potential deterioration 
of the macroeconomic environment. The stress scenarios are 
regularly reviewed and updated in response to changes in 
macroeconomic conditions. Additional ad hoc analysis such as 
special credit reviews of counterparties are presented to the 
Financial Risk Committee for consideration where events dictate.

Regulatory change and compliance 
The Group and its exchanges, other trading venues, CCPs, index administrators,  
central securities depositories, trade repositories and other regulated entities  
operate in areas that are highly regulated by governmental, competition and  
other regulatory bodies. 
There is a risk that the UK’s exit from the EU may lead to considerable regulatory 
change. There is a range of EU and UK measures which impact our business directly 
or indirectly including EU Benchmark Regulation, Securities Financing Transaction 
Regulation (SFTR) and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II). Together 
with MiFIR, its accompanying regulation, MiFID II came into force on 3 January 
2018. LSEG has delivered a series of key technological and procedural changes to 
prepare for the implementation of these new regulations.
In addition, several regulatory initiatives are ongoing, some of which directly affect 
LSEG activities, especially in the context of the departure of the UK from the EU.  
This is the case with ongoing CCP regulatory initiatives, mainly EMIR Review and  
CCP Recovery and Resolution. In May and June 201 7 , the European Commission 
proposed to review EMIR transaction-level requirements and the supervisory 
framework applicable to EU and third country CCPs. These reviews and in particular, 
the proposal to introduce the option to impose enhanced supervision or location 
requirements on third country CCPs that are of systemic importance for the EU,  
could have implications for the Group’s CCPs. The Group monitors these regulatory 
developments in order to help the market address the changing regulatory 
environment through its multiple locations. The European Commission made 
proposals to significantly transform the European Supervisory Authorities, principally 
by empowering ESMA to be the central supervisor for a range of new financial 
entities including systemically important third country CCPs, third country 
benchmark administrators, data service reporting providers and as the approval 
authority for certain types of prospectuses. However the nature of final political 
agreement on the proposal is highly uncertain. The European Commission made 
proposals to introduce a prudential regime for investment firms which may affect 
the ability of proprietary trading firms to provide liquidity on LSEG markets.
In December 201 7 , the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published final 
recommendations on the Basel III Framework, which as currently drafted could  
adversely impact CCP clearing volumes with implications for the Group’s revenues. 
However, in November 2016 the European Commission published proposed changes 
to the EU Capital Requirements Regulation which largely neutralise the effects for 
European clients and are currently being discussed with the other co-legislators.  
The changes would allow CCP clearing members to reduce their exposure measures 
by the amount of initial margin received from clients for CCP cleared derivatives. This 
would reduce leverage ratios, thus removing a financial barrier for clearing members 
to offer client clearing.
The EU Benchmarks Regulation came into effect on 1 January 2018 and FTSE Russell  
will need to apply for authorisation as a regulated benchmark administrator by 2020. 
In many of our key jurisdictions, there is an increasing legislative and regulatory 
focus on cyber security, data flow and protection and emerging technology. LSEG 
supports the regulatory efforts on these issues, as they increase the standards for 
clients, vendors and other third parties with whom we interact. Regulators are 
monitoring and considering regulatory frameworks around the development of 
innovative financial services technologies, which are important for maintaining the 
resiliency in the market.
Negotiations also continue on a possible Financial Transaction T ax (FTT). During  
201 7 little progress was made, however a FTT could adversely impact volumes in 
financial markets.
In the US, there is a considerable and comprehensive review of the financial services 
regulatory framework, including in areas impacting our capital markets, post trade, 
information services and technology divisions. We remain closely engaged with the 
relevant policymakers on these potential changes, which are likely to see progress  
in 2018. 
There is a risk that one or more of the Group’s entities may fail to comply with the 
laws and regulatory requirements to which it is, or becomes, subject. In this event, 
the entity in question may be subject to censures, fines and other regulatory or  
legal proceedings.
Changes in the regulatory environment form a key input into our 
strategic planning, including the political impact on our growth 
strategies, both organic and inorganic. We monitor regulatory 
developments continually and engage directly with regulatory  
and governmental authorities at national, EU and international 
levels. The Group has developed contingency plans to address  
the UK’s exit from the EU and monitors developments closely.
We continue to develop our relationships with the key political 
stakeholders in the EU, North America and Asia. Potential impacts 
from regulatory change are assessed and, depending on the 
impact, opportunities are developed and mitigating strategies  
and actions are planned. 
As the various regulatory initiatives progress, there will be greater 
certainty with regard to their likely final form. The Group continues 
to focus on remaining well positioned to respond to regulatory 
developments and further opportunities exist for the Group to 
deliver solutions to help the market address the changing 
regulatory environment including those linked with the departure 
of the UK from the EU. 
The Group continues to maintain systems and controls to mitigate 
compliance risk. Compliance policies and procedures are regularly 
reviewed to ensure that Group entities and staff are compliant  
with applicable laws and regulations and uphold our corporate 
standards. All staff across the Group are subject to mandatory 
compliance training.

Principal risks and uncertainties continued
RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATION RISK LEVEL
Competition 
The Group operates in a highly competitive and global industry. Continued 
consolidation has fuelled competition including between peers and service providers 
in different geographical areas.
In our Capital Markets operations, there is a risk that competitors will improve their 
customer service, products, pricing and technology in a way that erodes our 
businesses. There is strong competition for primary listings and capital raises from 
other global exchanges and regional centres. We maintain a dedicated international 
team who promote the benefits of listing on our markets to international issuers, the 
global advisory community and other stakeholders. Options for both debt and equity 
funding are also increasing as private equity, venture capital and new options such as 
crowd-funding and crypto-currencies are increasingly being considered. The Group 
will need to continue strong and collaborative dialogue with customers to ensure it 
remains responsive to their changing requirements.
In Post Trade Services, competition will continue to intensify as we see a shift 
towards open access and interoperability of CCPs and legislative requirements  
for mandatory clearing of certain OTC derivative products. While this may create  
new business opportunities for the Group, competitors may respond more quickly  
to changing market conditions or develop products that are preferred by customers. 
The Group’s track record of working with customers and other financial market 
infrastructure providers, including the user focused model in LCH, will help us  
to continue to deliver innovative new products and services to meet evolving 
customer needs. 
The Group’s Information Services business faces competition from a variety of 
sources, notably from other venues that offer market data relating to securities that 
are traded on the Group’s equity markets, as well as from index providers which offer 
indexes and other benchmarking tools which compete with those offered by the 
Group. As the Information Services offering diversifies and seeks to meet customer 
needs for new data segments and asset classes, it is facing a broader range of 
competitors. Furthermore, if the Group’s share of equity trading were to come under 
further pressure, the Group’s market data offering might be seen by current and 
prospective customers as being less valuable, which may adversely affect the Group’s 
business, financial condition and operating results. If competitors are quicker to 
access technology innovations such as artificial intelligence, they may achieve a 
valuable advantage which may impact the Group’s relative profitability and ability to 
develop new services in a similar way. Our integrated and business-led approach to 
technology research and development (R&D) will help us to manage this risk and the 
Group is well advanced in investigating and applying numerous new technology 
innovations, including in Information Services.
In Technology Services, there is intense competition across all activities and there  
are strong incumbents in some of our growth areas. New entrants are increasing 
from both within and outside of our traditional competition base. Start-ups, which 
may be sponsored by existing LSEG competitors or customers, are introducing new 
technology and commercial models to our customer base which we need to respond 
to with new products and services of our own. Our continual client dialogue and 
investment in product management and planning are critical to understanding and 
managing the impact of changing customer requirements in our technology and 
other business lines.
Competitive markets are, by their very nature, dynamic, and the 
effects of competitor activity can never be fully mitigated. Senior 
management and a broad range of customer-facing staff in all 
business areas are actively engaged with clients to understand 
their evolving needs and motivations. We have established a  
Group Relationship Programme to co-ordinate this across Group 
businesses globally. 
The Group undertakes constant market monitoring and pricing 
revision to mitigate risks and ensure we are competitive. 
Commercial initiatives are aligned with our clients and this is 
complemented by an ongoing focus on technology operations, 
research and development.
Transformation 
Given the current levels of change and alignment activity taking place across the 
Group. The Group is exposed to transformation risks (risk of loss or failure resulting 
from change/transformation). This derives from internal (organic) change and 
change required by the integration of acquisitions. As part of the alignment 
processes, the Group targets specific synergy deliveries.
A failure to successfully align the businesses of the Group may lead to an increased 
cost base without a commensurate increase in revenue; a failure to capture future 
product and market opportunities; and risks in respect of capital requirements, 
regulatory relationships and management time. 
The additional work related to M&A and alignment activities could have an adverse 
impact on the Group’s day-to-day performance and/or key strategic initiatives which 
could damage the Group’s reputation. 
The size and complexity of the recent acquisitions have increased the Group’s change 
management and transformation risks. However, it has also increased its 
opportunities to compete on a global scale.
The LSEG ERMF ensures appropriate Risk Management across the 
Group, and the governance of the Group following a merger or 
acquisition is aligned and strengthened as appropriate. The Group 
performs regular reporting of change performance, including 
ongoing alignment activity. 
Each major initiative is overseen by a steering committee which 
monitors the associated risks closely and is typically chaired by the 
Chief Financial Officer and includes Executive Committee 
members. Regular reports are submitted to the Executive 
Committee, the Board Risk Committee and the Board.
The Group has an effective track record of integrating acquisitions 
and delivering tangible synergies. This is supported by robust 
governance and programme management structures. 49 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017

RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATION RISK LEVEL
Reputation/Brand 
A number of the Group’s businesses have iconic national brands that are well-
recognised at international as well as at national levels. The strong reputation of  
the Group’s businesses and their valuable brand names are a key selling point.  
Any events or actions that damage the reputation or brands of the Group could 
adversely affect its business, financial condition and operating results.
Failure to protect the Group’s intellectual property rights adequately could result in 
costs for the Group, negatively impact the Group’s reputation and affect the ability  
of the Group to compete effectively. Further, defending or enforcing the Group’s 
intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and 
managerial resources, which could adversely affect the Group’s business, financial 
condition and operating results.
LSEG has policies and procedures in place which are designed to 
ensure the appropriate use of the Group’s brands and to maintain 
the integrity of the Group’s reputation.
LSEG actively monitors the use of its brands and other  
intellectual property in order to prevent, identify and address  
any infringements. 
The Group protects its intellectual property by relying upon a 
combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws,  
trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and other 
contractual arrangements with its affiliates, clients, customers, 
suppliers, strategic partners and others.
FINANCIAL RISKS
The risk of financial failure, reputational loss, loss of earnings and/or capital as a result of investment activity, lack of liquidity, funding or capital, and/or the inappropriate 
recording, reporting and disclosure of financial results, taxation or regulatory information.
RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATION RISK LEVEL
Credit risk 
Clearing  
CCPs in the Group are exposed to credit risk as a result of their clearing activities. A 
default by a CCP clearing member that could not be managed within the resources  
of the defaulted clearing member, could adversely affect that CCP’s revenues and its 
customers’ goodwill. CCPs authorised in the EU are required to make a proportion of 
their regulatory capital available to cover default losses after the defaulter’s resources 
have been exhausted and prior to allocation of losses to non-defaulters and so, in 
extreme circumstances, a default could lead to a call on the Group CCPs’ own capital 
‘skin-in-the-game’. CCPs may also be exposed to credit exposure to providers of 
infrastructure services such as Central Securities Depositaries (CSDs) and commercial 
banks providing investment and operational services. In addition, certain CCPs within 
the Group have interoperability margin arrangements with other CCPs requiring 
collateral to be exchanged in proportion to the value of the underlying transactions. 
The relevant clearing provider entities within the Group are therefore exposed to the 
risk of a default of other CCPs under such arrangements.
Non-Clearing 
CCPs and other parts of LSEG Group are also exposed to credit risk as a result of 
placing money with investment counterparties on both a secured and unsecured 
basis. Losses may occur due to the default of either the investment counterparty or 
of the issuer of bonds bought outright or received as collateral.
Clearing  
As CCP members continue to work towards strengthening of their 
balance sheets, the risk to LSEG CCPs of a member default reduces, 
although continuing geopolitical uncertainty continues and the 
banking sectors of some countries remain stressed. The financial 
risks associated with clearing operations are further mitigated by:
 – Strict CCP membership rules including supervisory capital, 
financial strength and operational capability
 – The maintenance of prudent levels of margin and default funds 
to cover exposures to participants. Members deposit margin, 
computed at least daily, to cover the expected costs which the 
clearing service would incur in closing out open positions in a 
volatile market in the event of the member’s default. A default 
fund sized to cover the default of the 2 members with the largest 
exposures in each service using a suite of extreme but plausible 
stress tests mutualises losses in excess of margin amongst the 
clearing members;
 – Regular ‘Fire Drills’ are carried out to test the operational 
soundness of the CCPs’ default management processes
 – Infrastructure providers are regularly assessed in line  
with policy
Non-Clearing  
Policies are in place to ensure that investment counterparties  
are of good credit quality, and at least 95% of CCP commercial 
bank deposits are secured. CCP and non-CCP counterparty 
concentration risk is consolidated and monitored daily at the 
Group level and reported to the Executive Committee and to  
the Board Risk Committee, including limits and status rating.

The Group’s CCPs assume the counterparty risk for all transactions that are cleared 
through their markets. In the event of default of their clearing members, therefore, 
credit risk will manifest itself as market risk. As this market risk is only present in the 
event of default this is referred to as ‘latent market risk’. The latent market risk 
includes interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, equity risk and commodity price 
risk as well as country risk, issuer risk and concentration risk. This risk is greater if 
market conditions are unfavourable at the time of the default.
Non-Clearing  
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of its broadening 
geographical footprint. There are, however, also benefits of global diversification 
including reduced exposure to local events such as the UK Brexit vote.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its borrowing activities and 
treasury investments. Further increases in interest rates in 2018 may increase the 
Group’s exposure to these risks. 
Clearing  
The margins and default funds referred to previously are sized to 
protect against latent market risk. The adequacy of these resources 
is evaluated daily by subjecting member and customer positions  
to ‘extreme but plausible’ stress scenarios encapsulating not only 
historical crises, but theoretical forward-looking scenarios and 
decorrelation events. All our CCPs are compliant with the 
appropriate regulatory requirements regarding margin calculations, 
capital and default rules. Latent market risk is monitored and 
managed on a day-to-day basis by the risk teams within the 
clearing services. Committees overseeing market risks meet on  
a regular basis.
Non-Clearing  
Foreign exchange (FX) risk is monitored closely and translation risk 
is managed by matching the currency of the Group’s debt to its 
earnings to protect key ratios and partially hedge currency net 
assets. To ensure this is effective, and also to manage any local  
FX transaction risks, FX derivatives including cross-currency  
swaps are used – under a control framework governed by LSEG 
Board approved policy.
The split between floating and fixed debt is managed to  
support the Group’s target of maintaining an interest coverage 
ratio that underpins a good investment grade credit rating. 
Authorised derivatives can be used to supplement a mix of  
floating rate loan borrowings and fixed rate bond debt to  
achieve the Group’s Policy objective.
For more information on this risk, see Note 2 to the accounts, Financial Risk Management on pages 120–124.
Liquidity risk 
Clearing  
There are 2 distinct types of risk to which the Group’s CCPs are exposed to that are 
commonly referred to as liquidity risk – market liquidity risk and funding liquidity 
risk. The former is the risk that it may be difficult or expensive to liquidate a large or 
concentrated position and is addressed under market risk. The latter is the risk that 
the CCP may not have enough cash to pay variation margin to non-defaulters or to 
physically settle securities delivered by a non-defaulter that cannot be on-sold to a 
defaulter and this is the subject of this section. 
The Group’s CCPs collect clearing members’ margin and/or default funds 
contributions in cash and/or in highly liquid securities. To maintain sufficient 
ongoing liquidity and immediate access to funds, the Group’s CCPs deposit the  
cash received in highly liquid and secure investments, such as sovereign bonds and 
reverse repos, as mandated under EMIR; securities deposited by clearing members 
are therefore held in dedicated accounts with CSDs and/or International Central 
Securities Depositaries (ICSDs). The Group’s CCPs also hold a small proportion of  
their investments in unsecured bank and money market deposits subject to the 
limitations imposed by EMIR. The successful operation of these investment activities 
is contingent on general market conditions and there is no guarantee that such 
investments may be exempt from market losses.
Non-Clearing  
Liquidity risk in a non-clearing context is the risk that the firm may be unable to 
make payments as they fall due.
Clearing  
The Group’s CCPs have put in place regulatory compliant  
liquidity plans for day-to-day liquidity management, including 
contingencies for stressed conditions. The Group’s CCPs have 
multiple layers of defence against liquidity shortfalls including; 
intraday margin calls, minimum cash balances, access to 
contingent liquidity arrangements, and, for certain CCPs, access  
to central bank liquidity.
Under the ERMF , CCP investments must be made in compliance 
with the Group CCP Financial Risk Policy (as well as the policies of 
the CCPs themselves). These policies stipulate a number of Risk 
Management standards including investment limits (secured and 
unsecured) and liquidity coverage ratios. Committees overseeing 
CCP investment risk meet regularly.
Each CCP monitors its liquidity needs daily under stressed and 
unstressed assumptions and reports to the Group Financial Risk 
Committee each month. 
Non-Clearing  
Requirements for liquidity including headroom requirements are 
set out in the Group Treasury Policy. The Group maintains liquidity 
facilities and monitors its requirements on an ongoing basis. 
Stressed facility headroom is assessed using plausible downside 
business projections.
Group Treasury risk is monitored daily and is managed within the 
constraints of a Board approved policy by the Group Treasury 
team, and is overseen by the Treasury Committee (a sub-
Committee of the Financial Risk Committee chaired by the CFO). 
An update on Group Treasury risks and actions is provided 
monthly to the Financial Risk Committee and to each meeting  
of the Board Risk Committee.

RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATION RISK LEVEL
Capital risk 
Principal risks to managing the Group’s capital are:
 – In respect of regulated entities, capital adequacy compliance risk (the risk that 
regulated entities do not maintain and report sufficient qualifying capital to meet 
regulatory requirements) and capital reporting compliance risk (the risk that 
regulated entities fail to comply with capital reporting and regulatory obligations). 
If a regulated entity in the Group fails to ensure that sufficient capital resources are 
maintained to meet regulatory requirements, this could lead to loss of regulatory 
approvals and/or financial sanctions.
 – In respect of regulated and unregulated entities, commercial capital adequacy and 
quality risk (the risk that Group and solo entities do not maintain both sufficient 
quantity and quality of capital to meet commercial requirements) and investment 
return risk (the risk that capital is held in subsidiaries or invested in projects that 
generate a return that is below the Group’s cost of capital).
 – Availability of debt or equity capital (whether specific to the Group or driven by 
general financial market conditions).
The Group’s Capital Management Policy provides a framework 
to ensure the Group maintains suitable capital levels (both at  
Group and solo entity levels), and effectively manages the risks 
thereof. The Group’s Treasury Policy recognises the need to 
observe regulatory requirements in the management of the 
Group’s resources.
The Risk Appetite approved by the Board includes components 
related to the Group’s leverage ratios and capital risks; Key Risk 
Indicators are monitored regularly. The Group maintains an 
ongoing review of the capital positions of its regulated entities to 
ensure that they operate within capital limits which are overseen 
by the Financial Risk Committee, the Executive Committee and 
the Board. The Group can manage its capital structure by varying 
returns to shareholders, issuing new shares or increasing or 
reducing borrowings. The Board reviews dividend policy and 
funding capacity on a regular basis and the Group maintains 
comfortable levels of debt facility headroom.
The Group regularly assesses debt and equity markets to maintain 
access to new capital at reasonable cost. The Group is mindful of 
potential impacts on its key metrics when considering changes to 
its capital structure.
For more information on this risk, see Note 2 to the accounts, Financial Risk Management on pages 120–124.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
The risk of loss, or other adverse consequences to the business, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. 
RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATION RISK LEVEL
Technology 
Secure and stable technology performing to high levels of availability continues to be 
critical to the support of the Group’s businesses. Technology failures may impact our 
clients, potentially leading to a loss of trading or clearing volumes or impacting our 
information services activities. 
The Group continues to consolidate its IT development and operations in its shared 
services company – LSEG Business Services Ltd – and in the MillenniumIT 
infrastructure to provide greater control and efficiency. 
There is a risk that as the Group continues to consolidate its IT development and 
operations, it creates single points of failure for multiple Group businesses, systems 
and services.
The focus of activity in MillenniumIT means there is also a risk of resource 
over-stretch to meet both the requirements of the Group and those of third  
parties. Continued innovation and investment in new trading/information  
systems can lead to further resource stretch in coping with increased volumes  
and new product development.
The Group also has dependencies on a number of third parties for the provision  
of hardware, software, communication and networks for elements of its trading, 
clearing, settlement, data and other systems.
The performance and availability of the Group’s systems are 
constantly reviewed and monitored to prevent problems arising 
where possible and ensure a prompt response to any potential 
service interruption issues.
The Group continues actively to identify, manage and mitigate 
risks associated with the consolidation of IT development and 
operations. Regular rigorous business impact and operational risk 
scenario analysis are performed in conjunction with the Group 
Risk and Group Business Continuity and Crisis Management 
functions to identify, assess and remedy potential system and 
governance vulnerabilities.
The Group’s technology teams mitigate the risk of resource 
over-stretch by ensuring prioritisation of key development and 
operations activities, and resource utilisation and allocation are 
kept under constant review. The MillenniumIT systems are 
designed to be fault tolerant and alternative standby computer 
facilities are maintained to minimise the risk of system disruptions.
The Group actively manages relationships with key strategic  
IT suppliers to avoid any breakdown in service provision which 
could adversely affect the Group’s businesses. Where possible  
the Group has identified alternative suppliers that could be 
engaged in the event of a third party failing to deliver on its 
contractual commitments. The Group actively monitors new 
technological developments and opportunities such as  
blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
For more information, see the Technology Services section of the Segmental Review on pages 32–33.
Model risk 
The Group defines model risk as the risk that a model may not capture the  
essence of the events being modelled, or inaccuracies in the underlying calculation 
potentially resulting in adverse consequences resulting from decisions based  
on incorrect or missed model outputs.
Subsequent to the acquisition during the year of The Yield Book 
analytics platform from Citigroup Inc, the Group has embarked on 
a programme of complete review of model policies and procedures 
to ascertain whether enhancements are required to address 
changes to the business. The Financial Risk Committee reviews 
results of model validations carried out.

RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATION RISK LEVEL
Security threats – Physical 
The Group is reliant upon secure premises to protect its employees and physical 
assets as well as appropriate safeguards to ensure uninterrupted operation of its  
IT systems and infrastructure. 
Terrorist attacks and similar activities directed against our offices, operations, 
computer systems or networks could disrupt our markets, harm staff, tenants and 
visitors, and severely disrupt our business operations. Civil or political unrest could 
impact companies within the Group. Long-term unavailability of key premises could 
lead to the loss of client confidence and reputational damages.
Security threats are treated very seriously. The Group has robust 
physical security arrangements. 
The Group is supported by the Centre for the Protection of National 
Infrastructure (CPNI) in the UK, with security teams monitoring 
intelligence and liaising closely with police and global government 
agencies. Across major hubs covering the UK, Europe, the 
Americas and Asia, the Group maintains close monitoring of 
geopolitical threats through a third party security monitoring 
service. Where events are detected, retained response support 
services are mobilised internationally. The Group has well 
established and regularly tested business continuity and crisis 
management procedures. The Group risk function assesses its 
dependencies on critical suppliers and ensures robust contingency 
measures are in place.
Security threats – Cyber 
The threat of cyber crime requires a high level of scrutiny as it has the potential to 
have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, new emerging technologies 
such as cloud computing will change our cyber security risk.
The Group’s technology and operational support providers could suffer a security 
breach resulting in the loss or compromise of sensitive information (both internal  
and external) or loss of service. A major information security breach could have a 
significant negative impact on our reputation, financial costs for remediation, fines 
and regulatory impacts and on the confidence of our clients.
Extensive IT measures aligned to the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) control framework are in place to 
both mitigate and monitor cyber security risks such as system 
vulnerabilities and access control. Information Security teams 
monitor intelligence and liaise closely with police and global 
Government agencies as well as industry forums and regulators. 
The Group continues to invest in and enhance its information 
security control environment, cyber defences and operational 
process as it delivers to its Board approved Cyber Security Strategy.
Change management 
The considerable change agenda is driven by both internal and external factors. 
Internal factors include the diversification strategy of the Group and its drive for 
technology innovation and consolidation. External factors include the changing 
regulatory landscape and requirements which necessitate changes to our systems 
and processes. 
There are a significant number of major, complex projects and strategic actions 
underway concurrently, that, if not delivered to sufficiently high standards and 
within agreed timescales, could have an adverse impact on the operation of core 
services, and revenue growth, as well as damaging the Group’s reputation. The 
volume of simultaneous change could also lead to a loss of client goodwill if the 
execution is not managed appropriately. Synergies and cost benefits may not be 
delivered to anticipated levels. 
The senior management team is focused on the implementation 
of the Group’s strategy and the project pipeline in view of their 
importance to the Group’s future success. Each major project is 
managed via a dedicated Programme Board overseen by 
members of the Executive Committee. 
Software design methodologies, testing regimes and  
test environments are continuously being strengthened  
to minimise implementation risk.
For more information, see the Chairman’s statement on pages 4–5, and the Chief Executive’s statement on pages 6–7 .
Settlement and custodial risks  
The Group’s CCPs are exposed to operational risks associated with clearing 
transactions and the management of collateral, particularly where there are manual 
processes and controls. While the Group’s CCPs have in place procedures and controls 
to prevent failures of these processes, and to mitigate the impact of any such failures, 
any operational error could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s reputation, 
business, financial condition and operating results.
In addition, the Group provides routing, netting and settlement services through 
its CSDs to ensure that cash and securities are exchanged in a timely and secure 
manner for a multitude of products. There are operational risks associated with  
such services, particularly where processes are not fully automated. 
A failure to receive funds from participants may result in a debiting of the Group’s 
cash accounts which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, 
financial condition and operating results.
Operational risk is minimised via highly automated processes 
reducing administrative activities while formalising procedures  
for all services.
The CSD mitigates IT risks by providing for redundancy of systems, 
daily backup of data, fully updated remote recovery sites and SLAs 
with outsourcers. Liquidity for CSD operations is provided by 
European National Central Banks. 53 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017

Employees 
The calibre and performance of our leaders and colleagues is critical to the success  
of the Group. 
The Group’s ability to attract and retain key personnel is dependent on a number  
of factors. This includes (but not exclusively) organisational culture and reputation, 
prevailing market conditions, compensation packages offered by competing 
companies, and any regulatory impact thereon. These factors also encompass the 
Group’s ability to continue to have appropriate variable remuneration and retention 
arrangements in place, which help drive strong business performance and alignment 
to long-term shareholder value and returns, impact the size of the local labour force 
with relevant experience, and the number of businesses competing for such talent. 
Whilst the Group focuses very carefully on the attraction and retention of talent, if 
unsuccessful it may adversely affect the Group’s ability to conduct its business 
through an inability to execute business operations and strategies effectively. 
We focus on a number of strategic enablers to ensure we attract 
and retain the right calibre of talent for our business, and continue 
to facilitate a culture of high performance.
We have a rigorous in-house recruitment and selection process,  
to ensure that we are bringing the best possible talent into the 
organisation, in terms of their skills, technical capabilities, cultural 
fit and potential.
We aim to remove barriers to our colleagues’ overall sense of 
engagement, proactively measuring how satisfied they are with 
their working experience at LSEG, and the extent to which they 
would recommend it as a place to work. We measure this 
sentiment when they join the organisation, via our bi-annual 
engagement survey ‘Have Your Say’, and via an exit survey for 
those who choose to move on. We use that feedback to inform  
our plans for improvement, and to identify and resolve any barriers 
to performance and engagement. 
We recognise that the overall wellbeing of our colleagues is vital  
for our continued performance, and have introduced a proactive 
approach to wellbeing in the UK, which we are in the process  
of rolling out globally. This looks to improve wellbeing across  
5 dimensions: physical, mental, financial, social purpose, and 
work-life balance. 
Career development remains a key enabler for success, and we 
have a carefully managed learning budget which enables us  
to take a coordinated approach, and focus investment in the 
development of colleagues. We provide colleagues with a range  
of courses, materials and tools to support them in owning their 
development, and will be launching a Career Framework in 2018,  
to further support people in navigating the opportunities that are 
available for them at LSEG. We also offer additional investment to 
identified key talent and executives, for instance, by providing 
coaches for key senior successors. 
In terms of talent management, we always look to promote 
internally where possible. We undertake a comprehensive  
annual review of critical roles, and ensure we have succession  
plans in place to minimise the impact of losing critical key 
personnel. We monitor the attrition in each division and country, 
in addition to any critical staff turnover, so that mitigation can  
be taken where needed.
Performance management plays a key role in mitigating  
retention and performance risk at LSEG, and the Group operates  
a robust performance management and appraisal process for  
all colleagues, which links to how we utilise incentives and 
compensation to drive organisational performance. This assesses 
performance against financial objectives, strategic deliverables, 
and the extent to which colleagues role model the Group’s values 
and behaviours. 
In terms of other reward approaches, critical high performers are 
offered Long Term Incentive Plans, aligned with the fulfilment of 
the Group’s strategic goals and increases in shareholder value.  
We also regularly benchmark our reward and incentive systems 
to ensure they are competitive.

55 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Governance Board of Directors Dear Shareholders, 
The Board of the Group is committed to ensuring that it provides effective 
leadership and promotes uncompromising ethical standards. One of the ways in 
which the Board achieves this is by requiring that good governance principles and 
practices are adhered to throughout the Company. The Board has determined 
that the following is a helpful summary of its role. 
Good governance is about helping to ensure the Company is well run. It involves 
being satisfied that an effective internal framework of systems and controls is put 
in place which clearly defines authority and accountability and promotes success 
while permitting the management of risk to appropriate levels.
It also involves the exercise of judgement as to the definitions of success for the 
Group, the levels of risk we are willing to take to achieve that success and the levels 
of delegation to the executive. The exercise of this judgement is the responsibility 
of the Board and involves consideration of processes and assumptions as well  
as outcomes. 
It also involves the creation of a sensitive interface for the views of shareholders 
and other stakeholders to be given appropriate consideration when reaching  
these judgements. 
The Executive Team is required to provide such information to the Board as the 
Board needs to enable it to exercise its judgement over these matters. It must also 
evidence appropriate process. There is a very fine distinction between the approval 
of processes and their definition. Only exceptionally would the Board intervene to 
initiate or define. 
The Board also sets the tone for the Group. The way in which it conducts itself, its 
attitude to ethical matters, its definition of success and the assessment of 
appropriate risk, all define the atmosphere and culture within which the Executive 
Team and all employees work. 
Good corporate governance is not about adhering to codes of practice (although 
adherence may constitute a part of the evidence of good governance) but rather 
about the exercise of a mind set to do what is right. One of the challenges facing 
any Board is the way in which the Non-Executive and the Executive Directors 
interact. It is clear that they each have the same legal responsibility but it is 
generally unrealistic to expect Executive Directors to speak individually with the 
same freedom as the Non-Executive Directors. Equally, Executive Directors who 
just “toe the executive line” in contradiction to their own views may not be 
effectively contributing to good governance. A well-functioning Board needs to 
find the right balance between hearing the collective executive view, being aware 
of the natural internal tensions in an executive team and allowing independent 
input from the Non-Executive Directors. 
One of the consequences of both increasing the watchdog role of the Board and 
finding this balance between individuality and team behaviour is driving more 
and more Boards to have fewer and fewer Executive Directors. In our 
circumstances, the consequent Board construction works effectively and an 
appropriate balance is struck. 
Notwithstanding the tensions created by many external expectations, which may 
be wholly or in part unrealistic, a successful Board should, ideally, be composed of  
a diverse group of respected, experienced and competent people who coalesce 
around the common purpose of promoting the long-term success of the Company, 
provide a unified vision of the definitions of success and appropriate risk, endeavour 
to support management (i.e. honestly criticise at times but encourage all the time) 
and create confidence in all stakeholders in the integrity of the business.

201 7 has proven an extremely busy year for the Group and during the year the 
Board considered the following matters: the recommended all-share merger 
between the Company and Deutsche Börse AG, the sale of LCH S.A., the General 
Meeting requisitioned by a shareholder and the subsequent Circular, the 
acquisition of The Yield Book businesses, the divestments of the MillenniumIT ESP 
and Exactpro businesses, the Company’s share buyback programme, the 
acquisition of additional shares in LCH Group Holdings Limited, the risks and 
opportunities presented by Brexit, the ongoing management of Cyber Risk and 
Information Security, the Group’s Tax Strategy, the Modern Slavery Act and related 
Group policies, the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Group’s 
Insurance policies, Group strategy including Group corporate responsibility 
strategy, Group Debt Refinancing, Investor Relations reports, the review of 
quarterly financial forecasts and funding of acquisitions, the review and approval 
of full year and interim results and quarterly Interim Management Statements, 
and Executive and Non-Executive succession planning, including the 
commencement of the search for a new Chief Executive Officer and the 
appointment of a new Non-Executive Director.
Other Board Committees
As reported in last year’s Annual report a transaction committee was appointed  
in 2016 to consider the proposed merger with Deutsche Börse. Its members were 
Donald Brydon (Chairman), Jacques Aigrain, Paul Heiden and David Nish. 
Following the end of the merger discussions in March 201 7 , the Transaction 
Committee was disbanded.
A board committee consisting of Paul Heiden (Senior Independent Director and 
Chair of the Committee), Lex Hoogduin, Jacques Aigrain and David Warren was 
appointed between October 201 7 – December 201 7 to assist the Board in 
preparation of a Circular in respect of the shareholder requisitioned General 
Meeting held on 19 December 201 7 . Details of the number meetings held to 
discuss these matters are outlined in the table above.
Board and Committee meetings 2017
The Board held 16 Board meetings of which 6 were scheduled meetings and 10 additional meetings principally relating to the proposed merger with Deutsche Börse, 
and the Shareholder requisitioned General Meeting. A table of Board and Committee meeting attendance is set out below.

3. Transaction committee, Circular committee
Note: Nearly all meetings which were missed by Directors were additional (rather than scheduled) meetings which related to the proposed merger of Deutsche Börse or the Shareholder requisitioned General 
Meeting. These were often called on exceptionally short notice. 
Attendance at Board Meetings
When Directors have not been able to attend meetings, they received and 
reviewed the relevant meeting papers. Where they had comments or concerns on 
the matters to be discussed, they provided these to the Chairman of the Board or 
Committee in advance of the meeting. The Chairman of the Board engages with 
Directors between Board meetings to discuss business and strategic issues.
When arranging meetings at short notice, every attempt is made to 
accommodate Directors’ diaries; however, inevitably, not all Directors are able to 
attend all such meetings. The majority of meetings where Directors have been 
unable to attend were the 10 additional meetings. 
As part of its ongoing development the Board visits the Group’s overseas sites and 
in 201 7 it visited the Group’s businesses and met with staff in Milan. 
On a number of occasions throughout the year, the Chairman met Non-Executive 
Directors without Executive Directors present in particular to discuss succession 
planning in relation to the Chief Executive Officer and actions arising in relation to 
the requisition of a General Meeting by a shareholder. The Board also met without 
the presence of the Chairman. Throughout the year, the Chairman also met with 
Non-Executive Directors individually to discuss other business-related matters 
including succession planning and refreshment of the Board and its composition. 
Comprehensive Board and committee papers, comprising an agenda and formal 
reports and briefing papers are sent to Directors in advance of each formal 
meeting. Directors are continually updated with written and verbal reports, from 
senior executives and external advisors.
Matters considered by the Board
Each of the regular meetings includes a wide-ranging report from the Chief 
Executive and a report from the Chief Financial Officer on the Group’s financial 
performance. Reports from the Committee Chairmen, updates on major projects 
and certain administrative matters are also reported at each Board meeting.
On an annual basis the Board undertakes reviews of the following: Health and 
Safety, the Three Year Business Plan and Annual Budget, Board effectiveness, 
Review of independence of Directors pursuant to the Code, Review of key

Governance Corporate governance BOARD EFFECTIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP 
2017 Effectiveness Review
Since 2005 it has been the Board’s policy to conduct an effectiveness review on an 
annual basis and, where appropriate, to act on the results of the review. The Code 
recommends that an externally facilitated evaluation should take place at least 
every 3 years.
During the Period, the Board engaged Professor Rob Goffee (Emeritus Professor, 
London Business School) to facilitate an external review of its effectiveness. 
Professor Goffee was appointed following a review of providers in the market  
and is not currently engaged in any other work on behalf of the Company. 
In the Circular dated 30 November 201 7 the Board said it would review the steps 
which ultimately led to the General Meeting to establish the appropriate lessons  
to be drawn. The Board engaged Simon Collins a former UK Chairman and Senior 
Partner of KPMG LLP to carry out a review of the events leading to the General 
Meeting. The Board will share a summary of key conclusions with shareholders in 
due course. 
Evaluation Process 
The events leading up to the General Meeting requisitioned by a shareholder, 
brought Governance, including the proper operation of the Board (and its 
Committees), into focus.
When designing the 201 7 Effectiveness Review, the Board and Professor Goffee 
felt it appropriate to acknowledge the impact of those events, but to focus on how 
the Board has operated throughout the year.
The process was in-depth and involved one-to-one interviews with Board 
members conducted by Professor Goffee and the completion of a very detailed 
questionnaire to provide insight into how the Board functions covering the 
following areas associated with the effectiveness of the Board:
1. Strategy & Planning
2. Governance, Risk & Control
3. Performance Management & monitoring
4. Board composition & succession planning
5. Board & Committee working/efficiencies
The Review also included review of individual director performance based on 
appropriate criteria. 
As part of the Review Professor Goffee reviewed papers and documentation 
provided to the Board. The anonymity of all feedback from board members 
received was ensured throughout the process.
Presentation of findings
Professor Goffee prepared a report setting out the findings including comparison 
against a wider set of other Boards. Separate reviews of the Board’s assessment of 
each individual director were also prepared for the Chairman to discuss with 
directors individually, and in the case of the Chairman, with the SID. 
Professor Goffee’s report was shared with the Board and a session scheduled for 
Board directors to discuss the findings with Professor Goffee and agree next steps.
Results
The results suggest that Board members are broadly content with various aspects 
of governance and functioning. Additionally, the Board sets itself objectives which 
were reviewed during the process and at the end of the year the Board judged it 
had made good progress in meeting those objectives. 
The Review identified a number of positive attributes including management of 
Board meetings, shaping of agendas, functioning of the Audit Committee and 
Chairman’s leadership of the Board to ensure focus and good practice. 
Next Steps
The Board recognised that greater focus needs to be given to the following areas 
during 2018:
 – Engagement – greater engagement with the business outside of board meetings 
to improve understanding of business activity and depth of executive talent
 –  Induction and training – induction and training to be strengthened
 –  Board composition and interaction:
 • Review of Board membership and balance to ensure it is equipped to meet the 
shifting competitive landscape and technological changes faced by the Group
 •  Further strengthen relationships between directors
 – Structural fine tuning – improve impact of the Regulatory Advisory Group and 
Technology Advisory Group.
The Board will agree actions to address these matters during 2018 and report 
against them in next year’s Annual Report and Accounts.

Corporate governance continued 2016 Effectiveness Review
The 2016 Effectiveness Review (which was conducted internally  
by the Group Company Secretary) identified a number of issues.  
These are summarised below, together with the resulting actions:
ISSUE ACTION
Board Directors to  
have increased  
contact outside  
the Board room
 – Board members attended dinners, company events 
and also held discussions outside formal Board 
meetings as a group and on an individual basis
Increased discussion 
of succession planning 
at Board level
 – CEO succession was a key area of focus for the 
Nomination Committee and Board in 2017 
 – Refreshing Board composition continued to be  
a key focus during the year
Identify further 
development  
needs for directors
 – Each Non-Executive Director identified areas of 
business interest and the Company Secretary is 
facilitating contact with that area of the business
 – Further in depth “teach in” sessions  
have been held outside of Board meetings
Relations with shareholders 
The Group’s Investor Relations (IR) function, reporting to the Chief Financial 
Officer, manages an ongoing shareholder engagement programme throughout 
the year. Executive management and the IR team engage with investors through 
meetings and presentations to discuss strategy, performance and other matters. 
The Chairman, Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee are also available to meet major investors, typically to discuss 
corporate governance matters. 
In 201 7 , Board members, senior executive management and the IR team held over 
500 meetings and calls with institutional equity and debt investors, including the 
Board’s engagement with shareholders to discuss CEO succession. 
In the lead up to a shareholder-requisitioned General Meeting, the Chairman  
and Senior Independent Director held 35 shareholder meetings or calls, and 
discussions were also held with investor trade organisations and shareholder  
proxy advisers as part of the wider shareholder communications around the  
topic. As part of the external review undertaken by Simon Collins, shareholder 
views will be incorporated in the report’s findings.
The Board receives a report on IR matters at each of its scheduled meetings, 
including market expectations of financial performance, updates on share register 
composition and feedback from investors. Sell-side analyst research notes are 
circulated to the Board following publication. The Group’s corporate brokers and a 
specialist IR advisory firm also provide the Board with advice on market sentiment, 
input on market communications and share register analysis. In June 201 7 the 
Group hosted a market update event, with senior management from the core 
business divisions presenting on growth and development opportunities. This 
resulted in the Group setting public financial targets (as described on page 4 1).
In addition to information on financial and operational performance, the Group 
engages with shareholders and relevant shareholder advisory agencies on 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. The Group produces an 
annual Corporate Sustainability report that details its approach to ESG matters: 
www.lseg.com/about-london-stock-exchange-group/corporate-
responsibility.
The Group’s AGM provides the opportunity for all shareholders to meet and to  
put questions to the Board Directors. Procedures for the AGM (and any General 
Meeting) are compliant with the Code, with voting by way of a poll to ensure all 
shareholders’ views are taken into account.
The IR section of the Group’s website (www.lseg.com/investor-relations) is a 
primary source of regularly updated information about the Group. All financial 
reports and statements, news releases, presentations and other documents 
including regulatory news service disclosures are available on the website together 
with a list of analysts producing research on the Company and a summary of 
analysts’ forecasts of performance. Recordings of preliminary and interim results 
calls are accessible to all shareholders via the Group website. 
59 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Governance Corporate governance Risk Management and Internal Control 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management framework and 
maintaining an appropriate system of internal controls. A Board approved 
Enterprise-wide Risk Management Framework and Group Risk Appetite Statement 
are central to the Group’s Risk Management process. The Risk Management 
Framework is updated on an ongoing basis in response to changes in the Group’s 
business and associated risks. The Group Risk Appetite statement is approved 
annually as part of the Group’s strategic planning process. 
The Audit Committee and Risk Committee assist the Board in discharging its 
responsibilities by reviewing and assessing the Group’s Risk Management 
Framework, system of internal controls and risk management process on a regular 
basis. Refer to the reports of the Audit Committee on pages 65–69 and the Risk 
Committee on pages 70–71 for further detail on their oversight activities during 
the year. 
The system of internal controls is designed to facilitate the management of the 
Group and its businesses within the Board’s risk appetite rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve the Group’s objectives, and can only provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss, fraud or 
breaches of laws and regulations.
Executive management is accountable for risk identification, evaluation, mitigation, 
monitoring and reporting in accordance with the framework. A divisional internal 
control and Risk Management self-certification process is also performed 
semi-annually. Each business unit is required to confirm that it is in compliance  
with the Group’s policies and governance procedures and managing its risk within 
appetite: exceptions are reported to the Audit Committee and Risk Committee. 
Conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association allow the Board to authorise conflicts of 
interest that may arise and to impose such limits or conditions as it thinks fit.  
The Group has established procedures whereby actual and potential conflicts of 
interest are regularly reviewed, appropriate authorisation is sought prior to the 
appointment of any new Director and new conflicts are addressed appropriately. 
The decision to authorise a conflict of interest can only be made by non-conflicted 
Directors and, in making such decisions, the Directors must act in a way they 
consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the Company’s success.
Lex Hoogduin is Chairman of LCH Group Holdings Limited. LCH Group Holdings 
Limited is a non-wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and Mr Hoogduin 
receives a separate fee for that role. Any potential conflicts of interest arising as a 
result of Mr Hoogduin’s appointment to the Board have been governed by the 
terms of a conflicts memorandum of understanding between LCH Group Holdings 
Limited and the Company.
Indemnities 
Directors have the benefit of indemnity arrangements from the Company in 
respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office and execution of their 
powers, duties and responsibilities. The Company maintained a Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance policy throughout the year. This policy covers the 
Directors for any such liabilities in respect of which they are not indemnified by 
the Company and, to the extent to which it has indemnified the Directors, also 
covers the Company. This insurance cover has been renewed. Neither the 
Company’s indemnity nor insurance provides cover for a Director in the event that 
the Director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
FURTHER INFORMATION
Further detail on the Group’s Risk Management 
oversight can be found on pages 42–45. An overview 
of the Principal Risks and Uncertainties of the Group 
is provided on pages 46–53.

Corporate governance continued Internal Controls
Management structure
The Group operates a matrix structure designed to optimise resource allocation 
and organisational capacity. The day-to-day running of the Group is managed by 
an Executive Committee, which is chaired by the Interim Chief Executive Officer 
and Group Chief Financial Officer. Each Executive Committee member is 
responsible for one of the Group’s operating divisions or a major area of strategic 
importance. The Executive Committee meets regularly to review business and 
financial performance, risk exposure and to approve key decisions. Each legal 
entity is responsible for engaging with its local regulators and monitoring and 
ensuring regulatory compliance. 
Policies and Procedures
A framework of Group-wide policies establish the principles, minimum standards 
and risk management activities LSEG requires the Group’s businesses and 
functions to follow to manage their business within risk appetite. All Group-level 
policies are approved by the Executive Committee, and may also require approval 
or ratification from the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and the Board. The 
Group runs a rolling programme of mandatory online training courses for all 
employees covering matters including ethical conduct, risk and control 
management, regulatory requirements and the group policies. 
Financial Control 
The Group has a robust system of financial control which has been enhanced 
during 201 7 by the continued roll-out and implementation of the Group wide 
financial system in response to the increased size and footprint of the group.  
An appropriate framework of delegated authorities is in place.
Comprehensive financial planning, reporting and review procedures are in place, 
with an annual budget and 3 year business plan approved by the Board. Financial 
and key performance indicators are reviewed against operational budgets on a 
monthly basis at a group, divisional and business unit level. The Chief Financial 
Officer’s management reports are shared with the Board and any key issues are 
reviewed at each Board meeting.
The Executive Investment Committee monitors capital expenditures across the 
Group and helps the Executive Committee approve and prioritise projects. 
The Executive Financial Risk Committee oversees risks related to capital, 
investments, tax, counterparties and through its Treasury Committee the 
activities of the Group’s Treasury function. The Treasury Committee operates 
within Board approved policy and meets regularly to review the management  
of the Group’s credit, market and liquidity risks. Material group counterparty 
exposures are assessed regularly including through a Group-wide centralised 
counterparty risk Value at Risk model. Further details on financial risk 
management are provided in Note 2 to the accounts. 
Internal Audit
The Internal Audit function provides independent assurance to the Board and 
other key stakeholders over the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s  
system of internal controls, the governance model and the Enterprise-wide Risk 
Management Framework. The function is the third line of defence in the Group’s 
risk control structure and has no operational responsibilities over the entities or 
processes which it reviews. 
The independence of the Internal Audit function from Executive Management is 
ensured through the following measures:
 – The Group Head of Internal Audit reports directly to the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee and has direct access to the Chairman of the Board. For 
administrative matters the Group Head of Internal Audit has a secondary 
reporting line to the Chief Financial Officer. 
 – The Chairman of the Audit Committee and Chief Financial Officer jointly assess 
the performance of the Group Head of Internal Audit. 
 – The Audit Committee approves the Internal Audit annual budget. 
Further details on the Internal Audit function can be found in the internal audit 
charter which is reviewed annually and available from the Group Company 
Secretary or the Group’s website at www.lseg.com/about-london-stock-
exchange-group/corporate-responsibility/ethics-and-governance. 
Conclusion
The Board confirms that, through the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee,  
it has reviewed the operation and effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
controls throughout 201 7 and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report and 
Accounts. The Board has satisfied itself that a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Company, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance and liquidity, have been carried out during the year. Necessary 
actions have been or are being taken to remedy any significant failings or 
weaknesses identified during these reviews. The Board is satisfied that the Risk 
Management process and system of internal controls conform with the FRC’s 201 4 
Risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting.

Governance Corporate governance The Group is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance and business integrity in all of its activities. Throughout  
the year, the Company has complied with all principles of the Code.  
The Code sets out guidance in the form of main principles and more 
specific provisions for good governance in relation to Board leadership, 
effectiveness, accountability, remuneration and relations with 
shareholders. Further information on the Code, its applicability, the 
principles and their provisions can be found on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website, at www.frc.org.uk. This table forms part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement on page 95 of the Directors’ Report. 
A Leadership
A.1 Role of the Board
The Board is the principal decision-making forum for the Group and is responsible 
to shareholders for achieving the Group’s strategic objectives and delivering 
sustainable growth in shareholder value. Directors act in a way they consider will 
promote the long-term success of the Company, by constructively challenging 
and supporting the development of the Group’s strategy, for the benefit of 
shareholders as a whole, with regard to the interests of the Group’s employees, the 
impact of the business on the community and environment and the interests of 
other stakeholders. The Board manages the overall control of the Group’s affairs 
with reference to the formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board. This 
schedule is available on the Company’s website at www.lseg.com/about-
london-stock-exchange-group/corporate-responsibility/ethics-and-
governance. The Board views the brands and reputations of its subsidiaries as 
important assets of the Group. Accordingly, protection of the brand and reputation 
of the Group, including ensuring that subsidiaries continue to meet local legal 
requirements, is also a key part of the Board’s role. The matters considered by  
the Board in 201 7 are summarised on page 57 .
Board Committees
The Company ensures that all committees are provided with sufficient resources 
to undertake their duties. All committees have written terms of reference which 
are available from the corporate responsibility section on the Company’s website 
at www.lseg.com/about-london-stock-exchange-group/corporate-
responsibility or on request from the Group Company Secretary. The matters 
considered by the Remuneration, Audit, Risk and Nomination Committees are 
summarised in the reports of those committees.
A.2 Division of Responsibilities
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are distinct and separate with a  
clear division of responsibilities. The Chairman is responsible for the running  
and leadership of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness. The Chief Executive 
has delegated authority from, and is responsible to, the Board for managing the 
Group’s business with the power for further delegation in respect of matters which 
are necessary for the effective running and management of the business. The 
current key responsibilities of both the Chairman and Chief Executives are set  
out on this page:
Chief Executive
 – formulates the strategic direction of the Group and periodically agrees this with 
the Board
 – ensures proper financial and business control is exercised within the Group 
 – chairs the Group Executive Committee 
 – ensures there is a clear management structure with appropriately delegated 
responsibilities, staffed by suitably experienced and qualified staff 
 – ensures appropriate reporting and communication systems are established 
across the Group 
 – ensures key performance objectives are set for all operational departments; 
action plans and budgetary controls are established; and, where necessary, 
corrective action is taken to maximise the performance of the Group 
 – ensures the Group’s strategy and values are effectively understood and applied 
by management and staff 
 – ensures an appropriate Risk Management framework is in operation
A.3 Chairman
 – chairs the Board of the Company 
 – forges an effective Board based on experience, diversity, skills and competencies 
 – ensures, in collaboration with the Chief Executive, that the Board considers the 
strategic issues facing the Group in a timely manner and is presented with sound 
information and analysis appropriate to the decisions that it is asked to make 
 – acts as a sounding board for the Chief Executive and provides general advice 
relating to the management and development of the Group’s business 
 – supports the commercial activities of the Group by, inter alia, maintaining 
contact with the Group’s key stakeholders and other industry participants
A.4 Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are urged to challenge constructively and help develop 
proposals on strategy, scrutinise the performance of management in meeting 
agreed goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of performance. They 
should satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial information and that 
financial controls and systems of risk management are robust and defensible. 
Non-Executive Directors are responsible for determining appropriate levels of 
remuneration for executive directors and have a principal role in appointing and, 
where necessary, removing executive directors, and in succession planning. The 
Board should appoint one of the Independent Non-Executive Directors to be the 
Senior Independent Director (Mr Paul Heiden is the Senior Independent Director). 
The responsibilities of the Senior Independent Director include meeting major 
shareholders as an alternative contact to the Chairman, Chief Executive or Chief 
Financial Officer.

There is a strong non-executive element on the Board, and the Non-Executive 
Directors provide deep corporate experience and knowledge which they apply 
to their understanding of the Group and its strategy. The Board has 7 Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. 
In assessing each Director’s independence, the Board considered whether there 
are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to 
affect, the Director’s judgement. In evaluating Directors’ independence, the Board 
has taken into consideration the guidance provided by the Code. The experience 
and other appointments of directors is set out on page 54–55.
62 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Complying with the provisions of the Code B.2 Appointments to the Board
The Board has a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment 
of new Directors to the Board. The Board has established a Nomination Committee 
which leads the process for Board appointments and makes recommendations to 
the Board. The Report from the Nomination Committee on page 64, outlines the 
changes to the Board that took place during the year. The Board normally uses an 
external search consultancy for appointments. 
B.3 Commitment
The other significant commitments of the Chairman and the Board are set out at 
pages 54–55. The Board is satisfied that these do not conflict with their duties and 
time commitments as Directors of the Company.
B.4 Development
Directors are encouraged to continually update their skills and knowledge of the 
business, and briefings are regularly given at Board meetings on particular parts 
of the business. The Board also continued its practice of undertaking formal visits 
to its overseas businesses so that the Directors can experience key aspects of the 
Group’s operations first hand. 
Each new Director joining the Board is offered an induction programme covering 
the key business areas of the Group and including meetings with members of the 
Executive Committee, other senior managers and external advisers. Directors are 
encouraged to meet with executives on an ongoing basis to better understand 
each of the business areas together with the Group’s governance, financial and 
legal framework. As set out on page 58 Board training and engagement with the 
business outside of meetings is an area of focus for the Board in 2018. 
B.5 Information and Support
The Directors have full access to the advice and services of the Group Company 
Secretary, who is responsible for advising the Board on corporate governance 
matters. Directors also have access to independent professional advice if they 
judge it necessary to fulfil their responsibilities as Directors.
B.6 Evaluation 
The Board conducts an annual evaluation of its effectiveness and acts on the results 
of the review. During the year, the Board carried out an externally facilitated review 
of its own effectiveness and that of its Committees and Directors together with 
actions taken following the 201 6 effectiveness review and the results of that review 
are detailed on page 59 of the Corporate Governance Report. 
B.7 Re-Election

balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group and Company’s position, performance,  
business model and strategy.
C.2 Risk Management and Internal Control
The Board has overall responsibility for the sponsorship of a strong risk culture 
across the Group and for determining the nature and extent of the principal risks it 
is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives. It approves the Risk Appetite 
each year as part of the strategic business objectives, and ensures there is an 
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating, and managing the principal risks 
faced by the Company. The Board has delegated a number of responsibilities to 
the Risk Committee including oversight of internal Risk Management processes.

relations/shareholder-services/agm-information. There have been no  
changes to the policy during the financial year. Under Schedule 8 of The Large  
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment)

The Board has delegated responsibilities to the Remuneration Committee 
including the remuneration of the Chairman and Executive Directors.
E. Relations with Shareholders
E.1 Dialogue with Shareholders
The Company maintains an active shareholder engagement programme, 
managed through the Group’s IR function. The IR programme provides regular 
opportunity for contact with existing and potential shareholders, as well as 
sell-side analysts that produce investment research relating to the Group. IR 
activities include meetings, calls, presentations and information releases on a 
regular basis throughout the year, based around the Group’s financial reporting 
calendar and following major corporate events and news flow. For more detail on 
the Group’s IR activities, please see page 59 of the Corporate Governance Report.
E.2 Constructive Use of General Meetings
The Group’s AGM provides the opportunity for all shareholders to meet the 
Directors and to put questions to the Board. Procedures for the AGM (and any 
General Meeting) are compliant with the Code, with voting by way of a poll to 
ensure all shareholders’ views are taken into account. 
63 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Governance Complying with the provisions of the Code The Nomination Committee members as at 31 December 2017 were 
Donald Brydon (Chairman), Paul Heiden, Stephen O’Connor and Mary 
Schapiro. The Company Secretary is the Secretary to the Committee 
and attends all meetings. The Head of Human Resources, CEO and 
appropriate external advisers attend as required. The Committee’s 
role is to review the size, structure and skills of the Board, consider 
succession planning and make recommendations to the Board on 
potential candidates for Board membership.
In 201 7 the Committee focused on:
1. Succession planning for the CEO and Non-Executive Directors
2. Refreshing Board composition 
As the Board set out in the Circular to shareholders dated 30 November 201 7 , one 
of the most important roles vested in Non-Executive Directors under the Code 
through the proper operation of the Nomination Committee (and the Board itself) 
is Board and CEO succession planning. 
CEO Succession Planning 
In 201 7 the Board undertook succession planning for the CEO. The intention of  
the Board and Nomination Committee was to achieve an orderly, consensual 
succession plan for the CEO in the best interests of LSEG. 
During 2016 and into the first part of 201 7 , Xavier Rolet had indicated he would step 
down as CEO to smooth the path for the planned merger with Deutsche Börse.
Following the end of the proposed merger the Nomination Committee reviewed  
the Board’s composition again and agreed to focus on the increased need for 
succession planning for the CEO. This ultimately led to the announcement on  
19 October 201 7 , confirming Xavier Rolet’s agreed departure from the Group by the 
end of 2018 and both parties’ commitment to an orderly transition. Following the 
requisition of a General Meeting by a shareholder, Xavier Rolet agreed to step down 
from the Board on 29 November 201 7 . The Board agreed that the Chief Financial 
Officer, David Warren, would be appointed as Interim CEO.
The Committee engaged Egon Zehnder to assist with compiling a CEO role profile 
and carrying out a global search against the agreed profile. 
Non-Executive Directors
As part of the Committee’s ongoing focus on Board composition, the Committee 
supported the Board’s search for another Non-Executive Director to further extend 
the Board’s knowledge and experience in technology and technical risk. Egon 
Zehnder was engaged to conduct the search against an agreed role profile and  
the successful candidate, Val Rahmani joined the Board on 20 December 201 7 .  
In reaching its decision to appoint Val to the Board, the Committee and other 
Non-Executive Directors considered a long list of candidates and then (as with 
previous Board appointments) narrowed the selection list to a short list of candidates 
for interviews. The Committee and the Board considered that Val’s considerable 
technology knowledge and expertise will be of significant benefit as the Group 
builds on its position as a global financial markets infrastructure provider.
Chairman succession
As announced in November 201 7 following the requisition of the General Meeting  
I said I would not stand for re-election in 2019 as I and the Board believe that at 
that point it will be in shareholders’ best interests to have a new team at the helm 
to steer the future progress of the Company. The Nomination Committee, which I 
will not chair for these purposes, will initiate the process to identify a successor 
later in 2018.
Diversity
The Board remains committed to diversity in the Board room and throughout  
the Group. 
The Board’s diversity policy states that the Board will seek to make appointments 
on merit against objective criteria with due regard for the benefits of diversity, 
including gender and the Committee can confirm that the policy was adhered to 
during the year. The Board also recognises the benefit in having access to the 
diversity of input from people with a wide range of backgrounds, skills, experience 
and nationalities. This is reflected in the composition of the Board.
The Board remains aligned with the proposals of the Hampton Alexander Review  
to ensure talented women at the top of business (and indeed throughout the Group 
as a whole) are recognised, promoted and rewarded and the value in investing in a 
pipeline of talent by encouraging a broad range of senior individuals within the 
business to take on additional roles.
Implementation
The Board is committed to building on existing programmes including WIN and the 
Group wide mentoring scheme to develop strong talent across the business. LSEG is 
a signatory to the UK Treasury Women in Finance Charter, signalling the Group’s 
ongoing commitment to equality in the workplace and to actively challenge both 
ourselves and others in the financial sector to keep addressing these issues. The 
Group continues to make progress against the stretch target it set itself in 2016 of 
40% female representation for senior management and our overall population by 
2020. See page 35 for further detail.
The Board has increased its gender diversity during the year by the appointment 
of an additional female director, Val Rahmani. The Board recognises it has more to 
do and remains committed to further restoring the gender diversity of the Board, 
a process that was paused ahead of the possible merger with Deutsche Börse and 
the disruption during the last quarter of 201 7 . At Board level, this will include 
continuing to request head hunters to ensure that as far as practicable a 
significant proportion of long lists of candidates are female and only using firms 
that have signed up to the voluntary code of conduct for Executive Search firms.
Further details of the Company’s approach to diversity and the LSEG Board’s 
diversity policy can be found at www.lseg.com/about-london-stock-exchange-
group/corporate-responsibility/ethics-and-governance.
Nomination Committee priorities for 2018 are to:

Audit Committee
65 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Governance Report to the Audit Committee
Report of the Audit Committee Role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee
1. Financial reporting
The Committee recommends the financial statements of the Group to the Board, 
including the annual and half-yearly reports, preliminary results announcements 
and any other formal announcement relating to its financial performance, 
reviewing the significant financial reporting judgements that they contain.
2. Internal controls and Risk Management systems
The Committee keeps under review the effectiveness of the Group’s system  
of Internal Control and Risk Management. The Audit Committee makes 
recommendations to the Board regarding the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control and Risk Management systems and recommends to the Board the 
statements to be included in the Annual Report concerning internal controls and 
Risk Management (in collaboration with the Risk Committee). The Committee also 
monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit function, 
ensuring that it has adequate resources and appropriate access to information  
to perform its function independently from Executive Management.
3. External auditor
The Committee oversees the relationship with the external auditor. The Committee 
reviews and approves the annual audit plan, ensures that it is consistent with the 
Committee’s view of the scope of the audit engagement and reviews the findings 
of the audit with the external auditor. The Committee monitors and reviews the 
objectivity and independence of the external auditors including the non-audit 
activities performed by the auditors for the Group (see the external auditors fees 
section below for more details). The Committee ensures that the external audit 
services contract is put out to tender on a periodic basis in line with existing best 
practices (the current external auditor was appointed in 2014 following a tender 
process overseen by the Audit Committee). The Committee oversees the selection 
process for new auditors and if an auditor resigns the Committee investigates the 
issues leading to this and decides whether any action is required.
4. Other matters
Treasury
The Committee approves the taking of any actions which fall outside the Group 
Treasury Policy and considers material financing and treasury transactions 
reserved for the Board ahead of review by the Board.
Whistleblowing and fraud
The Committee reviews the Group’s arrangements for its employees to raise 
concerns, in confidence, about possible wrongdoing in financial reporting or other 
matters. The Committee ensures that these arrangements allow proportionate 
and independent investigation of such matters and appropriate follow up action. 
The Committee also reviews the Group’s procedures for detecting fraud and for the 
prevention of bribery.
Composition and meetings
The Committee meets the requirements of the Code. It is comprised of 4 
Independent Non-Executive Directors who all bring recent and relevant financial 
experience. It is chaired by Paul Heiden who is a qualified chartered accountant  
with a career in a variety of senior finance roles. The skills and experience of each 
Committee member are provided in the Board of Directors section on pages 54–55.
The Chief Financial Officer, Group Financial Controller, Group Head of Internal Audit, 
Group Chief Risk Officer and the external auditor are standing invitees to all Audit 
Committee meetings. In addition, various other members of management are 
invited from time to time to present specific matters relevant to the Committee’s 
remit. The Chairman of the Board also attends the Committee on a regular basis.
Further details on the functions and responsibilities of the Audit Committee can 
be found in the Committee’s Terms of Reference which are reviewed annually and 
available from the Group Company Secretary or in the corporate governance 
section of the Group’s website at: www.lseg.com/about-london-stock-
exchange-group/corporate-responsibility/ethics-and-governance.
Activities in 2017
The Committee met 5 times during the year. The Committee maintains a formal 
agenda which ensures that all matters for which the Committee is responsible  
are considered at the appropriate meeting. The agenda for each meeting was 
determined by the key events of the annual financial reporting cycle, the risks 
identified by the Committee and the standing items under its Terms of Reference. 
The following provides details on how the Committee discharged its 
responsibilities during the year as set out in its Terms of Reference:
Financial matters:
With regards to financial matters, the Committee reviewed, discussed and 
approved the half-year and full-year financial results. It reviewed, discussed and 
approved key accounting judgements, the annual review for goodwill impairment 
and assessment of indicators of impairment on purchased intangible assets, 
management’s view of commitments and contingencies and the adequacy of the 
proposed disclosures. For more details on the main discussions and decisions 
reached by the Committee on financial matters, see the section below entitled 
“Significant matters impacting the financial statements” and “Other topics of 
discussion in respect to the financial statements”.
66 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Report of the Audit Committee continued Internal controls:
The Committee continued to exercise disciplined oversight of the effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal controls throughout the year. It fulfilled its responsibilities by 
reviewing and discussing regular reports from the external auditor, the Internal 
Audit and Risk Management functions as well as from external experts, including:
 – Reports on compliance with the Code – internal controls (including 
whistleblowing) at half year and year end
 – Quarterly updates on internal audit plans including internal control issues raised 
and management actions to remedy the deficiencies
 – Annual report on the performance of the Internal Audit function
The Committee obtained additional comfort by meeting with the Group  
Head of Internal Audit at each Audit Committee meeting without Executive 
Management present.
The activities of the Committee related to internal controls enabled it to satisfy 
itself that the Internal Audit function is independent, objective and adequately 
staffed to perform its duties. In addition, the Committee assessed the effectiveness 
of the Internal Audit function throughout the year using qualitative and 
quantitative indicators including:
 – Completeness of the audit universe and the audit plan
 – Quality of the methodology (updated at least once a year)
 – Quality of the audit reports and the issues raised
 – Consistency of the audit issues raised and their ratings
 – Feedback from Executive Management on specific audits
 – Key performance indicators such as percentage of the audit plan completed, 
duration of audits, distribution of audit ratings, percentage of past due actions 
and percentage of self identified issues
The Committee relied on the assurance process throughout the year to 
recommend to the full Board that it could report to shareholders on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control system. The Board statement  
can be found on page 99.
Oversight of the external auditor:
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of the external audit process  
including the independence and quality of the Group’s external auditor (EY) 
throughout the year. The Committee relied on its own judgment supported  
by the following evidence:
 – The Committee received a report from management on their own evaluation  
of the effectiveness of the external auditor
 – It received reports from EY on the status of their 201 7 plan and the results of their 
work. The external auditor’s reports were discussed at each Committee meeting 
and their views and opinions used to challenge decisions by Group Finance
 – Evidence of matters referred for specialist review, technical review, second 
partner review and quality control
 – The Committee also held separate meetings with EY at each Committee 
meeting without management being present
Based on all evidence presented, the Audit Committee satisfied itself that the 
external audit has been conducted independently and effectively with the 
appropriate rigor and level of testing.
The Committee approved the EY audit plan, the methodology used, the scope of the 
audit by location, the risks and areas of focus as well as the materiality threshold for 
the Group and the threshold for reporting unadjusted audit differences.
The Committee has complied with the relevant parts of the Competition and 
Markets Authority Final Order on the statutory audit market for the year ended  
31 December 201 7 .
The lead audit partner is required to rotate every 5 years and other key audit 
partners are required to rotate every 7 years. David Canning- Jones took over as  
lead audit partner in 201 4. Having considered the performance of EY for the past  
3 years, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that a resolution for  
the reappointment of EY as the Company’s external auditor for the year ending  
31 December 2018 be proposed to shareholders at the AGM in April 2018.
Report on external auditor’s fees and safeguards on non-audit services
The Committee has a formal policy governing the engagement of the auditors to 
provide non-audit services which is reviewed on an annual basis.
This policy prohibits certain activities from being undertaken by the auditors such 
as: accounting/bookkeeping services, internal auditing, tax and payroll services, 
executive recruitment and remuneration services and more generally any work 
where a mutuality of interest could compromise the independence of the auditors. 
The policy also places restrictions on the employment of former employees of the 
auditors. Recognising however that the auditors are best placed to undertake certain 
work of a non-audit nature, the policy permits the provision of audit-related services 
and permitted non-audit services with the prior approval of the Committee.
A breakdown of audit and non-audit service fees paid and payable to the external 
auditor for the year ended 31 December 201 7 and prior year is provided below and 
in Note 35 to the financial statements.

67 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Governance Report to the Audit Committee The Committee reviewed each of these individual appointments on their merits. 
Prior to EY being engaged, the review process involved considering management’s 
assessment of:
 – the threats to independence and objectivity resulting from the provision  
of such services
 – which accounting firms had the appropriate experience and expertise 
to undertake the work
 – whether there were any conflicts of interest for EY
 – whether the conflicts of interest that existed for other potential firms, who were 
either advising other parties to the transactions or were auditors of the other 
company, could be appropriately managed
 – the quantum of non-audit fees in the context of the overall audit fee and relative 
significance to EY in the context of its total client fees
In each case, the Audit Committee concluded, on the balance of risks, that the 
appointment of EY to perform certain non-audit services represented the most 
effective, secure and efficient way of obtaining the necessary advice and services, 
given their knowledge of our business and the Group’s structure and accounting 
and tax affairs, together with their wider knowledge of our industry sector.
The policy on audit and non-audit services supplied by the auditors of the Group and 
of its subsidiaries is available from the Group Company Secretary or in the corporate 
governance section of the Group’s website at: www.lseg.com/about-london-
stock-exchange-group/corporate-responsibility/ethics-and-governance.
Other matters:
The annual Board Effectiveness Review included a review of the Committee.  
There were no major modifications to the functioning of the Committee resulting 
from this.
Significant matters impacting the financial statements
Significant matters 
for January – 
December 2017
How the Committee reviewed  
these matters and what  
decisions were taken
Revenue recognition  
and links to 
management’s 
incentives
The Audit Committee reviewed the external auditors’ 
comments on the recognition of revenues in the 
secondary capital markets trading area, fees or  
revenue share clearing arrangements and information 
services revenue accruals (see EY audit opinion on 
pages 100–108). The Audit Committee was satisfied 
that sufficient analysis had been performed in this  
area to demonstrate that there was no evidence that 
any manipulation of revenues had taken place.
Acquisition of  
Mergent Inc. and  
The Yield Book 
and Citi Fixed  
Income Indices
In 201 7 the Group completed the acquisition of Mergent Inc. 
for a total consideration of US$1 47 million and The Yield  
Book and Citi Fixed Income Indices from Citigroup for 
US$679 million. The activities of the businesses are being 
incorporated Into the Information Services segment (ISD). 
The Audit Committee reviewed the methodology and the 
preliminary conclusions for the purchase price allocation  
to identify the appropriate intangible assets created as part 
of the acquisitions and fair value the acquisition balance 
sheets. See Note 30 to the financial statements.
Goodwill and  
acquired intangibles 
impairment assessment
The Audit Committee considered the approach and 
methodology applied to performing the detailed annual 
goodwill impairment assessment as well as the assessment 
for indicators of impairment of other purchased intangible 
assets as required under IAS 36, including the key 
assumptions for short and long-term growth rates, cash flow 
expectations and the discount rates used for the Group’s cost 
of capital. The impairment review was also an area of focus 
for the external auditors, who reported their findings to the 
Committee. Details of the impairment review can be found  
in Note 1 to the financial statements on pages 1 15–1 19.
Implementation  
of the new  
finance system
The Audit Committee reviewed reports from the 
Finance function on the progress of the on-going 
implementation of the new Group-wide finance system 
throughout 2017. The Committee satisfied itself that 
the implementation of the new finance system has 
delivered a more robust process for financial reporting, 
and has not impaired data integrity, or the accounting 
of financial reporting in any way.
68 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Report of the Audit Committee continued Other topics of discussion in respect to the financial statements:
Disposal of non controlling interest in LCH S.A.
LCH Group Holdings Ltd has completed a transaction with Euronext N.V. involving  
a share swap transaction. LCH Group Holdings Ltd has repurchased Euronext’s  
2.3% holding in LCH Group in exchange for a 1 1.1 % holding in LCH S.A.. The  
Audit Committee reviewed the accounting entries to satisfy itself that with  
the exception of the reallocation of profit between equity shareholders and non 
controlling interests, there is no impact to the Group’s income statement other 
than the charges from the advisor and contractor associated with negotiating  
the agreement. The movement in the respective shareholdings occurs in the 
equity account as there is no change in control. See Consolidated statement  
of changes in equity in the financial statements.
Commitments and contingencies:
The Audit Committee considered the facts and circumstances surrounding 
commitments and contingencies for the Group. The Committee agreed that  
no provision is needed to be recorded in the financial statements. See Note 29  
to the financial statements on page 15 1.
Non-underlying items:
The Committee discussed and agreed on the classification of non-underlying 
items in the financial statements for the year. These are presented in Note 7  
to the financial statements on pages 128–129.
M&A related insurance:
The Group often enters into certain insurance policies when executing on M&A 
opportunities. The payments for such policies are often made up front but are 
then recognised as a prepayment and released over the period of the policy.  
As these costs are directly linked to a one-off event and insure against breaches  
of representation pre-dating our ownership, the Committee has agreed that they 
should be recognised as non-underlying items in the income statement.
Financial viability statement
In order to meet the requirements of the Code, the Board needs to explain how it 
has assessed the prospects of the Group taking into account the current position 
and principal risks, and over what period they have done so along with why they 
consider that period to be appropriate.
The Audit Committee discussed the key elements required to make the 
statement, i.e.
 – Deciding on the appropriate period to cover
 – Identifying and describing the relevant evidence and assumptions and ensuring 
that the various planning scenarios were realistic, taking into account the 
business, industry and macro-economic factors
 – Making an assessment that is appropriate to the Company’s circumstances
 – Applying appropriate stress testing and reverse stress testing
The Audit Committee satisfied itself that the Board of Directors was in a position  
to make the statement using the Group Stress testing methodology.
The Financial viability statement can be found within the Directors’ Report on 
page 98.
Fair, balanced and understandable Annual Report
The Audit Committee satisfied itself that the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and has presented its conclusions to the Board. In order to reach 
its conclusions, the Committee examined the following criteria:
 – Fair:
 • The Annual Report does not omit important or sensitive elements necessary 
to understand the strategy, performance and business model of the Group
 • Segmental reporting accurately describes the various activities of the Group 
and their relative contributions to the strategy, performance and business 
model of the Group
 • The messages in the Strategic Report and the CEO and Chairman’s reports are 
consistent with the financial reporting section
 – Balanced:
 • There is an appropriate balance between the required statutory accounting 
metrics and Group-specific adjusted measures
 • The messages in all sections appropriately balance the favourable and less 
favourable events and trends affecting the strategy and performance of  
the Group
 • The principal risks presented in the Strategic Report on pages 46–53 
accurately reflect the risk registers which are used to set the risk appetite  
and the strategy of the Group, including those risks which would threaten  
its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity
 – Understandable:
 • There is a clear and comprehensive framework for the Annual Report
 • The key messages are adequately highlighted in simple language avoiding 
specialised terms and acronyms wherever possible
 • There is a glossary of technical terms and acronyms used frequently across 
the report
 • The relevant information for shareholders is easy to find and appropriately 
cross-referenced where necessary without additional clutter (the 201 7 Annual 
Report comprises 1 70 pages compared to the 1 76 pages of the 2016 report)
 • The various sections taken together present a consistent and easy to 
comprehend overview of the strategy, performance and business model  
of the Group
69 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Governance Report to the Audit Committee Stephen O’Connor
Chairman of the  
Risk Committee
The Committee closely monitored the continued strengthening of the Group Risk 
Framework during the year including enhancements made to the cyber security 
framework and the development of an Economic Capital measure to allow for a 
better quantification of its operational risks. The monitoring of the Group’s risk 
culture, which represents the foundation of the strong risk management 
capabilities within the Group, is considered at each meeting. 
In order to avoid potential duplication of coverage and, more importantly, to 
reduce the potential for non-coverage of important risk matters, by either the 
Audit or the Risk Committees, there is a cross membership of both chairmen  
of the Audit and of the Risk Committees.
Priorities in the forthcoming year will involve the continued monitoring of 
geopolitical risks and the monitoring of the Group’s Brexit contingency plans, 
preparedness and potential rollout, as the UK’s negotiations with the EU enter  
its second phase. 
The Committee will continue to review, on a rotational basis, the risk profile and 
execution risks of each of the Group’s main lines of business and key subsidiaries. 
The Committee will also continue to oversee the evolution of the Group’s risk 
culture across the Group and its subsidiaries to ensure the Board maintains 
effective risk management oversight and control.
Stephen O’Connor
Chairman of the Risk Committee 
2 March 2018
The Risk Committee members as at 31 December 2017 were Stephen 
O’Connor, Paul Heiden, David Nish, Val Rahmani and Andrea Sironi. 
Stuart Lewis (Chief Risk Officer, Deutsche Bank AG) acts as a special 
adviser to the Committee and is a standing invitee to meetings of the 
Risk Committee. 
This report is intended to give an overview of the role of the Risk 
Committee in assisting the Board to fulfil its oversight responsibilities 
relating to risk management and the adequacy of the systems of 
internal controls in place to mitigate key risks.
During the year ended 31 December 201 7 , the Committee met 4 times. In addition 
to its regular reviews of the Group’s risk map, risk appetite, and emerging risks, the 
Committee focused on the integration of the newly acquired Mergent and Yield 
Book businesses and review of the risk profile of specific divisions as part of its 
regular programme – in 201 7 the Committee reviewed the risk profile for the 
Information Services Division. The Committee also monitored specific geopolitical 
events and the programmes in place to implement MiFID II requirements across all 
subsidiaries subject to the legislation as well as the framework in place to manage 
the Group’s cyber security risks, including the approval of the Group’s cyber 
security strategy and related policies.

71 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Governance Report of the Risk Committee On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 . 
The report includes our Remuneration Policy Report and the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Context
At our April 201 7 AGM, shareholders voted 98.5% in favour of our Remuneration 
Policy. As a result of our proposed merger with Deutsche Börse, we did not make 
any amendments to our policy in 201 7 and appreciated shareholder support for 
our approach. 
We made a commitment to review our policy in the event that the merger did not 
proceed and as such, the following enhancements are being incorporated into our 
policy for operation in 2018 to further align to shareholder expectations and 
corporate governance best practice:
 – The mandatory deferral of 50% of bonus will be into shares only
 – A 2 year holding period will be added to the current 3 year performance period 
of the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), resulting in a total 5 year period from the 
date of grant; and
 – The Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR) will be increased from 200% to 
300% of base salary 
We are grateful for shareholder feedback in helping to shape and develop our revised 
policy. The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) believes that these 
enhancements ensure that our Remuneration Policy continues to align executive 
remuneration and shareholders’ long-term interests. 
As the additional elements provide strong market alignment, it is not our intention 
to present a new policy for approval. We will continue to engage with shareholders 
and monitor good practice developments ahead of our AGM in 2020, where it is 
anticipated that a revised Remuneration Policy will be presented for approval.
Performance in the year
The Committee continues to place great importance on ensuring that there is a  
clear link between pay and performance, including adherence to the Group’s risk 
framework, and that our remuneration outcomes are reflective of this wider context.
The Group has continued to execute on our strategy and achieved a strong 
financial and operational performance with growth across our core businesses, 
delivering on a number of new initiatives and developing our customer 
partnership approach. Total income from continuing operations rose to £1,955 
million, up 18%. AOP increased by 18% (£126 million) to £812 million and 
operating profit increased 47% to £626 million.
This strong performance reflects double-digit growth in our FTSE Russell and LCH 
OTC clearing businesses, supported by a robust capital markets performance 
against challenging market conditions.
 – Our Information Services Division’s revenue for FY201 7 was £736 million (2016: 
£595 million), within which FTSE Russell has continued to perform strongly with 
a 33% increase in revenue to £546 million (2016: £409 million). Within this 
performance the US$48 million run rate 5 year acquisition revenue synergies of 
the Russell Indexes business, acquired in 2014, have been achieved. In January 
201 7 we acquired Mergent Inc, and in August we acquired The Yield Book and 
Citi Fixed Income Indices businesses, which will both support the growth of FTSE 
Russell’s core index offering.
 – LCH’s income for FY201 7 increased 26% to £562 million (2016: £447 million). 
SwapClear saw a 31 % increase in clearing volumes, clearing a total US$87 4 
trillion (2016: US$666 trillion) for its members and their clients. The LCH 
SwapAgent service for uncleared products went live in May 201 7 .
 – In our capital markets business, revenues increased 6% to £391 million (2016: 
£368 million) and 194 new companies were admitted to our markets in the year, 
up 45% on 2016, with 9 out of 10 of the top IPOs by size coming from outside of 
the UK, underlining its position as the leading global listing venue for 
international companies.
 – Income for Post Trade services in Italy increased 3% to £15 1 million (2016:  
£147 million). 
 – FY201 7 revenue for the technology division was £91 million (2016: £88 million). 
At the end of 201 7 and in early 2018 we confirmed the disposal of 2 non-core 
technology businesses: MillenniumIT ESP and Exactpro.

Remuneration 
Committee
72 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee The Group has delivered another strong financial performance with growth across all 
core business areas. Although the proposed merger with Deutsche Börse failed for 
exogenous reasons it involved immense management effort. Despite the significant 
resources and focus required to progress the merger discussions, the business 
continued to outperform on financial targets during and after the process.
Bonus outcomes for Executive Directors
As a result of the Group’s performance and individual performance, the 
Committee determined that the Executive Directors will be awarded bonuses  
of between 79% and 82% of their maximum opportunity.
Share plan vesting
90.5% of the LTIP awards made in 201 4 vested during 201 7 . AEPS increased from 
98.6p (FY to end March 201 4) to 129.7p over the period to the end of December 
2016, resulting in 81 % of the AEPS element vesting. TSR increased by 120% over 
the period to August 201 7 , resulting in 100% of the TSR element vesting.
As shown in our ‘Single total figure of remuneration’ table, the AEPS element of 
the LTIP awards made in 2015 will vest in full. Based on performance to date it is 
forecast that the TSR element will also vest in full, however this will be confirmed 
following the end of the performance period in April 2018 and will be disclosed in 
our FY2018 DRR. The achievement of stretching targets year on year has delivered 
significant value. These vesting outcomes reflect AEPS growth of 14.6% year on 
year and 12.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the 3 year 
performance period; and annualised TSR performance to date for these 2015 
grants is 19% p.a., incorporating share price growth of 29% in 201 7 . 
During 201 7 , a significant number of our employees benefited from the maturity 
of our 2 Sharesave schemes launched in 2014. The 201 7 Sharesave Invitation 
extended the expanded Group’s participation overall to 52% of eligible employees, 
incorporating colleagues in Malaysia and those joining from Mergent Inc. and The 
Yield Book businesses.
Salary review for Executive Directors
During the year, the Committee conducted its annual review of the base salary 
levels of our Executive Directors.
As was announced on 29 November 201 7 in connection with his appointment as 
interim CEO, David Warren was granted a ‘step-up’ allowance of £212,000, to be paid 
in addition to his current base salary of £488,000 for the duration of his appointment 
as interim CEO, providing a new interim salary of £700,000. 
The Committee has decided to increase Mr Warren’s base salary for his role as 
Chief Financial Officer to £500,000, which is in line with average employee salary 
increases of 2.5%. Further details of Mr Warren’s remuneration arrangements as 
interim CEO are provided in the ‘Remuneration arrangements for the interim Chief 
Executive Officer’ section on the following page.
The Committee has decided to increase the salary of Raffaele Jerusalmi, Chief 
Executive Officer of Borsa Italiana and Director of Capital Markets to €525,000, 
recognising the value of his role as an Executive Director. The increase of 1 % is 
below average employee salary increases of 2.5%.
LTIP awards to be made in 2018
LTIP awards to be granted in 2018 will be granted under our 2014 shareholder-
approved plan.
David Warren will be granted a LTIP award of 300% and Raffaele Jerusalmi will be 
granted a LTIP award of 275% of salary in 2018, reflecting their criticality and 
providing strong alignment to the performance of the Group.
Operation of 2018 annual bonus
The operation of the 2018 annual bonus will continue to be focused on financial 
targets, strategic initiatives and personal contribution.
Share plan rules and approvals
We will seek shareholder approval for 4 share plans at our forthcoming AGM, 
reflecting routine course of business and our continued commitment to 
alignment with shareholder interests through employee share ownership.  
The plans are summarised below and detailed on page 86.
 – Renewal of our approved International Sharesave Plan, which reaches the end  
of its 10 year lifespan in July 2018
 – Approval of our Restricted Share Award Plan, which reaches the end of its 10 
year lifespan in May 2018. The plan will continue to be used primarily for key 
new hires to replicate deferred compensation forfeited from prior employment 
(reflecting the increased prevalence of deferred compensation structures in  
the markets in which we operate) and for the retention of key talent during 
acquisitions. The plan will not be used on a normal basis for Executive Directors 
and will not form part of any of their normal long term incentive; and
 – The introduction of a UK tax-favoured all-employee Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
and an equivalent international arrangement

The financial terms associated with his departure were agreed with Mr Rolet at the time of the CEO succession announcement on 19 October 201 7 . We are honouring 
these agreed contractual commitments, all of which are in accordance with the shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy and are detailed on pages 76–80. 
Remuneration arrangements for the interim Chief Executive Officer
As announced on 29 November 201 7 in connection with the departure arrangements for Mr Rolet, David Warren was appointed as interim CEO with immediate effect.  
As part of this appointment, changes were made to his terms until a permanent CEO successor is appointed.
Mr Warren was granted a ‘step-up’ allowance of £212,000 in addition to his current base salary of £488,000 for the duration of his appointment as interim CEO, providing a 
new interim salary of £700,000. As stated in the ‘Salary review for Executive Directors’ section above, the Committee has decided to increase his base salary in relation to 
his role as Chief Financial Officer by 2.5% to £500,000. His ‘step up’ allowance will be reduced by £12,000 to £200,000, providing an unchanged interim salary of £700,000 
for the duration of his appointment as interim CEO. 
Full details of Mr Warren’s remuneration arrangements are detailed on page 87 .
Concluding remarks
The Committee continues to ensure the Group’s approach to remuneration takes into account best practice and market trends in the financial services sector and wider 
market while continuing to support the commercial needs of the Group, the interests of shareholders and of all other stakeholders. We are grateful for shareholder 
feedback in helping to shape our enhanced policy and we look forward to your support for these proposals at the forthcoming AGM.

Remuneration Policy Report Summary (pages 76–80)
The Remuneration Policy Report was subject to a binding shareholder vote at the 
201 7 AGM and was passed with 98.5% support. As explained in the Chairman’s 
statement, we have incorporated a number of enhancements to our policy to  
align with good market practice. As the enhancements are deemed preferential  
to shareholders, we are not seeking approval for a new policy.
A summary of the Policy Report, including these enhancements, is set out  
on pages 76 to 80. The full Remuneration Policy Report is set out in the 2016 
Directors Remuneration Report as part of our 2016 Annual Report.

75 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Governance Directors’ Remuneration Report Our Remuneration Policy Report was subject to a binding shareholder vote at the 
201 7 AGM and was approved with 98.5% of the votes. Accordingly, it had a binding 
effect on the Group from that date. However, as stated in the Chairman’s statement, 
we have incorporated a number of enhancements to our policy to align with good 
market practice. A summary of the Policy Report, including these enhancements, 
is set out on pages 76 to 80. The full Remuneration Policy Report is set out in the 
2016 Directors Remuneration Report as part of our 2016 Annual Report. 
Current policy table for Executive Directors
A summary of the key elements of remuneration for Executive Directors is shown 
in the following table and includes the following enhancements to our policy for 
operation from FY2018:
ENHANCEMENTS TO POLICY FOR 2018:
 – The mandatory deferral of 50% of bonus will be into shares only
 – A 2 year holding period will be added to the current 3 year  
performance period of the LTIP , resulting in a total 5 year period  
from the date of grant; and
 – The Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR) will be increased  
from 200% to 300% of base salary
The above enhancements are highlighted in the summarised Policy 
Report, for ease of reference.
The Remuneration Policy is designed to support the long term interests of the 
Group. The Group is committed to paying for performance, rewarding the senior 
management team only when its goals are achieved. Each year the remuneration 
framework and the packages of the Executive Directors and members of the 
Executive Committee are reviewed by the Committee to ensure that they continue 
to achieve this objective. The Committee takes into account multiple reference 
points when setting pay including companies in the FTSE 100, the broader 
Financial Services sector and other international exchange groups.
The Committee has taken the following areas into account in establishing the 
Group Remuneration Policy:
 – a focus on shareholder value
 – the continued global expansion of the Group
 – the need to attract and retain senior management from the international 
finance and technology sectors
 – the Group’s intent to be mindful of best practice as expressed by institutional 
shareholders and their representative bodies; and
 – the unique position of the Group at the heart of capital markets

cost of the arrangement.
MAXIMUM 
OPPORTUNITY
There is no defined maximum salary. 
Increases are determined based on the factors described 
in the Operation row. 
The Committee’s normal approach is to initially consider 
increases within the range awarded to other employees. 
More significant increases may be awarded in certain 
circumstances, such as where there is a significant change 
in the scale, scope or responsibility of a role, development 
within a role and/or significant market movement. 
The annual base salaries in FY2017 and for FY2018 for 
each Executive Director are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
MAXIMUM 
OPPORTUNITY
There is no defined maximum. 
Benefits plans are set at (what are in the Committee’s opinion) 
reasonable levels in order to be market competitive for their local 
jurisdiction and are dependent on individual circumstances.
Participation in the Save As You Earn Option Scheme (or  
international equivalent) is capped at the same level as all other 
participants, which is determined by the Company within the 
parameters of applicable legislation.
The maximum annual pension contribution/cash allowance is 25%  
of salary (except where determined by local market practice). 
In Italy, Mr Jerusalmi accrues mandatory state pension (INPS) benefits 
which are calculated on salary, benefits and annual bonus. Actual 
benefit due at retirement is set out by the applicable Italian legislation 
in force from time to time. Under the Italian Trattamento di Fine 
Rapporto (TFR), he receives contributions which are funded by the 
Group at a rate fixed by local law and which are paid to Mr Jerusalmi’s 
private pension plan. TFR is calculated on salary, capped benefits, 
annual bonus and LTIP .

PURPOSE AND 
LINK TO 
STRATEGY
Provides a core element of remuneration which reflects 
the responsibilities of the role. 
Enables the recruitment and retention of individuals of 
the calibre required to execute the Group’s strategy.
PURPOSE AND 
LINK TO 
STRATEGY
Provide local market competitive benefits and support the wellbeing  
of employees.
Provide Executives with retirement benefits.
Support recruitment and retention of high-calibre people.
OPERATION Base salaries are normally reviewed annually by taking 
into account a range of factors, including: 
 – size and scope of the role; 
 – skills and experience of the individual; 
 – market competitiveness/relative positioning; 
performance of the Group and of the individual;  
wider market and economic conditions; and 
 – level of increases being made across the Group. 
Any changes are normally effective from 1 April each year.
OPERATION A flexible benefits plan is offered, in which individuals have certain core 
benefits (such as private medical, life assurance, income protection and 
additionally, in Italy only, disability, accident, car, fuel allowance and 
luncheon vouchers) together with (in the UK) a taxable cash allowance 
which can be spent on elective benefits (such as additional medical, life 
or dental cover).
Car transportation may also be provided for Executive Directors where 
appropriate.
Due to the high profile of the Group, the Committee reserves the  
right to provide our Executives with the appropriate level of security 
arrangements to allow them to perform their duties in the safest 
possible conditions.
Benefits are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain affordable and 
competitive. The Committee retains the discretion to provide reasonable 
additional benefits as appropriate – for example, relocation and other 
allowances including expatriate assistance, housing and school fees for 
a finite period, tax preparation and filing assistance and flights back to 
the home country for the Executive and his family. Repatriation costs 
are met by the Company if employment is terminated by the Company, 
other than for just cause.
Where necessary any benefits may be grossed up for taxes.
Executives are eligible to participate in the Group’s HMRC-approved Save 
As You Earn Option Scheme (or international equivalent) on the same 
basis as other employees.
Executive Directors are covered by the Directors’ and Officers’ insurance 
and indemnification.
Provision of annual pension allowance, invested in the Company’s 
defined contribution plan or taken as a cash allowance.
In certain jurisdictions, more bespoke pension arrangements may be

PURPOSE AND 
LINK TO 
STRATEGY
Rewards annual performance against challenging 
financial, strategic and individual targets linked to 
Group strategy.
Deferral reinforces retention and enhances 
alignment with shareholders by encouraging 
longer-term focus and sustainable performance.
Incentivises performance over the longer term 
through the award of performance related shares.
Aligns reward with long-term, sustainable Group 
performance and a focus on shareholder value.
Ensures alignment with  
shareholders’ interests.
OPERATION The Group operates a Group-wide bonus pool which 
is funded based on the achievement of financial 
and strategic goals of the Group. Allocations to 
individual Executive Directors are made from this 
pool based on the Committee’s assessment of their 
individual performance, taking into account the 
Group’s financial and strategic performance and 
the achievement of any individual objectives 
related to their role.
Performance targets are reviewed and set  
by the Committee at the beginning of each 
performance year.
Awards are determined by the Committee after  
the year end based upon the actual performance 
against these targets.
The Committee applies judgement where necessary 
to ensure approved pay-out levels are reflective of 
actual, overall performance.
 – 50% of the annual bonus will be subject to 
mandatory deferral, normally for a period  
of 2 years.
 – Enhancement: Bonus deferral will be 100% 
into shares.
 – Dividends (or equivalents) may be paid in respect 
of deferred shares on vesting.
 – Deferred awards are subject to malus provisions as 
described below. Paid bonuses and vested awards 
are subject to clawback as described below.
 – Under the LTIP 2014, which was approved by 
shareholders at the 2014 AGM, awards of shares 
(or equivalent) are granted annually subject to 
performance conditions.
 – Enhancement: Awards normally vest subject to 
performance targets assessed over a performance 
period, normally of at least 3 financial years  
with an additional holding period of 2 years. 
The Committee has discretion to set different 
performance periods if it considers them to  
be appropriate.
 – The Committee shall determine the extent to 
which the performance measures have been met. 
The Committee may make adjustments to 
performance targets if an event occurs that the 
Committee determines that an adjustment is 
appropriate. The performance targets will be at 
least as challenging as the ones originally set.
 – Dividends (or equivalents) may be paid on 
vesting. Unvested awards are subject to a malus 
provision and vested awards are subject to 
clawback, as described below.
Enhancement: Executive Directors 
are expected to build up share 
ownership over a period of 5  
years and maintain holdings  
of at least 3x base salary.
MAXIMUM 
OPPORTUNITY
Maximum annual bonus opportunity of 225% of 
salary for CEO and 200% of salary for other Executive 
Directors for maximum performance.
Although there is a facility for maximum awards of up 
to 400% of salary under the plan rules in exceptional 
cases, it is expected that awards under this plan will 
normally be up to 300% of salary.
PERFORMANCE 
MEASURES
Based on a combination of financial (e.g. adjusted 
operating profit), strategic and individual 
performance targets. Strategic objectives include 
key targets under the strategic pillars of developing 
our partnership approach, driving global growth 
and delivering best in class capabilities. These 
strategic objectives also impact financial results  
in the medium term.
The Committee will set the detail and mix of 
performance measures, targets and weighting 
based on the strategic objectives at the start of 
each year. At least 50% of the targets relating to  
the annual bonus pool in any year will be subject  
to financial measures.
No bonuses are paid for below threshold 
performance. The Committee may award  
any amount between zero and 100% of the 
maximum opportunity.
The performance measures are applied in the 
performance year only.
The Committee determines performance targets 
each year to ensure that the targets are stretching 
and support value creation for shareholders while 
remaining motivational for management.
Vesting of awards is subject to achievement of total 
shareholder return and financial performance targets. 
For grants under this LTIP , awards are subject to 
absolute TSR and adjusted EPS measures.
Measures will normally be equally weighted but in 
any event, any total shareholder return element will 
represent at least 50% of the award.
For each performance element, achievement of the 
threshold performance level will result in no more 
than 25% of the maximum award paying out. For 
achievement of the maximum performance level, 
100% of the maximum pays out. Normally, there is 
straight-line vesting between these points.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Remuneration Policy Report Notes to the Policy Table
Malus and clawback provisions
A malus provision applies to awards granted under the 2014 LTIP and to unvested 
awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan. This would allow the Committee in its 
absolute discretion to determine, at any time prior to the vesting of an award, to 
reduce, cancel or impose further conditions in certain circumstances, including  
(i) where there is a material misstatement or restatement of the results of the 
Group in its audited accounts, (ii) the negligence, fraud or serious misconduct of 
the individual which results in significant reputational damage to the Group or 
which has a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group or the 
business opportunities of the Group, or (iii) if the individual is a member of a 
company in the Group which suffers significant reputational damage or material 
adverse effect on its financial position or on its business opportunities. 
A clawback provision applies to vested awards granted under the 2014 LTIP , vested 
awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan and annual bonuses paid previously. This 
would allow the Committee in its absolute discretion to claw back from individuals 
some or all of the vested awards or paid bonus in certain circumstances, including 
(i) if there is a material misstatement or restatement of the results of the Group  
in its audited accounts, (ii) the negligence, fraud or serious misconduct of the 
individual which results in significant reputational damage to the Group or a 
material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group or the business 
opportunities of the Group, or (iii) if the individual is a member of a company in the 
Group which suffers significant reputational damage or material adverse effect on 
its financial position or on its business opportunities. Clawback will normally apply 
for a period of 3 years following vesting of shares/deferred cash bonus and/or 
payment of bonus, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Service contracts and payments for departing Directors 
The Group’s current policy is that Executive Directors’ service agreements should 
have notice periods that are no longer than 12 months. The Group may terminate 
an Executive Director’s service agreement by making a payment in lieu of notice 
of a sum equal to 12 months’ salary, pension, flexible benefits allowance, life and 
medical insurance (but excluding bonus and share incentives) plus any accrued 
unused holiday entitlement. Consideration will be given to appropriate mitigation 
terms to reduce payments in lieu of notice made on termination in the event of 
the Executive Director commencing alternative employment, being appointed  
as a Non-Executive Director or providing services pursuant to a consultancy 
agreement in the 12 months following the Executive Director’s departure.
The Group may pay an Executive Director’s reasonable legal fees for receiving 
advice in connection with their employment.
The lawful termination mechanisms described above are without prejudice to the 
Group’s ability in appropriate circumstances to terminate in breach of the notice 
period referred to above, and thereby to be liable for damages to the Executive 
Director. Liquidated damages clauses are not used.
In the event of termination by the Group, each Executive Director may have an 
entitlement to compensation in respect of his statutory rights under employment 
protection legislation in the UK and potentially elsewhere. Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance and an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law and 
the Group’s Articles of Association are provided to the Executive Directors for the 
duration of their employment and for a minimum of 7 years following termination.
The Committee considers that this is consistent with current best practice and this 
approach will generally be adopted for new appointments. Where appropriate and 
when recruiting non-UK based Directors, the Committee may agree different 
terms based on local legal requirements or market practice.
Treatment of variable incentives
Annual bonus Individuals may be considered for an annual bonus in 
respect of the period prior to cessation. Any award would be 
at the discretion of the Committee, subject to the Executive 
Director’s performance and period of employment.
Deferred Bonus 
Plan 2014
For good leavers, awards vest at the normal vesting date, 
although the Committee may determine that awards vest 
on cessation of employment. The award will usually vest in 
full or on a prorated basis at the Committee’s discretion. 
Good leavers are those who cease to be an employee of a 
member of the Group by reason of death, injury, disability, 
ill-health, redundancy, the sale of the individual’s 
employing business or the transfer of the Company out  
of the Group, or any other reason which the Committee 
decides in its discretion, having regard to a range of 
relevant factors including the Executive Director’s 
performance, length of service and circumstances  
of their departure. 
Where an individual is not considered to be a good leaver, 
unvested awards will lapse. Where an individual is 
summarily dismissed, all his awards will lapse. 
Deferred awards are subject to malus and vested awards 
are subject to clawback as detailed above.
Long-Term 
Incentive  
Plan 2014
For good leavers, awards will normally vest at the normal 
vesting date and following the end of the performance 
period, unless the Committee determines that awards 
should vest following cessation of employment. Vesting 
will be subject to performance and unless the Committee 
determines otherwise (or that another basis of reduction is 
appropriate) prorated for time in employment. Good 
leavers are those who cease to be an employee of a 
member of the Group by reason of death, injury, disability, 
ill-health, redundancy, and the sale of the individual’s 
employing business or transfer of the Company out of the 
Group, or any other reason which the Committee decides in 
its discretion, having regard to a range of relevant factors 
including the Executive Director’s performance, length of 
service and circumstances of their departure. 
Where an individual is not considered to be a good leaver, 
unvested awards will lapse. 
Unvested awards are subject to malus and vested awards 
are subject to clawback as detailed above.

Governance Directors’ Remuneration Report Policy for Non-Executive Directors
Approach to setting fees Basis of fees Other items
The fees for Non-Executive Directors are set at a level 
which is considered appropriate to attract individuals 
with the necessary experience and ability to make an 
important contribution to the Group’s affairs.
The Chairman’s fee is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee, and the Board is responsible for 
determining all other Non-Executive Director fees.
Fees are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain 
appropriate. The Committee retains the flexibility to 
increase, adjust and make one-off payments to 
Non-Executive Directors based on their remit.
Fees are set taking into account the level of 
responsibility of each Non-Executive Director and fees 
at other companies of a similar size and complexity.
The aggregate fees payable to all Non-Executives 
combined (excluding the Chairman and excluding fees 
paid for any appointments on subsidiary boards) are 
capped as set out in the Group’s Articles of Association as 
they may be amended by a resolution of shareholders 
from time to time. The current limit on the aggregate 
fees that are payable is £1,500,000 per financial year.
Details of current fees are set out on page 88 of the 
2017 Annual Report. 
Non-Executive Directors receive a basic annual fee with 
additional fees payable for committee chairmanship.
Certain Non-Executive Directors are also entitled  
to receive fees from subsidiary companies.
The Non-Executive Chairman of the Group and Senior 
Independent Director receive an all-inclusive fee for  
the role.
Fees are neither performance-related nor pensionable.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate  
in the annual bonus or LTIP plans and are not entitled  
to any payments on termination. 
Non-Executive Directors do not receive any benefits  
or entitlements other than their fees and reasonable 
expenses.
Travel and other appropriate expenses with associated 
taxes (including fees incurred in obtaining professional 
advice in the furtherance of their duties) incurred in the 
course of performing their duties are reimbursed to 
Non-Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors are covered by the Directors’ 
and Officers’ insurance and indemnification.
 
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with no notice period except for the Group Chairman who has a notice period of 6 months unless he is not 
re-elected by shareholders in which case his appointment will terminate immediately. The Non-Executive Directors’ appointments are for an initial period of 3  
years from the date of appointment and are also subject to re-election by shareholders.

Governance Directors’ Remuneration Report Additional notes to the Single total figure of remuneration (Audited)
Fixed pay
Base salary
When reviewing Executive Director salaries, and in line with our policy, the 
Committee considers multiple reference points including companies in the FTSE 
100, the broader Financial Services sector and other international exchange groups.
Benefits
A flexible benefits plan is offered, in which individuals have certain core benefits 
(such as private medical, life assurance, income protection and, additionally in 
Italy only, disability, illness, accident, car, fuel allowance and luncheon vouchers) 
together with (in the UK) a taxable cash allowance which can be spent on elective 
benefits (such as additional medical, life or dental cover).
Where received as a cash supplement, this allowance is not used to calculate bonus 
payments or pension contributions. Benefits are reviewed periodically to ensure 
they remain affordable and competitive. Executives are eligible to participate in  
the Group’s HMRC -approved SA YE Scheme (or international equivalent).
Xavier Rolet and David Warren receive a flexible benefits allowance of £20,000 per 
annum, which is unchanged since last year. In addition they receive benefits in 
kind which include private health care, permanent health insurance and life 
assurance arrangements. 
As an expatriate from the US to UK, David Warren is also entitled to receive 
the following:
 – Each year he is entitled to tax preparation and filing assistance in the US and  
the UK.
 – The Group will meet the costs of repatriating Mr Warren’s effects back to the US 
if it terminates his employment other than in circumstances such as serious 
misconduct which would justify summary termination.
 – An annual allowance of £30,000 net per annum to cover flights between London 
and New York for Mr Warren and his family.
Raffaele Jerusalmi receives benefits in kind that include private medical, disability 
and life insurance cover, luncheon vouchers, car and fuel. He also contributes 
towards the Italian mandatory national insurance system. 
There are no contractual malus or clawback provisions in place in relation to benefits.
Executive Directors are covered by the Directors’ and Officers’ insurance  
and indemnification.
Retirement Benefits
In the UK, pension provision for our Executive Directors takes the form of a 
non-consolidated cash allowance.
Xavier Rolet and David Warren receive an allowance equivalent to 25% of base 
salary as a taxable cash supplement. Only base salary is used to calculate pension 
entitlement and no other pension supplements apply. 
Raffaele Jerusalmi accrues mandatory state pension (INPS) benefits in Italy. 
Actual benefit due at retirement is set out by the applicable Italian legislation in 
force from time to time. Under the Italian TFR, he receives contributions which are 
funded by the Company at a rate fixed by local law and which are paid to Mr 
Jerusalmi’s private pension plan. Both INPS and TFR contributions are included  
in the Single total figure of remuneration table on the previous page.
Bonus awarded for FY2017
Executive Directors are eligible to receive an annual bonus based on meeting or 
exceeding bonus targets that are set at the beginning of the year, looking at the 
Group’s financial performance, strategic deliverables and their personal contribution.
The Committee also receives input from the Risk Committee with regard to 
performance related to risk culture (awareness, transparency and accountability) 
when assessing remuneration decisions.
The operation of the FY201 7 annual bonus is as per last year. For the financial year 
ending 31 December 2016, the Committee determined that the sole annual 
financial target should again be AOP . The Committee considers AOP to be of 
particular significance for the Group and believes it should continue to be the 
main financial measure for annual bonus plan purposes. As per 2016, the 
maximum bonus opportunity is 225% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 
200% of salary for other Executive Directors. For 2016 the balance between 
financial and strategic objectives for the Group bonus pool was 60:40, increased 
from 50:50 in 2015, reflecting the increasing importance of financial performance 
to the Group. This 60:40 balance is unchanged for 201 7 .
The Executive Directors’ awards are funded from the Group bonus pool; their 
individual awards are based on an assessment of their contribution weighted 
against 55% Group AOP , 35% against strategic deliverables and 10% delivery 
against personal objectives as determined by the Board.

Governance Directors’ Remuneration Report Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
As well as being an exemplary Group CFO, David Warren has stepped up as 
interim CEO, providing vital continuity and leadership during the period of 
change for the Group.
David has led the focus on all aspects of financial performance, driving income 
growth by focusing on a successful mix of core product lines, supporting new 
opportunities and ensuring successful integration of recent acquisitions. Notable 
integration success includes Russell Indexes, where the Group has achieved the  
5 year US$48 million revenue synergies from the acquisition 2 years ahead of  
target. As the Group’s income grows, David has reinforced continued discipline in 
operating cost levels and focus on delivering value from our investments for growth.
David has led the Group through several refinancing activities in 201 7: Refinancing 
of short dated facilities, rebalancing of bank/bond debt mix with €1 billion Euro 
bond and £600 million 5 year bank facilities, plus £1 billion Euro CP Programme 
launched, strengthening debt capital structure, materially reducing borrowing 
costs and strengthening lending appetite that would facilitate further small/
medium sized investments. This activity and the translation of Group financial 
performance into a strong cashflow has seen credit rating upgrades from both 
Standard & Poors and Moody’s in the year, enhancing lending bank appetite to 
provide headroom for further investments.
David was central to the Group’s M&A activities in the year, which included the 
acquisition of Mergent Inc, a leading provider of business and financial data on 
public and private companies; and The Yield Book fixed income analytics platform 
and Citi Fixed Income Indices, an index business including the World Government 
Bond Index (WGBI). In addition, our shareholding of LCH Group was increased 
from 57 .8% to 65.9% and a 10-year derivatives clearing partnership was achieved 
with Euronext N.V.
David has also led the focus on core operations through the disposal of our non- 
growth and low margin businesses, including ISPS, Exactpro and MillenniumIT ESP .
Executive Director, CEO of Borsa Italiana & Director of Capital Markets
In addition to his responsibilities as an Executive Director for the Group, Raffaele 
Jerusalmi has led our capital markets and Post Trade divisions in Italy. Against a 
challenging macroeconomic backdrop and low levels of volatility he has continued 
to promote innovation and drive growth. Capital markets had a 6% increase in 
revenues to £391 million (FY2016: £368 million).
Based on the above context and an assessment of individual performance, the Remuneration Committee awarded bonuses to each of the Executive Directors as follows:

2. Bonus awarded in relation to the 11 months worked as CEO in 2017
The Group welcomed 194 companies to our markets in the year, raising a 
combined total of £44.2 billion (2016: £25.6 billion) in new and further issues.  
This has been achieved despite significant levels of uncertainty around the 
potential outcomes of the Brexit negotiations between the EU and UK which  
has required significant engagement with key stakeholders. 
Other notable achievements include preparing our business for the launch of 
MiFID II in January 2018, AIM capital raised since launch reaching £105 billion, 
launch of the ELITE Basket Bond, and launch of the International Securities 
Market in London. In addition to the new products launched in-year, 201 7 has 
seen growth in products launched in 2016 such as CurveGlobal and ELITE Club 
Deal as our customers respond positively to our continued innovation.
Departing Chief Executive Officer
The Group has delivered another strong financial performance with growth across 
all core business areas. Although the proposed merger with Deutsche Börse failed 
for exogenous reasons, it involved immense management effort and despite the 
significant resources and focus required to progress the merger discussions, the 
business continued to outperform on financial targets during and after the process.
Following the strong historic financial performance, the Executive Directors  
and key members of the of the Group’s Leadership Team held a successful and 
well-received Investor Day in June 201 7 , whereby our investors were updated on  
our medium term performance expectations and financial targets.
The Group’s openness to innovation was demonstrated by the launch of numerous 
new products, services and initiatives that expand and leverage our open access 
strategy. Notable examples include: International Securities Market, ELITE Basket 
Bond €1 12 million 10-year bond, LCH SwapAgent, CDSClear client clearing, MTS 
Global Collateral Management and the launch of Russell 2000 Index futures on 
CME’s Globex platform.
Despite strong economic performance, aspects of Xavier’s operating style and  
the uncertainty surrounding whether or not he was prepared to give his consent  
to continue in office if the second resolution of the 19 December 201 7 General 
Meeting was passed negatively impacted relationships between him and the 
Board. As was announced at the time, Xavier’s garden leave was accelerated and  
he agreed to step down as CEO on 29 November 201 7 , resulting in him working  
1 1 of 12 months of the year. The Committee considered this and deemed it 
appropriate to pro-rate his FY201 7 bonus accordingly.
84 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Annual Report on Remuneration Compulsory deferral under existing Remuneration Policy
Executive Directors must compulsorily defer 50% of their bonus for a period of 2 years. This provision applies to the bonus amount for the FY201 7 bonus above and 
operates as follows:
 – Until the minimum shareholding requirement of 2x base salary is reached, the percentage of bonus that is deferred will be deferred 100% into shares; and
 – Once the level of minimum shareholding has been reached, individuals are able to elect to defer under 3 different approaches: 100% of the deferral amount into 
shares; 50% into shares and 50% into cash; or 100% into cash.
 – Dividend equivalents will be paid in respect of deferred shares on vesting.
 – Any deferral into shares will be disclosed at a later date once confirmed.
Long term incentive plan (LTIP)
All currently outstanding LTIP awards have been made under the 2014 LTIP .
Awards granted in August 2014 with a performance period ended in FY201 7
The performance period for the absolute TSR element of the Performance Share awards ended in August 201 7 . The awards granted in 2014 were based on absolute TSR 
performance in the 3 years from grant, and adjusted EPS performance in the 33-month performance period to December 2016. Over the period annualised absolute TSR 
performance in the 3 years to August 201 7 was 30% per annum and therefore vested at 100% for this element. The Company also delivered average adjusted EPS 
growth of 10.5% per annum over the performance period and therefore vested at 81 %. Vesting price as at 27 August 201 7 was £39.50.
Awards granted in April 2015 with a performance period ending in FY2018
The value shown in the single figure table on page 81 for the financial year ending December 201 7 represents the estimated value of the 2015 awards which will vest in 
April 2018. The estimate is based on the confirmed 100% vesting of the EPS element and forecast 100% vesting of the TSR element, which will be confirmed in April 
2018. The estimated value is based on a 3 month average share price from 1 October 201 7 to 31 December 201 7 . The final vesting outcome (including the actual share 
price at vesting) following the end of the performance period will be disclosed in the next Annual Report on Remuneration covering FY2018.
The performance conditions applying to awards granted in April 2015 are as follows:
EPS element (50%) – average adjusted EPS growth TSR element (50%) – absolute TSR growth Proportion of relevant element which vests
Less than 6% p.a. Less than 8% p.a. 0%
6% p.a. 8% p.a. 25%
12% p.a. or more 16% p.a. or more 100%
Straight-line pro-rating applies between these points
Further to the financial year-end change, awards made in FY2015 and onwards returned to being measured over 36 months, on a calendar year basis, for EPS.  
The financial year-end change did not affect the TSR measurement period which remained 3 calendar years from grant. Vesting remained at 36 months.
LTIP Awards Granted in FY2017 (Audited)
Awards during FY201 7 were granted in April under the LTIP and were made with a value of 300% of salary for David Warren, 275% of salary for Raffaele Jerusalmi (at rate 
of £1 = €1.18), and 300% for Xavier Rolet. The same EPS performance conditions and vesting schedules described above for 2015 awards also apply to these 201 7 
awards; similarly for TSR, except that the TSR performance range was set at 6% to 14% further to shareholder consultation at that time.

85 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Governance Directors’ Remuneration Report Other share plans (SAYE)
All UK employees, including Executive Directors, are eligible to participate in the 
HM Revenue & Customs approved Save As You Earn Scheme (SAYE). Under the 
rules of the SAYE, participants can save up to £500 each month, for a period  
of 3 years. At the end of the saving period, savings plus interest may be used  
to acquire shares by exercising the related option. 
The options may be granted at an exercise price which represents a discount of  
up to 20% to market value at the date of invitation. No performance conditions  
are attached to SAYE options. There is also an International Sharesave Plan (ISP), 
which is designed to provide share options to Group employees, including 
Executive Directors, who are not based in the UK on similar terms to the options 
that are available to UK employees through the SAYE. Employees in France,  
Hong Kong, Italy, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and the US participate in the ISP . As a core 
component of our employee proposition and benefits offering it acts as a modest 
retention tool with over 50% of eligible employees participating globally. 
Xavier Rolet contributed £250 per month into the 2014–201 7 scheme prior to its 
maturity date in March 201 7 and contributes £250 per month into the 2015–2018 
SAYE scheme.
Share plan rules and approvals
We will seek shareholder approval for 4 share plans’ rules at our forthcoming AGM. 
These reflect routine course of business as well as our continued commitment to 
alignment with shareholder interests through employee share ownership.
 – Renewal of our approved International Sharesave Plan (ISP), which reaches the 
end of its 10 year lifespan in July 2018. As detailed in the ‘Other share plans’ 
section above, the plan currently operates in 6 countries and over 50% of eligible 
employees participate globally.
 – Approval of our Restricted Share Award Plan, which reaches the end of its 10 
year lifespan in May 2018. The plan will continue to be used primarily for key 
new hires to replicate deferred compensation forfeited from prior employment 
(reflecting the increased prevalence of deferred compensation structures in the 
markets in which we operate) and for the retention of key talent during 
acquisitions. The plan will not be used on a normal basis for Executive Directors 
and will not form part of any of their normal long term incentive; and
 – The introduction of a UK tax-favoured all-employee Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
and an equivalent international arrangement. Together with our existing UK  
and International Sharesave plans, the SIP is intended to present an opportunity 
for an all-employee offering including those jurisdictions where we do not 
operate Sharesave, as our footprint extends through acquisition and 
increased global reach.
Should the Restricted Share Award Plan be utilised as one component of any 
incoming Executive’s deferred compensation buyout, full consideration would be 
given to shareholder expectations and the Plan’s use and award construct be fully 
disclosed. Any such award would be consistent with the shareholder-approved 
Remuneration Policy. 
86 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Annual Report on Remuneration Remuneration arrangements for the departing Chief Executive Officer:
As has been announced, Xavier Rolet stepped down from his role as CEO and 
Director of LSEG plc on 29 November 201 7 after almost 9 years of service.
The financial terms below were agreed with Mr Rolet in October 201 7  
in connection with his announced departure and all are in line with the 
shareholder approved Remuneration Policy 201 7 . The Company is honouring 
those contractual commitments.
The following arrangements will apply in respect of Mr Rolet’s notice period:
 – Mr Rolet’s 12 month notice period commenced on 29 November 201 7 and  
will be spent on garden leave.
 – He may accelerate his termination on 4 weeks’ notice (in which case he will 
receive a payment in lieu of notice, calculated by reference to base salary and 
contractual benefits. Such payment would be made in instalments and subject 
to reduction if alternative employment or engagement is secured).
 – During his garden leave Mr Rolet will be available to be consulted at the  
Board’s discretion.
Other terms agreed with Mr Rolet in October 201 7 , which were the subject  
of careful consideration by the Committee, are as follows:
 – Annual bonus – Mr Rolet received a bonus for the 1 1 months he worked  
as CEO in FY201 7 , 50% of which will be deferred until March 2020. He will be  
not be eligible for a bonus in respect of FY2018.
 – Deferred bonus – he will be a ‘good leaver’ and awards will vest, in line with 
vesting schedules, in March 2018, 2019 and 2020.
 – LTIP – he will be a ‘good leaver’ and awards will vest on a ‘wait and see’ basis in line 
with existing vesting schedules and subject to the normal performance conditions.
 • No time pro-rating will apply to his 2015 award as it is anticipated he will still 
be on notice on its vesting date on 2 April 2018.
 • As it was anticipated that he would have been in employment for the 3 
full financial years applicable to the 2016 LTIP award, the Committee 
determined that this award would vest in full subject to the achievement 
of normal performance conditions. This was agreed with Mr Rolet as part 
of the legal agreement reached in October 201 7 in connection with his 
announced departure.
 • Mr Rolet’s 201 7 LTIP will be time pro-rated to 31 December 2018 (the date 
by which it was originally intended that his employment would cease). 
Should he elect to leave earlier than the expiry of his 12 month notice period 
once a successor has been appointed, the time pro-rating will apply to his 
leaving date.
 • Mr Rolet will not be granted an LTIP award in 2018.
 – Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR) – as Mr Rolet has demonstrated 
throughout his tenure, he is fully aligned to shareholders and has constantly far 
exceeded his MSR. He will maintain the required MSR until his departure date.
The Committee remains of the view that this treatment of Mr Rolet’s LTIP and 
deferred bonus, agreed in October 201 7 , is appropriate in light of his significant 
contribution to the Company’s performance to date and the fact that he will remain 
available to be consulted on strategic and succession issues during his garden leave.
The tables below set out the relevant number of shares under each of Mr Rolet’s 
2015, 2016 and 201 7 LTIP awards and his 2016 and 201 7 Deferred Bonus Plan 
(DBP) awards, along with date of vesting. In the case of the LTIP , vesting (and 
therefore future value) is subject to the achievement of stretching performance 
measures, which are designed to provide a long-term focus towards enhanced 
shareholder value and do not reward for failure. The DBP awards relate to deferred 
bonuses already earned for previous performance years.

The Company has made a contribution of £25,000 (plus VAT) towards Mr Rolet’s 
legal fees incurred in connection with the above arrangements that were agreed 
in October 201 7 .
Remuneration arrangements for the interim Chief Executive Officer:
As announced on 29 November 201 7 in connection with the departure 
arrangements for Mr Rolet, David Warren was appointed as interim CEO with 
immediate effect. As part of his appointment, the following changes were made  
to his terms until a permanent CEO successor is appointed:
 – A ‘step-up’ allowance of £212,000 will be paid in addition to his current base 
salary of £488,000 for the duration of his appointment as interim CEO, providing 
a new interim salary of £700,000.
 – Any bonus paid for 201 7 and 2018 performance will be adjusted on a pro-rata 
basis to reflect his new interim salary.
 – For 2018 his LTIP award will be calculated by reference to his current base salary.
 – His benefits, pension allowance and all other employment terms will  
remain unchanged.
As stated in the Chairman’s statement, the Committee has decided to increase his 
base salary in relation to his role as Chief Financial Officer by 2.5% to £500,000. 
His ‘step up’ allowance will be reduced by £12,000 to £200,000; therefore Mr 
Warren’s interim salary of £700,000 is unchanged.

Governance Directors’ Remuneration Report Implementation of the Remuneration Policy during 2018 (1 January 
2018 to 31 December 2018)
Base salary operation:
During the year, the Committee conducted its annual review of the base salary 
levels of our Executive Directors.
The Committee has decided to increase Mr Warren’s base salary for his role as 
Chief Financial Officer to £500,000, which is in line with average employee salary 
increases of 2.5%. The Committee has decided to increase the salary of Raffaele 
Jerusalmi, Chief Executive Officer of Borsa Italiana and Director of capital markets 
by 1 % to €525,000.
Base salaries effective from 1 April 2018 are set out in the table below:

1. Total salary for duration of appointment as interim CEO is £700,000 per annum
Annual bonus operation:
 – For FY2018 the Group bonus pool will be determined based on performance 
measures weighted 60% Group AOP and 40% strategic deliverables to be 
intended to be tested over a 12-month performance period.
 – The Executive Directors’ awards are funded from the Group bonus pool; their 
individual awards will be based on an assessment of their contribution weighted 
against 55% Group AOP , 35% against strategic deliverables and 10% delivery 
against personal objectives, as determined by the Board. The Committee 
determined that there should be a greater focus on the development of culture 
for the Group and a real emphasis on behaviour as to how the Executive 
Directors achieved their targets. As such, for FY2018, performance against 
strategic and personal deliverables will include an assessment against specific 
cultural objectives, including 360 degree feedback as an input measure. 
 – Any bonus payment will be paid out in March 2019. In accordance with the 
enhancements made to our policy, mandatory deferral of 50% of bonus will  
be into shares for a period of 2 years.
 – The minimum shareholding requirement is 3x base salary, increased from  
2x base salary in prior years.
 – Deferred awards are subject to malus provisions. Bonuses already paid out 
under the Deferred Bonus Plan and vested awards are subject to clawback  
(e.g. in cases of material misstatement or gross misconduct) with judgement 
applied by the Committee.
 – For good leavers, awards will usually vest at the normal vesting date and in full, 
unless the Committee determines to scale back the award based on any factors 
deemed relevant. Where an individual is not considered to be a good leaver, 
unvested awards will lapse.
Long Term Incentive Plan:
Awards are intended to be made in 2018 under the 2014 LTIP , as described in our 
Remuneration Policy Report. The 2018 LTIP awards will be granted under our 
enhanced Remuneration Policy and will therefore be subject to a 2 year holding 
period in addition to the current 3 year performance period, resulting in a total  
5 year period from the date of grant.
Malus and clawback provisions will apply to these awards, allowing the Committee 
to reduce subsisting awards or request the refund of already paid or vested awards 
in certain circumstances (e.g. material misstatement or gross misconduct). The 
2018 awards will vest 3 years after the grant date subject to absolute TSR and 
adjusted EPS performance measures as follows (i.e. the same measures as those 
that applied to the 201 7 awards):
EPS element (50%) – average 
adjusted EPS growth
TSR element (50%) – 
 absolute TSR growth
Proportion of relevant 
element which vests
Less than 6% p.a. Less than 6% p.a. 0%

and for each of the previous 8 financial periods, the TSR on a holding of the 
Company’s ordinary shares of the same kind and number as those by reference  
to which the FTSE 100 is calculated. The TSR graph represents the value, at  
31 December 201 7 , of £100 invested in London Stock Exchange Group plc on  
31 March 2009, compared with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE 100 Index 
over the same period. As a member of the FTSE 100, we have chosen the FTSE 100

Governance Directors’ Remuneration Report Advisors
The Remuneration Committee continues to be mindful of recommendations from 
key stakeholders, including institutional investor bodies. The Committee consults 
with major shareholders on any key decisions taken.
Deloitte LLP is the principal advisor appointed by the Committee to provide 
independent advice on executive remuneration policy and practice, and reviews 
the implementation of our approved policy against current and emerging 
corporate governance best practice. During 2015, the Committee undertook  
a competitive tender process for the role of Remuneration Committee advisor  
and re-appointed Deloitte as its principal advisor with effect from 1 April 2016.
During the year, Deloitte LLP received £150,000 (excluding VAT) based on actual 
time spent for these services. In addition, Deloitte received £16,000 (excluding 
VAT) at the beginning of the year for advice related to the potential merger with 
Deutsche Börse. Separately, other parts of Deloitte LLP also advised the Company 
during 201 7 in relation to tax, internal audit, consulting and transaction support 
services. Deloitte is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants Group 
and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to 
executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee is satisfied that  
the advice provided by Deloitte LLP is independent and objective.

Outside appointments
Executive Directors are allowed to accept appointments as Non-Executive 
Directors of other companies with the prior approval of the Chairman. Approval 
will only be given where the appointment does not represent a conflict of interest 
with the Company’s activities and where the wider exposure gained will be 
beneficial to the development of the individual. Executive Directors may retain 
fees to encourage them to seek out the development opportunities and valuable 
experience afforded by these appointments and in recognition of the personal 
responsibility Executives assume in such roles and we would disclose these fees.
At present, none of the Executive Directors are in receipt of additional fees.
No payments were made for loss of office during the year and no payments were 
made to past directors.

Authority to Purchase Shares
The authority for the Company to purchase in the market up to 35,040,453 of its 
ordinary shares (representing 10% of the issued share capital of the Company as 
at the latest practicable date before publication of the Notice of the Company’s 
last AGM) granted at the Company’s last AGM, expires on the date of the 
forthcoming AGM. This authority was used by the Company during the year for its 
buyback programme and the Company repurchased 5,552,359 of its own shares 
during the year. Shareholders will be asked to give a similar authority to purchase 
shares at the forthcoming AGM.
The Directors of the Company are pleased to present their Annual 
Report to shareholders, together with the financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 with comparatives for the year ended 
31 December 2016.
The following sections of the Annual Report are incorporated into this Directors’ 
Report by reference:
 – The information that fulfils the requirements of the Strategic Report (including 
the Financial Review) can be found on pages 2–53
 – Board of Directors on pages 54–55
Results
The Group made a profit before taxation from continuing operations, before 
amortisation of purchased intangible assets and non-underlying items for the 
year, of £750 million (2016: £623 million). After taking into account amortisation 
of purchased intangible assets and non-underlying items, the profit of the Group 
before taxation for the year from continuing operations was £564 million (2016: 
£364 million). Profit after taxation from continuing operations for the year was 
£586 million (2016: £263 million).
During the year the Group classified certain of its businesses as discontinued 
operations. The discontinued profit before taxation, before amortisation of 
purchased intangible assets and non-underlying items for the year, was £nil  
(2016: £28 million). After taking into account amortisation of purchased intangible 
assets and non-underlying items, the profit of the discontinued operations for the 
year was £23 million (2016: £104 million). Loss after taxation from discontinued 
operations for the year was £25 million (2016: £70 million loss).
Dividends
The Directors are recommending a final dividend for the year of 37 .2 pence  
(2016: 31.2 pence) per share which is expected to be paid on 30 May 2018 to 
shareholders on the register on 4 May 2018. Together with the interim dividend  
of 14.4 pence (2016:12.0 pence) per share paid in September 201 7 , this produces  
a total dividend for the period of 5 1.6 pence (2016: 43.2 pence) per share 
estimated to amount to £1 79 million (2016: £15 1 million).
Share capital
As at 31 December 201 7 , the Company had 350,531,339 ordinary shares in issue 
with a nominal value of 6
79/86
 pence each, representing 100% of the total issued 
share capital.
The Company holds 3,794,585 of its ordinary shares in Treasury. Therefore,  
the total number of voting rights in the company is 346,736,754. The figure 
346,736,754 may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations 
by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a 
change to their interest in, the company under the FCA’s Disclosure Guidance  
and Transparency Rules.
During the year, the Company issued 224,965 new ordinary shares and transferred 
1,757 ,77 4 ordinary shares out of treasury, to settle employee share scheme awards.
Directors’ Report
95 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Governance Directors’ Report Purchase of Company’s shares during the year
The Company has a capital management framework (previously disclosed) that 
takes account of balance position, investment for growth and distributions to 
shareholders through ordinary dividends and other possible returns of capital. 
Share buybacks are a means of returning capital when the Board expects to hold 
surplus cash for a prolonged period. Accordingly, the Company undertook its 
buyback programme to return surplus cash to shareholders in a manner that 
increased total earnings per share and net asset value per share. 
The Company purchased 5,552,359 of its ordinary shares for an aggregate 
consideration of £199 million (excluding costs) at an average price per share of 
£35.84 (excluding costs). These shares were ordinary shares with a nominal value 
of 6 79/86 pence each, and represented 1.6% of the Company’s ordinary shares in 
issue at the start of the year. Of these shares, the Company transferred 1,757 ,77 4 
shares (representing 0.5% of the Company’s ordinary shares in issue at the start  
of the year) out of treasury to settle employee share scheme awards. 
Authority to Issue Shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and without prejudice to any 
rights attached to any existing shares or class of shares, any share may be issued 
with such rights or restrictions as the Company may by ordinary resolution 
determine or, subject to and in default of such determination, as the Board  
shall determine.
Authority to Allot Shares
The authority conferred on the Directors at last year’s AGM to allot shares in the 
Company up to a maximum nominal amount of £8,081,035 (representing 33.3% 
of the issued share capital of the Company as at the latest practicable date before 
publication of the Notice of the Company’s last AGM) or, in connection with a 
pre-emptive offer to existing shareholders by way of a rights issue, up to a 
maximum nominal amount of £16,162,069 (representing 66.6% of the issued 
share capital of the Company as at the latest practicable date before publication  
of the Notice of the Company’s last AGM), expires on the date of the forthcoming 
AGM. Shareholders will be asked to give a similar authority to allot shares at the 
forthcoming AGM.
Directors’ interests
Directors’ interests in the shares of the Company as at 31 December 201 7 , 
according to the register maintained under the Companies Act 2006, are set  
out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 91. No company in  
the Group was, during or at the end of the year, party to any contract of 
significance in which any Director was materially interested.
Directors’ indemnity
Details of qualifying third-party indemnity provisions (as defined by section 234 
of the Companies Act 2006) in force during the course of the year ended 31 
December 201 7 can be found on page 60. Such qualifying third party indemnity 
provisions remain in force as at the date of approving this Directors’ Report.
Employees
Information on the Company’s wider responsibilities in relation to employees 
including the Company’s approach to human rights and diversity is given on page 
35 and information on the Group’s share schemes is provided in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 78, 85-86 and 88.. The Company provides an 
induction programme for new employees, including training employees on health 
and safety and a range of development programmes for all employees to develop  
their skills and knowledge. The Group gives full consideration to applications  
for employment from persons with a disability where the candidate’s particular 
aptitudes and abilities are consistent with and adequately meet the requirements 
of the role. The Group encourages and assists employees with a disability with 
training, career development and promotion opportunities, and where existing 
employees become disabled, our policy is to provide continuing employment and 
training wherever possible. Where changes to working practices or structure affect 
staff, staff are consulted and given the appropriate support. All employees are 
provided with information on matters of concern to them in their work, through 
regular briefing meetings and internal publications. To inform employees of the 
economic and financial factors affecting our business, regular updates are posted 
on our intranet and engagement events are hosted, such as ‘Townhall’ style 
meetings with members of our Executive Committee, providing a briefing of 
specific areas of the business.
Environment
As a group, we recognise that we must use resources in ways that deliver the 
long-term sustainability and profitability of the business and have a positive 
impact on the environment. We are taking such factors into account in developing 
products and services that support these aims through companies listed on our 
markets. The Group’s primary greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions arise from energy, 
waste and water in our offices and data centres around the world, from staff travel, 
and indirectly from our supply chain.
During the reporting period, we achieved a 31 % reduction in our absolute carbon 
emissions and a 42% reduction in Carbon Emissions per Full Time Employee  
(FTE), accelerating our progress from previous years This significant reduction is 
primarily attributed to our move to over 64% of the Group’s electricity now being 
provided by 100% natural renewable energy.
We are taking an active approach to emissions management, with our global 
Environmental Management Group measuring GHG impacts across our property 
portfolio, including managed offices where possible. We report beyond the 
mandatory reporting guidelines to include Scope 3 emissions. Performance is 
reported quarterly via our intranet, and we annually disclose to the Carbon 
Disclosure Project, DJSI, FTSE4Good and on our website www.lseg.com.
In June 201 7 , the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) released its reporting recommendations. The Group 
signed the TCFD statement of support, affirming its commitment to support the 
recommendations, and sees them as an important step in driving improved global 
consistency in voluntary global reporting standards. As the Group, and FTSE 
Russell in particular, intends to play a critical role in enabling the flow of 
information envisioned by the TCFD, the recommendations were incorporated  
into FTSE Russell’s climate-related indicators and in the Group ESG Reporting 
Guidance. Going forward, the Group will continue to review the recommendations.
96 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Directors’ Report continued support is not considered to be a political donation or expenditure under US law. 
As the PAC was a new programme, no political contributions were made during 
the reporting period. In accordance with the applicable law the PAC will be funded 
entirely by voluntary contributions from eligible employees. All decisions on the 
amounts and recipients of contributions are directed by a steering committee 
comprising employees eligible to contribute to the PAC.
All LSEG US Holdco, Inc contributions will be reviewed for legal compliance and will 
be publicly reported in accordance with US election laws.
Significant agreements
The following are significant agreements to which the Company is a party that 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following 
a takeover bid.
 – SwapClear 
LCH, along with a number of investment banks, is party to an agreement for the 
clearing of OTC interest rate swaps in relation to the SwapClear business. Such 
arrangements contain certain provisions that entitle the banks to terminate the 
agreement on a change of control of the Company.
 – Facility Agreement 
The Company has entered into 2 syndicated, committed, revolving facility 
agreements dated 9 November 2015 and 1 1 December 201 7; which provide an 
aggregate £1.2 billion of flexible financing capacity. The facilities are partially 
drawn and sized to provide comfortable headroom to the Group. The terms of 
the above agreements are consistent and appropriate for an investment grade 
borrower including change of control provisions which, if triggered, allow the 
Facility Agent, upon instructions from the majority lenders, to cancel the facility 
and declare all outstanding loans under the agreement, together with accrued 
interest and all other amounts accrued, due and payable.
 – Notes 
The Company has issued to the wholesale fixed income market £250 million of 
Sterling notes due in 2019, and under its Euro Medium Term Note Programme 
(the value of which the Company increased from £1 billion to £2 billion during 
the course of 201 7), two €500 million tranches of euro notes due in 2024 and 
2029. The notes contain a ‘redemption upon change of control’ provision which, 
if triggered by the combination of a change of control and, within 120 days 
thereafter, a credit rating downgrade to non-investment grade, allows note 
holders to exercise their option to require the Company to redeem the notes  
and pay any accrued and unpaid interest due.
 – Retail Bond Issue 
The Company has issued £300 million in Sterling denominated retail bonds, 
under the Euro Medium Term Note Programme referred to above, which are due 
in 2021. The retail bonds contain change of control provisions which, if triggered, 
by the combination of a change of control and, within 120 days thereafter, a 
credit rating downgrade to non-investment grade, allow the holder of these 
bonds to have the option to require the Company to repay early or to purchase 
the bonds of that holder at their face value together with the accrued interest.
 – Employee Share Plans 
The rules of the Company’s employee share plans set out the consequences  
of a change of control of the Company on employees’ rights under the plans. 
Generally such rights will vest on a change of control and participants will 
become entitled to acquire shares in the Company (although in certain 
circumstances the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to defer vesting 
and to require rights to be exchanged for equivalent rights over the acquiring 
company’s shares).

Emissions and Fleet Vehicles
4.  Purchase of electricity by the Group for its own use (the Group does not purchase heat,  
steam or cooling)
 
In addition to monitoring our environmental impact, we have set environmental 
targets for the next financial year and long-term science based targets that 
include energy, water, waste and travel. More information on these as well as full 
details of emissions and reporting methodology can be found in our CS report.
Political Donations and Expenditure
During the year the Group did not make any political donations to EU or non-EU 
organisations, or incur any political expenditure.
It remains the Company’s policy not to make political donations or to incur 
political expenditure; however, the application of the relevant provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 is potentially very broad in nature and, as last year, the Board 
is seeking shareholder authority to ensure that the Group does not inadvertently 
breach these provisions as a result of the breadth of its business activities, 
although the Board has no intention of using this authority. As with previous years 
the Board is proposing that shareholders pass a resolution at the forthcoming 
AGM to authorise the Group to:
 – make political donations to political parties and independent election 
candidates not exceeding £100,000 in total;
 – make political donations to political organisations other than political parties not 
exceeding £100,000 in total; and
 – incur political expenditure not exceeding £100,000 in total,
provided that in any event the aggregate amount of any such donations and 
expenditure made or incurred by the Group shall not exceed £100,000.
Notwithstanding the Company’s policy not to make political donations, we 
recognise the rights of our employees to participate in the political process. Their 
rights to do so are governed by the applicable laws in the countries in which we 
operate. For example in the US under the Federal Election Campaign Act, US 
employees can establish non-partisan political action committees known as 
“PACs” that encourage voluntary employee participation in the political process. 
PACs are a common feature of the US political system and operate independently 
of any political party or candidate.
Following the divestment of the Russell Investment Management Business on  
1 June 2016, a new PAC was established during the year by one of the Group’s 
other US entities, LSEG US Holdco, Inc.. Consistent with US law, LSEG US Holdco, 
Inc. paid for the PAC’s establishment and administrative expenses; providing such

Governance Directors’ Report Events since the balance sheet date
Acquisition
On 23 February 2018, the Group became committed to acquiring an additional 
2.04% interest in LCH Group Holdings Limited from certain minority shareholders. 
This acquisition will increase the Group’s total stake in LCH Group Holdings Limited 
to 67 .97%. The transaction is expected to complete in early March 2018. Further 
details are provided in Note 34 to the Financial Statements on page 157 .
Disposal of business
On 1 7 January 2018, the Group completed the sale of Exactpro Systems Limited 
and its subsidiaries (Exactpro). The Exactpro business was part of the Technology 
Services segment and was contained within a stand alone cash generating unit. 
Further details are provided in Note 34 to the Financial Statements on page 157 .
Employee Benefit Trust
As at 31 December 201 7 , the trustee of the London Stock Exchange Employee 
Benefit Trust, which is an independent trustee, held 944,495 shares under the 
terms of the trust for the benefit of employees and former employees of the 
Company and its subsidiaries. The trust is a discretionary trust and the shares  
are held to meet employees’ entitlements under the Company’s share plans. 
Employees have no voting rights in relation to the unencumbered shares while 
they are held in trust. The trustee has full discretion to exercise the voting rights 
attaching to the unencumbered shares or to abstain from voting. Shares acquired 
by employees through the Company’s employee share plans rank equally with 
the ordinary shares in issue and have no special rights.
Branches outside the UK
Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have established branches in a number of 
different countries in which they operate.
Financial Risk Management
The use of financial instruments by the Group and the Group’s Financial Risk 
Management have been specifically considered by the Directors, and relevant 
disclosures appear in Principal Risks and Uncertainties, on pages 46–53 of this 
Annual Report, and in the Notes to the Financial Statements, on pages 1 15–161  
of this Annual Report, and in each case are incorporated by reference into this 
Directors’ Report.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
In accordance with Section 4 18(2) of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors 
confirm, in the case of each Director in office at the date the Directors’ Report  
is approved as listed on pages 54–55, that:
 – so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which  
the Company’s auditors are unaware
 – he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director in 
order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information
Financial viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, the Directors confirm that they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to operate and meet 
its liabilities, as they fall due, for the next 3 years. A period of 3 years has been 
chosen for the purpose of this viability statement, in line with the Group’s business 
plan. The Directors’ assessment has been made with reference to the Group’s 
current position and prospects, the Group’s 3 year business plan, the Group’s  
risk appetite and the expected impact of a selected group of severe but plausible 
downside scenarios.
The business plan makes certain assumptions about the performance of the core 
revenue streams and segments, using existing product lines as well as 
assumptions on take up of new product lines, assumptions on appropriate levels 
of investment to support expected performance, known inorganic activity, the 
ability to refinance debt as required, and expected returns to shareholders.
The plan is stress tested using a selected group of severe but plausible downside 
scenarios as determined relevant by the Group Risk Committee, over the full 3 
year plan period. Impacts on the performance of core revenue streams and 
segments are modelled through business inputs, with appropriate mitigating 
factors also considered.
The impact on the Group’s cash-flows, liquidity headroom, and debt covenants  
are detailed throughout the 3 year period in each scenario. No scenario over the  
3 year period leads to a breach in Group covenants or an inability to meet the 
Group’s obligations through insufficient headroom. Further, a reverse stress test 
has been completed, to evaluate the financial impacts required to breach the 
Group Risk Committee’s risk appetite.
FURTHER INFORMATION
Stress testing capabilities are detailed in the Risk 
Management oversight section on page 44.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position and its objectives and policies in 
managing the financial risks to which it is exposed and its capital are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 2–53. The Directors’ statement in relation to going 
concern is set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 99.
Future developments
The Executive Management team monitors future development and market 
trends affecting the Group and its subsidiaries on an ongoing basis. Details of 
these developments and trends and the potential implications for the Group can 
be found in the “Market trends and our response” section of the Annual Report 
(pages 12–15).

98 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Directors’ Report continued The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. The Directors have prepared the Group and Company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and applicable law.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of the 
affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss for that year.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then apply them consistently
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRSs as adopted by the European Union is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the Group and the Company’s financial position and financial performance
 – state whether the Group and the Company financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it  
is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue  
in business
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements  
in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group and the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies 
Act 2006, other applicable laws and regulations, including the requirements of the 
Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. The 
Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the 
Group and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are set out in the Overview and Strategic 
Report sections of the Annual Report on pages 2–53. In particular, the current 
economic conditions continue to pose a number of risks and uncertainties for  
the Group and these are set out in Principal Risks and Uncertainties on page 46.
The Financial Risk Management objectives and policies of the Group and the 
exposure of the Group to capital risk, credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk are 
discussed on pages 49–50. The Group continues to meet Group and individual 
entity capital requirements and day-to-day liquidity needs through the Group’s 
cash resources and available credit facilities. Committed term funding at 31 
December 201 7 was £2,638 million which is committed until October 2019 or 
beyond (2016: £1,903 million), described further in the Financial Review on  
pages 36–4 1.
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into 
account reasonably possible changes in trading performance, which show that  
the Group has sufficient financial resources. On the basis of this review, and after 
making due enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the  
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are set out on pages 54–55  
of this Annual Report confirms that, to the best of their knowledge and belief:
 – the Group and the Company financial statements, which have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
Group taken as a whole;
 – the report of the Directors contained in the Annual Report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the Group taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and
 – they consider that the Annual Report and Accounts 201 7 , taken as a whole, is  
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group and the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.

Overview of our audit approach
Key audit matters
 – Risk that goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
may be impaired
 – Risk of fraud in recognition of revenue in secondary capital 
markets trading, revenue share for clearing arrangements, 
and information services revenue accruals
 – Risk that the acquisition of businesses was accounted  
for incorrectly
 – Risk that the implementation of the Oracle finance 
system could lead to errors in data integrity, 
accounting or financial reporting
Audit scope
 – We performed an audit of the complete financial 
information of 7 components and audit procedures  
on specific balances for a further 18 components.
 – The components where we performed full and specific 
audit procedures accounted for approximately 94% of  
the Group’s revenue, pre-tax profit, adjusted pre-tax profit 
measure used to calculate materiality, and total assets.
Materiality
 – Overall Group materiality is £30.0 million which 
represents 5% of adjusted pre-tax profit from 
continuing operations calculated by including the 
impact of the amortisation of purchased intangible 
assets, but excluding other non-underlying items  
as disclosed in Note 7 of the financial statements.
100 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Independent Auditor’s Report to the members  
of London Stock Exchange Group plc Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and 
include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed  
in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
Risk that goodwill and purchased 
intangible assets may be impaired
Balance of £4.2 billion, prior year 
comparative £3.9 billion
The Group holds significant intangible 
assets on its balance sheet, including 
goodwill, customer relationships, 
brands, software licenses, and 
intellectual property.
We have determined this to be a key 
audit matter due to the quantum  
of the intangible assets as at 31 
December 2017, the involvement of 
significant judgement by management 
on the valuation of the intangible 
assets, and the risk of misstatement 
either due to fraud or error.
On an annual basis, management are 
required to perform an impairment 
assessment for goodwill, and to 
assess for indicators of impairment  
in respect of other intangible assets. 
Where indicators of impairment of 
other intangible assets are identified, 
a full impairment assessment is 
performed. These assessments 
involve significant management 
judgement in the application of 
valuation models and assumptions.
As a consequence, there is a greater 
risk of misstatement in these 
balances, either by fraud or error, 
including through the potential 
override of controls by management.
Refer to the Report of the Audit 
Committee (page 68); Accounting 
policies (page 117); and Notes 3  
and 14 of the Financial Statements 
(pages 125 and 134 to 135)
 
The risk has neither increased nor 
decreased in the current year.
We confirmed our understanding of the impairment assessment 
process and evaluated the design effectiveness of key controls, 
concluding that a substantive audit approach should be adopted.
For 7 material cash generating units (CGU), we examined the cash flow 
forecasts which support management’s impairment assessment and 
tested compliance with the requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of 
Assets’. We assessed the reasonableness of those forecasts and the 
evidence supporting the underlying assumptions, by comparing to 
Board-approved budgets, considering prior periods’ budget accuracy, 
comparing the expected growth rates to relevant market expectations, 
and considering recent market developments including changes in  
tax rates.
In respect of purchased intangible assets, we tested management’s 
assessment as to whether indicators of impairment exist as at the 
balance sheet date, by reference to factors specific to each class of 
assets. Examples included customer retention rates within specific 
business lines and the current returns made on intellectual property.
We tested the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) discount rates 
assigned to each of the CGUs, as well as the long-term growth rates 
(LTGR), with reference to our understanding of the business, 
comparisons to other similar companies and broader market 
considerations.
The WACC discount rates and LTGR applied within each impairment 
model were critically assessed by EY valuation specialists, including 
comparison to economic and industry forecasts where appropriate. 
We considered evidence available to support the WACC discount rates 
and LTGR used, and assessed consistency with findings from other 
areas of the audit.
Together with EY valuation specialists, we assessed specific inputs in 
the determination of the WACC discount rates, including the risk-free 
rate, equity beta and market/size premium, along with gearing and 
cost of debt. We benchmarked the inputs against observed risk rates 
in the markets where the Group operates.
We also performed sensitivity analysis on the cash flow forecasts and 
key inputs (including WACC discount rates, LTGR and customer 
retention rates) to the impairment model, to understand the impact 
that reasonably possible changes to key assumptions would have on 
the overall carrying value of the goodwill and purchased intangible 
assets at the balance sheet date.
We performed recalculation of the amortisation of purchased 
intangible assets, and assessed that the amortisation policy had 
been appropriately applied. We also assessed the appropriateness  
of the remaining amortisation period by comparing management’s 
forecasts against historic data.
We also tested the reasonableness of the translation of non-Sterling 
balances into the Group’s presentation currency.
In addition to the above procedures, we performed overall analytical 
procedures and journal entry testing in order to identify and test the 
risk of misstatement arising from management override of controls.
No material issues were identified when 
executing the audit procedures over the risk  
that goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
may be impaired.
We concluded that the WACC discount rates, 
LTGR, customer retention rates and cash flow 
forecasts used by management in the 
impairment assessment are within a reasonable 
range as at 31 December 2017.
We did not identify any additional factors that 
would lead to a revision of the amortisation 
periods applied for purchased intangible assets.
We concluded that the carrying value of goodwill 
and purchased intangible assets is materially 
correct as at 31 December 2017.
We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in 5 
components, which covered 99.8% of the risk amount.
101 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Governance Independent Auditor’s Report Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
Risk of fraud in recognition  
of revenue in secondary capital 
markets trading, revenue share  
for clearing arrangements,  
and information services  
revenue accruals
Balance of £0.5 billion, prior year 
comparative £0.5 billion
Compensation tied to the performance 
of the entity may create an incentive 
for management to manipulate results.
We have determined this to be a key 
audit matter having identified 3 
revenue streams with heightened  
risk of misstatement:
 – Secondary capital markets revenue 
(for certain business lines) involves 
multiple pricing structures based  
on product types, customer activity 
and volumes. This complexity leads 
to a heightened risk that revenue 
may not be recognised appropriately, 
either as a result of fraud, or error.
 – Contracts relating to revenue sharing 
in respect of clearing arrangements, 
between the Group’s central 
counterparty (CCPs) and third party 
participants, in some cases, involve 
complex calculations to determine 
the appropriate level of revenue to 
recognise within the Group.
 – Information services revenue 
accruals can require estimation,  
for instance based on prior billings 
or preliminary usage.
As a consequence, there is a greater 
risk of misstatement in these 
balances, either by fraud or error, 
including through the potential 
override of controls by management.
Refer to the Report of the Audit 
Committee (page 68); Accounting 
policies (page 116); and Note 4  
of the Financial Statements  
(pages 125 to 127)
The risk has neither increased nor 
decreased in the current year.
We confirmed our understanding of the secondary capital markets 
trading, revenue share clearing arrangements and information 
services revenue accruals processes. On the secondary capital 
markets trading process, we performed testing of the operating 
effectiveness of key controls in 1 full scope component and 
concluded that a substantive audit approach should be adopted  
in other components that are in scope. We tested the operating 
effectiveness of key controls in revenue share clearing arrangement 
process. We adopted a substantive audit approach in relation  
to the information services revenue accruals process. 
We considered whether the Group’s revenue recognition policy is 
appropriate and in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.  
We performed testing on a sample basis to gain assurance that the 
selected contracts were accounted for in accordance with the policy.
We performed overall analytical procedures and journal entry testing 
in order to identify and test the risk of misstatement arising from 
management override of controls.
We performed substantive and transactional testing, including the 
assessment of debit balances, and unusual items and trends.
We also performed cut-off testing to gain assurance that revenue  
was recognised in the correct period. We selected transactions on  
a sample basis before and after the year end to test the 
appropriateness of revenue recognition.
Secondary capital markets trading
We increased our standard sample size for transactional testing by  
at least 1.5 times according to our statistical sampling methodology,  
to respond to the risk of fraud. We agreed a random selection of 
transactions back to supporting audit evidence, such as invoices and 
cash receipts. Where appropriate, we also recalculated the fee charged 
and checked back to the pricing policy and relevant tariff schedule.
We reconciled trading platform data to the general ledger and tested 
material topside adjustments.
We also used analytical tools to identify outliers in high volumes  
of transactional data for focused follow-up testing. This analysis 
included comparing the fee per transaction to volume (notional) 
traded and investigating any particularly high values which were 
outliers to the overall population.
Revenue share for clearing arrangements
We tested revenue sharing calculations for all material business lines 
on a sample basis and checked for consistency with the underlying 
contracts.
We also used analytical tools in the analysis of the related revenue 
streams. This included analysing monthly trading volumes and their 
correlation with monthly revenue recognised; any anomalies 
identified were investigated.
Information services revenue accruals
We selected a sample of revenue accruals using a lower testing 
threshold when compared to our standard transaction testing 
approach. For the selected samples, we obtained supporting 
evidence, including customer input/consent, for accrued amounts.
For revenue based on assets under management (AUM), we tested the 
calculations on a sample basis and checked back to the supporting 
agreements. We also validated the AUM used in the calculations to  
an independent third party source.
For Q4 accruals, we tested the appropriateness of using Q3 
information for purposes of the year end accruals, and performed 
corroborative testing.
No material issues were identified from the 
execution of our audit procedures over the risk 
of fraud in recognition of revenue in secondary 
capital markets trading, revenue share for 
clearing arrangements, and information services 
revenue accruals.
We concluded that the revenue recognised related 
to secondary capital markets trading, revenue 
share for clearing arrangements, and information 
services revenue accruals for the year ended  
31 December 2017 is materially correct.
We performed full and specific scope audit procedures over this risk 
area in 8 components, which covered 99.3% of the risk amount.
102 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Independent Auditor’s Report to the members  
of London Stock Exchange Group plc continued Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
Risk that the acquisition  
of businesses was accounted  
for incorrectly
Net assets acquired £355 million
The Group undertook 2 significant 
acquisitions in the current year:
 – Mergent Inc.; and
 – The Yield Book and Citi Fixed 
Income Indices.
The acquired entities were 
consolidated into the Group’s results 
from the date of acquisition.
We have determined this to be a  
key audit matter due to the size of  
the acquisitions and the judgement 
involved in determining the fair  
value of the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed.
There is a risk of error in:
 – The appropriate accounting for  
the acquisitions, including the 
significant judgement involved  
in the determination of goodwill  
and purchased intangible assets;
 – The completeness and accuracy of 
disclosures relating specifically to 
the transactions, but also in respect 
of the impact of new business lines 
on pre-existing disclosures; and
 – The conversion of the financial 
performance of the components 
from United States Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles  
(US GAAP) to IFRS as adopted  
by the EU.
Refer to the Report of the Audit 
Committee (page 68); Accounting 
policies (page 115); and Note 30  
of the Financial Statements (pages 
152 to 153)
This is a new risk this year. Our audit 
approach and assessment of key 
areas of audit focus changes in 
response to circumstances affecting 
the Group.
We confirmed our understanding of the business acquisition process 
and assessed the design effectiveness of key controls, concluding 
that a substantive audit approach should be adopted.
We inspected the final signed sale and purchase agreements (SAPA) 
and agreed the purchase consideration to the SAPA and 
the cash payments to the bank statements.
We assessed the accounting of the business combinations for 
compliance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’.
We tested the book values of acquired assets and liabilities assumed, 
performing substantive audit procedures on material balances as at 
the acquisition date.
Management engaged a third-party firm to perform the intangible 
assets fair value calculations and associated purchase price 
allocation. We assessed the competency of the firm and, together 
with EY technical and valuation specialists, examined and challenged 
key inputs into the intangible assets fair value calculations and 
purchase price allocations, including the deal model, deal value,  
the discount rates used, performance forecasts and the remaining 
useful lives of the intangible assets identified.
Together with EY valuation specialists, we assessed the 
appropriateness of the amounts recognised in respect of goodwill  
and purchased intangible assets, such as brands and customer 
relationships, benchmarking to similar market participants.
Together with EY valuation and tax specialists, we assessed whether 
the changes in the US tax law that occurred as part of the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act of 2017 had an impact on the valuation of amounts 
recognised as goodwill and purchased intangible assets as at the 
acquisition date.
We assessed the appropriateness of tax-related components from  
the acquisitions, specifically over the opening balance sheet and 
purchase price allocations.
We tested the presentation and disclosures in the financial statements.
No material issues were identified from the 
execution of our audit procedures over the  
risk that the acquisition of businesses was 
accounted for incorrectly.
We concluded that the accounting and the 
related disclosures of the acquisition of Mergent 
Inc. and The Yield Book and Citi Fixed Income 
Indices are materially correct.
We performed full scope audit procedures on the 2 material 
acquisitions completed in the year which covered 100% of the risk.
103 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Governance Independent Auditor’s Report Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
Risk that the implementation of 
the Oracle finance system could 
lead to errors in data integrity, 
accounting or financial reporting
We have determined this to be a key 
audit matter as the implementation 
of a new finance system could lead to 
errors in data integrity, accounting or 
financial reporting.
The general ledger for LCH Group 
(excluding LCH S.A.) was migrated  
to Oracle in January 2017, whilst the 
general ledger for LSEG US Holdco Inc. 
was migrated in May 2017.
Refer to the Report of the Audit 
Committee (page 68).
The risk has neither increased nor 
decreased in the current year.
We confirmed our understanding of the implementation of the 
Oracle finance system, including confirming our understanding  
of the relevant processes pre and post Oracle implementation.
We assessed the following areas of the migration project:
 – Governance – verification of approvals at different stages of the 
project and meeting minute reviews;
 – Data conversion – evaluation of data migration and conversion 
procedures, and verification of approvals for data migration;
 – Migration procedures – inspection of documentation for data 
migration procedures, evaluation of migration plan and 
execution against the plan;
 – System interface – inspection of documentation around the 
process flows and understanding the data flows into Oracle; and
 – Access review – inspection of documentation confirming  
initial load of users and testing of IT general controls over  
user administration processes.
We performed audit procedures over the migrated data in the  
new system to the data in the previous general ledgers, including:
 – Reconciliation of FY2017 opening balances to the audited 
FY2016 closing balances;
 – Substantive testing of the data which was migrated into the new 
general ledger, including reconciliation of transactions listings from 
the new system with those from the previous general ledgers; and
 – Testing of manual adjustments related to migration of the data 
(including those related to duplication of data and its manual reversal).
We inspected the chart of accounts and validated the mapping 
from the legacy ledgers, to Oracle, as well as from Oracle to the 
Group consolidation tool.
Our testing identified exceptions in respect of 
certain IT general controls; these exceptions have 
been mitigated by testing relevant compensating 
controls which were concluded as effective and by 
performing additional substantive audit procedures. 
As a result, we concluded that we are able to place 
reliance on the Oracle finance system.
We concluded that there were no material errors  
in the financial statements as a result of the 
implementation of the Oracle finance system  
in respect of LCH Group (excluding LCH S.A.)  
and LSEG US Holdco Inc.
We performed audit procedures in 2 full scope components that 
implemented the Oracle system during 2017.
 
In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a key audit matter in relation to the risk that the divestment of the Russell Investment Management business was 
accounted for incorrectly. This matter is not relevant in the current year as the divestment occurred in 2016.

An overview of the scope of our audit
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation  
of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity within  
the Group. Taken together, these enable us to form an opinion on the Group 
financial statements. We take into account the size, risk profile, the organisation  
of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business 
environment, and other factors, such as recent Internal Audit findings, when 
assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, 
and to make sure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts 
in the financial statements, of the 88 reporting components of the Group, we 
selected 25 components covering entities headquartered within the United 
Kingdom, United States of America, Italy, France and Sri Lanka, which represent 
the principal business units within the Group.
Of the 25 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial 
information of 7 components (full scope components) which were selected based 
on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining 18 components (specific 
scope components), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within 
each component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on 
the significant accounts in the financial statements, either because of the size of 
these accounts or their risk profile.

The components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 99%  
(2016: 99%) of the Group’s revenue, 97% (2016: 98%) of the Group’s pre-tax profit, 
94% (2016: 99%) of the Group’s adjusted pre-tax profit measure used to calculate 
materiality, and 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s total assets.
For the current year, the full scope components contributed 93% (2016: 92%)  
of the Group’s revenue, 70% (2016: 92%) of the Group’s pre-tax profit, 72% (2016: 
89%) of the Group’s adjusted pre-tax profit measure used to calculate materiality, 
and 100% (2016: 99%) of the Group’s total assets.
The specific scope components contributed 6% (2016: 7%) of the Group’s revenue, 
27% (2016: 6%) of the Group’s pre-tax profit, 22% (2016: 10%) of the Group’s 
adjusted pre-tax profit measure used to calculate materiality, and less than 1 % 
(2016: 1 %) of the Group’s total assets. The audit scope of these components may 
not have included testing of all significant accounts of the components but will 
have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group.
The remaining 63 components together represent less than 6% of the Group’s 
revenue, pre-tax profit, adjusted pre-tax profit and total assets. For these 
components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review and 
testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations, to respond to 
any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.
The charts below illustrate the coverage obtained from the work performed  
by our audit teams.
105 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Governance Independent Auditor’s Report Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the 
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining 
the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined overall materiality for the Group to be £30.0 million (2016: £23.3 
million), which is 5% (2016: 5%) of adjusted pre-tax profit from continuing 
operations calculated by including the impact of the amortisation of purchased 
intangible assets, but excluding other non-underlying items as disclosed in Note 7 
of the financial statements.
We determined overall materiality for the parent company to be £5.6 million 
(2016: £4.8 million), which is based on the allocated performance materiality for 
purposes of the Group audit. The allocated performance materiality is based on 
the relative scale and risk of the parent company to the Group as a whole, and our 
assessment of the risk of misstatement at the parent company.
We consider the basis of our materiality to be one of the important considerations 
for shareholders of the Company in assessing the financial performance of the 
Group. It is linked to the key earnings measures discussed when the Group 
presents the financial results. In addition to non-underlying items, the Group also 
excludes amortisation of purchased intangibles to present adjusted operating 
profit; this amount is not excluded from our materiality calculation.
Our overall materiality threshold provided a basis for determining the nature, 
timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the 
risk of material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of 
further audit procedures. Our evaluation of materiality requires professional 
judgement and necessarily takes into account qualitative as well as quantitative 
considerations implicit in the definition.
Starting basis – £564 million
 – Profit before tax from continuing operations
Adjustments – £33 million
 – Non-underlying items, mostly costs related to the 
acquisition of Mergent Inc. and The Yield Book and Citi 
Fixed Income Indices, and the ongoing restructuring  
of LCH and integration of the acquired businesses
Adjusted  
basis
 – £597 million
 – Adjusted profit before tax from continuing operations, but 
including amortisation of purchased intangible assets
Materiality – Materiality of £30 million (5% of materiality basis)
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and made 
adjustments based on the final financial performance of the Group.
Changes from the prior year
In the prior year, we identified 7 full scope components. As a result of the 
divestment of the Russell Investment Management business in the prior year,  
we separately scoped in LSEG US Holdco Inc. (Index) and LSEG US Holdco Inc. 
(Investment Management) as 2 full scope components. Further, LCH.Clearnet 
Group Limited was scoped in as 1 full scope component in the prior year; in  
the current year, we separated this into 2 full scope components: LCH Limited, 
which was audited by the EY primary team, and LCH S.A., which was jointly 
audited by EY Paris and BDO Paris.
All other full scope components remained consistent. Specific scope components 
have been re-assessed as the contribution of these smaller parts of the business 
to the Group financial statements varies each year.
Involvement with component teams
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type  
of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the 
primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global 
network firms or other firms operating under our instruction.
Of the 7 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 4 of  
these directly by the primary audit team. For the 3 full scope and 1 specific  
scope components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we 
determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that 
sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the 
Group as a whole.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has 
been designed to make sure that the Senior Statutory Auditor visits the principal 
locations of the Group.
During the current year’s audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the Senior 
Statutory Auditor and/or other senior members of the primary audit team to 
the following locations:
Component Location Scope
Number  
of visits
London Stock Exchange 
Group Holdings Italy S.p.A. Milan, Italy Full 2
LSEG US Holdco Inc. New York,  
United States of America Full 1
LCH S.A. Paris, France Full 2
Millennium Information 
Technologies (Private) 
Limited Colombo, Sri Lanka Specific 1
These visits involved discussing the audit approach with the component team and 
any issues arising from their work, as well as meeting with local management. In 
addition, we participated in planning and closing meetings and reviewed selected 
key audit working papers. The primary audit team interacted regularly with the 
component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit and were 
responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. This, together with the 
additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for 
our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in 
evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming  
our audit opinion.
106 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Independent Auditor’s Report to the members  
of London Stock Exchange Group plc continued Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set 
at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the 
aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s 
overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality  
was 50% (2016: 50%) of our overall materiality, namely £15.0 million (2016: £1 1.7 
million). We have set performance materiality at this percentage (which is the 
lowest in the range) due to misstatements which were identified in the prior year 
audit. Our approach is designed to have a reasonable probability of ensuring that 
the total of uncorrected and undetected misstatements does not exceed our 
overall materiality of £30.0 million (2016: £23.3 million) for the Group financial 
statements as a whole.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over 
significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage  
of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each 
component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group  
as a whole, and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.
In the current year, the performance materiality allocated to components was  
as follows:
Component
Allocated performance 
materiality
London Stock Exchange Group plc £2.8m
London Stock Exchange plc £7.7m
LCH Limited £6.3m
LCH S.A. £4.2m

An amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be  
clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we report to them all uncorrected audit 
differences in excess of £1.0 million (2016: £0.5 million), as well as differences below 
that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. This is 
less than the threshold of 5% of overall materiality that we would typically use.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative 
measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative 
considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report  
set out on pages 2 to 99 including the Strategic Report (including Highlights, 
Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s statement, What we do – our business 
model, Overview of Group activities, Market trends and our response, Strategy in 
action, Segmental review, Our wider responsibility, Financial review, Risk 
management oversight, and Principal risks and uncertainties), Governance 
information and disclosures (including Board of Directors, Corporate Governance, 
Complying with the provisions of the Code, Report of the Nomination Committee, 
Report of the Audit Committee, Report of Risk Committee, Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, Directors’ Report and Statement of Directors’ responsibilities), other than 
the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are 
responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is  
to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, 
we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the 
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.  
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to 
specifically address the following items in the other information and to report as 
uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude 
that those items meet the following conditions:
 – Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 99 – the statement given  
by the directors that they consider the Annual Report and financial statements 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or
 – Audit Committee reporting set out on pages 65 to 69 – the section describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or
 – Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set 
out on pages 56, 62 to 63 and 95 – the parts of the directors’ statement which 
are required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by 
the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2), do not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited  
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for  
the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent 
company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to  
which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
107 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Governance Independent Auditor’s Report  – the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out  
on page 99, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for  
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing 
the Group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the 
Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable  
of detecting irregularities, including fraud
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are: to identify and assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement 
due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to 
respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit. 
However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests 
with both those charged with governance of the entity and management.
Our approach was as follows:
 – We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are 
applicable to the Group have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial 
statements. We determined that the most significant are the UK Companies Act 
2006, UK Corporate Governance Code 2016, The Financial Conduct Authority’s 
(FCA) Listing Rules, other relevant FCA rules and regulations, and tax legislation 
(governed by HM Revenue and Customs).
 – We understood how the Group complies with these legal and regulatory 
frameworks by making enquiries of senior management, including the Group 
General Counsel, the Chief Risk Officer, the Head of Compliance and the Group 
Head of Internal Audit. We also reviewed significant correspondence between 
the Group and regulatory bodies, reviewed minutes of the Board, Risk 
Committee and Executive Committee, and gained an understanding of the 
Group’s approach to governance, demonstrated by the Board’s approval of the 
Group’s governance framework and the Board’s review of the Group’s risk 
management framework and internal control processes.
 – We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material 
misstatement, including how fraud might occur, by considering the controls 
that the Group has established to address risks identified by the Group, or  
that otherwise seek to prevent, deter or detect fraud. We also considered 
performance and incentive plan targets and their potential to influence 
management to manage earnings or influence the perceptions of investors.
 – Based on this understanding, we designed our audit procedures to identify 
non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in the paragraphs 
above. Our procedures involved inquiries of senior management, legal counsel,  
the compliance officer and internal audit, review of significant correspondence 
with regulatory bodies and minutes of meetings of the Board and Board 
committees, and focused testing, as referred to in the Key Audit Matters  
section above.
 – The Group operates in the exchange and CCP industries which are regulated 
environments. As such, the Senior Statutory Auditor reviewed the experience 
and expertise of the engagement team to ensure that the team had the 
appropriate competence and capabilities, which included the use of experts 
where appropriate.
 – The FCA has regulatory oversight over London Stock Exchange plc and certain 
other entities within the Group. The Bank of England (BOE) supervises CCPs in the 
UK and therefore regulates LCH Limited. In addition, local regulatory bodies in 
France and Italy regulate other subsidiaries of the Group, including: LCH S.A. which 
is regulated by L ’ Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) and US 
Commodity Futures T rading Commission (CFTC); and Borsa Italiana S.p.A., Cassa 
Di Compensazione e Garanzia S.p.A. (CC&G) and Monte Titoli S.p.A. which are all 
regulated by Commissione Nazionale per la Società e la Borsa and Banca d’Italia.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements is located on the FRC’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required to address
 – We were appointed by the Company on 12 June 2014 to audit the financial 
statements for the 9 months period ended 31 December 2014 and subsequent 
financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement including 
previous renewals and reappointments is 4 years, covering the 9 months  
period ended 31 December 2014 to the year ended 31 December 201 7 .
 – The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group or the parent company and we remain independent  
of the Group and the parent company in conducting the audit.
 – The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.

not engage in any share buyback programmes in 2016

1.  During the year, the Company completed a £199 million share buyback programme, purchasing 5.5 million of its own shares from the market and subsequently transferred 1.8 million treasury shares to 
the Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy the vesting of the Group’s various share schemes. Total costs directly attributable to the share buyback programme amounted to £2 million. The Company did not 
engage in any share buyback programmes in 2016
The notes on pages 1 15 to 161 form an integral part of these financial statements.
Employee share scheme expenses of the Company include movement in the fair value of loan balances with the Employee Benefit Trust of £(1) million (2016: £(9) 
million), costs relating to the issue of own shares for employee share schemes of £(3) million (2016: £(1) million), subscriptions received on the vesting of employee

The merger reserve of £1,305 million (2016: £1,305 million) is a potentially distributable reserve arising on consolidation when the Company issued shares as part of  
the consideration to acquire subsidiary companies. 
The capital redemption reserve of £5 14 million (2016: £5 14 million) is a non-distributable reserve set up as a result of a court approved capital reduction. 
114 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Statements of changes in equity continued Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations 
and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from discontinued 
operations in the income statement. Comparatives are also re-presented to 
reclassify disposed businesses or held for sale businesses which meet the criteria 
for discontinued operations.
Investments in subsidiary companies’ shares, loans and other contributions are 
recognised at cost. These are reviewed for impairment when events indicate the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable and are accounted for in the Company’s 
financial statements at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
The Company is a public company, incorporated and domiciled in England  
and Wales. The address of its registered office is 10 Paternoster Square,  
London, EC4M 7LS.
Recent accounting developments
The following amendments were endorsed by the EU during the year and have 
been adopted in these financial statements:
 – Amendment to IAS 7 , ‘Statement of cash flows’ on changes in liabilities arising 
from financing activities
 – Amendment to IAS 12, ‘Income taxes’ on recognition of deferred tax assets for 
unrealised losses
The adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the results  
of the Group; however additional disclosure in relation to cash flows arising from 
financing activities is now provided in Note 28.
The following standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRIC, 
but have not been adopted either because they were not endorsed by the EU at  
31 December 201 7 or they are not yet mandatory and the Group has chosen not 
to early adopt. The Group plans to adopt these standards and interpretations when 
they become effective. The impact on the Group’s financial statements of the 
future standards, amendments and interpretations is still under review, and where 
appropriate, a description of the impact of certain standards and amendments is 
provided below:
International accounting standards and interpretations Effective date
Amendment to IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payment’ on classification 
and measurement of share-based payment transactions 1 January 2018
Amendment to IFRS 4, ‘Insurance contracts’ regarding the 
implementation of IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ 1 January 2018
Amendments to IAS 40, ‘Transfers of Investment Property’ 1 January 2018
IFRIC 22, ‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance 
Consideration’ 1 January 2018
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ on classification and 
measurement and amendments regarding general  
hedge accounting 1 January 2018
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ 1 January 2018
IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ 1 January 2019
IFRIC 23, ‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’ 1 January 2019
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ introduces new accounting 
principles for revenue recognition for all types of sales of goods or services. It is 
effective for the year ending 31 December 2018 and as a result the Group will 
adopt IFRS 15 in both the interim and annual 2018 financial statements. IFRS 15 
provides a single, principles-based 5 step model to be applied to all sales 
contracts, based on the transfer of control of goods and services to customers, 
and replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts 
currently included in IAS 1 1 ‘Construction Contracts’ and IAS 18 ‘Revenue’. 
Based on the Group’s assessment, the key areas of judgement expected on initial 
adoption of IFRS 15 are in relation to the timing of revenue recognition for services 
provided. The Group continues to assess the impact the new standard will have on 
the Group’s future financially reported position and performance.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ is effective for the year ending 31 December 2018 
and will simplify the classification of financial assets for measurement purposes. 
The implementation of IFRS 9 will not have a significant impact on the results of 
the Group. 
1. Basis of preparation and accounting policies
The Group’s consolidated and the Company’s financial statements are prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations endorsed by the European 
Union (EU), and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial 
statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to  
all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as 
modified by the revaluation of assets and liabilities held at fair value and on the 
basis of the Group’s accounting policies.
The Group uses a columnar format for the presentation of its consolidated income 
statement. This enables the Group to aid the reader’s understanding of its results 
by presenting profit for the year before any non-underlying items. Non-
underlying items include amortisation of purchased intangible assets and other 
income or expenses not considered to drive the operating results of the Group. 
This is the profit measure used to calculate adjusted earnings per share. Profit 
before non-underlying items is reconciled to profit before taxation on the face  
of the income statement. 
The Group consolidated income statement includes an additional performance 
measure for the year ended 31 December 201 7 . Earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is included on the face of the income 
statement to further assist users in understanding the financial performance  
of the Group. The results for the year ended 31 December 2016 have been 
re-presented accordingly. There is no impact on the previously reported profit for 
the year as a result of this change. Additionally, the Group consolidated financial 
statements have changed its reporting from 1 decimal place to whole numbers.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the 
Company and its subsidiary companies with all inter-company balances and 
transactions eliminated, together with the Group’s attributable share of the results 
of associates. The results of subsidiary companies sold or acquired in the period 
are included in the income statement up to, or from, the date that control passes. 
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the investee.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s income 
statement has not been included in these financial statements. 
The acquisition of subsidiary companies is accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, 
and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the 
acquiree. Upon completion of the Group’s fair value exercise, comparatives are 
revised up to 12 months after the acquisition date, for the final fair value 
adjustments. Further details are provided in Note 30. Adjustments to fair values 
include those made to bring accounting policies into line with those of the Group.
The Group applies a policy of treating transactions with non-controlling interests 
through the economic entity model. Transactions with non-controlling interests 
are recognised in equity. Where the non-controlling interest has an option to 
dispose of their holding to the Group, then the amounts potentially due are 
recognised at their fair value at the balance sheet date.
A disposal group qualifies as a discontinued operation if it is a component of an 
entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale and:
a. represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of 
operations;
b. is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of 
business or geographic area of operations; or
c. is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

Group financial statements Notes to the financial statements
Notes to the financial statements IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is effective for the year ending 31 December 2019 and will require 
all leases to be recognised on the balance sheet. Currently, IAS 1 7 ‘Leases’ only 
requires leases categorised as finance leases to be recognised on the balance 
sheet, with leases categorised as operating leases not recognised. In broad terms, 
the impact will be to recognise a lease liability and corresponding asset for the 
operating lease commitments set out in Note 31.
Accounting policies
Income Statement
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable 
and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal 
course of business, net of discounts, value added tax and other sales related taxes.
Revenue is recognised in the period when the service or supply is provided. The 
sources of revenue are:
a. Maintenance contracts, membership and other fees – revenue is recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the period to which the fee relates;
b. Admission fees – revenue is recognised at the time of admission to trading;
c. Clearing fee income and rebates, together with other fee income and net 
settlement fees, are recognised on a transaction by transaction basis, or in 
cases where there is a fixed annual fee, monthly in arrears, in accordance  
with the Group’s fee scales;
d. Royalties – revenue is recognised at the date at which they are earned or 
measurable with certainty;
e. IT products – where there is no significant service obligation the revenue is 
recognised upon delivery and acceptance of the software or hardware by the 
customer, in other circumstances revenue is recognised on provision of 
contracted services;
f. IT solutions – where software is sold requiring significant modification, 
integration or customisation, the consideration is allocated between the 
different elements on a fair value basis. Revenue is recognised using a 
percentage of completion method. The stage of completion is determined by 
reference to the costs incurred to date as a proportion of the total estimated 
costs or the services performed to date as a percentage of total services to be 
performed;
g. Software and Licence fees – revenue is recognised when the performance 
under the contract has occurred and the revenue has been earned; and
h. Other – all other revenue is recognised in the month in which the service is 
provided. The Borsa Italiana Group defers some of the income received from 
cash trading and FTSE MIB futures trading and clearing. This deferral results in 
revenues being recognised at the average price of transactions forecast for the 
full year, as pricing levels reduce during the year when incremental volume 
targets are achieved.
Net treasury income
Income recognised through the CCP clearing business includes net treasury 
income earned on margin and default funds, held as part of the risk management 
process, and is shown separately from the Group revenues. Net treasury income is 
the result of interest earned on cash assets lodged with the clearing house, less 
interest paid to the members on their initial margin and default fund 
contributions. Net treasury income is shown separately on the face of the income 
statement to distinguish this income stream from revenues arising from the 
Group’s other activities and provides the reader with a greater understanding of 
the operating activities of the Group. Where negative interest rates apply, the 
Group recognises interest paid on cash assets as a net treasury expense and 
interest received on clearing member’s margin as net treasury income.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales comprises data and licence fees, data feed costs, expenses incurred 
in respect of revenue share arrangements and costs incurred in the MillenniumIT 
business that are directly attributable to the construction and delivery of 
customers’ goods or services, and any other costs linked and directly incurred to 
generate revenues and provide services to customers.
Revenue share expenses presented within cost of sales relate to arrangements 
with customers where the revenue share payment is not limited to the amount  
of revenues receivable from the specific customer.
Non-underlying items
Items of income and expense that are material by size and/or nature and are  
not considered to be incurred in the normal course of business are classified as 
non-underlying items on the face of the income statement within their relevant 
category. The separate reporting of these items together with amortisation of 
purchased intangible assets helps give an indication of the Group’s sustainable 
performance. Non-underlying items are disclosed in Note 7 .
Pension costs
The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. 
For the defined benefit schemes the service cost, representing benefits accruing 
to employees, is included as an operating expense. The interest cost and expected 
return on plan assets is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined 
benefit liability or asset at the start of each annual reporting period. Actuarial 
gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, changes in actuarial 
assumptions or differences between actual and expected returns on assets are 
recognised at each period end net of tax in the statement of comprehensive 
income. The net asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the 
difference between the present value of pension obligations and the fair value of 
scheme assets. For defined contribution schemes, the expense is charged to the 
income statement as incurred.
Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of equity settled share-based compensation plans 
for employees. The charge to the income statement is determined by the fair 
value of the options granted or shares awarded at the date of grant and recognised 
over the relevant vesting period. 
Foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the 
Company’s presentation and functional currency. Foreign currency transactions 
are converted into the functional currency using the rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the settlement of 
such transactions and from the translation at year-end rates of monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income 
statement. Translation differences on non-monetary items, such as equities 
held at fair value through profit or loss, are reported as part of their fair value  
gain or loss. Exceptions to this are where the non-monetary items form part 
of the net investment in a foreign operation or are designated as hedges of a  
net investment, or as cash flow hedges. Such exchange differences are initially 
recognised in equity.
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional 
currency different from the presentation currency are converted into the 
presentation currency as follows:
a. assets and liabilities including goodwill, purchased intangible assets and fair 
value adjustments are converted at the closing balance sheet rate;
b. income and expenses are translated and recorded in the income statement  
at the rate prevailing at the date of the transaction; and
c. all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component  
of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net 
investment in foreign operations, and of borrowing and other currency 
instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ 
equity. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange 
differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement 
as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Finance income and expense
Finance income and expense comprise interest earned on cash deposited with 
financial counterparties and interest paid on borrowings which reflect the agreed 
market-based or contractual rate for each transaction undertaken during the 
financial period, and calculated using the effective interest rate method. 
116 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017 In conditions where negative interest rates apply, the Group recognises interest 
paid on cash deposits as an expense and interest received on liabilities as income.
Recurring fees and charges levied on committed bank facilities, the cash 
management transactions and the payment services provided by the Group’s 
banks, are charged to the income statement as accrued. Credit facility 
arrangement fees are capitalised and then amortised back to the income 
statement over the term of the facility subject to projected utilisation. Fees and 
charges are included within other finance costs.
Fair value gains and losses on financial instruments include the movement in the 
market valuations of derivative instruments held as fair value hedges.
Balance Sheet
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are included in the financial statements at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings, fixed plant and plant and equipment 
are depreciated to residual value on a straight line basis over the estimated useful 
economic lives of the assets which are as follows:
a. Freehold buildings – 30 to 50 years;
b. Fixed plant – 3 to 20 years; and
c. Plant and equipment – 3 to 15 years.
Leasehold properties and improvements are included at cost and depreciated to 
residual value over the shorter of the period of the lease or the useful economic life 
of the asset.
Investment in associates
An associate is a company over which the Group has significant influence. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the company, but is not control nor joint control over those policies.  
The Group’s investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
The Company accounts for its investments in associates at cost, less any 
impairments recognised through the income statement.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are 
retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under 
operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis. 
Lease incentives are spread over the term of the lease.
The Group leases certain plant and equipment and licences where the Group has 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. These are classified as finance 
leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower  
of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments.
Each lease payment is apportioned between the finance charge and the liability 
so as to achieve a constant interest rate on the finance balance outstanding. Plant 
and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of 
the useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Intangible assets
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling 
interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of 
the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has 
correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and 
reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the 
acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of 
net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is 
recognised in profit or loss.
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the assets and 
liabilities acquired. These may include brand names, customer and supplier 
relationships, software licences and intellectual property, all of which are recorded 
as intangible assets and held at cost less accumulated amortisation. These assets 
are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives which are as 
follows:
a. Customer and supplier relationships – 2 to 25 years (material assets are 
amortised over a life exceeding 15 years);
b. Brand names – 10 to 25 years (material assets are amortised over a life of  
25 years); and
c. Software licences and intellectual property – 2 to 25 years (the majority of 
material assets are amortised over a life not exceeding 5 years).
The useful economic lives are based on management’s best estimates such as 
attrition rates on customer relationships, product upgrade cycles for software and 
technology assets, market participant perspective for brands and pace of change 
of regulation for business.
Third party software costs for the development and implementation of systems 
which enhance the services provided by the Group are capitalised and amortised 
over their estimated useful economic lives of 3 to 5 years.
Internal product development expenditure is capitalised if the costs can be 
reliably measured, the product or process is technically and commercially 
feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group has sufficient 
resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset. The assets are 
recorded at cost including labour, directly attributable costs and any third party 
expenses, and amortised over their useful economic lives of 3 to 7 years.
Intangible assets are assessed for any indicators of impairment at each balance 
sheet date. Where indicators of impairment for a particular intangible asset are 
identified, a full impairment assessment is performed, with any diminution in value 
recognised in the income statement. For assets with an indefinite useful life a full 
impairment assessment is performed annually. When performing any impairment 
assessment, in addition to considering matters particular to the relevant Group 
business area, management evaluates the overall value of the asset from the 
perspective of a market participant. Accordingly, any reduction in value recorded 
represents the Group’s view of the market fair value of the intangible asset.
Current and non-current classification
Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, cash and cash 
equivalents, and assets expected to be realised within 1 year from the reporting 
date, or intended for trade or consumption and realised in the course of the 
Group’s operating cycle. All other assets are classified as non-current assets.
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes, liabilities 
expected to be settled in the course of the Group’s operating cycle and those 
liabilities due within 1 year from the reporting date. All other liabilities are 
classified as non-current liabilities.
Current and deferred taxation
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted  
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the 
Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Full provision is made, using the liability method, for temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts 
in the financial statements. Deferred taxation is determined using tax rates that 
are substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply 
when the asset is realised or liability settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent it is probable that they will be recoverable against future taxable profits.
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities (non-CCP businesses)
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value 
through profit or loss, available for sale or loans and receivables. The classification 
of the Group’s financial assets depends on the purpose for which the financial 
assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial 
assets at initial recognition.
117 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Group financial statements Notes to the financial statements a.  Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for 
liquidity purposes that are initially recognised at fair value and any subsequent 
changes in fair value are recognised directly in the income statement. These 
assets are financial instruments not designated as hedges.
b.  Available for sale financial assets
Investments (other than term deposits and interests in joint ventures, associates 
and subsidiary companies) are designated as available for sale and are recorded 
on trade date at fair value plus transaction costs, with subsequent changes in fair 
value recognised in equity. Cumulative fair value gains or losses on an asset are 
recycled through the income statement when the asset is derecognised. Assets 
such as shares in clearing and payment transmission operations and long-term 
equity investments that do not qualify as associates or joint ventures are usually 
classified as available for sale.
c.  Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and comprise 
trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents. They are included in 
current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the 
balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash-flows from the 
assets has expired, or has been transferred, and the Group has transferred 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. 
d.  Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified at initial recognition as either financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss or financial liabilities at amortised cost. Financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit and loss include CCP financial liabilities (see 
below) and other non-current liabilities. Financial liabilities at amortised cost 
include trade and other payables, borrowings and provisions.
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities at amortised cost are measured 
using the effective interest rate method, with gains and losses recognised in finance 
income and expense respectively. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial assets and liabilities of the central counterparty (CCP) and 
clearing businesses
The Group has adopted the settlement date as the reference date for recognising 
financial assets and liabilities in the CCP businesses.
a.  Derivative or equity trading assets and liabilities
These transactions are initially recorded at fair value, and are subsequently 
marked to market every day with the movement recognised in the income 
statement. Since the asset and liability positions of the CCP are matched, the 
same amount is recorded for both the assets and liabilities and no net fair value 
gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.
b.  Repurchase transactions (repos) trading assets and liabilities
These balances represent repurchase transactions (repos) novated by clearing 
members to the Group’s clearing and guarantee service. They represent the value 
of transactions already settled spot and not yet settled at term. These transactions 
are all initially recognised at fair value and are either revalued through profit or loss 
at fair value or are subsequently measured at amortised cost, depending on the 
terms and conditions set out the Rulebook of the CCP business.
c.  Other receivables from and payables to clearing members and default funds
These comprise accounts receivable and payable deriving from the trading 
activities of clearing members. They mainly represent amounts to be received or 
paid in relation to initial and variation margin calls, option premiums, securities as 
collateral and default fund contributions and are initially recorded at fair value. 
They are generally settled on the next day and, accordingly, are not discounted 
back to current value. 
d.  Other financial assets at fair value
These represent bond securities in which the CCPs invest to hold their significant 
asset balances securely. These are initially recognised at fair value and are 
subsequently marked to market. Some bonds are treated as fair value through the 
profit or loss, and some are treated as fair value through equity. The classification 
of each bond depends on the investment intention when the bond is acquired.
e.  Cash and cash equivalents (restricted)
These include amounts received from clearing members to cover initial and 
variation margins and default fund contributions that are not invested in bonds 
and are deposited with banks, including central banks. Such amounts are initially 
recognised at fair value and are subsequently recognised at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the 
balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised 
amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously. 
Fair value measurement
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured are categorised within the 
fair value hierarchy which is described in detail in Note 19.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the 
Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy 
by re-assessing categorisation at each balance sheet date. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each balance 
sheet date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 
whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so the 
nature of the item being hedged.
The Group applies fair value hedge accounting for hedging interest rate risk  
on borrowings. Any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement within 
finance expense.
The Group designates as cash flow hedges both foreign currency derivatives and 
hedges of interest rate movements associated with highly probable forecast 
transactions. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective 
portion of the hedge is recognised in equity.
The Group hedges a proportion of its net investment in its Italian companies by 
designating Euro borrowings as a net investment hedge.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, a transaction must meet strict criteria  
as regards documentation, effectiveness, probability of occurrence and reliability 
of measurement. The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the 
relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its  
risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging 
transactions. Effectiveness testing is conducted at each reporting date and at the 
commencement and conclusion of any hedge in order to verify that the hedge 
continues to satisfy all the criteria for hedge accounting to be maintained. The 
ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the 
period when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, when the forecast 
transaction that is hedged takes place). When a hedging instrument expires or is 
sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any 
cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is 
recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income 
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 
cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to 
the income statement.
118 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017 Commitments to purchase non-controlling interests 
Where the Group has granted put options to non-controlling interest shareholders, 
these are treated as liabilities as the Group has no control over whether these 
options are exercised or not. The amounts due are recognised at fair value and are 
revalued on each balance sheet date. When the liability is recognised initially, the 
redemption amount is reclassified from non-controlling interests. The changes in 
the fair value of the liability are recognised in the income statement. Changes in 
the measurement of the liability that do not change the relative interests in the 
subsidiary company that are held by the parent and the non-controlling interest 
shareholder and therefore are not equity transactions.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at their  
fair value, which is usually the original invoiced amount, less any provisions for 
impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial 
difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or will  
be subject to a financial reorganisation or default on, or be delinquent on, its 
payment obligations are considered indicators that the trade receivable is 
impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of the portion deemed recoverable. The 
carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account 
and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement. Subsequent 
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited in the income statement. 
Other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, short-term deposits and 
investments in money market funds and other instruments and structures that 
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant 
risk of changes in value.
Assets and liabilities held for sale
Assets and liabilities are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying 
amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is 
considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount  
and fair value less costs to sell.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recorded at the fair value of amounts received, net of direct 
issue costs and transaction costs (including upfront facility fees). Subsequently, 
these liabilities are carried at amortised cost, and interest is charged to the 
income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest 
rate method. Similarly direct issue costs and transaction costs (including upfront 
facility fees) are charged to the income statement over the period of the 
borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Preference shares
Preference shares or components of preference shares are classified on initial 
recognition as a financial liability or equity based on the terms of the contract. 
They are classified as a financial liability if the terms impose a contractual 
obligation to deliver cash. 
Provisions
A provision is recognised where there is a present obligation, whether legal or 
constructive, as a result of a past event for which it is probable that a transfer of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
The amount recognised as a provision shall be the present value of the best 
estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of 
the reporting period, i.e. the present value of the amount that the Group would 
rationally pay to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date or to transfer it to a 
third party.
Property provisions are made in the financial statements at the lower of the  
cost of fulfilling lease commitments for property space surplus to business 
requirements after taking into account income from sub-letting, and any 
compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil the lease commitments.
All provisions are discounted where the time value of money is considered 
material. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a finance expense.
Equity and related items
Share capital
The share capital of the Company includes balances relating to the Company’s 
ordinary equity shares, own shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust and 
treasury shares held by the Company. 
When the Company issues new shares to the Employee Benefit Trust at par, the 
share capital of the Company is increased by the par value of these own shares, 
and a corresponding deduction or debit is recorded to the employee share 
scheme reserves within retained earnings. 
From time to time, the Company may also issue new shares to the Employee 
Benefit Trust to satisfy vesting of specific employee share schemes. These shares 
may be issued at a subscription price above par value, reflecting the option cost 
payable by the participant in the employee share scheme. In such instances, the 
share capital of the Company is increased by the par value of these own shares 
and the difference between the subscription price and the par value of the own 
share is recorded in share premium. A corresponding deduction or debit is 
recognised in the employee share scheme reserves within retained earnings.
Shares reacquired by the Company from the open market as part of share 
buyback programmes are referred to as treasury shares and are held by the 
Company. The consideration payable is deducted from retained earnings. 
The par value of the treasury shares is then recorded as a transfer from the 
Company’s ordinary equity shares to treasury shares within share capital. 
No gain or loss is recognised by the Company in the income statement on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own shares held by the 
Employee Benefit Trust and treasury shares.
Dividend distributions
Dividend distributions to the Company’s equity holders are recognised as a 
liability in the Group financial statements in the period in which the dividends are 
approved by the Company’s shareholders. The Group maintains a sustainable 
progressive dividend policy. The interim dividend will generally be payable each 
year in September and final dividend in May. The Group’s dividend policy 
determines that the interim dividend is calculated as one-third of the prior full 
year dividend.
119 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017
Group financial statements Notes to the financial statements 2. Financial risk management
The Group seeks to protect its financial performance and the value of its business from exposure to capital, credit, concentration, country, liquidity, settlement, custodial 
and market (including foreign exchange, cash flow and fair value interest rate) risks.
The Group’s financial risk management approach is not speculative and adopts a ‘3 lines of defence’ model. It is performed both at a Group level, where the treasury 
function identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks from a Group perspective and also locally, where operating units manage their regulatory and operational risks. 
This includes clearing operations at the Group’s CCPs (at LCH Group and CC&G) that adhere to local regulation and operate under approved risk and investment policies. 
The Group Chief Risk Officer’s team provides assurance that the governance and operational controls are effective to manage risks within the Board approved risk 
appetite, supporting a robust Group risk management framework. The Financial Risk Committee, a sub-committee of the Group Executive Committee and chaired by 
the Chief Financial Officer, meets monthly to oversee the consolidated financial risks of the Group. In addition, the Treasury Committee, a sub-committee of the 
Financial Risk Committee (which is also chaired by the Chief Financial Officer), meets regularly to monitor the management of, and controls around foreign exchange, 
interest rate, credit and concentration risks and the investment of excess liquidity in addition to its oversight of the Group’s funding arrangements. Both committees 
provide the Group’s senior management with assurance that the treasury and risk operations are performed in accordance with Group Board approved policies and 
procedures. Regular updates, on a range of key criteria as well as new developments, are provided through the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Framework to the 
Group Risk Committee. See ‘Risk Management Oversight’ on pages 42 to 45, for further detail on the Group’s risk framework.
On 23 June 2016 the UK voted to exit the EU. The UK companies within the Group, as members of the EU or European Economic Area (EEA), rely on a number of rights 
that are available to them to conduct business with other EU or EEA members. This includes, without limitation, the right for UK CCPs to offer clearing services to EU 
regulated firms under EMIR, and the right for UK trading venues to offer services to members in the EU or EEA. The Group companies have analysed the potential 
impacts and considered contingency plans that they may choose to execute should these rights not be replaced by rights that persist outside EU membership.
Capital risk
Risk description Risk management approach
The Group is profitable and strongly cash 
generative and its capital base comprises equity 
and debt capital.
However, the Group recognises the risk that its 
entities may not maintain sufficient capital to 
meet their obligations or they may make 
investments that fail to generate a positive or 
value enhancing return.
The Group comprises regulated and unregulated 
entities. It considers that:
 – increases in the capital requirements of its 
regulated companies, or 
 – negative yields on its investments of cash, or
 – a scarcity of debt or equity (driven by its own 
performance or financial market conditions) 
either separately or in combination are the 
principal risks to managing its capital. 
The Group focuses upon its overall cost of capital as it seeks, within the scope of its risk appetite, to provide 
superior returns to its shareholders, fulfil its obligations to the relevant regulatory authorities and other 
stakeholders and ensure that it is not overly dependent upon short and medium term debt that might not be 
available at renewal. Maintaining the flexibility to invest for growth is a key capital management 
consideration. 
The Group can manage its capital structure and react to changes in economic conditions by varying returns to 
shareholders, issuing new shares or increasing or reducing borrowings. The Board reviews dividend policy and 
funding capacity on a regular basis and the Group maintains comfortable levels of debt facility headroom. A 
summary of the Group’s capital structure is presented below: 
Book value of capital 31 December 
2017
£m
31 December 
2016
£m
Group consolidated equity excluding non-controlling interests 3,227 3,106
Group consolidated debt 1,953 1,166
Whilst the Company is unregulated, the regulated entities within the Group monitor compliance with the 
capital requirements set by their respective competent authorities and the terms of reference of the Financial 
Risk Committee includes oversight of the Group’s Capital Management Policy. The Capital Management Policy 
seeks to ensure that compliance with local regulations is maintained and that there is a robust evaluation, 
undertaken by the Group’s Investment Committee, of the impact of new investments, across the Group, on its 
capital position. Regulated entities within the Group have to date predominantly issued equity and held cash 
to satisfy their local regulatory capital requirements.
We believe that capital held by Group companies is sufficient to comfortably support current regulatory 
frameworks. The level of amounts set aside by the Group for these purposes remains subject to on-going 
review with regulators, particularly in Europe. A summary of the Group’s regulatory and operational capital  
is shown below:
Regulatory and operational capital 31 December 
2017
£m
31 December 
2016
£m
Total regulatory and operational capital 1,147 943
Amount included in cash and cash equivalents 1,042 848
The total capital amounts have increased year on year reflecting strong cash generation at regulated entities 
and now include cash held by Monte Titoli as at 31 December 2017 in response to the new Central Securities 
Depositories Regulation (“CSDR”) regulatory requirements.
To maintain the financial strength to access new capital at reasonable cost and sustain an investment  
grade credit rating, the Group monitors its net leverage ratio which is operating net debt (i.e. net debt after 
excluding cash and cash equivalents set aside for regulatory and operational purposes) to proforma adjusted 
EBITDA (Group consolidated earnings before net finance charges, taxation, impairment, depreciation and 
amortisation, foreign exchange gains or losses and non-underlying items, prorated for acquisitions or 
disposals undertaken in the period) against a target range of 1–2 times. The Group is also mindful of potential 
impacts on the key metrics employed by the credit rating agencies in considering increases to its borrowings. 
As at 31 December 2017, net leverage was 1.7 times (2016: 1.1 times), but remains well within the Group’s 
target range. The Group is comfortably in compliance with its bank facility ratio covenants (net leverage  
and interest cover) and these measures do not inhibit the Group’s operations or its financing plans.
120 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017 Credit and concentration risk
Risk description Risk management approach
The Group’s credit risk relates to its customers  
and counterparties being unable to meet their 
obligations to the Group either in part or in full, 
including:
 – customer receivables,
 – repayment of invested cash and cash 
equivalents, and
 – settlement of derivative financial instruments.
In their roles as CCP clearers to financial market 
participants, the Group’s CCPs guarantee final 
settlement of transactions acting as buyer 
towards each seller and as seller towards each 
buyer. They manage substantial credit risks as 
part of their operations including unmatched  
risk positions that might arise from the default  
of a party to a cleared transaction. For more 
information see ‘Principal Risk and Uncertainties’, 
pages 46 to 53.
Notwithstanding regulations that require CCPs to 
invest predominantly in secured instruments or 
structures (such as government bonds and reverse 
repos), CC&G and the LCH Group CCPs continue to 
be able to maintain up to 5% of their total deposits 
at commercial banks on an unsecured basis. 
Through this potential for its CCPs to invest on  
an unsecured basis (as well as by certain other 
regulated and unregulated operations observing 
agreed investment policy limits), the Group will 
continue to face some risk of direct loss from a 
deterioration or failure of one or more of its 
unsecured investment counterparties.
Concentration risk may arise through Group 
entities having large individual or connected 
exposures to groups of counterparties whose 
likelihood of default is driven by common 
underlying factors. This is a particular focus of  
the investment approach at the Group’s CCPs.
Group
Credit risk is governed through policies developed at a Group level. Limits and thresholds for credit and 
concentration risk are kept under review. 
Group companies make a judgement on the credit quality of their customers based upon the customer’s 
financial position, the recurring nature of billing and collection arrangements and, historically, a low 
incidence of default. Furthermore, the Group is exposed to a large number of customers and so concentration 
risk on its receivables is deemed by management as low.
Non-CCP entities
Credit risk of cash and cash equivalents is managed by limiting exposure to counterparties with credit rating 
levels below policy minimum thresholds, potentially overlaid by a default probability assessment. Except 
where specific approval is arranged to increase this limit for certain counterparties, a maximum of £50 million 
may be invested for up to 12 months with counterparties rated long term AAA (or equivalent), through  
to a maximum £25 million overnight with counterparties rated short term A-2 (or equivalent). Derivative 
transactions and other treasury receivable structures are undertaken or agreed with well capitalised 
counterparties and are authorised by policy to limit the credit risk underlying these transactions.
CCPs
To address market participant and latent market risk, the Group’s CCPs have established financial safeguards 
against single or multiple defaults. Clearing membership selection is based upon supervisory capital, 
technical and organisational criteria. Each member must pay margins, computed and collected at least  
daily, to cover the exposures and theoretical costs which the CCP might incur in order to close out open 
positions in the event of the member’s default. Margins are calculated using established and internationally 
acknowledged risk models and are debited from participants’ accounts through central bank accounts and via 
commercial bank payment systems. Minimum levels of cash collateral are required and non-cash collateral is 
revalued daily.

Clearing members’ margin liability (139) (139)
Collateral security Cash 73 72

Maximum aggregate margin liability for the year (155) (145)
Clearing members also contribute to default funds managed by the CCPs to guarantee the integrity of the 
markets in the event of multiple defaults in extreme market circumstances. Amounts are determined on the 
basis of the results of periodic stress testing examined by the risk committees of the respective CCPs. 
Furthermore, each of the Group’s CCPs reinforces its capital position to meet the most stringent relevant 
regulatory requirements applicable to it, including holding a minimum amount of dedicated own resources to 
further underpin the protective credit risk framework in the event of a significant market stress event or 
participant failure. An analysis of the aggregate clearing member contributions to default funds across the 
CCPs is shown below:

31 December

Aggregate at year end 16 12
Maximum during the year 18 12
Investment counterparty risk for CCP margin and default funds is managed by investing the cash element in 
instruments or structures deemed “secure” by the relevant regulatory bodies including through direct 
investments in highly rated, “regulatory qualifying” sovereign bonds and supra-national debt, investments in 
tri-party and bilateral reverse repos (receiving high quality government securities as collateral) and, in certain 
jurisdictions, deposits with the central bank. The small proportion of cash that is invested unsecured is placed 
for short durations with highly rated counterparties where strict limits are applied with respect to credit 
quality, concentration and tenor.

Associated liquidity risks are considered in the investment mix and discussed further below.
To address concentration risk, the Group maintains a diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid investments 
and uses a broad range of custodians, payment and settlement banks and agents. The largest concentration 
of treasury exposures as at 31 December 2017 was 24% of the total investment portfolio to the French 
Government (2016: 21% to the French Government).

Group financial statements Notes to the financial statements Country risk
Risk description Risk management approach
Distress can result from the risk that certain 
governments may be unable or find it difficult to 
service their debts. This could have adverse 
effects, particularly on the Group’s CCPs, 
potentially impacting cleared products, margin 
collateral, investments, the clearing membership 
and the financial industry as a whole.
Specific risk frameworks manage country risk for both fixed income clearing and margin collateral and all 
clearing members are monitored regularly against a suite of sovereign stress scenarios. Investment limits and 
counterparty and clearing membership monitoring are sensitive to changes in ratings and other financial 
market indicators, to ensure the Group’s CCPs are able to measure, monitor and mitigate exposures to 
sovereign risk and respond quickly to anticipated changes. Risk Committees maintain an ongoing watch over 
these risks and the associated policy frameworks to protect the Group against potentially severe volatility in 
the sovereign debt markets.

Liquidity, settlement and custodial risk 
Risk description Risk management approach
The Group’s operations are exposed to liquidity 
risk to the extent that they are unable to meet 
their daily payment obligations. 
In addition, the Group’s CCPs and certain other 
subsidiary companies are required to maintain a 
level of liquidity (consistent with regulatory 
requirements) to ensure the smooth operation of 
their respective markets and to maintain 
operations in the event of a single or multiple 
market stress event or member failure. This 
includes the potential requirement to liquidate the 
position of a clearing member under a default 
scenario including covering the associated losses 
and the settlement obligations of the defaulting 
member.
The Group is exposed to the risk that a payment or 
settlement bank could fail or that its systems 
encounter operational issues, creating liquidity 
pressures and the risk of possible defaults on 
payment or receivable obligations. 
The Group uses third party custodians to hold 
securities and is therefore exposed to the 
custodian’s insolvency, its negligence, a misuse of 
assets or poor administration.
The combined Group businesses are profitable, generate strong free cash flow and operations are not 
significantly impacted by seasonal variations. The Group maintains sufficient liquid resources to meet  
its financial obligations as they fall due and to invest in capital expenditure, make dividend payments,  
meet its pension commitments, support acquisitions or repay borrowings. With the exception of regulatory 
constraints impacting certain entities, funds can generally be lent across the Group and cash earnings 
remitted through dividend payments. This is an important component of the Group Treasury cash 
management policy and approach. 
Management monitors forecasts of the Group’s cash flow and overlays sensitivities to these forecasts to 
reflect assumptions about more difficult market conditions or stress events. 
Treasury policy requires that the Group maintains adequate credit facilities provided by a diversified lending 
group to cover its expected funding requirements and ensure a minimum level of headroom for at least the 
next 24 months. The financial strength of lenders to the Group is monitored regularly. During the year ended 
31 December 2017, the LCH Group €200 million Preferred Securities were redeemed in full utilising the Group’s 
committed credit facilities together with available cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Group put in 
place a new, 5 year, £600 million committed revolving credit facility to replace a maturing facility of  
the same amount and issued €1 billion of senior notes due in 2024 and 2029, materially extending its debt 
maturity profile. It has also recently established a £1 billion euro commercial paper programme to further 
broaden its sources of liquidity; the programme was unutilised at the end of the financial year. At 31 
December 2017, £675 million (2016: £733 million) of the Group’s facilities were unutilised.
The Group’s CCPs maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents and, in certain jurisdictions, have access  
to central bank refinancing or commercial bank liquidity support credit lines to meet the cash requirements  
of the clearing and settlement cycle. Revised regulations require CCPs to ensure that appropriate levels of 
back up liquidity are in place to underpin the dynamics of a largely secured cash investment requirement, 
ensuring that the maximum potential outflow under extreme market conditions is covered (see Credit and 
concentration risk section above). The Group’s CCPs monitor their liquidity needs daily under normal and 
stressed market conditions.
Where possible, the Group employs guaranteed delivery versus payment settlement techniques and manages 
CCP margin and default fund flows through central bank or long-established, bespoke commercial bank 
settlement mechanisms. Monies due from clearing members remain the clearing members’ liability if the 
payment agent is unable to effect the appropriate transfer. In addition, certain Group companies, including 
the CCPs, maintain operational facilities with commercial banks to manage intraday and overnight liquidity. 
Custodians are subject to minimum eligibility requirements, ongoing credit assessment, robust contractual 
arrangements and are required to have appropriate back-up contingency arrangements in place.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the 
remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the 
table reflect the contractual undiscounted cash flows. The borrowings line includes future interest on debt 
that is not accrued for in relation to bonds which are not yet due.

Market risk – Foreign Exchange
Risk description Risk management approach
The Group operates primarily in the UK, Europe 
and North America, but also has growing and 
strategically important businesses in Asia, and 
other alliances and investments across the globe. 
Its principal currencies of operation are Sterling, 
euro and US Dollars. 
With the exception of MillenniumIT (a Sri Lankan 
Rupee reporting entity), which invoices a material 
proportion of its revenues in US Dollars, and 
certain operations of the LCH Group (a Euro 
reporting subsidiary), which generate material 
revenues in Sterling and US Dollars and incur 
material costs in Sterling, Group companies 
generally invoice revenues, incur expenses and 
purchase assets in their respective local 
currencies. As a result, foreign exchange risk 
arises mainly from the translation of the Group’s 
foreign currency earnings, assets and liabilities 
into its reporting currency, Sterling, and from 
occasional, high value intragroup transactions.
Intragroup dividends and the currency debt 
interest obligations of the Company may create 
short term transactional FX exposures but play 
their part in controlling the level of translational 
FX exposures the Group faces.
The Group may be exposed from time to time to 
FX risk associated with strategic investments in, 
or divestments from operations denominated in 
currencies other than Sterling.
The Group seeks to match the currency of its debt liabilities to the currency of its earnings and cash flows 
which to an extent balances the currency of its assets with its liabilities. In order to mitigate the impact of 
unfavourable currency exchange movements on earnings and net assets, non-Sterling cash earnings are 
centralised and applied to matching currency debt and interest payments, and where relevant, interest 
payments on Sterling debt re-denominated through the use of cross-currency swaps. 
A proportion of the Group’s debt is held in or swapped into Euro and US Dollars.

Euro denominated cross-currency interest rate swaps (355) 256
US Dollar denominated drawn debt – 100
US Dollar denominated cross-currency interest rate swaps 622 –
The cross currency interest rate swaps are directly linked to Sterling and Euro fixed debt. The Euro and US 
Dollar denominated debt, including the cross-currency swaps, provides a hedge against the Group’s net 
investment in Euro and US Dollar denominated entities. 
As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s designated hedges of its net investments were fully effective.
Whilst transactional foreign exchange exposure is limited, the Group hedges material transactions in 
accordance with Group Treasury policy (which requires cash flows of more than £1 million or equivalent per 
annum to be hedged) with appropriate derivative instruments or by settling currency payables or receivables 
within a short timeframe. Where appropriate, hedge accounting for derivatives is considered in order to 
mitigate material levels of income statement volatility. 
In addition to projecting and analysing its earnings and debt profile by currency, the Group reviews 
sensitivities to movements in exchange rates which are appropriate to market conditions. The Group has 
considered movements in the Euro and the US Dollar over the year ended 31 December 2017 and year ended 
31 December 2016 and, based on actual market observations between its principal currency pairs, has 
concluded that a 10% movement in rates is a reasonable level to illustrate the risk to the Group. The impact  
on post tax profit and equity for the years ended 31 December is set out in the table below:

Group financial statements Notes to the financial statements Market risk – Cash Flow and Fair Value Interest Rate Risk
Risk description Risk management approach
The Group’s interest rate risk arises through the 
impact of changes in market rates on cash flows 
associated with cash and cash equivalents, 
investments in financial assets and borrowings 
held at floating rates.
The Group’s CCPs face interest rate exposure 
through the impact of changes in the reference 
rates used to calculate member liabilities versus 
the yields achieved through their predominantly 
secured investment activities.
Group interest rate management policy focuses on protecting the Group’s credit rating and maintaining 
compliance with bank covenant requirements. To support this objective, a minimum coverage of interest 
expense by EBITDA of 7 times, and a maximum floating rate component of 50% of total debt are targeted. 
This approach reflects: 
i.   a focus on the Group’s cost of gross debt rather than its net debt given the material cash and cash 
equivalents set aside for regulatory purposes;
ii.  the short duration allowed for investments of cash and cash equivalents held for regulatory purposes 
which, by their nature, generate low investment yields; 
iii.  a view that already low market yields are unlikely to move materially lower; and
iv.  the broad natural hedge of floating rate borrowings provided by the significant balances of cash and cash 
equivalents held effectively at floating rates of interest.
As at 31 December 2017, consolidated net interest expense cover by EBITDA was measured over the 12 month 
period at 15.5 times (2016: 13.0 times) and the floating rate component of total debt was 27% (2016: 40%). 
In the Group’s CCPs, interest bearing assets are generally invested in secured instruments or structures and 
for a longer term than interest bearing liabilities, whose interest rate is reset daily. This makes investment 
revenue vulnerable to volatility in overnight rates and shifts in spreads between overnight and term rates. 
Interest rate exposures (and the risk to CCP capital) are managed within defined risk appetite parameters 
against which sensitivities are monitored daily.
In its review of the sensitivities to potential movements in interest rates, the Group has considered interest 
rate volatility over the last year and prospects for rates over the next 12 months and has concluded that a  
1 percentage point upward movement (with a limited prospect of material downward movement) reflects  
a reasonable level of risk to current rates. At 31 December 2017, at the Group level, if interest rates on 
Sterling-denominated, Euro-denominated and US Dollar-denominated cash and borrowings had been 1 
percentage point higher with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been  
£5 million higher (2016: £5 million higher) mainly as a result of higher interest income on floating rate cash 
and cash equivalents partially offset by higher interest expense on floating rate borrowings.
At 31 December 2017, at the CCP level (in aggregate), if interest rates on the common interest bearing 
member liability benchmarks of Eonia, Fed Funds and Sonia, for Euro, US Dollar and Sterling liabilities 
respectively, had been 1 percentage point higher, with all other variables held constant, the daily impact  
on post-tax profit for the Group would have been £2 million lower (2016: £2 million lower). This deficit is 
expected to be recovered as investment yields increase as the portfolio matures and is reinvested.
124 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017 3. Significant judgements and estimates
Judgements and estimates are regularly evaluated based on historical experience, current circumstances and expectations of future events. 
Estimates:
For the year ended 31 December 201 7 , the following areas require the use of estimates:
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination – valued on acquisition using appropriate methodologies and amortised over their estimated useful 
economic lives. These valuations and lives are based on management’s best estimates of future performance and periods over which value from the intangible assets 
are realised. Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are provided in Note 14; 
Impairment of purchased intangible assets, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries – tested for impairment annually. The recoverable amounts of relevant cash 
generating units are based on value in use calculations using management’s best estimate of future performance and estimates of the return required by investors to 
determine an appropriate discount rate. Details are provided in Note 14; and
Defined benefit pension asset or liability – determined based on the present value of future pension obligations using assumptions determined by the Group with 
advice from an independent qualified actuary. Sensitivity analysis is provided in Note 18.
Judgements:
In preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 201 7 , the following judgement has been made:
CCP trading assets and trading liabilities – The Group uses its judgement to carry out the offsetting within clearing member balances. The carrying values of the 
balances are offset at what the Group considers an appropriate level to arrive at the net balances reported in the balance sheet. The Group has an aligned approach for its 
CCP subsidiaries to ensure the principles are applied are consistent across similar assets and liabilities. The approach is reviewed on a timely basis to ensure the 
approach used is the most appropriate. Details of amounts offset are provided in Note 20.
4. Segmental Information

The UK Finance Bill 2015 was enacted in November 2015 reducing the standard rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 201 7 and the UK Finance Bill 
201 6 was enacted in September 201 6 reducing the standard rate of corporation tax further to 1 7% effective from 1 April 2020. Accordingly, the UK deferred tax balances at 
December 201 7 have been stated at 19% or 1 7% dependent on when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The Group recognised a one off deferred tax credit of 
£1 42 million relating to the reduction in the deferred tax liability which arises from consolidation of US acquisitions and reflects the lower Federal tax rate of 21 % 
substantively enacted following US tax reform signed into law in December 201 7 . The deferred tax balances in other countries are recognised at the substantively enacted 
rates at the balance sheet date. 
Uncertain tax positions
An amount of £2 million (2016: £1 million) has been provided for in respect of uncertain tax positions in relation to uncertainty arising from the introduction of UK 
Diverted Profits Tax. In the prior year, an additional uncertain tax position of £3 million was provided for, reflecting ongoing discussions with the tax authorities 
regarding the tax effect of certain changes in accounting policy for intangible assets. The Group no longer considers this amount to be uncertain, following further 
discussions with the tax authorities during the year. 
Judgements
The Group is monitoring developments in relation to EU State Aid investigation into the UK’s Controlled Foreign Company regime. The Group does not currently consider 
that any provision is required in relation to EU State Aid.

Transfers in the year relate to re-classification of software intangibles to property, plant and equipment.
During the year, the Group acquired the entire share capital of the Mergent and Yield Book businesses, which resulted in an increase of £289 million in goodwill.  
Further details are provided in Note 30.
During the year, the Group disposed of the Millennium Enterprise Systems Integration business, which resulted in a reduction of £1 million in goodwill.
During the year, the Group classified Exactpro as a disposal group held for sale which resulted in £3 million of goodwill being reclassified as an asset held for sale.  
Further details are provided in Note 10.
The goodwill arising on consolidation represents the growth potential and assembled workforces of the Italian Group, LCH Group, FTSE Group, MillenniumIT, the US 
Information Services Group and Turquoise. The Company has no intangible assets (2016: none).
Purchased intangible assets
The fair values of the purchased intangible assets were principally valued using discounted cash flow methodologies and are being amortised over their useful economic 
lives, which do not normally exceed 25 years. The Group’s purchased intangible assets include:
Customer relationships
These assets have been recognised on acquisition of major subsidiary companies by the Group. The amortisation period remaining on these assets are between 10 to  
25 years.
Brands
Brands have been recognised in a number of major acquisitions, including FTSE, LCH, Russell and Yield Book. Included within brands are trade names relating to the 
acquisition of Frank Russell Group of £57 4 million (2016: £658 million). The remaining amortisation period on these assets are between 20 to 25 years.
Software, licences and intellectual property
These assets have been recognised on acquisition of subsidiary companies and have a remaining amortisation period of 5 to 20 years.
There are no other individual purchased intangible assets with a carrying value that is considered material to each asset class. 
134 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017 Software and other 
The cost of self-developed software includes £94 million (2016: £67 million) representing assets not yet brought into use. No amortisation has been charged on these 
assets and instead they are tested for impairment annually. 
Following a review of software assets across the Group, no impairment was recognised during the year (2016: £8 million).
Other amounts represent the internally built and developed trading systems within the various business lines. In general these assets have a useful economic life of  
5 years.
During the year, additions relating to internally generated software amounted to £143 million (2016: £1 13 million).
The carrying value of licences held under finance leases at 31 December 201 7 was £7 million (2016: nil).
Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to 1 1 cash generating units (CGUs).
The recoverable amounts of these CGUs have been determined based on value in use calculations using discounted cash flow forecasts based on business plans 
prepared by management for a 3 year period ending 31 December 2020, and then projected for a further 2 years to 31 December 2022. Cash flows beyond this period 
are extrapolated using the estimated long term growth rates and applying the pre-tax discount rates referred to below.
The amount of the net book value of goodwill allocated to each CGU is set out below.

Management has based its value in use calculations for each CGU on key assumptions about short and medium term revenue and cost growth, long term economic 
growth rates (used to determine terminal values) and pre-tax discount rates.
The values assigned to short and medium term revenue and cost growth assumptions are based on the 2018 budget and the Group’s approved business plan. The 
assumptions are derived from an assessment of current trends, anticipated market and regulatory developments, discussions with customers and suppliers, and 
management’s experience. These factors are considered in conjunction with the Group’s long-term strategic objectives to determine appropriate short and medium 
growth assumptions.
Long-term growth rates assumed to be 1.6% for each of the Italian CGUs (2016: 1.7%), 9.4% for MillenniumIT (2016: 10.1 %), 3.8% for each of the US Information Services 
CGUs (2016: 4.1 %) and 3.7% for the other CGUs (2016: 3.7%) represent management’s internal forecasts based on external estimates of GDP and inflation analysis for the 
10 year period 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2022, and do not exceed the long term average growth rates for the countries in which the CGUs operate.
Pre-tax discount rates are based on a number of factors including the risk-free rates in Italy, France, Sri Lanka, USA and the UK as appropriate, the Group’s estimated 
market risk premium and a premium to reflect the inherent risks of each of the CGUs.
Based on the results of the impairment tests performed, management believes there is no impairment of the carrying value of the goodwill in any CGU. 
Value in use calculations for each CGU are sensitive to changes in short and medium term revenue and cost growth assumptions, long term growth rates and pre-tax 
discount rates. Management believes goodwill allocated to each CGU is unlikely to be materially impaired under reasonable changes to key assumptions. The excess of 
value in use over carrying value is determined by reference to the net book value as at 31 December 201 7 . Revenue and cost sensitivities assume a 5% change in 
revenues or costs for each of the 5 years in the value in use calculations.

The deferred tax assets are recoverable against future taxable profits and are due after more than 1 year. 
The net deferred tax asset of £1 1 million (2016: £26 million) in respect of provisions and other temporary differences mainly relates to share based payments of  
£14 million (2016: £7 million), retirement benefits liability of £(15) million (2016: £10 million), trading losses of £5 million (2016: £24 million), withholding tax on 
distributable reserves of subsidiary companies of £(5) million (2016: £(5) million) and other provisions and temporary differences of £12 million (2016: £(10) million).
The purchased intangible assets of the acquired subsidiaries create a deferred tax liability due to the difference between their accounting and tax treatment. This liability 
is amortised at the same rate as the purchased intangible assets.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of losses of £18 million (2016: £21 million) within certain Group subsidiaries. The assets would be recognised 
in the future only if suitable taxable income were to arise within the Group.
There was no deferred tax in the Company (2016: nil).
138 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017 18. Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates separate defined benefit and defined contribution schemes. The assets of the defined benefit and defined contribution schemes are held separately 
from those of the Group. 
In the UK, the defined benefit scheme is administered by trustees with the assets primarily being managed by BMO Global Asset Management, Legal & General 
Investment Management Limited, PIMCO Europe Limited, Schroder Investment Management Limited, and a ‘buy in’ insurance asset with Pension Insurance 
Corporation. 
On 5 September 2016, the London Stock Exchange Retirement Plan (“LSERP”) and the LCH Pension Scheme in the UK (“LCH UK”) underwent a sectionalised merger into a 
new London Stock Exchange Group Pension Scheme (“LSEGPS”). The scheme maintains separate LCH and LSE Sections.
The assets of the LSEGPS are held by the trustees who are responsible for the scheme’s governance. The schemes are invested in a wide range of assets in the UK and 
overseas, which seek to balance risk and investment return, through investment managers appointed by the scheme’s trustees. The plan assets do not include any of 
the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
The ‘Other plans’ relate to the severance and leaving indemnity scheme Trattamento di Fine Rapporto (“TFR”) operated by the Italian group in accordance with Italian law, 
the employee benefit and retirement plan operated by MillenniumIT and other pension commitments of the LCH Group outside of the UK. 
The only schemes operated by FTSE International and US entities are defined contribution schemes recorded in Other plans. 
All schemes are governed by the local regulatory framework and employment laws in the country in which they operate.
The Company has no retirement benefit obligations.
Defined benefit schemes 
United Kingdom
The LSE section of LSEGPS was a non-contributory defined benefit scheme that closed to new members in 1999. With effect from 31 March 2012, the LSERP also  
closed to accrual of future benefits for active members and it has been agreed that the benefits already accrued for affected members will remain linked to their  
salary with the Group.
The LCH section of LSEGPS was closed to new members from 30 September 2009. It was closed to further employee contributions and accrual of future benefits from  
31 March 2013 with the defined contribution section remaining open until April 201 7 , when the Legal & General mastertrust was provided to all UK employees. 
Pension scheme obligations and costs are determined by an independent qualified actuary on a regular basis using the projected unit credit method. The obligations 
are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme and are reflected in the Group balance sheet.
Overseas
LCH Group also operates a retirement indemnity and long-service award schemes in Paris, for which the scheme obligations are calculated by an independent qualified 
actuary. They also operate an independent defined benefit scheme in Porto, assumed in 2006. Updated valuations of these funds are carried out by an independent 
qualified actuary. 
The TFR operated by the Italian group is classified as an unfunded defined benefit scheme for funds accumulated prior to 1 July 2007 . The service cost, representing 
deferred salaries accruing to employees, was included as an operating expense and was determined by law at 6.91 % of salary payments subject to certain adjustments. 
The scheme obligation comprises accumulated service costs and is revalued by law at a rate equal to 75% of ‘national life price index + 1.5% ’ by an independent qualified 
actuary. Since 1 July 2007 , the Group retains no obligation, as contributions are made directly into Italian state funds in the manner of a defined contribution scheme.
The employee benefit and retirement plan operated by MillenniumIT is classified as an unfunded defined benefit plan. The net obligation in respect of this plan is  
the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. Once an employee is continuously employed  
for more than 5 years, he or she is entitled to a payment equivalent to half a month’s gross salary multiplied by the number of years in service at MillenniumIT. 
The principal risks to which the defined benefit schemes expose the Group arises from an increase in pension liability.
The pension liabilities could increase in the following circumstances:
 – if increases in the plan liabilities are not accompanied by corresponding increases in the plan assets
 – if investment returns are lower than assumed in assessing the adequacy of plans
 – if the salaries of active members increase more rapidly than assumed, increasing liabilities
 – if inflation is higher than expected, increasing liabilities through indexing of pension payments; and
 – the risk that members live longer than expected, increasing the length of time for which pensions have to be paid, potentially due to a medical breakthrough
Such an increase in pension liabilities could lead to an increase in pension deficit. Defined benefit schemes are normally revalued by actuaries every 3 years.  
Where any material funding gap is identified by this process, the Trustees will agree a schedule of contributions with the sponsor company. Such contributions  
would result in financial impact to the Group.
In addition with regard to the LSERP , the Group is exposed to the credit of the buy-in insurance provider. A failure of the buy-in insurance provider would reduce  
the pension assets and could thus also lead to a pension deficit or an increase in pension deficit and the need for contributions from the Group.

Group financial statements Notes to the financial statements Defined contribution schemes 
In the UK, the only pension scheme open to employees is a defined contribution scheme, provided by Legal & General. Following a pension consultation, from April 
201 7 , all UK employees are eligible to participate in the same pension scheme. A core contribution of 8% of basic salary is paid by the Group, who will also match 
employee contributions up to 4% of basic salary.
Amounts recognised in the income statement from continuing operations are as follows:

As at 31 December 201 7 , the Group has recognised a net defined benefit asset of £56 million (2016: £2 million asset) in relation to the LCH UK scheme on the basis that 
the Group has access to the surplus in the event of wind up of the scheme and therefore no asset ceiling has been applied to the net surplus recognised. Further, no 
minimum funding commitments are associated with the plan.

The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit obligations as a result of reasonable changes  
in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.
The impact of the salary increase assumption as a standalone sensitivity has an immaterial impact on the scheme obligations.

The last actuarial valuation of the LSERP defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2015 by an independent qualified actuary. According to the schedule of 
contributions of this valuation the Group has funded its defined benefit scheme deficit with payments of £2 million in 2015, £3 million in 2016 and £3 million in 201 7 
with funding commitments of £2 million per annum in years 2018 to 2022.
The last actuarial valuation of the LCH UK defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 30 June 2013 by an independent qualified actuary. LCH section is currently in 
discussion on the results of the valuation as at 31 December 2016, which is being finalised and which may result in an adjustment to future contributions to the plan.
The weighted average duration of the LSERP and LCH UK defined benefit obligations at the end of the reporting period is estimated to be 1 7 years and 22 years, respectively.

1.  In the hierarchy for determining fair value, the Group has re-presented £18 million of deferred consideration liabilities in relation to the purchase of non-controlling interests of acquired subsidiaries,  
from Level 2 to Level 3 to reflect the measurement principles applied to the balances 
Within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, £2,367 million of CCP non-derivative instruments have been re-presented as derivative instruments.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: 
 – Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
 – Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs, which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and 
 – Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data 
For assets and liabilities classified as Level 1, the fair value is based on market price quotations at the reporting date.
For assets and liabilities classified as Level 2, the fair value is calculated using one or more valuation techniques (e.g. the market approach or the income approach) with 
market observable inputs. The selection of the appropriate valuation techniques may be affected by the availability of the relevant inputs as well as the reliability of the 
inputs. The inputs may include currency rates, interest rate and forward rate curves and net asset values. The results of the application of the various techniques may 
not be equally representative of fair value, due to factors such as assumptions made in the valuation.
There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the current and prior period.
When observable market data is not available, the Group uses one or more valuation techniques (e.g. the market approach or the income approach) for which sufficient 
and reliable data is available. These inputs used in estimating the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments include expected timing and level of future cash flows, 
timing of settlement, discount rates and net asset values of certain investments. 
The Group has classified deferred consideration in relation to put options over the non-controlling interests of subsidiaries as Level 3 in the hierarchy for determining the 
fair value, due to the significant inputs used in the valuation that are not based on observable data. The valuation of the deferred consideration is set out in the terms of the 
option agreement, where the cash flow forecasts of the underlying business over the deferred consideration payment period are discounted at the Group’s pre-tax cost of 
debt. The key inputs into the valuation of the deferred consideration are cash flow forecasts over a 5 year period from the date of acquisition and the discount rate.
A 10% increase or decrease in the total cash flows or a 1 % change in the discount rate applied would not have a material effect on the valuation of the amounts payable.
The Group does not consider there to be any alternative assumptions that will be used in the valuation of the liability.
With the exception of Group borrowings, management has assessed that the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities categorised as ‘Loans and receivables’ 
and ‘Financial liabilities at amortised cost’ approximate their carrying values. The fair value of the Group’s borrowings is disclosed in Note 24.
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities held at fair value consist largely of securities restricted in use for the operations of the Group’s CCPs as managers of their 
respective clearing and guarantee systems. The nature and composition of the CCP clearing business assets and liabilities are explained in the accounting policies 
section in Note 1.
144 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017 As at 31 December 201 7 , there were no provisions for impairment in relation to any of the CCP financial assets (2016: nil) and none of these assets were past due (2016: nil).
Hedging activities and derivatives
During the year the Company issued €1 billion of bonds in two €500 million tranches maturing in 2024 and 2029. At the same time €700 million of these bonds was 
swapped on a coordinated basis into US$836 million through a series of 9 cross currency interest rate swaps. As at 31 December 201 7 , derivative financial assets of £4 
million (2016: nil) represents the fair value of these cross currency interest rate swaps. These instruments effectively exchange some of the obligations and coupons of 
the 2024 and 2029 €500 million bonds from Euros into US Dollars in order to more closely match the currency of borrowings to the Group’s currency of borrowings to the 
currency of its net assets and earnings. These swaps have been designated as a hedge of the Group’s net investments in its US Dollar reporting subsidiaries and qualify 
for effective hedge accounting. 
The remaining €300 million of bonds outstanding remain in place as a hedge of the Group’s net investments in Euro denominated subsidiaries and qualify for effective 
hedge accounting.
Derivative financial liabilities of £29 million (2016: £19 million) represents the fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps comprising 6 contracts totalling €300 
million notional (2016: €300 million). These instruments effectively exchange the obligations and coupons of the 2019 £250 million bond from Sterling into Euros in  
order to more closely match the currency of borrowings to the Group’s currency of net assets and earnings. This also results in a reduction in balance sheet translation 
exposure on Euro denominated net assets and the protection of Sterling cash flows. These swaps have been designated as a hedge of the Group’s net investment in the 
Italian group and qualify for effective hedge accounting. 
For the year ended 31 December 201 7 , the Group recognised a net £5 million loss on mark to market valuation and settlement of these derivatives in reserves (2016: £54 
million loss). 
Foreign exchange forward contracts were arranged during the year to hedge the fair value of Euro and US Dollar denominated exposures. These contracts forward buy 
and sell payables and receivables denominated in Euro and US Dollar, with the mark to market adjustments offsetting the revaluation of the underlying hedged item in 
the income statement. They also offer more predictable cash flows to the Group at maturity. At 31 December 201 7 , payables of €19 million (2016: nil) and US$10 million 
(2016: US$13 million) were hedged forward into the next financial year. The market value of the derivatives was nil (2016: nil) in aggregate.
20. Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
The Group reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a net basis on the balance sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts 
and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
The following table shows the impact of netting arrangements on all financial assets and liabilities that are reported net on the balance sheet as at 3 1 December 201 7 :

Total liabilities (2,365,526) 2,044,996 (320,530)
All offset amounts are held in the CCP trading assets and CCP trading liabilities within the Group’s financial instruments.
An extensive review of the member balances, and the amounts offset to arrive at the net balances reported, has been undertaken. This has resulted in updates to the 
offsetting approach and the identification of adjustments in relation to the application of the Group’s policies. The gross amounts and amounts offset in relation to other 
financial assets and liabilities have been amended from those previously reported at 31 December 2016. There has been no impact to the net amount reported in the 
balance sheet, amounts reported in the income statement, cash flow statement or any other disclosures in the financial statements. Additionally, changes in the basis 
of netting during the year have resulted in measurements that are more representative of fair value and additional balances being included in the total.
As CCPs, the Group’s operating companies sit in the middle of members’ transactions and hold default funds and margin amounts as a contingency against the default 
of a member. As such, further amounts are available to offset in the event of a default reducing the asset and liability of £647 ,950 million (2016: £320,530 million) to nil.

Cash and cash equivalents are held with authorised counterparties of a high credit standing, in secured investments at LCH Group companies and at CC&G and 
unsecured interest bearing current and call accounts, short-term deposits and AAA rated money market funds elsewhere in the Group. Management does not expect 
any losses from non-performance by the counterparties holding cash and cash equivalents, and there are no material differences between their book and fair values. 
Cash and cash equivalents do not include amounts held by certain subsidiaries on behalf of their clearing members, the use of which is restricted to the operation of  
the clearers as managers of the clearing and guarantee system (see Note 19).

The Group acquired Mergent on 3 January 201 7 . If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 201 7 , the results of the additional period of ownership would have had an 
immaterial impact on the Group’s revenue and operating profit from continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 201 7 .
If The Yield Book acquisition had occurred on 1 January 201 7 , the Group revenue from continuing operations for the year would have been £1,823 million, with operating 
profit (before acquisition amortisation and non-underlying items) of £834 million. These amounts have been calculated using the Group’s accounting policies and based 
on available information.
In the year ended 31 December 201 7 , a total of £9 million transaction costs in respect of both acquisitions have been recognised as a non-underlying expense in the 
Group income statement.

The valuation of the acquisition of Mergent was finalised in the year and resulted in no change to the fair values attributed on acquisition. The fair values attributed to 
The Yield Book acquisition are preliminary and will be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
The fair value adjustments are explained below:
Mergent
The Group recognised £69 million of purchased intangible assets arising on acquisition representing £54 million attributable to customer relationships, £14 million 
attributable to various technologies and £1 million relating to brands and trade names. The deferred tax liability arising on the recognition of these intangible assets  
was £19 million. The fair values of these purchased intangible assets are being amortised over their remaining useful lives from the date of completion.
The goodwill of £7 4 million arising on consolidation represents the growth of future expected income streams from Mergent’s customer base and development of the 
Group’s product offering, along with the assembled workforce and value of expected synergies arising from the acquisition. The goodwill recognised is not deductible  
for tax purposes.
152 London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2017 The Yield Book and Citi Fixed Income Indices
The Group recognised £307 million of intangible assets arising on acquisition representing £97 million attributable to customer relationships, £154 million attributable 
to various technologies and £56 million relating to brands and trade names. The fair values of these purchased intangible assets are being amortised over their 
remaining useful lives from the date of completion.
The goodwill of £215 million arising on consolidation represents the growth of future expected income streams from the integration of Yield Book’s enhanced data and 
analytics capabilities to better serve the Group’s global customer base, and the value of the assembled workforce and expected synergies arising from the acquisition. 
An election has been made to treat the goodwill arising on acquisition to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisitions in the year to 31 December 2016
The Group made 1 acquisition in the year ended 31 December 2016.
Turquoise SwapMatch Limited
On 1 1 July 2016, the Group acquired a 50% equity shareholding in Turquoise SwapMatch Limited (SwapMatch) for a cash consideration of £1 million. The main activity  
of SwapMatch is to provide a neutral platform allowing prime brokers to match and net off synthetic equity positions with other brokers. The fair value of net assets 
acquired was nil and the Group recognised £1 million in goodwill. Immediately following the acquisition, the Group made a £1 million cash investment in exchange for 
an additional 10% equity in SwapMatch. 
The valuation on the acquisition of SwapMatch was finalised during the current year and resulted in no change to the fair values attributed on acquisition.
During the current year, the Group purchased the remaining 40% equity interest of SwapMatch it did not already own. As at 31 December 201 7 , the Group holds  
a financial liability representing the fair value of associated earn out payments attached to the transaction.

32. Share schemes
The London Stock Exchange Group Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), approved at the 2016 AGM, has 2 elements, a conditional award of Performance Shares and an 
award of Matching Shares linked to investment by the executive of annual bonus in the Company’s shares – the latter element is not applicable to executive directors. 
Vesting of these awards is dependent upon the Company’s total shareholder return performance and adjusted basic earnings per share. Further details are provided in 
the Remuneration Report on pages 72 to 94. Awards are granted at nil cost to employees.
The SAYE Scheme and International Sharesave Plan provide for grants of options to employees who enter into a SAYE savings contract and options were granted at  
20 per cent below fair market value during the year.
The Group has an employee benefit discretionary trust to administer the share plans and to acquire the shares to meet commitments to Group employees. At the year 
end, 944,495 (2016: 376,456) shares were held by the trust, funded in part by an interest free loan from the Group and in part by the issue of 224,965 (2016: 1,930,380) 
shares and transfer of 1,757 ,77 4 (2016: nil) shares held in treasury. 
The Company has no employees but, in accordance with IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’, has the obligation for the assets, liabilities, income and costs  
of the employee benefit trust and these have been consolidated in the Group’s financial statements. The cost of the Group’s shares held by the trust are deducted  
from retained earnings.

The approach adopted by the Group in determining the fair value for the Performance and Matching Shares granted during the year was based on a Total Shareholder 
Return pricing model which incorporates TSR and EPS performance conditions and references the vesting schedules of the awards.
For all other share awards, including the Share Save Plan, the Black-Scholes model was used.
The significant inputs into both models are the share price at grant date, expected volatility, dividend yields and annual risk-free interest rate. The volatility assumption 
is based on the historical 3 year volatility as at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate represents the yield available on a UK zero-coupon government bond on the 
date of grant for a term commensurate with the vesting period of the award. The expected life refers to the time from the date of grant to the date the awards vest. 
Holders of share awards and share options are not entitled to receive dividends declared during the vesting period.

 • Extension of pre and post trade transparency to non-equity asset classes, 
including bonds and derivatives
 • Increased regulatory requirements for high frequency trading strategies  
and algorithmic trading

for trading venues
 • Platform trading obligation for shares and OTC derivatives
MAD/MAR political agreement reached at Level 1; 
work on technical aspects, Level 2 completed

also impact LSEG CCPs if required by rules to register as collection agents.)
Post Trade
CCPs EMIR Review 2.1 (REFIT) – The European Commission published a legislative proposal amending  
EMIR focused on proportionality of transaction-level requirements
 – The Proposal reduces the scope of the clearing obligations and margin 
requirements and proposes several changes to the reporting mechanisms 
(delegating ETD reporting to CCPs)
 – The final text is expected Q3 2018, in order to allow for an extension of  
the exemption from the clearing obligation for pensions funds
EMIR Review 2.2 (supervision of EU  
and third-country CCP) 
 – The EC Commission to amend EMIR on the supervision of EU and  
third-country CCPs 
 – For EU CCPs it proposes a more coordinated supervision of EU CCPs (ESMA)  
and an increased role for the central banks of issue 
 – For third country CCPs it introduces a two-Tier approach: 
 • Tier 1: Non-systemically important third country CCPs that can benefit  
from the current recognition system. 
 • Tier 2: Systemically important third country CCPs directly supervised by  
ESMA and that directly apply EMIR. 
 – In addition the Commission proposes a mechanism to deny the recognition  
of Tier 2 CCPs that are considered substantially too important to be recognised  
by ESMA and therefore be required to be established in the Union. 
 – The legislative Proposal is currently reviewed by the Council and the European 
Parliament. A final text is expected in H2 2018.
