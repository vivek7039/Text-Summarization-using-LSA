04 Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Performance overview
I am pleased to report our 2017 annual 
results. We achieved a record turnover 
of £536.8m with an underlying revenue 
growth of 14% at constant exchange 
rates*. We report an adjusted profit 
before tax of £109.1m* and a statutory 
profit before tax of £117.1m, an 
increase of 25% on an adjusted basis. 
Our total shareholder return during the 
year was 67%, ranking Renishaw in 
the top 25 in both the FTSE 250 and 
FTSE 350.
Renishaw is a long-term business 
and we remain committed to strategic 
investments and R&D. In addition, 
over the past year, we have focused 
on underperforming business areas 
resulting in our discontinuing the 
activities of Renishaw Diagnostics 
Limited and the spatial measurement 
business. In spite of the potential 
headwinds brought about by the 
uncertainty of Brexit, we remain 
confident of future growth due 
to our innovative product base, 
extensive global sales and marketing 
presence, and relevance to high-
value manufacturing.
Revenue
We achieved record turnover with 
revenue for the year ended 30th June 
2017 of £536.8m, compared with 
a restated £427.2m for last year, an 
increase of 26%. There was underlying 
revenue growth of 14% with the 
balance arising from exchange rate 
movements compared to the prior year.

Profit and earnings per share
During the year, it was established 
that certain foreign currency forward 
contracts used as hedging instruments 
for future incoming currency cash flows 
did not qualify for hedge accounting. 
This has resulted in the prior year profit 
before tax being restated and as a 
consequence the Board has introduced 
an alternative performance measure, 
adjusted profit before tax, to report 
the profitability on the basis that all 
forward contracts are accounted for as 
effective hedges. This measure will be

D Demonstration area at the new headquarters of Renishaw, Inc.
There was strong growth in our 
encoder, measurement and 
automation, calibration and 
coordinate measuring machine (CMM) 
product lines.
Adjusted operating profit for our 
metrology business was £115.9m 
(2016 restated: £90.0m). 
We have continued to invest in 
research and development, with total 
engineering costs in this business 
segment of £68.8m (before net 
capitalised development costs and the 
R&D tax credit) compared to a restated 
2016 of £60.9m, with a number of new 
product launches during the year. 
In our CMM product line, we 
launched a new, improved surface 
finish measurement probe for use 
with our REVO
®
 5-axis measurement 
system. The laser calibration product 
line launched the XM-60 multi-axis 
calibrator. Designed for the machine 
tool market, it is a highly accurate 
laser system used to capture multiple 
machine errors in a single set-up. In our 
encoder product line, we launched 
the VIONiC™ series, a new range of 
ultra-high accuracy, super-compact 
all-in-one digital incremental encoders.

Statutory profit before tax for the year 
was £117.1m compared to a restated 
£61.7m last year. Statutory earnings 
per share on continuing activities were 
141.3p compared to 71.8p last year.
This year’s tax charge on continuing 
operations amounts to £14.3m (2016 
restated: £10.0m) representing a 
tax rate of 12.2% (2016 restated: 
16.2%). The tax rate has benefited 
from the continued phasing in of the 
patent box tax regime and a reduction 
in the UK tax rate applied when 
calculating certain deferred tax assets 
and liabilities.
Metrology
Revenue from our metrology business 
for the year was £503.4m compared 
with a restated £398.9m last year.

market. Our additive manufacturing 
(AM) product line introduced the 
RenAM 500M machine and opened an 
additional two AM solutions centres in 
Germany and the USA.
Healthcare
Revenue from our healthcare business 
for the year was £33.4m, an increase 
of 18% over the £28.4m last year. 
We experienced growth in all our 
product lines.
Healthcare also saw continued 
investment in research and 
development, with total engineering 
costs in this business segment 
of £9.2m (before net capitalised 
development costs and the R&D tax 
credit) compared to a restated 2016 of 
£7.9m.
In our spectroscopy product line, we 
introduced the RA802 pharmaceutical 
analyser, designed exclusively for the 
pharmaceutical industry, enabling users 
to formulate tablets more efficiently 
by speeding up the analysis of tablet 
composition and structure.
The neurological product line continued 
to make sales of our stereotactic robot 
and associated neuroinspire planning 
software, with further sales in the UK, 
USA and Canada.
The medical dental product line has 
experienced good growth resulting 
from a continued focus on sales of 
additive manufacturing technologies 
into the healthcare market.
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 06 There was an adjusted operating loss 
of £7.2m, compared with a restated 
loss of £3.1m last year. We remain 
focused on moving this business 
sector into profit, where we have 
implemented a number of initiatives 
and are restructuring the neurological 
and medical dental businesses.
Discontinued activities
As reported in our October 2016 
trading update, the Board decided to 
discontinue operations at Renishaw 
Diagnostics Limited (RDL), resulting 
in the closure of the business. 
Subsequently, certain assets of the 
business have been sold.
The RDL business has been accounted 
for as a discontinued activity, with 
comparative figures for the previous 
year being restated accordingly. 
The loss after tax of £3.3m accounted 
for as a discontinued activity comprises 
the running costs for RDL, including 
cessation costs and impairment write 
offs for assets and goodwill, less 
amounts received. The loss after tax for 
the prior year was £2.5m.
In June 2017, after an extensive review 
of the spatial measurement business, 
the Board decided to discontinue 
this line of business. Including a 
goodwill impairment charge of £6.7m 
and provisions for the cessation of 
the trade, there was a net loss in 
this business for the year of £10.6m 
(2016: £1.5m).
Continued investment for  
long-term growth
The Group continues its strategy to 
invest for the long term, expanding 
our global marketing and distribution 
infrastructure, along with increasing 
manufacturing capacity and 
research and development activities. 
This year saw the completion of 
our new USA headquarters near 
Chicago and the sale of the previous 
premises. New facilities have also 
been completed in Detroit (USA) 
with expansion and refurbishment in 
Spain, Sweden, Hungary, Germany 
and France. We also converted our 
representative office in Turkey into a 
trading subsidiary to facilitate solution 
selling in the territory.
Our workforce at the end of June 2017 
was 4,530, an increase of 244 in the 
year, of which 91 were apprentices 
and graduates taken on as part of our 
on-going commitment to train and 
develop skilled resource for the Group 
in the future. 
Capital expenditure on property, 
plant and equipment for the year was 
£42.6m, of which £24.2m was spent 
on property and £18.4m on plant 
and equipment. 
Working capital
Group inventory decreased from 
£95.0m at the start of the year 
to £87.7m. We continue to focus 
on working capital management 
whilst remaining committed to our 
policy of holding sufficient finished 
inventory to ensure customer delivery 
performance, given our short order 
book of approximately five weeks. 
Trade debtors increased from £114.9m 
to £137.5m, with debtor days 
outstanding at the end of the current 
year at 73 days (2016: 70 days).
Net cash balances at 30th June 2017 
were £51.9m, compared with £21.3m 
at 30th June 2016. Additionally, there 
is an escrow account of £12.9m 
(2016: £15.3m) relating to the provision 
of security to the UK defined benefit 
pension scheme.
Directors and employees
Now that Will Lee has settled into his 
role as Group Sales and Marketing 
Director since his appointment earlier in 
the year, he will take over responsibility 
from John Deer for chairing the 
International Sales & Marketing Board 
from the start of the new financial year.
The directors would like to express 
their thanks to all employees for their 
invaluable support and contribution 
during the year.
Investor communications
Our fourth investor day was held 
on 11th May 2017, for existing and 
potential new investors. This event 
involves presentations on group 
strategy, business segments and 
product lines as well as tours 
covering the Group’s activities and an 
opportunity to meet the Board and 
senior management. There was also a 
Q&A session with the Board. The event

Strategic report
Chairman’s  
statement 
continued
*Previous year figures have been restated for the following:
1.  The results of Renishaw Diagnostics Limited and the spatial measurement 
business have been excluded, as these businesses have been reclassified as 
discontinued activities.
2.  The R&D tax credit, previously accounted for within the income tax expense line, has 
been reclassified to cost of sales, thereby showing it as part of the profit before tax. 
This reclassification increased the profit before tax by £2.4m for the year ended 30th 
June 2016.
3.  It has been established that certain foreign currency forward contracts used as 
hedging instruments for future incoming currency cash flows did not qualify for 
hedge accounting as they did not meet the hedge effectiveness criteria set out in 
the International Accounting Standard IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement’. To ensure technical compliance with this standard it has been 
necessary to restate the 2016 financial statements resulting in a £25.8m reduction to 
the profit before tax for that year and a corresponding increase in other comprehensive 
income. The consolidated net assets and cash balances were not impacted by the 
prior year adjustment and the future cash flows remain unchanged.
Alternative performance measures
Alternative performance measures are – Revenue at constant exchange rates, Adjusted 
profit before tax, Adjusted earnings per share and Adjusted operating profit. 
Revenue at constant exchange rates is defined as revenue recalculated using the same 
rates as were applicable to the previous year and excluding forward contract gains 
and losses.

investments in automation and  
user-friendly technology.
• Rising energy costs – increased 
demand for products that 
maximise output.
• Focus on reducing emissions and 
waste – increased demand for high 
performance products with ever 
tighter manufacturing tolerances and 
products that help minimise waste 
and rework.
• Population growth and rising 
incomes – increased consumption 
in our principal markets.
• Life expectancy rising globally – 
increased demand for healthcare 
products and continuing demand 
for consumer products.
We are also increasingly spreading 
risk through the diversification of 
our applications for product lines, 
our customer base and our routes 
to market.
Renishaw’s business has transitioned 
over recent years from primarily being 
a supplier of products to capital 
equipment manufacturers, to becoming 
much more focused on delivering 
a full solution directly to end-users. 
Our experience in our core product 
lines, which has highlighted that our 
global customers need assistance in 
solving their problems, is being carried 
across into our newer offerings.
Today, many of our product lines 
including measurement and 
automation, additive manufacturing and 
healthcare lines are primarily sold direct 
to the end-user. This helps to build 
brand loyalty and open up new revenue 
opportunities including hardware and 
software upgrades, the cross-selling 
of complementary products and 
maintenance contracts. 
Our business focus is to provide 
solutions for our customers across 
these highlighted markets and to be 
seen as a trusted technology partner 
meeting their needs.

airframe manufacture 
The manufacture of airframe 
components for modern aircraft 
demands precision and consistency. 
BAE Systems, the global defence, 
aerospace and security company, 
produces vital airframe components for 
the Eurofighter Typhoon which is flown 
by various air forces around the world.
Without periodic checking and 
maintenance, CNC machine tools can 
lose positioning accuracy and introduce 
errors over time. BAE Systems 
machines complex high-value airframe 
components, and turned to a wireless 
ballbar system to provide the machine 
tool diagnostics data it needed to 
maximise quality and productivity.

machined from titanium. This high-
strength, lightweight metal, which 
is resistant to high temperature 
and corrosion, is high in value and 
increasingly scarce, with stocks 
required to be reserved up to a year 
in advance. 
Utilising Renishaw’s QC20-W wireless 
ballbar, the company initiated a 
site-wide preventative maintenance 
programme to check 60 CNC machine 
tools on a defined weekly, monthly and 
annual basis. 
Through detailed interpretation of the 
QC20-W’s diagnostic data trends 
across all machine tools, BAE Systems 
established a dependable go/no-go 
error margin benchmark, against which 
all machines’ performance could be 
quickly checked. Any circularity error 
in CNC machine positional accuracy 
greater than 30 microns would demand 
immediate investigation. 
The efficiency with which ballbar-
trained machine tool operators 
could run diagnostic checks using 
the QC20-W meant they could be 
completed between part production 
runs with little adverse effect on 
machine tool throughput. 
Machine tool error diagnosis at BAE 
Systems has become virtually instant. 
Unacceptable machine tool down-
times – the result of lengthy and 
expensive investigations and repairs – 
have been drastically reduced, and the 
machine builder is no longer depended 
upon as the sole source of technical 
insight and support. 
With the help of Renishaw 
ballbar diagnostics BAE Systems 
has benefitted from significant 
improvements in workshop productivity 
and QA compliance.

Guangdong Medical University 
is developing a method 
for non-invasive prostate 
cancer screening 
New research at the Guangdong 
Medical University suggests a laser-
based approach could be the latest 
breakthrough in prostate cancer 
detection. The proposed non-invasive 
blood test uses a combination of two 
techniques: surface-enhanced Raman 
scattering and a new mathematical 
analysis technique called support 
vector machine – together, these 
techniques can produce an accuracy 
up to 98.1%. Professor Shaoxin Li, 
the study leader at the University 
commented, “Compared to traditional 
screening methods, this method has 
the advantage of being non-invasive,  
highly sensitive and very simple 
for prostate cancer screening. 
It is important to improve the survival 
of patients by early diagnosis 
and treatment. 
Currently, there are many diagnostic 
methods available—including B-mode 
ultrasound, CT scan, biopsy and 
histopathology assessment—but these 
techniques have various limitations. 
“We selected the inVia as a potential 
methodology to be used in prostate 
cancer screening, when coupled with 
our support vector machine, because 
it offers continuous scanning from 
50 to 4000 wavenumbers and its 
high sensitivity makes it suitable for 
biological tissue measurement.”

the future skillset of the organisation 
through training and promoting people 
from within, where possible.
  For further information see pages 56–58
Continual research creating  
strong market positions with 
innovative products
Renishaw is well known for its sector-
leading investment in R&D and 
engineering. “Apply innovation” is a 
way of life for Renishaw employees, not 
just a strap-line. We have continued 
to protect our core businesses with 
exciting new patented technology 
and process developments, whilst 
also diversifying into new product and 
market areas.
  For further information see pages 34–35
Efficient high-quality  
manufacturing

Strategic report
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 24 Focus on delivering  
solutions
Renishaw’s business has transitioned 
over recent years from primarily being 
a supplier of products to capital 
equipment manufacturers, to becoming 
much more focused on delivering a 
full solution directly to the end-user. 
Our experience in our core product 
lines, which has highlighted that our 
global customers need assistance in 
solving their problems, is being carried 
across into our newer offerings.
   For further information see pages 28–29
Global customer support
Renishaw is founded on the belief that 
excellent customer support delivers 
success. Our customers are often 
global, with an order being placed in 
one country, the product shipped to 
another and the eventual end-user 
often located on a different continent. 
By having “local” global support 
through our wholly-owned subsidiary 
network, we are able to assure 
customers that whatever their needs, 
we are able to support and assist 
them, resulting in a positive return on 
their investment.
Progress
Our worldwide service offering is 
growing so we can support our 
customers throughout the product life-
cycle. With the growth of our training 
facilities, technical support personnel, 
test and solution centres we can offer 
personal local support to the customer.
Consistent organic  
growth
Whilst Renishaw does invest for the 
long-term, it also closely manages 
costs at all levels and ensures that 
it does not undertake undue risks. 
It is through this approach that 
Renishaw has been able to deliver 
such a long-term track record of 
profitable growth.
Progress
Renishaw has further invested in the 
Group’s long-term business growth 
which this year focused on our 
continued recruitment and training of 
skilled people, our global marketing 
and distribution infrastructure, 
enhancing our ability to demonstrate 
our products and their applications, 
the infrastructure to support our 
additive manufacturing business, 
and our manufacturing capabilities. 
Our Spanish subsidiary and two 
of our American subsidiaries have 
relocated to larger premises and a 
further office has been established 
in California. This has allowed for 
the recruitment of extra sales and 
technical support staff. In November 
2016 our first North American Additive 
Manufacturing Solutions Centre 
(AMSC) in Canada was formally 
opened. Ongoing investments in 
manufacturing capacity and processes 
have given us an agile capability and 
increasing awareness of the benefits to 
be gained by adopting Industry 4.0 and 
Smart Factory philosophies to meet the 
demands of a record order book and 
quickly respond to short lead times.
Supplementing the  
business via niche  
acquisitions
We actively undertake acquisitions as a 
means to expand our product portfolio, 
quicken geographic market penetration 
and gain access to new patents, 
technologies and customers.
Progress
We continue to integrate acquired 
businesses and evaluate acquisition 
opportunities. We work closely 
with HiETA Technologies Limited, 
a UK company in which we have 
an investment that specialises in 
the design and delivery of additive 
manufacturing products such as heat 
exchangers for a range of applications 
– a complementary business for our 
additive manufacturing products line. 
We are also strengthening our acquisitions 
process and have considered various 
potential opportunities during the year.

Industrial metrology
Manufacturers driven by the 
goals of Industry 4.0 are 
increasingly recognising the 
importance of applying 
Renishaw technology throughout  
advanced manufacturing. The 
breadth of technologies and 
experience Renishaw provides 
during the entire manufacturing 
process is unique.
Geoff McFarland 
Group Engineering Director
Intelligent process control for 
Industry 4.0
Intelligent machining processes are a 
critical element in future manufacturing 
technology. With the widely publicised 
‘Industry 4.0’ and ‘Made in China 
2025’ initiatives combined with 
the ‘Industrial internet of things’, 
manufacturers are faced with 
an unparalleled opportunity.
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 26 Industry 4.0 is the current trend of 
automation and data exchange in 
manufacturing technologies to create 
what are known as ‘smart factories’. 
The ability to monitor key process 
inputs, analyse data and continuously 
improve manufacturing processes 
will facilitate increased productivity 
and higher accuracy, whilst reducing 
the dependency on skilled engineers. 
This, in turn, enables highly effective 
automated manufacturing systems 
to be implemented successfully.
Renishaw not only provides 
technologies and applications that 
deliver some of the benefits of 
Industry 4.0, data generated by 
Renishaw devices can also be used 
in conjunction with other process 
information from machines, cutting 
tools and other probes within predictive 
analytics systems for intelligent process 
optimisation and control.
Productive 
manufacturing processes
Simply measuring the final output 
of a manufacturing process using 
‘tailgate’ inspection is not enough 
and, more often, too late to control 
all the variability in a manufacturing 
process. It is critical that checks and 
measurements are also made before, 
during and immediately after machining 
to control both common-cause and 
special-cause variation.
The process control framework 
developed by Renishaw within our own 
factories has allowed us to minimise 
manufacturing costs and significantly 
reduce the skill levels required to 
support production. This has been 
achieved through a combination of 
integrated process control using our 
own products and application of 
factory automation. This approach is 
applicable to many industries using 
CNC machine tools. Moreover, the 
benefits we have experienced at 
Renishaw align closely with the goals 
of Industry 4.0.
Manufacturers driven by a focus 
on Industry 4.0 are increasingly 
recognising the importance of applying 
Renishaw technology throughout 
advanced manufacturing. The breadth 
of technologies and experience 
Renishaw provides during the entire 
manufacturing process is unique.
In the future, measurements provided 
by Renishaw devices will be used in 
conjunction with other data sources 
within a manufacturing process to 
allow real-time feedback for process 
optimisation, proactive adjustment and 
increased intelligence.
Data availability
Manufacturers can only make the most 
of their collected data if they have the 
means of using it when required. Today, 
most machine tools are equipped with 
a networking capability and have more 
accessible software architectures, 
making it simpler to facilitate 
communication between systems. 
As integrating sensors (including 
probes) and programming automated 
intelligent systems becomes easier, 
more manufacturers will be able to 
exploit the benefits of Industry 4.0.
The data collected through  
in-process measurement throughout 
the manufacturing process can also 
be used for continuous improvement. 
It allows manufacturers to understand 
what causes adverse effects during 
manufacturing and consider the 
key variables when designing and 
developing new processes.
From consumer electronics to 
aerospace components, products 
have shorter life cycles than ever 
before. Manufacturers must develop 
new products and processes more 
quickly to remain competitive. 
Intelligent processes allow high 
productivity and high-quality output 
despite the reduced process 
development window.
Additive manufacturing
The advent of metal additive 
manufacturing (AM) for serialised 
production, as opposed to prototyping, 
will bring further benefits for intelligent 
manufacturing. From medical implants 
to critical aerospace applications, 
customers are increasingly demanding 
more specialised parts to save weight 
or space, dramatically improve 
product performance and simplify 
assembly operations.
AM is allowing manufacturers more 
design freedom and the ability to 
produce prototype products more 
rapidly from which performance data 
can be quickly acquired to inform final 
design and manufacturing parameters. 
We will increasingly see a combination 
of both additive and subtractive 
technologies to gain the benefits of 
both processes, all led by data driven 
intelligence at every stage of the 
manufacturing process.

Race to innovate: How 
Renishaw helped Land Rover 
BAR in its attempt to win the 
America’s Cup
Renishaw is part of Land Rover BAR’s 
Technical Innovation Group which aims 
to bring together the best of British 
engineering to help win the America’s 
Cup. The oldest international trophy 
in world sport dating from 1851, it is 
the world’s premier sailing challenge 
(described as being like ‘Formula 1 
on water’) and has never been won 
by Britain.
Land Rover BAR made it to the 
semi-finals of the 35th edition of the 
America’s Cup, held this summer in 
Bermuda, with Renishaw’s AM and 
position encoder technology helping 
the first-time challenger to produce a 
boat that competed well against much 
more established teams.
America’s Cup Class (ACC) racing 
yachts use an innovative rigid wingsail. 
With the aerodynamics of an aeroplane 
wing, instead of lift, this vertical wing 
provides thrust and is efficient enough 
to propel the vessel up to four times 
faster than the speed of the wind 
driving it forward. The wingsail used 
by the Land Rover BAR race-yacht 
‘Rita’ (code-name: R1) has an area 
of 103 m
2
 and is 23.5 m high, which 
is comparable to a wing of a Boeing 
737 aeroplane. Clearly, there are many 
difficult engineering challenges involved 
in designing and building a huge 
functional wing with numerous moving 
parts, whilst ensuring sufficient strength 
and minimal weight.
Each hull on R1 features a T-shaped 
rudder and retractable board that 
bends beyond 90 degrees to create a 
hydrofoil. Once the boat speed reaches 
around 16 knots (18 mph) it starts 
foiling. The flow over the hydrofoils 
creates sufficient lift to ‘fly’ and both 
hulls rise clear of the water, reducing 
drag and increasing speed.
Race to innovate: metal AM 
manifolds improve power flow
On the R1, the control surfaces are 
all driven by hydraulic actuators. 
Hydraulic pressure is provided by 
the sweat and toil of the crew’s four 
‘grinders’, who turn specialised 
hand-cranks. There are no batteries 
(except to provide electrical power 
for computers and sensors), the 
four grinders act as a human 
engine to generate all the hydraulic 
energy required.
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 28 D  Metal 3D-printed hydraulic system parts made by Renishaw for Land Rover BAR. D  LinACE™ encoder from RLS repackaged 
into a waterproof enclosure.
Land Rover BAR understood the 
potential of additive manufacturing 
to save weight and improve the 
efficiency of its hydraulic system and 
worked with Renishaw engineers, who 
contributed by highlighting the manifold 
components which would most benefit 
from being manufactured using metal 
AM technology, by collaborating and 
advising on iterations, then producing 
the necessary parts.
The structure of these manifolds, which 
have multiple passageways, helps 
improve the flow of hydraulic fluid from 
one part of the boat to another, and 
are lighter than conventional manifolds. 
This streamlining helps the grinders 
conserve energy whilst still allowing the 
boat to perform at the optimal level.
Traditionally, hydraulic block manifolds 
are manufactured from an aluminium 
alloy or stainless steel billet which 
has been cut and machined to size. 
This is followed by drilling at 90-degree 
angles to create the flow pathways. 
Specialised tooling is often needed due 
to the complex drilling that is required. 
Passages require blanking plugs to 
properly direct flow through the system.
The nature of the traditional 
manufacturing process results in abrupt 
angled junctions which slow down the 
flow of hydraulic fluid, often leading 
to a loss of power. By using additive 
manufacturing technology, you can 
design in and build smooth rounded 
corners which promote the flow of fluid 
and improve efficiency. Another benefit 
is the significant weight saving against 
a traditional block manifold where 
material must be cut away, leaving 
surplus non-essential weight and an 
over-specification wall thickness.
Additive manufacturing builds up parts 
layer by layer, applying material only 
where it is required, leading to a much 
lighter part. The wall thickness of the 
manifold can be adjusted so that it is 
fit for function and all manifolds used 
on the boat are customised and built 
in titanium to be both lightweight 
and strong.
Whilst the actual parts produced 
by Renishaw for R1 remain highly 
confidential, the manifolds designed 
in CAD software by Land Rover BAR 
were sent to Renishaw, where they 
were prepared for production using its 
QuantAM software. The build file was 
then sent to a Renishaw AM system, 
which produced the complex parts 
by melting successive layers of metal 
powder using a high-powered laser.
R1 is an incredibly advanced racing 
catamaran that pushes the boundaries 
of what technology can provide and it 
truly was a ‘race to innovate’ to turn 
around the optimum parts, in time for 
the America’s Cup. The challenge was 
immense with many design changes, 
demanding timescales and rapid 
production of parts running up to a 
fixed race day, but the ability of additive 
manufacturing to produce many 
iterations rapidly was a major benefit to 
the collaborative process.
Race to innovate: digital 
position feedback
As mentioned earlier, the 
control surfaces on R1 are all 
driven by hydraulic actuators. 
During development, Land Rover BAR 
realised that precision knowledge 
of their sail wing settings could be 
compromised by the tenuous link 
between the hydraulic actuators 
and the control surfaces or flaps. 
These linkages are ropes with a 
high degree of compliance, so the 
position of each actuator is often 
only an approximate measure of the 
actual flap angle. They again asked 
Renishaw to collaborate in designing 
a robust solution.
A team of Renishaw’s encoder 
products specialists rose to the 
challenge and designed a bespoke 
magnetic encoder solution, 
based around technology from 
Renishaw’s associate company 
RLS. The LinACE™ product is an 
extremely robust absolute linear 
cylindrical encoder system designed 
for integration into hydraulic, pneumatic 
and electromechanical actuators as 
a feedback element for position or 
velocity closed-loop applications.
Due to the extreme conditions faced 
at sea, with high-speed winds and 
salt spray, magnetic encoders were 
deemed to be the only viable option, 
as open optical encoders would 
face real challenges due to the 
requirement to maintain a clear optical 
path between readhead and scale. 
Magnetic encoders can be fully sealed 
to give much greater contamination 
resistance and due to space limitations 
surrounding the highly loaded wing 
ribs, the use of LinACE modules meant 
that the Renishaw team could design a 
new encoder that minimised the size of 
hole needed within the wing rib.
The new design of position encoders 
were installed on the control surfaces 
of both the wing flaps and the port 
and starboard rudders, with numerous 
changes made to ruggedise the 
LinACE encoder and make it durable 
enough for life at sea. 
Position feedback from the encoders 
is used in real-time on the boat by the 
wing trimmer, allowing the boat to race 
with more precision, whilst enabling the 
capture of high-quality performance 
data that can be analysed to improve 
general efficiencies and accuracies.
With both additive manufacturing 
and encoders, Renishaw worked 
within the short timescales and high 
specifications requested by Land Rover 
BAR, to deliver world-class solutions.

has been important to work 
closely with them to educate

Will Lee  
Group Sales and Marketing Director
Will Lee, Group Sales and Marketing 
Director, was asked to talk about 
Renishaw’s approach to developing its 
global network of service and support 
operations – here is a summary of 
his thoughts: 
Strategic report
Our strategy in action – 
Strong market presence
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 30 Q.  Why does Renishaw 
have such a strong 
global presence?
A.  We exported our products from 
very early on in the Company’s 
history, so exporting is very natural 
to us. Our co-founder John Deer 
was very clear from the start that 
we needed to give excellent support 
to our customers and if we did 
that, then sales would follow as we 
would become a trusted supplier. 
We have always been prepared to 
invest in our support capabilities and 
initially our overseas operations in 
markets such as the USA, Japan 
and Germany, were only set up for 
service and support – it was only 
later that they started to focus on 
sales and marketing activities. It is 
also true that throughout our history 
we have been prepared to invest 
early where there is the potential for 
long-term growth.
Q.  Why is a local presence so 
important for Renishaw?
A.  Our products have often been 
unique and disruptive, offering new 
ways of solving our customers’ 
problems, so it has been important 
to work closely with them to train 
their engineers. Although machinery 
and the application of our products 
may be common across the globe, 
business practices, local customs, 
levels of technical expertise and 
of course language, are very 
different, so employing local 
people is a necessity to be taken 
seriously. There are also the simple 
practicalities of having Renishaw 
people easily accessible to provide 
fast engineering support and 
answer queries. 
  Our model is therefore to use the 
strength of our UK operations 
for product development, but to 
decentralise decision-making to our 
subsidiary network, allow our local 
offices to make fast decisions and 
also to tailor sales and marketing 
messages, and customer solutions, 
to their specific needs.
Q.  What is the process for 
opening new offices?
A.  We start by determining which 
new markets offer the best growth 
potential and then what type of 
infrastructure we require to achieve 
our medium-term aims. Our current 
focus is to build capabilities within 
larger regional offices which 
can then support smaller offices 
within their geographic region, so 
demonstration and training facilities 
may not be initially required.
  Where we do decide to invest in 
a new country office we prefer to 
be optimistic about the long-term 
potential and ‘over invest’, as from 
years of experience we have learnt 
how difficult it can be to have to 
move/expand offices too soon after 
first opening.
Q.  What is your current focus 
in relation to Renishaw’s 
subsidiary network?
A.  Given our more solutions-based 
focus and increasing market 
requirements to work on projects 
with much greater levels of product 
integration, the requirements to 
service our customers is changing. 
This is driving the need for more 
skilled applications engineers and 
a greater investment to upskill 
our employees. 
  To meet these demands we are 
developing more of a regional 
approach to customer service and 
the wider sharing of resources 
across individual markets. 
Q.  Are there plans to open any 
new offices?
A.  Our main focus currently is 
upgrading existing country 
offices so that they are better 
equipped to service our customer 
base and to best promote our 
industrial metrology offering and 
new products, especially additive 
manufacturing. For example, we 
have recently improved, or moved 
to new facilities, in Italy, Spain, 
France and Taiwan, whilst we have 
also opened a new local office in 
California, and opened a series of 
Additive Manufacturing Solutions 
Centres in India, Canada and 
Germany. However, we do continue 
to monitor opportunities to enter 
new markets with growth potential.
Q.  Despite having offices in 
35 countries Renishaw still 
use distributors in those 
countries – why is that?
A.  When we first enter a market, our 
existing distributors in that market 
are very important to help educate 
our staff and make introductions 
to key customers. The changing 
nature of those relationships over 
time will depend on many local 
factors, including the strength of 
each distributor, but typically we 
may focus on key accounts and the 
distributors will service end-users 
and smaller accounts. We may 
also use specialist distributors to 
handle certain products outside 
the core metrology products, for 
example, Raman spectrometers 
and position encoders.
  Generally, we like the flexibility 
that distributors give us, especially 
given that we simply do not have 
the resources to tackle all business 
opportunities ourselves. What is 
also true is that having a local office 
and local relationships with 
distributors is key to ensuring that 
those distributors remain motivated 
to act in the best interests 
of Renishaw.
Q.  How do you manage your 
travel schedule?
A.  Travel is critical to understanding 
developing business opportunities, 
new products we need to develop to 
meet varying customer challenges, 
and also importantly to meet and 
motivate our own employees.

Efficient high-quality  
manufacturing
Manufacturing overview
During the last year, the manufacturing 
operations have continued to support 
significant activity levels for all product 
lines, the development of in-house 
processes to support new product 
development and growth for the 
future of the additive manufacturing 
businesses. Investment has 
continued in the improvement of key 
manufacturing processes associated 
with increased volumes and developing 
capability for specific product lines 
such as AM.
Strategy
At a strategic level, Renishaw’s 
manufacturing operations are highly 
vertically integrated. This is as a result 
of our commitment to delivering 
exceptional service levels in terms of 
delivery, service and product quality 
to our customers. This approach also 
ensures that we are in control of our 
costs, quality and many of the supply 
chains that are critical to the success 
of our business. This approach 
has continued during the year with 
substantial investments in processes 
and capital to support organic growth 
and efficiency improvements for core 
product lines, and the development of 
the AM business.
Over many years, we have strived to 
ensure our products are designed to 
optimise manufacturing capability, 
whether in relation to our machining 
and assembly processes, or that 
of third-party suppliers. This is best 
illustrated by our approach to metal 
cutting, where a high degree of 
standardisation has been applied to the 
hardware used to perform machining 
operations, since we have an excellent 
understanding of process capability 
for each platform. A secondary benefit 
to this strategy is that it provides the 
ability to upscale production through 
duplication, as required, without the 
need to invent alternative techniques, 
and this has been key to delivering the 
growth in our turnover in recent years.

are applied to design for assembly 
and test during product and process 
development, and during the last 
year, a number of new products have 
transferred from pre-production to 
the assembly sites in the UK, Ireland 
and India.
The Group has manufacturing facilities 
in the UK (Woodchester 165,000 sq ft,  
Stonehouse 100,000 sq ft, Miskin

and the USA (Grand Haven 14,000 sq ft).
Long-term investment
Renishaw continues to be committed 
to significant investment in its 
manufacturing capability for both the 
medium and long-term. The Renishaw 
Automated Mill Turn Inspection Centre 
(RAMTIC) system developed in the 
early 1990s uses a standard machine 
tool platform that has been modified to 
provide a highly efficient manufacturing 
solution, involving a high degree of 
automation and closed-loop control 
that is facilitated by Renishaw probing 
technology for tool setting, in-process 
monitoring and component validation. 
Whilst the base machine platform has 
evolved with improvements in machine 
tool technology, the fundamental 
process remains the same and is 
the mainstay of Renishaw’s standard 
machining platforms for prismatic 
parts, with 62 RAMTIC systems now 
in operation. 
The same approach has also been 
taken with respect to our investments 
in assembly-based technologies. 
Renishaw has a very broad product 
range that is largely produced in low 
to medium volumes, but through 
our strategies of standardisation 
and design for manufacture we 
have created the circumstances to 
develop and invest in highly efficient 
and capable assembly systems that 
deliver exceptional process control 
and efficiencies. The electronics 
production facilities utilise the very 
latest technology capable of placing 
40,000 components per hour, process 
control by using in-line component 
validation, automated optical inspection 
and innovative technology to validate 
the performance of assembled printed 
circuit boards (PCBs). Another example 
is the in-house development of 
automation systems for assembly of 
certain products in the UK and Ireland 
facilities, where automation and closed-
loop controls have delivered significant 
reductions in process variation, hence 
providing enhanced product quality,  
as well as reducing our costs.
There has been continual and 
substantial investment in the latest 
manufacturing technologies in order 
to optimise the cost and capability of 
our manufacturing systems, where 
investment in new equipment in the  
UK over the period 2010 to 2017 has 
been £37m.
D  The PCB assembly facility at Miskin 
includes technology capable of placing 
40,000 components per hour.
Supply chain management
As a manufacturer operating in a 
high-mix/low-volume situation, with 
a strategy of delivering exceptional 
customer service, our approach has 
been to maintain as much control as 
possible of our supply chains. This has 
been achieved through a combination 
of in-house manufacturing (including 
the creation of in-house capability for 
critical processes as they become 
financially viable), duplication of critical 
processes, dual sourcing and strategic 
long-term partnerships with our third-
party suppliers. We also have supply 
chain management teams based in 
China, India and Ireland.
Risk management
We have duplicated key processes in 
order to reduce the risks associated 
with certain critical in-house supply 
chains such as machining, anodising 
of aluminium components and the 
assembly and test of electronic 
PCBs. For third-party supply chains, 
regular monitoring and review takes 
place with a view to determining 
supply risk, including implementing 
dual sourcing strategies and 
reviewing our contractual terms with 
suppliers to ensure continuity of 
supply. Processes have also been 
implemented and enhanced within our 
supply chains to ensure compliance 
with our Group Business Code, and 
the UK anti-bribery and modern 
slavery legislation.
People
Consistent with the strategy in 
other parts of the business, the 
manufacturing operations take 
a long-term view with regard to 
development of people. In many 
cases employees transfer from 
manufacturing into other parts of the 
business to assist other roles such 
as new product development or 
applications engineering, making best 
use of the experience gained within the 
manufacturing arena.
The investment in apprentices 
and graduates is very much in 
evidence at each manufacturing site. 
All manufacturing graduates and 
apprentices follow a well-defined 
programme that provides exposure 
to a wide range of functions and 
technologies such that we develop 
well-rounded individuals with a 
broad grounding in a variety of 
manufacturing-related disciplines. 
Many of our apprentices and graduates 
succeed in developing career paths 
into more senior engineering and 
operational roles within the organisation 
(for example, see pages 56–58).
Progress at a glance
During the last year, investment 
in manufacturing facilities and 
equipment has continued to 
ensure that future requirements 
can be satisfied in a highly efficient 
and cost-effective manner.
The factory floor space at the 
Miskin facility, refurbished during 
2016, provides substantial 
capacity for future growth of the 
business. In addition, outline 
planning permission exists for 
further development and capacity 
to be provided at that facility.
Substantial capital investments 
and process development activities 
have continued to provide both 
in-house piece part manufacturing 
capabilities and new assembly 
processes to support current 
and new products within the 
AM business.
Production of various products 
have transferred to alternative 
assembly locations in the UK, 
Ireland and India as a result 
of capacity forecasts or the 
completion of new product 
development activities.
A team dedicated to packaging 
design has been established 
with the remit of optimising the 
materials, labour and logistics 
costs associated with our 
products, which is increasingly 
important given the global 
distribution network of the Group.

innovative products
ATOM™ – miniaturising 
innovation in the 
encoder business
Modern high-volume production 
processes, such as semiconductor 
manufacturing, demand production-line 
machines with ever smaller footprints 
to maximise productivity while also 
continually improving accuracy and 
throughput. This results in growing 
demand for smaller and lighter position 
sensors. These position sensors, often 
referred to as encoders, comprise 
a readhead (an optical movement 
sensor) paired with a scale (an 
accurately marked ruler). The readhead 
measures position by directly sensing 
the regularly-spaced scale markings. 
A smaller readhead allows installation 
in tight spaces and a lower mass 
also reduces inertia to enable higher 
accelerations of the moving parts of 
the machine.
The ATOM miniature optical encoder 
was launched in 2014 and is 
Renishaw’s smallest incremental 
encoder product. It remains one 
of the most compact optical 
encoder solutions on the market. 
ATOM is the only miniature encoder to 
use Renishaw’s unique optics engine 
with patented filtering technology, 
which imparts several advantages 
when compared with other types of 
miniature encoder, including better dirt 
immunity, lower cyclic error (improved 
accuracy) and higher resolution.
One of the greatest technical 
challenges in the design of ATOM was 
shrinking the optics of pre-existing 
compact encoders, such as the 
TONiC™ series. ATOM readheads 
occupy less than half the volume of the 
TONiC equivalent.
Advanced manufacturing
ATOM readheads are too small to easily 
build by hand and so ATOM is the first 
Renishaw readhead to be assembled 
with an automated process, which 
also decreases process variability, 
leading to lower production costs 
and more consistent product quality. 
An automated assembly process 
provides significant flexibility of capacity 
that allows the rate of production to 
be readily increased from low to high. 
Multiple readheads can pass through 
the assembly process simultaneously.
The ATOM readhead is designed such 
that fine alignment and assembly 
operations are performed from one 
side of the product only and robot arms

head incorporates ATOM incremental 
rotary encoders. 
are used for component/subassembly 
transfer between each process stage. 
This is a largely unmanned assembly 
system with no human observers 
so continuous process checking 
is essential.
All parts must first be correctly 
orientated by means of bowl-
feeders and shaped feed-chutes. 
Automatic part identification is 
achieved by various means such as 
RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) 
tags and advanced image processing 
techniques. Furthermore, a Renishaw 
TP20 touch-trigger probe is used 
to calibrate the scale and readhead 
body datum positions during the 
assembly process. Correct alignment 
of the optical components within 
the readhead is achieved by a 
combination of optical checking and 
output feedback from the encoder 
sensor itself.
ATOM and the REVO-2
One of the first commercial applications 
of ATOM was in a new metrology 
product developed at Renishaw. 
The REVO system is one of Renishaw’s 
flagship products and enables CMM 
users to perform 5-axis measurement 
on a 3-axis CMM. It measures 
thousands of points per second and 
operates at speeds up to 500 mm/s. 
As the head is much lighter and 
more dynamic than the CMM, it can 
quickly follow changes in the part 
geometry without introducing harmful 
dynamic errors.
REVO-2 is an improved version that 
builds upon the successful REVO 
system with enhanced power and 
communications capability to carry the 
latest REVO probes such as the RVP 
vision measurement probe.
The original REVO product featured a 
custom-designed encoder with a fine 
pitch 12 micron phase scale developed 
before highly accurate miniature 
encoders had been brought to market. 
REVO-2 incorporates Renishaw’s latest 
ATOM incremental rotary encoder with 
RCDM rotary (angle) glass scales on 
both of its axes (yaw and pitch). It is the 
first product to have the ATOM encoder 
designed-in at the concept stage. 
Each 20 micron-pitch RCDM glass 
disc (Ø68 mm diameter) is face-read 
by a dual-readhead setup which helps 
to optimise REVO-2 performance by 
eliminating rotational eccentricity error.
The readheads are connected, via 
an analogue filter and analogue-to-
digital converter (ADC), to REVO-2’s 
electronics. ATOM, with its highly 
automated manufacturing that 
minimises process variability to 
assure the best quality and the shortest 
lead times, was chosen by REVO-2’s  
design team as the most cost- 
effective solution.
In this application, ATOM offers 
leading-edge accuracy and speed 
that enable excellent servo-loop gain 
levels for outstanding position holding 
and accurate surface scanning of 
parts/components. The ATOM system 
was also chosen for several design 
features including: 
• its mechanical simplicity and optical 
disc alignment method using a 
microscope camera system for 
improved installed accuracy;
• ease of setup in conjunction with 
REVO-2’s electronics, allowing both 
incremental signal calibration and 
auto-phasing of reference marks 
without oscilloscopes or external 
equipment; and
• availability of chrome-on-glass rotary 
scale, with highly accurate scale 
markings enables REVO-2 to achieve 
a resolution of 0.002 arc seconds, 
delivering high precision over the full 
operating temperature range.
Richard Toller, Technical Manager for 
Renishaw’s CMM Products Division, 
explains: “The ATOM encoder 
provides a level of plug-and-play 
convenience that simply didn’t exist 
before. The ease of installation and 
alignment coupled with excellent 
technical support allowed the REVO-2 
design team to fully meet the design 
specification whilst reducing overall 
production cycle time.”
To summarise, ATOM helps to 
streamline the REVO-2 manufacturing 
process, while still providing 
exceptional metrology performance. 
ATOM is designed to support 
manufacturing and servicing operations 
with streamlined installation and robust 
calibration procedures, in addition 
to Renishaw’s unrivalled technical 
support. The effects on the REVO-2  
production process are reduced 
process cycle times, higher unit yields, 
greater efficiency and lower production 
costs. REVO and ATOM are leading 
metrology products that are now 
combined in the powerful REVO-2.

Performance – Overview
Review of 2017
This was a record year for revenue 
and whilst there was a boost from 
currency due to the Sterling weakening 
following the UK vote to leave the 
EU, there was still underlying growth 
at constant exchange rates of 14%. 
All product lines experienced growth, 
including strong growth for the position 
encoder line, which benefited from 
strong investments in the electronics 
sector in the Far East. This provided 
us with the confidence to continue our 
ongoing investments for the long-term 
sustainability of the Group, including 
global marketing and distribution 
infrastructure, the recruitment and 
training of skilled employees and 
new product development and 
manufacturing capacity.
The year saw continuing high levels of 
capital investment in the development 
and refurbishment of property. The new 
133,000 sq ft headquarters facility for 
Renishaw, Inc. was completed and is 
occupied, allowing us to consolidate 
operations from two existing sites, 
including the 37,500 sq ft  
former headquarters building which 
was sold for US$3.2m. The new 
building at West Dundee, Illinois, is 
much better aligned to our ‘solutions 
provider’ strategy with excellent 
customer demonstration and training 
facilities. In the USA we also completed 
a new 20,000 sq ft building in Detroit, 
Michigan, for Renishaw Advanced 
Consulting and Engineering, Inc., a 
business that we acquired in 2014 to 
help support sales of CMM products 
and Equator gauging systems in the 
USA. A small office has also been 
established in California to support 
customers within the electronics sector.
It was a very good year for Renishaw 
with record revenue for the Group and 
strong growth in both revenue and 
profit compared to the previous year. 
Investment for long-term business growth 
continued, including the recruitment 
and training of skilled people, new 
product development, manufacturing 
capacity and global marketing and 
distribution infrastructure.
D  Renishaw products, such as the SPRINT scanning system, are meeting market 
needs for ever-tighter production tolerances.
D  Renishaw Additive Manufacturing 
Solutions Centres provide a secure 
development environment.
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 36 During the year, refurbishment of 
existing premises in Italy, France (Paris) 
and Sweden was completed, whilst in 
Spain, our subsidiary for the Spanish 
and Portuguese markets relocated 
to a new facility close to Barcelona, 
which has given them three times 
the space of their former building. 
As well as a new showroom which 
follows the highly successful template 
of the Renishaw Innovation Centre, 
the new Spanish office includes an 
additive manufacturing lab which 
includes material development facilities 
and post-processing equipment for 
3D-printed metal parts. The ongoing 
investment in infrastructure to support 
our additive manufacturing business 
also saw the formal opening of our first 
North American Additive Manufacturing 
Solutions Centre (AMSC) in November 
2016. Based in Kitchener, Canada 
and close to our existing office, it is 
one of a global network that is being 
established to increase the adoption of 
AM technology by providing a secure 
development environment in which 
our customers can expand their AM 
knowledge and confidence to enable it 
to be deployed in their own facilities for 
volume production.

In Mexico, work is nearing completion 
of a new building that will provide 
expansion space for sales and 
marketing operations. In October 
2016, a new 11,800 sq ft office in 
Taiwan was formally opened, allowing 
enhanced commercial and technical 
support to customers through 
product showrooms, training and 
demonstration facilities.
In the UK, we continued to expand 
our manufacturing facilities, with 
further expenditure on plant and 
equipment to enable the Group to 
meet the demands of a record order 
book. Following refurbishment, the 
Old Town site in Wotton-under-Edge is 
now being used as an R&D facility for 
metrology product development, whilst 
at the Miskin site in South Wales, the 
Healthcare Centre of Excellence was 
formally opened by the First Minister of 
Wales in September 2016.
We continued to invest in our global 
IT infrastructure to support all the new 
and refurbished facilities, including 
ongoing investments in regional data 
centres to improve performance across 
our subsidiary network.
The skills agenda continues to be a 
major topic of conversation amongst 
engineering and science-based 
businesses, with strong competition 
for the best talent that will ensure 
the future success of the business. 
We continue to work hard regionally 
and nationally to promote engineering 
as a desirable career and Renishaw 
as a desirable employer (see CSR 
report pages 54–63 on Education and 
Community). With such a competitive 
environment for skilled people, we were 
very pleased to again be recognised 
for our graduate recruitment by 
The JobCrowd (a UK graduate job 
review website). We received a Highly 
Commended Award for the benefits 
package offered to graduates, rated 
second behind winner Volkswagen 
UK. We have a planned intake of 
45 graduates and 48 apprentices 
this summer, whilst our in-house 
academy delivered 3,050 training 
days (2016: 6,500), with the reduction 
primarily due to changes to our 
graduate induction and apprenticeship 
programmes, which meant that less 
time was spent with the academy in 
favour of more ‘on-the job’ training.
During the year there were various 
awards for Renishaw including the 
prestigious Company of the Year award 
presented at the 2016 NMI awards 
(NMI is the UK trade association 
representing the electronic systems, 
microelectronics and semiconductor 
communities). There were also 
awards for products, including the 
XM-60 multi-axis calibrator winning 
the German MM Award for Innovation 
in the Measuring Systems category 
and a TASIA (The Analytical Scientist 
Innovation Award) 2016 award for our 
LiveTrack™ focus-tracking technology 
for Raman imaging.
Market conditions
As reported last year, we were already 
seeing a favourable environment for 
our position encoders line due to 
new investments in LED manufacture 
and the semiconductor sector. 
These investments have continued 
this year and have been boosted 
by a major investment cycle in flat 
panel display (FPD) manufacture in 
the Far East, where a combination 
of the right products, backed up by 
our excellent reputation for customer 
service, including delivery and 
engineering support, has enabled 
us to win significant business in this 
sector. With ever-shorter lead times 
demanded by this market, our ongoing 
investments in manufacturing capacity 
have given us an agile capability 
that allows us to quickly respond to 
such demands.
As well as strong trade in the Far East 
electronics sector, on a global basis 
we are continuing to see ongoing 
investment in production systems 
and processes, including automation, 
aided by an increasing awareness of 
the benefits to be gained by adopting 
Industry 4.0 and Smart Factory 
philosophies (see pages 26–27). 
Key sectors such as aerospace, 
automotive and energy require 
Renishaw systems to meet their need 
for ever tighter production tolerances 
and cost controls.
Strategy
To meet our key strategic aims, we 
continued to make investments, 
which this year included focusing on 
enhancing our ability to demonstrate 
our products and their applications, 
the infrastructure to support our 
additive manufacturing business, our 
manufacturing capabilities to meet the 
strong growth in business, and our 
continuing drive to develop a strong 
market presence in both established 
and emerging markets.
We continued to invest heavily in R&D 
to create strong market positions 
through technology leadership, 
with £78.0m (before net capitalised 
development costs and the R&D 
tax credit) expenditure on R&D and 
engineering during the year. We filed 27 
new patent applications and there were 
74 previously filed applications granted 
this year.
Another important aspect of our 
strategy is to utilise our existing 
technologies across different product 
lines; for example, the Z-axis on 
our new RenAM 500M additive 
manufacturing system, and the 
new REVO-2 measuring head (see 
page 35) all incorporate our optical 
encoders. Our MODUS
™
 metrology 
software platform, initially created for 
CMM applications, is also increasingly 
being applied across our metrology 
lines, and during the year, a new 
group was created to focus on its 
future development.
During the year we established a 
new subsidiary in Turkey to expand 
our marketing, sales, service and 
distribution infrastructure in this 
growing economy.

Performance – Metrology
During the year there were some 
notable AM collaborative projects 
announced, particularly in the 
aerospace sector. In the UK, Renishaw 
is contributing its expertise to a 
project called WINDY (Wing Design 
Methodology Validation), being led 
by Airbus in the UK, to develop 
an innovative way of designing 
and manufacturing aircraft wings. 
Airbus is creating an AM facility at 
its Filton, UK site, which includes a 
new Renishaw RenAM 500M system, 
whilst in Spain the same system has 
also been installed at the Centre for 
Advanced Aerospace Technologies 
(CATEC) in Seville, which focuses 
its activity on the promotion of R&D 
activities within the aerospace sector 
in Andalusia, actively developing new 
technologies and the transfer of best 
practices. Renishaw is working with 
CATEC and other organisations in a 
Spanish Government funded project 
called Futuralve. Led by ITP , the aero 
engines and turbines manufacturer, 
the project’s objective is to create 
advanced material and manufacturing 
technologies for a new generation of 
high-speed turbines for the aerospace 
sector. With increasing interest from the 
aerospace industry, Renishaw attended 
the Paris Air Show for the first time.
Outside Europe, Rapid Advanced 
Manufacturing (RAM3D) has opened 
a new facility in New Zealand, the 
biggest Australasian centre for metal 
3D printing, where it is collaborating 
with Renishaw and using several of 
our AM250 additive manufacturing 
systems to help companies from a 
range of sectors, including aerospace, 
defence and consumer products, to 
explore the benefits of AM. In China, an 
agreement was signed with FalconTech 
Co, Ltd. to become an additive 
manufacturing solutions centre partner 
and distributor for our AM technology. 
Under the partnership, FalconTech, 
which is focused on the rapid 
manufacturing of high-performance 
components for sectors including 
aerospace, biomedical and marine, 
will set up an AM centre in Wuxi and 
purchase 10 RenAM 500M systems by 
October 2018.
Market conditions
The drivers for our metrology business 
are similar across the world. Many of 
our lines are benefiting from global 
skills shortages in the engineering 
sector, requiring increased investments 
in automation to offset the need for 
highly-skilled machine operators 
and demanding user-interfaces and 
software that are easier to operate. 
Manufacturers are also faced with 
a relentless drive to reduce costs, 
Performance
As already reported, there was strong 
growth for our position encoder line, 
but all other metrology lines also grew, 
with strong growth also achieved in 
our measurement and automation, 
calibration and co-ordinate measuring 
machine product lines. The calibration 
line includes fibre-optic laser encoders, 
which are the finest resolution and 
highest accuracy position feedback 
systems offered by Renishaw. With a 
sub-nanometre (less than one billionth 
of a metre) resolution capability at 
velocities of up to two metres per 
second for an axis length of up to four 
metres, these encoders have this year 
benefited from growth in applications 
within the semiconductor industry.
The measurement automation 
products line, currently focused on the 
Equator™ gauging system, continues 
to see high levels of global success 
in the automotive, electronics and 
aerospace sectors, with integration 
within automation cells continuing 
to be a notable trend. To meet the 
growing demand for the latter, new 
IPC (intelligent process control) 
software was launched during the 
year which allows Equator systems to 
be fully integrated into manufacturing 
processes, either connected to one 
or multiple machine tools, or within 
fully automated manufacturing cells. 
The software allows tool offsets to 
be automatically updated after parts 
have been machined and inspected, 
ensuring that the process is kept within 
control limits.
The position encoders line and our 
associate company RLS, continue 
to derive particular benefit from the 
ongoing global drive towards industrial 
automation which aims to increase 
capacity and flexibility, whilst reducing 
manufacturing lead times and costs. 
This sector, like LED and flat panel 
manufacture, requires rapid, reliable 
and accurate measurement of position 
between moving parts. The market 
for industrial robots is also growing, 
with the introduction of smart factory 
concepts seeing the expansion of 
new robotic applications into light 
industries, such as 3C product 
assembly (computing, communication 
and consumer) and other automatic 
production lines, where robots with 
high precision and high flexibility are 
required. The use of collaborative 
robots (‘cobots’) is increasing, working 
closely with people to help finish 
production tasks through simple, fast 
programming or even self-learning 
processes. Denmark-based Universal 
Robots is a market leader in this field 
and their multi-axis collaborative robots 
use RLS AksIM magnetic absolute 
rotary encoders for position feedback.
Investment continues in the AM 
products line, which includes the LBC 
business in Germany (specialising 
in AM parts manufacture, including 
conformally cooled mould tools and 
tool inserts for injection moulding 
and die-casting applications) and 
the previously mentioned Additive 
Manufacturing Solutions Centres.
v  The new Trigger Logic™ 
app simplifies the process 
of configuring a Renishaw 
machine tool probe.
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 38 shorten lead times, meet the need 
for increased complexity and closer 
tolerances in product design, and 
supply into markets where shorter 
product life-cycles are compressing 
times for process development. 
Renishaw technologies provide them 
with proven solutions to keep machines 
running reliably, maximise output from 
those machines, assist fast changeover 
between different products, and 
significantly reduce the time taken to 
inspect finished components.
A key sector for Renishaw continues to 
be the civil aviation market. The 2017 
Boeing Global Market Forecast sees 
the need for 41,000 new aircraft by 
2036 to meet growing demands 
and the replacement of aircraft 
within the current commercial fleet. 
Growth is seen as being due to the 
rise in middle-income travellers in 
developing markets such as China and 
India, and Boeing believes that over 
this period, Asia will need more than 
16,000 new aircraft (39% of global 
demand). Renishaw products are used 
heavily in the aerospace sector and 
the drive to “lightweight” components 
is generating strong interest in 
additive manufacturing.
Strategy for growth
A key focus is on developing 
technologies that provide patented 
products and methods which 
support our product strategies, 
with £68.8m (before net capitalised 
development costs and the R&D 
tax credit) expenditure on R&D 
and engineering during the year. 
The current technology focus is on 
products that help our customers 
to increase measurement capability, 
improve measurement performance, 
increase speed of operation and are 
more user-friendly. These include 
simplified software, including apps, 
for machine tool and CMM probing, 
calibration and gauging; multi-probe 
capability for CMMs; miniaturised 
high-resolution position feedback 
systems that support the manufacture 
of high-precision electronics; the 
development of AM systems with faster 
processing capability and improved 
process control for large-scale 
manufacturing; and integrated process 
control solutions for automated 
manufacturing processes.
We continue to position Renishaw 
as a ‘solutions provider’ and reduce 
the risks of over-reliance on large 
customers who integrate our products. 
Our measurement automation, 
calibration, additive manufacturing, 
and accessory ranges, such as 
styli and fixtures, can be supplied 
direct to the end-user, whilst we 
continue to strengthen our portfolio 
of hardware and software for users 
of CMMs, including the upgrades of 
measuring machines already installed. 
For example, our new SFP2 surface 
finish probe offers a solution for the 
surface measurement of parts on the 
same machine used for dimensional 
measurement, reducing inspection 
times, part handling and floor 
space requirements.
Our wide portfolio of products gives us 
key advantages when competing for 
high-value orders, and both AM sales 
and automation projects are often with 
existing customers who understand 
Renishaw’s holistic approach to 
manufacturing and the complementary 
products that can assist their part 
production. For example, as well as 
AM technology, the Futuralve project 
mentioned earlier is also benefiting 
from our REVO five-axis measurement 
system and SPRINT on-machine 
contact scanning technology for 
machine tools.
Key developments
In addition to new products already 
mentioned we introduced other 
metrology products, most notably 
the XM-60 multi-axis laser calibrator 
which allows the measurement of a 
machine tool’s six degrees of freedom 
along a linear axis in a single set-up. 
It is significantly simpler and faster to 
use than other laser measurement 
techniques. Within our encoder 
products line we launched the VIONiC 
family of highly compact, ultra-high 
accuracy ‘all-in-one’ position encoders 
which combine interpolation and digital 
signal processing inside the readhead, 
therefore eliminating the requirement for 
additional external interfaces. For users 
of manual CMMs we introduced a 
MODUS 2 upgrade kit which combines 
a Renishaw controller, software 
and position encoder technologies 
to give users a more sophisticated 
measurement capability. We will launch 
a large number of new products 
at the EMO Hannover exhibition in 
September 2017.
We have introduced at trade exhibitions 
a new machining cell concept with 
integrated process control which 
demonstrates how complementary 
technologies from Renishaw, including 
gauging and machine tool probing, can 
contribute to high levels of productivity 
and manufacturing capability.
Outlook
The continuing drive to automate 
manufacturing processes in many 
sectors, both to minimise labour costs 
and reduce the need for skilled labour, 
will benefit our position encoder, 
measurement and automation, and 
machine tool product lines, whilst 
we remain confident that there 
will be increased adoption of AM 
technologies by many of our existing 
customer groups.
Growth in the world’s middle-classes, 
with increasing disposable income, 
is also forecast to drive demand in 
areas such as civil aviation, consumer 
products, agriculture, construction 
and power generation (including 
renewables). These trends should 
all result in increased demand for 
our metrology products to help 
drive efficiencies, reduce waste, 
increase automation and aid product 
measurement traceability.

watchmaking elements, including a 
Swiss movement with manual winding 
and a design inspired by classic 
watches of the 1950s, with metal 3D 
printing used to produce the case, 
crown and buckle.
Michiel first worked with a reputable 
3D printing bureau in Belgium to 3D 
print prototypes and the first stainless 
steel ‘Ornament 1’ watch on its 
Renishaw AM250 system. He noted, 
however, that customers seemed to 
be less concerned by the method of 
manufacture, but rather more by the 
details in the design which could not be 
achieved by traditional manufacturing 
and highlights the capability of 
Renishaw’s high-performance AM 
systems to produce highly precise and 
fine detail features.
Now that Michiel has proved 
‘Ornament 1’ can be produced, he is 
working with an AMSC to investigate 
how reproducible it is, to streamline the 
labour-intensive finishing process and 
to offer an alternative material. His plan 
is to develop a core range of classic 
style watches that are high-end and 
have a strong element of personality, 
but which could be completely 
customised like bespoke jewellery.
The fast-paced nature of the consumer 
products market demands flexible 
manufacturing systems that can adapt 
to shorter lifecycles, yet still meet the 
requirements for high-quality, high-
volume components. This illustration 
of a typical household shows a few 
examples of how Renishaw products are 
allowing manufacturers to satisfy these 
demanding requirements.

From marble slabs to 
machine tools
Focusing initially on designing and 
building machinery to process natural 
stone, the Italian company Breton 
S.p.A soon moved to producing 
complete systems for the manufacture 
of composite stone. This proved to be 
the backbone of its growing business 
for many years. The 1980s saw 
Breton begin building CNC machinery 
for processing marble, granite and 
composite stone slabs, this also 
included the arrival of the company’s 
first five-axis systems.
A decade down the line and Breton 
began to diversify its expertise into 
the production of high-speed CNC 
machining centres for the metal-
cutting industry. 
Switching from processing stone 
materials to metals demands a 
significant increase in precision, and 
using Renishaw’s laser interferometers, 
rotary axis calibrators and ballbars all 
Breton’s machines undergo calibration 
routines which guarantee their optimum 
operation. As a result, Breton’s CNC 
machining centres are now seen 
as being among the world’s most 
advanced in the sector.

41 Lamborghini is a brand that symbolises 
Italian passion in the world of 
supercars, but it also has a strong 
following in the agricultural world, due 
to a range of high-performance tractors 
produced by SAME DEUTZ-FAHR. 
At its headquarters and main factory in 
Treviglio, near Milan, Italy, the company 
improved manufacturing efficiency 
by retrofitting Renishaw TRS2 tool 
recognition systems on four Mazak 
flexible manufacturing system (FMS) 
cells, which produce transmission and 
gearbox components. All these parts 
require a large number of threaded 
holes and some 70% of machining 
time is therefore devoted to drilling and 
tapping, with tools varying in size from 
M5 to M18 which break frequently; 
undetected this would lead to scrap 
and wasted machining time. 
As machining cycles are fully 
automated, a tool monitoring system 
had previously been introduced in order 
to minimise scrap; however, it was 
taking an unacceptable 21 seconds  
to check each tool. With 34 tool 
checks required per finished 
component, this was resulting in 
significant non-productive time. 
The sector is being driven by 
increasing global demand for food 
products from developing nations, 
as well as increasing global demand 
for biofuels. This is requiring greater 
investment in machinery for intensive 
farming capabilities and new 
technology to bring greater efficiencies 
to deliver ‘precision agriculture’ – 
making use of satellites to monitor 
crop condition and direct machinery 
for optimal performance, including 
the distribution of seed, fertilisers 
and pesticides.
D  Lamborghini tractors are known globally for their 
bold style, performance and design.
The majority of key components 
on high-end agricultural equipment 
are subject to process control using 
Renishaw products. This illustration of 
a typical tractor highlights a few key 
applications for our products.

Agriculture
Agricultural analysis 
Raman spectroscopy is increasingly 
being used for research within various 
fields of agriculture such as fruit 
and vegetables, crops, meat and 
dairy products.
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 42 This led to the decision by SAME 
DEUTZ-FAHR to retrofit the Renishaw 
TRS2 tool recognition units which 
offered fast and reliable tool inspection, 
reducing the time to check each tool 
to just 7 seconds, a 67% reduction on 
the previous method and an average 
reduction of component cycle time of 
7.5 minutes – some 6% of cycle time.
If a tool breakage is detected by the 
Renishaw system an alarm sounds and 
the machining program is stopped. 
Any logic could be employed at this 
stage, for example, another identical 
‘sister tool’ could be used instead 
and machining could continue, but 
the engineers at SAME DEUTZ-FAHR 
prefer to stop the process for an 
operator to check the part and make 
sure that no more damage occurs.
The company’s manufacturing 
engineering specialist involved with 
the project reports that the decision 
to invest in the TRS2 tool recognition 
systems and the subsequent cycle 
time savings has been extremely 
successful. “After a detailed analysis, 
based on the cost to run machines, we 
know this equates to a saving of more 
than €150k in the first year. This is 
because most of the non-productive 
machine time taken to check tools 
has now been released to machine 
components. We have paid back the 
initial investment in the TRS2s in a 
matter of just 5 months.”
D  The TRS2 tool recognition 
system is used to check all 
tools prone to breakage, 
with at least 34 checks per 
machined component.

Performance – Healthcare
Renishaw’s expertise in technologies 
such as metal additive manufacturing 
will be harnessed through PDR’s 
experience in research and design 
of medical devices. Renishaw and 
PDR have already collaborated on 
other projects, including the Innovate 
UK and EPSRC funded Additive-
manufacture for Design-led Efficient 
Patient Treatment (ADEPT) project, 
which won a Collaborate to Innovate 
award and has resulted in the release 
of Renishaw’s new ADEPT software 
(see below). 
In Canada, Renishaw is contributing 
to a new medical centre called 
ADEISS (Additive DEsign In Surgical 
Solutions) based at the Western 
University campus in London, Ontario. 
The result of a partnership between 
the university, the London Medical 
Network and Renishaw, the centre will 
focus on the research, development 
and commercialisation of additively 
manufactured medical devices and 
surgical instruments. The Renishaw 
contribution is CAD3 million of  
in-kind support.
There was also a good year of sales 
for additively manufactured metal 
dental structures created from cobalt 
chrome powder using Renishaw AM 
machines. This came from a mix of 
LaserPFM™ frameworks (crowns and 
bridges), LaserRPD™ partial dentures 
and LinkAbutments™. The majority 
of manufacture of medical dental AM 
products takes place in the Healthcare 
Centre of Excellence, based at Miskin, 
which operates under an ISO13485 
quality management system. 
Our Raman instrumentation meets the 
high-performance requirements of a 
wide range of research applications, 
including life sciences, mineral 
research, graphene and other 2D 
materials, pharmaceuticals and 
advanced materials for the green 
energy market. However, there is 
an increasing use of our technology 
within medical research, for example 
in Canada, the University of British 
Columbia in Vancouver is leading the 
way in the use of Raman spectroscopy 
as a tool for monitoring biochemical 
changes and inter-donor variability in 
stored red blood cell units. In China, 
the Guangdong Medical University is 
developing a method for non-invasive 
prostate cancer screening (see page 21).
Hybrid systems, combining Raman 
chemical analysis with the high 
spatial resolution of either scanning 
electron microscopy or atomic force 
microscopy, continue to be in strong 
demand. Likewise, the growing life 
science market is showing renewed 
Performance
There was growth from all our 
healthcare product lines (spectroscopy, 
neurological and medical dental). 
In spectroscopy the market has 
responded very well to our award-
winning InVia Qontor system helping 
the product line to achieve growth.
During the year the neurological 
products line achieved key strategic 
sales of the neuromate
®
 stereotactic 
robotic system and neuroinspire™ 
surgical planning software. Alder Hey 
Children’s Hospital and Birmingham 
Children’s Hospital (BCH), are 
two of the UK’s four national 
Children’s Epilepsy Surgery Service 
(CESS) centres and both reported 
successful uses of the systems for 
stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) 
cases for epilepsy, where intracerebral 
electrodes are implanted to measure 
electrical signals and identify which 
region of the brain is acting as a source 
for the epileptic seizures. Mr Richard 
Walsh, consultant neurosurgeon at 
BCH, reported after the first procedure 
that “using the robot certainly made 
the procedure easier, faster and 
more straightforward for me.” One of 
London’s largest and busiest teaching 
hospitals, King’s College Hospital, also 
reported its first successful SEEG  
case (see page 20). Outside the UK, 
a neuromate robot was installed 
in Canada for the first time at the 
London Health Sciences Centre 
(LHSC) in Ontario, with the first 
assisted neurosurgical procedure also 
a SEEG case. The team at LHSC is 
led by neurosurgeon Dr David Steven 
who said, “It (the robot) is already 
noticeably faster and more accurate 
than the previous system. In addition, 
it allows us to plan trajectories 
previously impossible with a standard 
frame, making surgery safer and 
more accurate.”
The medical dental products line 
experienced good growth from 
focusing on the sale of Renishaw AM 
machines configured for medical and 
dental applications. It ensures that it is 
able to demonstrate its knowledge of 
the technical challenges faced by those 
applications by manufacturing medical 
and dental parts at Renishaw facilities. 
The medical dental products line 
has seen good progress in the 
supply of additively manufactured 
LaserImplants™, which are 
craniomaxillofacial patient-specific 
implants (PSIs) and associated cutting 
guides that support reconstructive 
surgery, typically resulting from head 
or neck trauma, birth defects or 
cancer treatment.
During the year a collaboration was 
announced with PDR, the International 
Centre for Design and Research, 
based in Cardiff, Wales, which seeks 
to pioneer new design methods that 
will bring engineering levels of precision 
to complex surgical procedures.

Market conditions
Life expectancy is increasing in both 
developed and developing markets, 
meaning that key drivers include the 
requirement for faster procedures 
to reduce waiting times, more 
economical treatments, more patient-
specific treatments (e.g. implants and 
personalised medicines), and safer 
procedures with reduced human 
errors. All our healthcare product 
lines are well placed to deliver on 
these requirements.
Global economic conditions continue 
to limit the availability of academic 
research funding in certain markets, 
while remaining strong in others. 
Key research areas, including 2D 
and 3D materials, green energy, 
pharmaceutics and biomedical 
research, continue to attract funding 
and our spectroscopy products are 
well placed to service these sectors.
Strategy for growth
We aim to develop innovative 
healthcare products that will 
significantly advance our customers’ 
operational performance by maximising 
research capabilities, reducing process 
times and improving the efficacy of 
medical procedures. We are also 
increasingly addressing the requirement 
for personalised healthcare treatments.
As a key Renishaw focus is to 
develop technologies that provide 
patented products and methods, we 
invested £9.2m (before net capitalised 
development costs and the R&D tax 
credit) of expenditure on R&D and 
engineering during the year.
The regulatory requirements for 
healthcare products demand significant 
investment, but make barriers to entry 
high for competitive products.
Our metrology and healthcare 
businesses are interconnected and we 
employ core metrology technologies 
and manufacturing expertise to 
minimise technology risks. This is 
illustrated very clearly in our medical 
dental products line where we use our 
own AM machines in the manufacture 
of dental structures and medical 
implants to demonstrate the suitability 
of AM for this purpose, whilst also 
taking advantage of our knowledge 
of subtractive machining in the hybrid 
manufacture of LinkAbutments. 
We actively seek out partnerships that 
will assist research and our routes to 
market, and we consider acquiring 
businesses and/or technologies that 
we feel are complementary to our 
existing healthcare products.
Key developments
During the year, a €6m Horizon 2020 
grant was announced to support 
Phase 1-2 clinical trials for Renishaw’s 
novel drug delivery system, to be used 
in combination with Herantis Pharma 
plc’s drug candidate CDNF, for the 
treatment of Parkinson’s disease. 
CDNF aims to relieve the symptoms 
of Parkinson’s disease by protecting 
and regenerating dopamine producing 
neurons. The study has been approved 
by the Medicines Agency of Sweden 
and Finland and a total of 18 patients 
with Parkinson’s disease are being 
recruited. Other applications for the 
Renishaw drug delivery system are also 
being progressed including its use for 
treating children with brain tumours 
by delivering therapies directly into the 
area affected by the tumour.
The neurosurgical line launched 
neurolocate™, a frameless patient 
registration module designed for use 
with the neuromate stereotactic robot 
and mounted on the robot arm during 
intraoperative X-Ray/CT scans.
The spectroscopy line launched the 
RA802 pharmaceutical analyser, 
which is a compact benchtop Raman 
imaging system designed specifically 
for the pharmaceutical industry. 
Using Renishaw’s award-winning 
LiveTrack™ focus tracking technology, 
tablet samples with uneven, curved 
or rough surfaces can be quickly 
analysed for composition and structure 
without sample preparation, meaning 
that tablets can be formulated more 
efficiently. The RA802 won the best 
measurement laboratory equipment 
award at Eurolab 2017 show in 
Poland. The new Centrus CCD 
detector was also introduced for 
high-speed Raman analysis; giving 
outstanding performance, even at 
speeds of over 1,800 spectra per 
second, it dramatically reduces 
measurement times and is available 
on inVia microscopes and the RA802 
pharmaceutical analyser.
During the year the medical dental 
products line introduced two new 
software products – QuantAM Dental 
increases automation in the production 
of dental products, especially using 
additive manufacturing, whilst ADEPT 
is a software package that streamlines 
the design and manufacture of 
craniomaxillofacial patient-specific  
implants.
Outlook
Increased life expectancy on a global 
basis means greater incidences of 
degenerative neurological diseases, 
which will require surgical therapies. 
With appropriate regulatory 
approvals and increasing numbers 
of reference sites we are well-placed 
to supply neurosurgeons with the 
products and techniques to support 
such procedures.
In developing markets, levels of 
wealth are increasing at a national and 
individual level, which is driving demand 
for higher-quality medical treatments, 
often requiring more technologically 
advanced products.
The market for Raman spectroscopy 
continues to grow in fields such as 
nanotechnology, advanced materials, 
pharmaceutical, life sciences and 
medical research.

Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 46 Profit and tax 
The adjusted profit before tax 
amounted to £109.1m, an increase of 
25% compared to a restated £87.5m 
in 2016. Statutory profit before tax 
was £117.1m compared to a restated 
£61.7m in the previous year. In our 
metrology business, adjusted operating 
profit was £115.9m, compared with a 
restated £90.0m last year and in our 
healthcare business we recorded an 
operating loss of £7.2m, compared 
with a restated loss of £3.1m last year.
The overall effective rate of tax on 
continuing operations was 12.2% 
(2016 restated: 16.2%). The Group 
operates in many countries around the 
world and the overall effective tax rate 
is a result of the combination of the 
varying tax rates applicable throughout 
these countries. In the UK, the tax 
charge for the current year benefited 
from a lower UK current corporation 
tax rate of 19.75% (2016: 20%), a 
UK patent box benefit amounting to 
£4.0m, a reduction in the deferred tax 
rate to 17% from 2020 and a prior year 
credit of £3.0m.
Earnings per share 
and dividend
Adjusted earnings per share from 
continuing operations is 132.4p, an 
increase of 32% compared with 100.4p 
last year.
Statutory earnings per share from 
continuing operations is 141.3p, 
compared with 71.8p last year.
In line with the Group’s progressive 
dividend policy, a final dividend of 
39.5p net per share (2016: 35.5p) 
results in a total dividend for the year 
of 52.0p, an increase of 8.3% over 
the 48.0p in 2016. Dividend cover 
is 2.5 times (2016: 2.1 times) on an 
adjusted basis.
Research and development
Gross expenditure on engineering 
costs, including research and 
development on new products, was 
£78.0m (2016 restated: £68.8m). 
The capitalisation of development costs 
(net of amortisation charges) amounted 
to £2.7m (2016: £3.1m). The R&D tax 
credit in 2017 amounted to £6.5m 
compared to £2.4m in 2016. The net 
charge in the Consolidated income 
statement amounted to £68.8m 
compared to a restated £63.3m in 
2016. The gross charge amounts to 
15% of group revenue (2016:16%).
Between the business segments 
gross expenditure on engineering 
costs was £68.8m (2016 restated: 
£60.9m) in the metrology segment and 
£9.2m (2016 restated: £7.9m) in our 
healthcare segment.
New product research and 
development expenditure amounted 
to £53.5m, which compares with 
£44.4m spent last year. There have 
been a number of new product 
releases in both our metrology and 
healthcare business segments, and a 
number of new product introductions 
are anticipated during the 2018 
financial year.
Group headcount
Group headcount has increased from 
4,286 at 30th June 2016 to 4,530 
at 30th June 2017, with the average 
for the year of 4,395, compared with 
4,192 last year. The increase during 
the year of 244 comprised additional 
employees of 98 in the UK and 146 
overseas. The increase in the UK 
included 46 apprentices and 45 
graduates, and, in addition, we are 
funding the further education of 103 
employees in engineering, software and 
commercial/business disciplines.
Labour costs, the most significant cost 
for the Group, increased by 15% to 
£211.6m (2016: £183.8m) reflecting 
an annual pay increase, exchange rate 
movement, the incremental cost of the 
employees recruited in both 2016 and 
2017 and an increase in the employee 
bonus provision. Also, there was a 
directors’ bonus this year of £1.7m 
(2016: £nil).
Revenue
We achieved a record turnover with 
revenue for the year of £536.8m, 
compared with a restated £427.2m last

Consolidated balance sheet 
The Group’ s shareholders’ funds at the end of the year were £443.8m, compared with £381.4m at 30th June 2016. 
Reserves benefited from our trading results, with a retained profit after tax of £88.8m and were reduced by dividends paid of £34.9m.
Additions to property, plant and equipment totalled £42.6m, of which £24.2m was spent on property and £18.4m on plant and 
machinery and IT equipment and infrastructure.
The main property additions were: 
• in the USA, completion of our new headquarters, near Chicago and a new building in Detroit; 
• in Spain, fit out of premises purchased last year;
• in Sweden, refurbishment of our existing premises; 
• in Germany, refurbishment of our existing premises; and
• in France, refurbishment of our existing premises.
Within working capital, inventories decreased to £87.7m from £95.0m at the beginning of the year reflecting our continued 
focus on working capital management whilst remaining committed to our policy of holding sufficient finished inventory to ensure 
customer delivery performance, given our short order book of approximately five weeks. 
Trade debtors increased from £114.9m to £137.5m. This increased amount reflects a stronger final quarter’s revenue compared 
with the previous year, which has also contributed to the increase in debtor days to 73 at the end of the year, compared with 70 
at the end of last year. 
Net cash balances have grown over the year with balances at 30th June 2017 of £51.9m (2016: £21.3m). The cash flow bridge 
below shows the significant items that reconcile opening to closing cash balances. There is also the pension scheme escrow 
account of £12.9m (2016: £15.3m). 
Cash flow bridge
At the end of the year, the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes, now closed for future accrual, showed a deficit of £66.8m, 
compared with a deficit of £67.8m at 30th June 2016. Defined benefit pension scheme assets at 30th June 2017 increased to 
£170.7m from £149.2m at 30th June 2016, representing investment performance during the year. Pension fund liabilities increased 
from £217.0m to £237.5m, reflecting changes in the underlying assumptions applied, in particular the reduction in the discount 
rate used for the UK pension scheme. Under the 2015 recovery plan the liabilities are calculated on the basis of funding to self-
sufficiency. The recovery plan provides for charges over certain UK properties to the value of £66.6m and the escrow account. 
For the UK defined benefit pension scheme, a guide to the sensitivity of the value of the respective liabilities is as follows:

Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 48 Restatements and alternative performance measures
Restatements to the 2016 results have arisen from the following items:
• the R&D tax credit previously reported in the tax charge has been reclassified and is now reported in cost of sales and 
credited against the group’s R&D expenditure in line with international accounting standards;
• the allocation of profits between continuing and discontinued operations; and
• the impact of certain foreign currency forward contracts used as hedging instruments for future incoming currency cash 
flows that did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting under IAS 39 which has resulted in the prior year profit before tax 
being reduced by £25.8m, with a corresponding credit in the other comprehensive income. This year an £8m gain has been 
recorded in statutory profit before tax as a result of this accounting treatment. There was no impact on the group net assets, 
cash balances or future cash flows.
The Board has introduced alternative performance measures (adjusted profit before tax, adjusted operating profit and 
adjusted earnings per share) to report the results on the basis that all forward contracts are accounted for as effective 
hedges. These measures will be the basis by which the Board evaluates the Group’s performance as they better represent the 
underlying trading of the Group. The tables below show the effects of the restatements on the previous year’s results and the 
details of the adjustments between statutory profit before tax and adjusted profit before tax. See note 24 for further details.

Treasury policies
The Group’s treasury policies are designed to manage financial risks to the Group that arise from operating in a number of 
foreign currencies and to maximise interest income on cash deposits. As an international group, the main exposure is in respect 
of foreign currency risk on the trading transactions undertaken by group companies and on the translation of the net assets of 
overseas subsidiaries.
The following information includes disclosures which are required by IFRS and are an integral part of the financial statements. 
Weekly groupwide cash management reporting and forecasting is in place to facilitate management of this currency risk. 
The operations of group treasury, which is situated at head office, are governed by Board-approved policies.
All Sterling and foreign currency balances not immediately required for group operations are placed on short-term deposit with 
leading international highly-rated financial institutions.
The Group uses a number of financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk, such as foreign currency borrowings to 
hedge the exposure on the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries and forward exchange contracts to hedge a significant 
proportion of anticipated foreign currency cash inflows. There are forward contracts in place to hedge against the Group’s Euro, 
US Dollar and Japanese Yen cash inflows. The Group does not speculate with derivative financial instruments.
See note 20 for an analysis of cash balances and currency borrowings at the year end.
Investment for the future
We will continually look to the long-term growth of the Group and to invest in the research and development of new products, 
improving manufacturing and production processes to provide capacity for the future, and expanding our marketing and 
support presence around the world.

Risk and risk 
management
Overview of risk management
The Board is responsible for the 
overall stewardship of our system of 
risk management and internal control. 
It has established the level of risk 
that is appropriate for our business 
and acceptable in the pursuit of our 
strategic objectives and has therefore 
set appropriate policies. It has also set 
delegated authority levels to provide 
the framework for assessing risks and 
ensuring that they are escalated to the 
appropriate levels of management, 
including up to the Board where 
appropriate, for consideration 
and approval. 
The roles and responsibilities of the 
Board, key committees and all levels of 
management from a risk management 
perspective are summarised in the 
infographic below. This process 
ensures that risks are not just the 
product of a bottom-up approach but 
are also examined from a top-down 
perspective via an integrated senior 
management process, which is closely 
aligned with the Group’s strategy in 
order to enhance the Group’s approach 
to risk generally. 
Effective risk management is critical 
to the achievement of our strategic 
objectives. Risk management controls 
are integrated into all levels of our 
business and across all our operations. 
We continually assess our exposure to 
risk and seek to ensure that risks are 
appropriately mitigated.
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 50 Activities during the year 
A new executive risk committee was 
formed in 2016 creating greater linkage 
across our review and assessment of 
risk. The committee met four times in 
the period and conducted a thorough 
review of our principal risks as well as 
the relevant mitigation plans for each. 
The overall effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management and mitigation 
processes is reviewed regularly 
by the Executive Board and the 
Audit Committee. 
During the year a new Group Audit 
Manager was recruited. The internal 
audit team operates independently, 
reporting to the Audit Committee. 
Scheduled visits to Group companies 
were held and documented, with 
an executive summary provided 
to the Audit Committee and any 
shortcomings acted upon promptly. 
Process enhancements are worked 
upon by this team. All operating 
companies are required annually 
to complete self-certification 
questionnaires regarding compliance 
with Group policies, procedures 
and requirements. 
Cyber threats 
In relation to the continuing threat 
from cyber security, we have provided 
employees with online training and 
further strengthened our IT systems’ 
resilience as well as the monitoring 
of threats. 
Other key developments 
New enhanced due diligence 
procedures have been implemented for 
routinely screening new and existing 
agents and distributors, utilising 
the services of a market-leading 
screening service. We have rolled out 
refresher e-learning training on our 
Group Business Code (which sets 
out the ethical standards expected of 
employees and our business partners) 
and also on anti-bribery.
A groupwide whistleblowing policy was 
implemented this year which involved 
the appointment of an independent 
third party provider to operate a 
confidential reporting line, enabling 
people to raise concerns in confidence 
if they feel the standard internal 
processes are not appropriate.

Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Strategic report
51 The Board has conducted a 
robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the business. The full 
business implications of Brexit remain 
uncertain, which will be the case 
for some time. The Board is 
closely monitoring the situation as 
it develops. Further commentary 
on Brexit is provided on page 67. 
Currency fluctuations, trading 
arrangements, employment issues and 
other risks that become apparent over 
time, will be monitored by the Board and 
mitigation put in place where possible. 
The cyber security threat risk has 
been included for the first time this 
year, to demonstrate how the Group 
is addressing this increasing and 
challenging threat.
Our performance is subject to a number of risks,  
the principal risks and factors impacting on them 
are set out in the table below.
Strategic report
Principal risks and 
uncertainties
1 
 
Current trading levels and order book
Revenue growth is 
unpredictable and orders 
from customers generally 
involve short lead-times  
with the outstanding order 
book at any time being 
around one month’s worth  
of revenue value.
Related strategic priorities:
2 4 5 6 8
 
* No change.
Potential impact
Global market conditions continue to 
highlight risks to growth and demand 
that can lead to fluctuating levels 
of revenue. 
Whilst global investment in production 
systems and processes is expected 
to expand, future growth is difficult to 
predict, especially with such a short-
term order book. This limited forward 
order visibility leaves the annual 
revenue forecasts uncertain. 
Mitigation
• The Group is expanding and diversifying its 
product range in order to maintain a world-
leading position in its sales of metrology products. 
Targeted investment in sales and marketing 
resources continues in order to support the 
breadth of the product offerings.
• The Group is applying its measurement expertise 
to grow its healthcare and additive manufacturing 
business activities.
• The Group retains a strong balance sheet and has 
the ability to flex manufacturing resource levels 
and shift patterns.
Year-on-year change
 
2 
 Research and development
The development of new 
products and processes 
involves risk, such as 
development timescales, 
meeting the required 
technical specification and 
the impact of alternative 
technology developments.
Related strategic priorities:
2 5 7
 
* No change.
Potential impact
Being at the leading edge of new 
technology in metrology and 
healthcare, there are uncertainties 
whether new developments will 
provide an economic return.
Mitigation
• Patent and intellectual property generation is core 
to new product developments.
• R&D programmes are regularly reviewed against 
milestones and, when necessary, projects 
are cancelled.
• Medium to long-term R&D strategies are 
monitored regularly by both the Board and 
Executive Board, including reviews of the 
allocation of R&D resource to key projects.
• Product development processes around the 
Group are reviewed and aligned where possible to 
provide consistency and efficiency.
• New products involve beta testing at  
customers to ensure they will meet the needs  
of the market.
• Market developments are closely monitored.
Year-on-year change

 Supply chain management
Customer deliveries may  
be threatened by a failure  
in the supply chain.
Related strategic priorities:

*  No change.
Potential impact
Inability to meet customer deliveries 
could result in loss of revenue 
and profit.
Mitigation
• Production facilities are maintained with fire  
and flood risk in mind.
• Critical production processes are replicated  
at different locations where practical.
• The Group is highly vertically integrated providing 
increased control over many aspects of the 
supply chain.
• The Group has the ability to flex manufacturing 
resource levels and shift patterns.
• Regular vendor reviews are performed for critical 
part suppliers.
• Stock policies are reviewed by the Board on  
a regular basis.
• Product quality is closely monitored.
Year-on-year change
Increased Decreased No change
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 52 4 
 Regulatory legislation for healthcare products
The expansion of the 
Group’s business into the 
healthcare markets involves 
a significantly increased 
requirement to obtain 
regulatory approval prior to 
the sale of these products.
Related strategic priorities:
2 5 6
 
* No change.
Potential impact
Regulatory approval can be very 
expensive and time-consuming. 
This area is also very complex 
and there is a risk that the correct 
approvals are not obtained. 
Mitigation
• Specialist legal and regulatory employees are in  
place to support the healthcare business.
• The Group has experience of healthcare 
regulatory matters at Board level.
• Healthcare operations in UK and France 
have ISO13485 certification for their quality 
management systems, with Ireland and other 
subsidiary healthcare operations falling under the 
UK quality management system.
Year-on-year change

 Defined benefit pension schemes
Investment returns and 
actuarial valuations of the 
defined benefit pension 
fund liabilities are subject to 
economic and social factors 
that are outside of the 
control of the Group.
Related strategic priorities:
1
 
 
Potential impact
Volatility in investment returns 
and actuarial assumptions 
can significantly affect the 
defined benefit pension scheme 
deficit, impacting on future 
funding requirements.
Mitigation
• The investment strategy is managed by the 
pension scheme trustees who operate in line with 
a statement of investment principles.
• A new recovery plan was agreed in June 2016 for 
the 2015 actuarial valuation based on funding to 
self-sufficiency.

 Exchange rate fluctuations
Fluctuating foreign exchange 
rates may affect the results 
of the Group.
Related strategic priorities:
6 7
 
 
*   No change.
Potential impact
With 95% of revenue generated 
outside of the UK, there is an 
exposure to major currency 
fluctuations, mainly in respect of the 
US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen. 
Such fluctuations could adversely 
impact both the Group’s income 
statement and balance sheet.
Mitigation
• The Group enters into forward contracts in 
order to hedge varying proportions of forecast 
US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen revenue. 
Forward contracts which are ineffective for 
accounting purposes provide the protection 
against rate changes that management intended 
when entering the contracts.
• The Group uses currency borrowings to hedge 
the foreign currency denominated assets held in 
the Group’s balance sheet.
• There is a monthly board review of currency rates 
and hedging position.
Year-on-year change
 
7
 Cyber security threats
For the Group to operate 
effectively it requires 
continuous access to timely 
and reliable information at 
all times. We seek to ensure 
continuous availability, 
security and operation 
of information systems. 
Cyber threats continue 
to increase.
Related strategic priorities:

*  Increased vigilance against 
evolving threats. 
Potential impact
Reduced service to customers due 
to lack of reliable management 
information putting the Group at a 
competitive disadvantage.
Delay or impact on decision making 
through lack of availability of sound 
data or disruption in/denial of service.
Loss of commercially sensitive and/
or personal information leading to 
implications including reputational 
damage, claims or fines.
Theft of commercial or sensitive 
information/data or fraud causing  
loss and disruption.
Mitigation
• There is substantial resilience and back-up built 
into group systems.
• An IT security committee exists, comprising IT 
and business leadership. 
• Cyber risk and security is a regular topic for 
board discussion.
• External penetration testing is utilised on an 
appropriate basis.
• The Group operates central IT policies in all 
aspects of information security. 
• Regular monitoring of all group systems takes 
place with regular reporting and analysis.
• Operating systems are continuously updated and 
refreshed in line with current threats. 
• The Group employs a number of physical, logical 
and control measures to protect its information 
and systems.
• E-learning courses covering certain cyber threats 
were rolled out to all employees group wide 
during the year as well as management training.

Human rights and slavery
A review of the Group Business Code 
(the Business Code) was performed 
to ensure it still upholds the standards 
we and our stakeholders expect. 
During this review, some parts of 
the Business Code were updated to 
reflect our new approach to mitigating 
modern slavery within our supply 
chains. To ensure all our people 
are aware of the high standards we 
expect of them, the updated Business 
Code has been sent out to all 4,530 
employees worldwide. 
Implementation of our modern slavery 
and human trafficking strategy is 
proceeding as planned. We have 
begun a process of engaging with our 
tier 1 suppliers to ascertain the extent 
of their efforts to mitigate modern 
slavery. This process is underway in 
our main UK purchasing group and our 
local purchasing teams in India and 
China. Further details are contained 
within our modern slavery statement 
found at www.renishaw.com.
A strict non-discrimination policy is 
embedded in the Business Code, 
which states the minimum standards 
expected within the Group and from 
our representatives. The Business 
Code requires that our employees 
have the right to non-discriminatory 
treatment and equal opportunities, 
to work in a safe and secure working 
environment, and to receive a 
fair wage. 
During the year, we have also 
developed a new bullying and 
harassment training course which 
has been rolled out across the Group. 
It explains how to identify bullying and 
harassment in the workplace, and 
how to manage any situations that 
may arise. This course is the latest in a 
series of modules aimed at developing 
our employees and empowering them 
to operate in accordance with the 
Business Code. 
To avoid any form of discrimination 
during the recruitment process, we 
have strict guidelines to ensure proper 
consideration is given to applications 
from all genders, ethnic backgrounds 
and those with disabilities. We work 
closely with employees who become 
disabled to ensure they have every 
opportunity to continue in their 
employment with Renishaw.
We continue to use the Business 
Code and other policies to set 
expectations with potential suppliers. 
The full Business Code can be found at

Diversity
As a global company, Renishaw 
enjoys the advantages of a diverse 
workforce. We benefit from the 
range of experience and cultural 
understanding that comes from 
diversity in the workplace. With over 
20 different nationalities represented 
within our senior management group, 
we benefit from the variety of expertise 
they bring to the business. On 30th 
June 2017, we employed 4,530 people 
across the Group, an increase of 5% 
since last year. Of these, 3,496 (77%) 
are male and 1,034 (23%) are female. 
There are nine directors on the Board, 
consisting of seven males and two 
females. The senior management 
group is made up of 58 people, of 
which 56 (97%) are male and two (3%) 
are female. Renishaw regards its senior 
management group to be the Executive 
Board, the heads of each product 
line, sales territory, and manufacturing 
organisation that report directly into the 
Executive Board, and the directors of 
Renishaw’s subsidiary undertakings.
Communication and 
participation
Operating out of 77 locations around 
the world has necessitated a culture 
of clear and open communication 
between sites, functions and 
management teams across the 
business. To facilitate this, we operate 
a flat structure that allows our people to 
openly voice their ideas and concerns. 
We are committed to conducting our 
business with honesty and integrity 
and promoting a culture of openness 
and accountability. To help with this a 
groupwide whistleblowing policy was 
introduced this year for our people 
to raise concerns about suspected 
wrongdoing. The policy covers 
all Renishaw employees, officers, 
consultants, contractors, casual 
workers, agency workers, suppliers, 
customers and third parties who 
provide services for or on behalf of 
Renishaw. People are reassured their 
concerns will be taken seriously and 
investigated as appropriate, and that 
their confidentiality will be respected 
without fear of reprisals. We hope that 
in many cases an employee will be 
able to raise any concerns internally. 
However, it is recognised there will be 
times when it is not appropriate, or a 
person will not be comfortable, raising 
a concern internally. An independent 
third-party provider, Safecall, has been 
appointed to operate a confidential 
reporting line enabling people to raise 
concerns in confidence and, if they 
wish, anonymously.
Our strategy in action – 
People
Tom Silvey, like many of our 
apprentices, has gone on to study 
a part-time engineering degree 
alongside his work as a CNC 
Applications Engineer at Renishaw. 
Tom completed his degree in 2016 
with first-class honours and has since 
received the Frederic Barnes Waldron 
Award from the UK Institution of 
Mechanical Engineers. 
56 Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 We continue to use our suggestion 
scheme, which we have recently 
relaunched on a new online platform, 
to encourage our people to share 
ideas that can improve business 
processes and their employment 
experience. The suitability of these 
ideas is assessed by a committee of 
employees, and then transferred to 
the appropriate area of the business 
for detailed consideration. Ideas that 
are implemented and provide benefits 
to the business can earn a financial 
reward for the originator. We also hold 
regular communication meetings, 
where a member of the Board presents 
updates on each area of the business 
with an open-floor Q&A session. 
The Board presents our annual and 
half-yearly financial results to all 
employees in person at our larger 
locations in the UK and via video-
conference to smaller sites.
Training and development
We recognise that our highly skilled 
people are the key to success within 
our organisation; ensuring that they are 
fully trained in their fields is critical to 
achieving that success. As such, we 
place a large emphasis on ensuring 
that our training programmes work 
effectively for our people and business 
needs. This year, we invested a further 
£1.9m in training. We firmly believe 
that work experience, as well as 
studying, is essential to the success 
of our employees. To ensure this is 
possible, we offer the opportunity for 
our graduates and apprentices to 
take part in funded studies at HNC, 
HND and degree levels alongside their 
regular working lives. Tom Silvey, an 
award-winning apprentice and BEng 
graduate, said the following about his 
experience “When Renishaw presented 
me with the opportunity to work 
alongside my studies, I knew this was 
the best fit for me. The Company not 
only funded my degree, but also gave 
me all the time I needed to complete 
university projects.” 
Our continued investment in training 
is currently funding the development 
of 131 apprentices, 57 graduates 
on our graduate training programme 
and further career development 
for employees right across the 
business. We are also currently 
funding the further education of 103 
of our people across the Company in 
engineering, software and commercial/
business disciplines.
Our online training platform, MySkills, 
was launched in May 2015 and 
continues to be successful. Our people 
from around the world participate 
in the programmes it offers, which 
are organised to give them control 
of their own development plans with 
the support of their line manager. 
It offers a broad range of courses (in 
various languages) focused on equal 
opportunities and diversity, technical 
skills, leadership/management 
development, induction, soft skills, 
career development, health and 
safety, anti-bribery and corporate 
social responsibility.
The Academy was launched in 
2010 with the aim to develop future 
application engineers to meet the 
growing demand of Renishaw’s 
increasingly diverse range of products. 
Technical training is vital to maintain 
our ability to provide excellent technical 
support, and since the inception of 
the Academy, it has provided a wide 
range of training programmes from 
“Face-to-Face Communication” and 
“Fundamentals of Manufacturing” to 
using and programming the machines 
and products we make. Access to the 
Academy continues to be rolled out to 
more of our locations across the globe, 
with our highly skilled trainers being 
able to offer face-to-face and online 
training. We also offer the experience 
gained from our internal training to 
customers in several key markets, with 
courses held at customer sites or our 
own locations.

is offered in the form of subsidised 
health monitoring (blood pressure, 
diabetes, cholesterol and BMI). 
To support the physical and mental 
welfare of our people we have regular 
on-site visits from two occupational 
physicians who are available for our 
employees as required. These doctors 
also act as senior advisors to our 
Group Health and Safety and HR 
functions to ensure that best practice 
in occupational health is observed.
A total of 122 (2016: 113) near-

Community
With an increasing global footprint, we 
recognise the positive contribution that 
can be made to our local communities 
through varied interactions with local 
residents, businesses, schools and 
not-for-profit organisations. This is 
especially true in the west of England 
and South Wales, where we are a 
significant employer.
In many of our markets, we communicate 
a positive story about the role played by 
science, engineering and manufacturing 
to enhance the lives of the general 
populace and the attractive nature of a 
career within these sectors. We see this 
as vital to overcome perceptions about 
career options in these areas and 
to ensure a strong pipeline of future 
talent, not just for our own needs, 
but also for our wider supply chain 
and customer base.
Across the Group we continue to 
host tour groups and have given 
talks to a range of organisations 
including primary and secondary 
schools, universities and colleges, 
business clubs and societies. 
We actively support the business 
community regionally, nationally and 
internationally, through membership 
of trade and lobbying associations 
such as the Additive Manufacturing 
Users Group (USA), the European 
Society for Precision Engineering & 
Nanotechnology, SAE International, the 
Confederation of British Industry (CBI), 
the Dental Laboratories Association

To give potential future employees the 
ability to receive practical training and 
experience alongside their academic 
studies, we offer paid placements 
each year for a broad range of 
students. This year we have given 100 
(2016: 100) students the opportunity 
to work at Renishaw, 40 of whom 
stay for a full year-long placement. 
There are 131 manufacturing, technical 
and software apprentices currently in 
training (2016: 120), with four (2016: 4) 
in our German subsidiary, and the rest 
at various UK locations. We have a 
further 48 new apprentices joining us 
in September 2017 (2016: 46) and 45 
new graduates starting this summer 
(2016: 76). 
Health and safety
We continue to develop our health 
and safety management system and 
we are bringing more sites online 
with our health and safety strategy. 
Our management system has been 
designed to be in line with best 
practice and the requirements of the 
ISO18001 standard. We recognise 
the importance of dealing with all 
injuries, as many have the potential to 
have been more serious. All injuries 
are recorded, enabling us to manage 
treatment and investigate all incidents 
effectively with the aim of implementing 
appropriate control measures to 
prevent reoccurrence.
The total number of accidents for the 
period was 234 (2016: 296) against 
a year-end headcount of 4,530 
(2016: 4,286). This equates to an 
accident frequency rate of 30.79 per 
million hours worked (2016: 40.99). 
Our online incident reporting system 
continues to be used effectively, 
encouraging employees to report all 
incidents regardless of severity, and 
enables us to record trends more 
effectively. We currently do not see any 
overall trends with the data we capture, 
except that most of our incidents are 
minor cuts.
There were two reportable accidents 
under the UK RIDDOR reporting 
requirements: one severe cut to a 
finger and one head injury leading 
to concussion. These resulted in a 
total lost time of 244 hours, or 42.5 
days. This equates to a frequency 
rate of 0.25 per million hours worked 
compared with a UK manufacturing 
average for RIDDOR reportable 
accidents of 1.94.
No work-related ill health or disease 
was reported, but health monitoring 
in the form of lung function testing, 
hearing testing and eye testing, where 
appropriate for a job role, has been

the globe, some of these include 
Canada Makes (Canada), PräziGen 
(Germany), Light Alliance (Germany), 
BazMod (Germany), The Manufacturing 
Technology Centre (UK) and the 
Advanced Manufacturing Research 
Centre (UK). 
We continue to sponsor and help 
judge a range of regional and national 
business award programmes that 
help encourage and recognise 
business and individual excellence. 
Rainer Lotz, Managing Director 
of Renishaw GmbH is a Board 
Member of Germany’s MX Awards,

and Gloucestershire. 
To further our aim of establishing 
awareness of Renishaw as a significant 
regional employer, we continue to 
sponsor a wide range of festivals, 
sports clubs and organisations in 
the west of England and South 
Wales. During the year this included 
sponsorship of new music at the 
Colston Hall’s Lantern venue in Bristol, 
Stroud Young Photographer of the Year 
and Gloucester Tall Ships Festival. 
The sport of rugby has an especially 
high profile in South Wales and the 
west of England, and we currently 
sponsor Samson Lee (Scarlets and 
Wales) and Ben Morgan (Gloucester), 
and for season 2017-2018, we have 
agreed sponsorship with Cardiff 
Blues, including on-ground signage 
and sponsorship of Tomos Williams, 
a promising young scrum-half who 
was named in the Wales squad in 
June 2017. We sponsor Swansea 
City footballer Ki Sung-Yeung, who 
plays internationally for South Korea, 
plus Gloucestershire County Cricket’s 
Tom Smith. 
We are a technical sponsor to 
numerous student racing teams, where 
we utilise our additive manufacturing 
expertise to supply key components. 
In Italy, the Unibo Motorsport team, 
based at Università di Bologna, 
competes in the Formula Student 
single-seater car competition, whilst 
at Politecnico di Torino we sponsor 
the 2 Wheels Polito team, which has 
built a motorcycle that competes in the 
MotoStudent competition. In Germany, 
we have also supplied additively 
manufactured wheel carriers for the 
Formula Student GreenTeam.
Our sponsorship of the French 
Moto2™ GP motorcycle team 
TransFIORmers also includes 
the supply of unique additively 
manufactured titanium wishbone and 
steering column components.
Charity
In the UK, the Renishaw Charities 
Committee (RCC) was formed in the 
1980s to distribute funds to charitable 
and voluntary organisations and 
support the individual fundraising 
efforts of all UK employees. The RCC 
is made up of representatives from 
Renishaw’s main Gloucestershire sites 
and has a particular focus on assisting 
organisations that help enrich the lives 
of children and adults, from toddler 
groups and sports clubs, through to 
organisations that support the disabled 
and the bereaved. Donations are also 
made to organisations located close 
to other UK sites. A separate fund 
is administered by the RCC, which 
donates monies to aid the victims of 
global disasters.
During the year, the RCC received 
fewer funding requests but still made 
donations to 230 diverse organisations 
totalling £98,000 (2016: £102,000). 
Beneficiaries included medical research 
groups, junior sports clubs, cubs 
and brownies groups, sea cadets, 
hospice care organisations, disability 
sports and support groups, primary, 
secondary and special needs schools, 
counselling and carers support groups, 
animal sanctuaries and senior citizen 
groups. The RCC also fully matches 
funds raised by employees for UK 
national fundraising events such as 
Children in Need and Red Nose Day 
and also supports individual employee 
fundraising activities.
During the year, significant donations 
of £2,000 or more were made by the 
RCC to support seven organisations 
in Gloucestershire, including a new 
memorial garden for St Mary’s Church 
in Kingswood, a community library 
in Berkeley, further development of 
the Wotton-under-Edge community 
swimming pool, a new launch 
vehicle for the Severn Area Rescue 
Association’s lifeboat, and a new 
centre at the Milestone special school 
in Gloucester that, when opened, will 
offer state-of-the-art facilities including 
a large hydrotherapy pool with therapy 
and sensory equipment, plus an all 
ability play and sports area.
Globally, Renishaw is highly supportive 
of its local communities. In the USA 
we have started a partnership with 
VetPowered LLC, an organisation 
offering machining, fabrication and 
maintenance and repair services 
to industry through a highly-trained 
veteran and wounded warrior work 
force. It provides profits and resources 
to Workshop for Warriors, a non-
profit school that prepares veterans 
and wounded warriors for advanced 
manufacturing careers through training, 
certification and job placement. 
Renishaw, Inc. has donated machine 
tool calibration equipment to 
VetPowered and runs free-of-charge 
training to enable them to increase 
their machine maintenance and 
repair portfolio. Following successful 
completion, the aim is to then train the 
veterans in machine tool retrofits to 
enable them to earn further revenue to 
support their very important cause. 
During the year, our subsidiary in India 
supported Gurukulam, a school of 350 
disadvantaged students in Pune. 
The children are often from travelling 
families who do not have the stability 
or financial means to send them to 
mainstream schools and the school 
provides education integrated with 
vocational training, as well as shelter 
and three meals per day, which is free 
of charge to the children and their 
families. Gurukulam faces many 
financial challenges, one of which is 
the cost of fuel (wood and LPG) used 
for cooking. Renishaw therefore gave 
a significant donation for the installation 
of a concentrated solar thermal 
technology based steam cooking 
system, which harnesses the power 
of the sun to generate steam and hot 
water, providing an efficient and 
environmentally friendly system with 
no fuel costs.

To allow us to support education 
outreach activities across our key 
regions, we offer STEM ambassador 
training to all our new graduates and 
second-year apprentices. We now have 
over 130 ambassadors in the Company 
and each must carry out one STEM 
activity per year, which helps to sustain 
and grow our multiple initiatives with 
schools and universities, including talks 
and lectures, career fairs, after school 
clubs and STEM projects. One of our 
STEM ambassadors recently received 
a letter from a parent whose daughter 
had attended a talk on working as an 
engineer at Renishaw. “My daughter 
had never been committed to school, 
but after the Renishaw engineer’s talk 
she amazed us! She suddenly knew 
that she wanted to be developing new 
technology with Renishaw, and the 
last parent’s evening was a delight to 
experience.” Such feedback validates 
our continuing commitment to 
schools engagement. 
We are continuing to develop 
relationships with key universities 
that have been identified as having 
relevant courses for our business 
needs. This includes the sponsorship 
of engineering societies and 
Formula Student teams. We have 
ongoing research projects, PhD and 
undergraduate projects with several 
universities, and often give lectures, 
employability talks and attend career 
fairs to raise our profile. 
The task of developing more engineers 
is not something that we can do alone 
and therefore we continue to work 
with leading industry organisations 
and engineering peers to advise 
government on national policy that 
will benefit the sector. For example, 
we are members of the Royal Academy 
of Engineering’s Diversity and Inclusion 
Leadership Group that has been set up 
to help remove barriers and encourage 
more women and other under-
represented groups into engineering. 
We are also a key contributor, both in 
time and money, to Festomane (Festival 
of Manufacturing and Engineering), 
which is held each year in Stroud 
district, where our Gloucestershire sites 
are located. The festival has grown 
in popularity and Renishaw hosted 
an ‘Engineer your Future’ event this 
year where both students and parents 
attended workshops and talks to find 
out the opportunities for young people 
in engineering and manufacturing. 
Influencers such as teachers and 
parents are key groups that we focus 
on to change perceptions.
Education
Renishaw’s UK-based education 
outreach team continues to work with 
primary and secondary schools, and 
higher educational establishments, 
to encourage young people of all 
genders, ethnicity and backgrounds 
to learn about engineering, discover 
what engineers do every day and to 
encourage them to choose engineering 
as a career. The team has designed 
more workshops to be delivered either 
at schools, or at Renishaw’s sites in 
Gloucestershire and South Wales, 
that are curriculum-linked to add value 
and context to learning in maths, 
physics, computer science, and design 
and technology.
Renishaw believes that making things, 
and understanding how products are 
designed and made, is important in 
influencing young people to consider 
a career in engineering. We have 
therefore developed (with support from 
the Welsh Government) a Fabrication 
Development Centre (FDC) on our 
manufacturing site at Miskin in South 
Wales, which we believe is unique in 
the UK.
Our aim is to become a key 
educational resource for hands-on  
learning of design, fabrication, 
manufacturing and engineering skills, 
through which we will raise the profile 
of engineering and encourage more 
students, especially girls, to choose 
science, technology, engineering 
and maths (STEM) subjects. This will 
encourage more young people to take 
up apprenticeships, jobs or further 
education career pathways in high-
value engineering. 
Since it opened last May, we have 
welcomed over 600 pupils and 
students to the FDC where they 
have participated in design and build 
projects, and Renishaw workshops 
in a state-of-the-art facility that 
inspires them to think about an 
engineering career. 
We continue to build relationships and 
raise our profile in the regions where 
we have the highest recruitment needs. 
In Bristol, we again partnered with the 
Bristol Post newspaper to run a ‘Super 
Science’ competition that offers one 
Bristol region school the chance to 
win £10,000 towards anything in the 
name of science education. The 2016 
winning school was Southville Primary, 
which intended to buy key science 
equipment such as magnets, circuits, 
microscopes and thermometers, and 
hold workshops with local scientists.

Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 60 We also have strong partnerships with 
other STEM-focused organisations 
including the Greenpower Education 
Trust, Aerospace Bristol, Bristol Music 
Trust and the SS Great Britain Trust. 
The new Aerospace Bristol museum, 
which features a hangar for the 
Concorde aircraft to be built, opens 
in Autumn 2017 and a key aim is to 
advance learning, skills and training 
particularly in science, technology, 
engineering and design. A Renishaw 
Equator gauging system will form part 
of the museum’s exhibits focused on 
current aerospace technology, and 
we will use the dedicated education 
facilities to deliver some of our 
outreach programmes. 
Our Spanish subsidiary continues to 
support the SpainSkills entry in the 
global WorldSkills competition through 
sponsorship, the loan of equipment 
and supplying engineers to assist the 
entrants in the successful completion 
of the engineering sections of 
this challenge.
In the USA, we are also developing 
a new programme that creates 
partnerships with educational 
establishments such as technical 
colleges and universities. 
These partnerships create regional 
Renishaw bases to support our 
customers whilst helping to develop 
training and curriculum for the 
next generation of engineers and 
manufacturing staff. A pilot partnership 
with Greenville Technical College 
Center for Manufacturing Innovation, 
South Carolina, is up and running 
covering a variety of our product lines 
with two Renishaw staff based at the 
facility to support the partnership.
As part of this pilot, staff from 
Renishaw, Inc. attended an event at 
the college to encourage girls into 
automotive engineering, organised by 
the Southern Automotive Women’s 
Forum. Around 150 middle-school and 
high-school girls attended from the 
Greenville area who took part in hands-
on STEM-based activities, toured 
the facilities and heard Renishaw UK 
STEM ambassador, Lucy Ackland, 
talk about her career journey and 
the many opportunities within the 
engineering sector.
Environment
We recognise that improving the 
operational efficiencies of our locations 
across the world contributes to the 
sustainable growth of our business. 
We continue to work hard to ensure 
that the impact of our business 
activities is as low as practical. 
By analysing our GHG emissions we 
can see that our greatest impact is 
from the purchase of electricity and 
its associated Scope 3 emissions, 
which is responsible for just over 50% 
of our global GHG emissions. This is 
followed by our product distribution 
and business travel, at around 25% 
and 17% respectively.
To combat this, we have in previous 
years invested in solar arrays. 
During this year, we have generated 
2.98% (2016: 3.45%) of our global 
energy needs, and are looking for more 
ways to invest effectively in reducing 
our future energy demands. As well 
as our investment in solar arrays, we 
have invested just under £1m this 
year in energy-saving technologies 
to increase the efficiency and lower 
the energy demand of our building 
stock. These projects have included 
the installation of triple glazing, LED 
light fixtures and insulation in several of 
our buildings.
We have installed new LED lighting in 
the UK which has reduced our energy 
demand for lighting by around 80%, 
and aim to continue to apply these 
technologies at new locations where 
appropriate. In the USA, we have 
recently constructed a new building 
for Renishaw, Inc. where carpets 
with a 43% pre-consumer recycled 
content were used. We also reduced 
the amount of parking enabling us to 
increase the amount of green space 
on the site to around 3,200 m
2
, thus 
removing the need to transport and 
lay around 1,600 m
3
 of tarmac and 
1,500 tonnes of stone. The roof was 
also upgraded to white thermoplastic 
polyolefin (TPO) offering two advantages. 
Firstly, it is a lighter roofing system 
which allows for the building structure 
to utilise less steel, and secondly, a 
white TPO roof provides a reduction 
to the roof heat island effect, as 
recognised by the LEED
®
 energy 
and environmental design standard. 
LED lighting has been installed 
throughout the building which reduces 
our annual energy demand around 
100,000 kWh compared to traditional 
ballast tube lighting.
In Germany and the UK we are looking 
at ways we can reduce the impact of 
our pool car fleets, and are looking at 
fuel types and car sizes to increase 
the fuel efficiencies and overall impact 
of the vehicles. At our new building in 
the USA we have installed two electric 
vehicle charging points.
We have also investigated energy in 
production and developed a project 
to analyse downtime on our machine 
tools, which significantly contributes to 
our energy demands. Machine tools 
are designed to always be left in 
standby mode, which uses only slightly 
less energy. This project has enabled 
us to reduce the power required when 
the machines are not in use, and from 
the work we have carried out to date, 
we have reduced our energy demand 
from these machines by just over 
806,000 kWh per annum.
We continue to look at ways to 
reduce our reliance on business travel 
and to install state-of-the art video-
conferencing facilities at our locations. 
Our people are encouraged to use 
these facilities and other technologies 
rather than travel if possible. We are 
also working with our logistics partners 
to measure the GHG emissions of the 
work they perform on our behalf and 
will work with them to manage this as 
effectively as possible. 
This year our total GHG emissions 
have increased by 7% but our statutory 
emissions have increased by just 2%. 
We continue to increase coverage of 
our scope 3 emissions data and expect 
to show increases in the data reported 
as this progresses. We have continued 
to increase our business over this 
period and have importantly seen our 
statutory GHG emissions normalised 
by revenue fall by 19% and our total 
GHG emissions normalized by revenue 
fall by 16%. 
At our sites across the globe we 
house 4,530 people, with sites 
ranging in size from two people, to 
our UK headquarters, which houses 
1,411 in eight buildings. Our buildings 
range from a 19th century Grade II 
listed cotton mill, to state-of-the-art, 
purpose-built modern buildings, and 
offices in large and small multipurpose 
properties around the world. 
In the UK, Renishaw continues to 
participate in the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment (CRC) Energy Efficiency 
Scheme and the Carbon Disclosure 
Project (CDP). We use the CDP as a 
benchmarking tool and are working 
extensively to ensure that our efforts in 
GHG emission management are fully 
disclosed and are as transparent as is 
expected by our people, customers, 
and investors.

Renishaw is legally obliged to report on 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions (as defined 
by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol). 
However, through analysis, it is evident 
that our Scope 3 emissions amount to 
a significant proportion of our carbon 
footprint. We will continue to disclose 
our Scope 1, 2, and significant Scope 
3 emissions, and to put efforts into 
improving data quality, and expanding 
our Scope 3 data capture to present 
a more complete picture of our GHG 
emissions. During the year, our total 
GHG emissions for Scope 1 and 2

To calculate our GHG emissions, we 
have used the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard 
(revised addition), data gathered for 
our CRC submission, and the UK 
Government’s GHG reporting guidance 
as the basis of our methodology 
and the source of emissions factors. 
Our GHG emissions are based on 
actual data taken from bills, invoices, 
meter readings and expense claims 
wherever possible. For our Scope 
1 and 2 emissions, less than 1% of 
the data is based on estimates from 
averaged data sets.

most of our products to be compliant 
in July 2017. We continue to monitor 
substances against those identified 
as ‘substances of very high concern’ 
under the Registration, Evaluation, 
Authorisation and Restriction of 
Chemicals Directive. Whilst we do 
not fall within the remit of the USA’s 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
and Consumer Protection Act, we 
recognise that compliance with the 
conflict minerals assessment and 
disclosure aspects of such legislation 
is important to many of our customers. 
We also recognise we should have a 
supply chain with minimum risk, that is 
free of unethical practices. As such, we 
have worked to mitigate against conflict 
minerals within our supply chain. 
Continual investigations in our supply 
chain are carried out to help ensure 
conflict minerals are not present. 
Any issues we consider to be against 
the spirit of the Business Code are 
monitored, and we work with suppliers 
where issues are identified.
Waste management
Our waste strategy, which was 
started in February 2014 and proved 
to be effective, has continued to 
drive our efforts throughout the year, 
resulting in a further 2,330 tonnes 
of waste being diverted from landfill. 
Approximately 64% of all waste 
generated this year originated from 
our UK sites where we sent less than 
0.5% of waste to landfill, these sites 
continue to maintain their certification 
to the Carbon Trust Waste Standard. 
These sites have been recognised 
by the Carbon Trust for their efforts 
in moving waste away from landfill as 
a disposal option, towards recovery, 
recycling and reuse.
Last year, we set a target of 5% for 
the reduction of waste to landfill in 
our global operations. We have had a 
decrease from our global operations of 
10%. We are still reusing, recycling or 
recovering around 95% of our waste 
around the world.

The California Institute of Technology 
(Caltech) is on a mission to find new 
and effective ways to produce solar 
fuels using only sunlight, water and 
carbon dioxide. A focus of this is 
investigating photocatalysis and light 
capture. Dr David A. Boyd is using 
Raman spectroscopy to accelerate the 
discovery and in-depth understanding 
of photocatalysts and photoactive 
materials for the solar-driven CO

Worldwide attention is continuing 
to focus on expanding our use of 
renewable energy. Whilst equipment 
such as solar panels and wind turbines 
are in increasing supply, and research 
continues into making this equipment 
as efficient as possible, the storage 
of energy generated is another area 
where significant R&D efforts are 
being applied.

appropriate band energetics, for 
efficient photoelectrocatalysis of solar 
fuel reactions. 
Dr Boyd said, “The inVia system is a 
natural fit to assist in the identification 
and characterisation of metal oxide 
catalysts. Given our sample sizes and 
the need to differentiate a number of 
possible material phases, we require 
large area mapping and advanced

especially invaluable.”
Dr Boyd and his colleagues have 
recently published a paper on 
this work in the RSC Journal of

Corporate governance
Introduction
With the assistance of the Audit 
Committee, the Board approves the 
Group’s governance framework and 
reviews its risk management and 
internal control processes with a 
view to maintaining high standards 
of corporate governance throughout 
the Group.
A key focus area for 2017 has been the 
proposed changes to the Company’s 
remuneration policy, which is covered in 
more detail in the Remuneration report 
beginning on page 83. In line with the 
Companies Act 2006, Renishaw will 
be submitting its new remuneration 
policy for shareholder approval at 
the 2017 AGM. The Remuneration 
Committee has reviewed the existing 
policy, which was supported by 86% 
of voting shareholders when put to the 
AGM in 2014. Our proposed changes 
are outlined on pages 86 to 88. 
In reviewing the policy we have: 
• taken into account feedback from 
the shareholder community;
• considered changes in market 
practice since 2014; and 
• reviewed developments in 
remuneration governance, including 
the commentary from many 
stakeholders and observers on the 
issue of executive pay. 
The Annual report on remuneration 
2017 starting on page 90 sets out 
the details of directors’ compensation 
throughout this financial year, which will 
be subject to the normal advisory vote 
at the AGM.
During the period, we have continued 
the implementation of new policies 
and procedures commenced last 
year following the introduction of the 
Market Abuse Regulation, by amending 
the Group’s Share Dealing Code 
and insider list process and training 
employees in order to comply with the 
stricter rules on the management and 
disclosure of inside information.
We have worked closely with Ernst 
& Young LLP in their first year as our 
new auditors, following shareholder 
approval of their appointment at the 
2016 AGM. 
Senior management has also held four 
meetings of our new risk committee 
formed last year, in order to conduct 
a thorough review of our principal 
risks together with mitigation plans. 
The Board also considered the viability 
statement requirement, now in its 
second year, in the context of risk and 
the viability statement is contained on 
pages 75 to 76.
The Board is ultimately responsible 
to shareholders for all the Group’s 
activities, its strategy and financial 
performance, the efficient use of 
the Group’s resources and social, 
environmental and ethical matters.
Sir David Grant 
Senior Independent Director
66 Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 The Brexit referendum had taken place 
only one month prior to the date of our 
report last year, and the full business 
implications of the decision to leave the 
EU were uncertain. The nature of the 
exit remains uncertain, but it is clear 
that changes will need to be made in 
aspects of the Group’s operations. 
However, with a strong direct presence 
in the EU, Renishaw is well placed to 
respond to changes in future trading 
arrangements between the UK and 
the EU and the risk committee will be 
monitoring developments closely to 
assess required actions as the exit and 
trading negotiations become clearer.
Other areas that have received 
particular attention include a review 
of our insurance provider for property 
and liability cover, via a tender 
process that led to the appointment 
of new insurers. We also launched a 
global whistleblowing facility, which 
is externally facilitated by Safecall, 
a leading provider of confidential 
whistleblowing lines, in order to give 
employees additional options should 
they wish to raise a serious concern. 
The Board takes seriously its 
responsibilities for making sure that 
all employees are aware of their 
obligations to act with openness, 
honesty and transparency. This strong 
anti-corruption culture is embedded 
in our Group Business Code and 
Anti-Bribery Policy which can be found 
at www.renishaw.com/en/renishaw-
group-business-code-14444. In 2017, 
we have continued to closely monitor 
operational risks in key regions and are 
implementing additional compliance 
policies in certain areas. In the period 
we entered into a contract with a 
market leading provider, allowing us to 
routinely screen new intermediaries. 
This has been rolled out to the Group, 
via updated e-learning packages 
on anti-bribery as well as senior 
management briefings. Training on our 
Group Business Code, which sets out 
the ethical standards we require, was 
also refreshed globally.

71 A. Leadership
The role of the Board
The Board comprises four executive 
and four independent non-executive 
directors in addition to the executive 
Chairman. The directors holding office 
at the date of this report and short 
biographical details are given on pages 
68 to 69 (Ben Taylor retired on 31st 
July 2016). Full biographical details 
are available at www.renishaw.com. 
Will Lee was appointed by the Board 
as a director with effect from 1st 
August 2016, and along with all other 
directors, will be retiring and putting 
himself up for election at the AGM. 
The Company maintains liability 
insurance for its directors and officers, 
as disclosed in the Other statutory and 
regulatory disclosures. 
There is a formal schedule of matters 
specifically reserved for its decision. 
These include the approval of annual 
and half-year results and trading 
statements, company and business 
acquisitions and disposals, major 
capital expenditure, borrowings, 
material agreements, director and 
company secretary appointments and 
removals, patent-related disputes and 
other material litigation, forecasts and 
major product development projects.
The Board meets as often as is 
necessary to discharge its duties 
effectively. In the financial year ended 
30th June 2017, the Board met for 
nine scheduled meetings and the 
directors’ attendance record at board 
and committee meetings is set out 
at the end of this report. In addition, 
the non-executive directors met a 
number of times without executive 
directors present.
A high-level summary of subject areas 
discussed during the year is set out on 
page 73. 
The Board has three formally constituted 
committees, the Audit Committee, 
the Remuneration Committee and the 
Nomination Committee.
There is an executive management 
committee known as the Executive 
Board that is responsible for the 
executive management of the Group’s 
businesses. It is chaired by the 
Chairman and includes the executive 
directors and senior managers as 
noted on page 70. The Executive 
Board usually meets for two days on 
a monthly basis and considers the 
performance and strategic direction 
of the metrology and healthcare 
businesses and other matters of 
general importance to the Group. 
In addition, there is an executive sales 
and marketing committee known as 
the International Sales and Marketing 
Board which meets quarterly to 
determine the Group’s sales and 
marketing policies and strategies 
and review its sales and marketing 
activities. This committee is chaired 
by the Deputy Chairman and includes 
the Group Finance Director, the 
Group Sales and Marketing Director, 
the directors of the five largest sales 
regions and the Head of Global 
Additive Manufacturing.
A framework of delegated authorities 
is in place that maps out the structure 
of delegation below the Board and 
includes the matters reserved to 
the Executive Board and the level of 
authorities given to management below 
the Executive Board.
An executive risk committee meets 
regularly to review risks which may 
impact on the Group’s business and 
to implement mitigation actions. 
The framework for managing risk is set 
out on pages 50 to 51.
The Board has adopted a conflict 
of interests policy, putting in place 
procedures for the disclosure 
and review of any conflicts and 
potential conflicts, and authorisation 
by the Board (if felt appropriate). 
Authorisations granted and the terms 
of such are reviewed on an annual 
basis. New disclosures are made 
where applicable.

Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Strategic report
73 Division of responsibilities/
the Chairman
The role of Chairman and Chief 
Executive is a combined role and thus 
contrary to the recommendations 
of the Governance Code. Sir David 
McMurtry has held this position since 
the Company listed in 1983 and he 
and John Deer hold the majority of the 
voting interests in the Company.
There has been a voting agreement 
in place between Sir David and John 
Deer since 1983, further details of 
which are set out in the Other statutory 
and regulatory disclosures on page 94. 
The Board considers that there is still a 
clear division of responsibilities at board 
level to ensure an appropriate balance 
of power and authority so that there is 
no one person with unfettered powers 
of decision. The Board and Executive 
Board meet on a sufficiently regular 
basis to make decisions of significance 
to the metrology and healthcare 
business segments and review 
management actions. It is intended that 
this combined role will continue for so 
long as Sir David McMurtry remains 
on the Board and he and John Deer 
hold a majority of the voting interests in 
the Company.
The Chairman has no other significant 
commitments as regards employment 
or directorships of other companies.
Non-executive directors
Sir David Grant is the Senior 
Independent Director and is available 
to discuss material concerns with 
shareholders should the normal 
channels of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive or the Group Finance 
Director fail to resolve such concerns. 
The non-executive directors meet 
without the executive directors 
present to discuss performance and 
other matters.
B. Effectiveness
Composition of the Board
All the non-executive directors 
are considered by the Board 
to be independent in character 
and judgement and there are no 
relationships or circumstances that 
are likely to affect a non-executive 
director’s judgement.
Sir David Grant is currently the Senior 
Independent Director of IQE plc (having 
been appointed in September 2012), 
chair of STEMNET (appointed in 
December 2011) which at the date of 
this report is in the process of merging 
with STEM Learning, chair of the 
National Physical Laboratory (appointed 
in May 2015) and on the board of 
the Defence Science and Technology 
Laboratory (Dstl) (appointed in June 
2012). The Company has dealings 
with these organisations from time to 
time, such as grant-funded research 
projects, or research, collaboration 
or supply agreements. The Company 
confirms that Sir David Grant has taken 
no part in decisions relating to any of 
the dealings between the Company 
and these organisations.
The dealings referred to above are not 
material (i.e. in aggregate they are less 
than 0.5% of the Company’s revenue 
for the financial year ended 30th 
June 2017).
John Jeans was chair of the Council 
of Cardiff University from December 
2011 until December 2015, is chair 
of Innovate UK’s Stratified Medicine 
Steering Group (having been appointed 
in February 2014) and was chair of 
MRC Technology from December 
2008 until November 2014. John was 
also from March 2016 to May 2017, 
interim Chair of the Scottish Medical 
Device Hub and, since May 2017, 
is the Chair of the Scottish Digital 
Health & Care Institute at Strathclyde 
University. The Company has dealings 
with these organisations from time to 
time, such as grant-funded research 
projects, or research, collaboration 
or supply agreements. The Company 
confirms that John Jeans has taken no 
part in decisions relating to any of the 
dealings between the Company and 
these organisations.
The dealings referred to above are not 
material (i.e. in aggregate they are less 
than 0.5% of the Company’s revenue 
for the financial year ended 30th 
June 2017).
Directors’ corporate 
governance report 
continued
Governance
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 74 The Governance Code recommends 
that at least half the Board, excluding 
the Chairman, should comprise 
independent non-executive directors. 
The Board has complied with this 
requirement during the period.
Appointments to the Board
A description of the structure and 
activities of the Nomination Committee 
are set out in the Nomination 
Committee report on page 78.
Commitment
The terms of appointment of the non-
executive directors, which includes 
the expected time commitment and 
requirement to discuss any changes 
to other significant commitments with 
the Chairman and Chief Executive in 
advance, are available for inspection at 
the AGM and the registered office upon 
written request.
None of the executive directors hold a 
directorship in a FTSE 100 company.
Development
Directors are offered the opportunity 
to attend formal training courses 
to update their knowledge of their 
duties as directors. Guidance notes, 
papers and presentations on changes 
to law and regulations are provided 
as appropriate. During the year, 
specific training was given to the 
Board by Herbert Smith Freehills 
on the directors’ and controlling 
shareholders’ obligations in case of 
any offer approach. Non-executive 
directors are invited to attend 
internal conferences, which provide 
information to the Group on new 
product development and marketing 
initiatives, as well as our investor days. 
Business presentations are given at 
board meetings to provide updates on, 
and opportunities to discuss, products 
and business strategies.
This year, non-executive directors 
met with regional management at 
Renishaw, Inc. in the USA. This has 
facilitated a deeper understanding 
of the Group, leadership team and 
Renishaw’s products and markets.
An induction pack is provided to new 
appointees to the Board, and the 
induction programme (together with the 
continuing development programme) 
includes site visits and briefings by 
senior managers, attendance at internal 
senior management conferences and 
external trade shows, as well as foreign 
subsidiary visits, as applicable. 
Information and support
The Board receives appropriate 
documentation, management 
accounts, forecasts and commentaries 
thereon in advance of each board 
meeting to enable its members to 
review the financial performance of 
the Group, current trading and key 
business initiatives. Regular financial 
updates are also provided between 
meetings. The Company Secretary 
advises the Board on all governance 
matters. All directors have access 
to the Company Secretary and to 
independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense where necessary 
to discharge their responsibilities 
as directors. The appointment and 
removal of the Company Secretary is a 
matter reserved for the Board.
Evaluation
The Board and its committees 
undertake an annual evaluation of 
their performance. The format of the 
evaluation varies each year. 
For 2016, Equity Communications 
Limited (which assisted with the last 
externally facilitated evaluation in 
2013) undertook interviews with the 
directors, discussing a list of subjects 
agreed by the Board. The feedback 
report was discussed early in this 
financial year, focussing on effective 
board presentations, succession 
planning and people development. 
Equity Communications Limited has no 
other connection with the Company. 
For 2017, an internal evaluation 
process was undertaken and the 
results will be discussed early in the 
2018 financial year.
Re-election
In accordance with the Governance 
Code all the directors will retire from 
the Board at the next AGM and will 
offer themselves up for re-election 
or election (as the case may be) at 
the AGM.
C. Accountability
Financial and business reporting
The respective responsibilities of the 
directors and auditor in connection with 
the financial statements are explained 
in Directors’ responsibilities on page 97 
and the Independent auditor’s report 
on pages 98 to 105.
Fair, balanced and 
understandable
The directors consider that the Annual 
report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable, and 
provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Going concern
The Group’s strategy for delivering 
its objectives and business model, 
together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development and 
performance are set out in the 
Strategic report, where details of 
the financial and liquidity positions 
are also given. In addition, note 20 
to the financial statements includes 
the Group’s objectives and policies 
for managing its capital, details of its 
financial instruments and hedging 
activities and its exposures to credit 
risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial 
resources at its disposal and the 
directors have considered the 
current financial projections. As a 
consequence, the directors believe that 
the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the directors 
have a reasonable expectation that 
both the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue 
in operation for a period of at least 
12 months from the date of approval of 
the financial statements. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Annual 
report and accounts.
Viability statement
The Board undertakes an annual 
review of the corporate strategy, 
which includes medium term financial 
forecasts and an assessment of 
the major risks facing the business. 
In addition, current financial year 
forecasts are reviewed regularly by 
the Board, underpinned by regular 
briefings from its business sectors and 
subsidiaries on progress. The corporate 
strategy provides the foundations for 
monitoring of performance, budgets, 
risk and strategic actions by the Board.
The Board confirms that its 
assessment during the year of the 
principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, 
solvency and/or liquidity, and which are 
set out in the Group’s Principal risks 
and uncertainties on pages 52 to 53, 
was robust. In making the assessment, 
severe but plausible scenarios have 
been considered that estimate the 
potential impact of the principal risks 
on the financial forecasts over the 
assessment period. 
Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Strategic report
75 In accordance with provision C.2.2 
of the Governance Code, whilst the 
Board has no reason to believe the 
Group will not be viable over a longer 
period, the period over which the 
Board considers it possible to form 
a reasonable expectation as to the 
Group’s longer-term viability, based 
on the risk and sensitivity analysis 
undertaken, is the three-year period 
to 30th June 2020, taking account of 
the Group’s current position, financial 
forecasts, future prospects and the 
potential impact of the Principal risks 
and uncertainties documented in the 
Strategic report. The Board believes 
that a three-year viability assessment 
period is appropriate as the timeframe 
is covered by the Group’s corporate 
strategy, takes account of the Group’s 
short order book and, together with 
the planning process set out above, 
it gives management and the Board 
sufficient, realistic visibility on the future 
in the context of the industry and world 
economic environment.
On the basis of the above and other 
matters considered and reviewed by 
the Board during the year, the Board 
has a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period to 30th 
June 2020. In assessing the Group’s 
viability over the next three years, it is 
recognised that all future assessments 
are subject to a level of uncertainty 
that increases for the later part of the 
assessment period and that future 
outcomes cannot be guaranteed or 
predicted with any certainty.
Risk management and 
internal control
The Board is responsible for 
the Company’s systems of risk 
management and internal control, 
and for reviewing their effectiveness. 
Any system of internal control is 
designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and 
can only provide reasonable, but not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
There are defined lines of responsibility 
and delegation of authorities. 
Established and centrally documented 
control procedures also exist, 
including, for example, capital and 
other expenditure, information and 
technology security and legal and 
regulatory compliance. These are 
applied throughout the Group.
The Group internal audit function 
provides independent and objective 
assurance that the control procedures 
are appropriate and effectively 
applied. The Group Audit Manager 
attends Audit Committee meetings 
to present annual internal audit plans 
and the results of such internal audits. 
Actions are monitored by the Audit 
Committee on an ongoing basis.
There is an established process for 
the review of business risks throughout 
the Group including an executive risk 
committee as explained on pages 
50 to 51.
The Board ensures that there are 
effective internal controls over the 
financial reporting and consolidation 
processes. Monthly accounts and 
forecasts are presented to the Board 
for review. The Group internal audit 
function undertakes a review of 
subsidiaries’ accounting processes 
and performance to provide assurance 
to the Board on the integrity of 
the information supplied by each 
company forming part of the Group’s 
consolidated results.
The Board undertakes an annual 
formal review of the effectiveness of 
the Group’s system of internal controls 
and an updated risk and controls 
analysis. The review covers all material 
controls, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls and risk 
management systems.
The Board has conducted a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. 
The Board is satisfied that there is 
an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant 
risks facing the Group, that has been 
in place during the year, is regularly 
reviewed and accords with the FRC 
guidance on risk management and 
control. The Board confirms that 
necessary action has been or is 
being taken to remedy any significant 
failings or weaknesses identified from 
its review.
Audit Committee and auditor
A description of the structure and 
activities of the Audit Committee are 
set out in the Audit Committee report

Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 76 E. Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with shareholders
The Board announced a new policy 
in the 2013 Annual report. No private 
meetings will be held other than 
shareholder meetings with the 
Chairman, Senior Independent Director 
and/or any other non-executive 
director where a shareholder has 
material issues, concerns or questions. 
The director attending such a meeting 
will communicate the shareholder’s 
issues, concerns or questions to the 
Board. The Board’s response will be 
published on the Renishaw website 
for the benefit of all shareholders 
where appropriate. 
The interim and annual results and 
presentations are posted on the 
website promptly after announcement 
of the results to the UK Listing Authority

Open webcasts of presentations on 
annual and half-year results are held 
and recordings of the presentations 
and the subsequent question and 
answer sessions made available

website. Analysts’ and brokers’ 
reports will be circulated to the Board. 
The Board intends to hold open 
discussions with any shareholder 
who wishes to share views with the 
directors at the AGM or the annual 
investor day at which presentations on 
group strategy, business segments and 
product lines will be given by members 
of the Board and senior management, 
as well as tours covering the Group’s 
activities. This year, 97 visitors attended 
the Company’s investor day, which 
included various Q&A sessions with 
the Board during the day as well as an 
opportunity to ask questions during 
tours, lunch and refreshment breaks.
Constructive use of the AGM
The AGM takes place at the 
Company’s headquarters or one of 
the Company’s other sites and formal 
notification is sent to the shareholders 
at least 20 working days before the 
meeting. A business presentation is 
given and all directors are available 
for questions during and after the 
meeting, including the chairs of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees. Tours of the Company’s 
facilities are offered.
Separate resolutions are proposed 
for each substantially separate issue, 
and all resolutions are taken on a poll. 
The Company reports on the number 
of votes lodged on each resolution, the 
balance for and against each resolution 
and the number of votes withheld. 
This information is published via an 
RIS and on the Company’s website 
following the meeting.

77 Boardroom diversity
The Board has considered the 
recommendations of the “Women on 
Boards” report issued by Lord Davies 
of Abersoch, and his subsequent 
annual reviews, as regards setting 
out aspirations for the appointment of 
women to boards, and has decided 
that it is inappropriate to set out 
any levels that may require positive 
discrimination in this respect, as the 
overriding requirement is to appoint 
directors with the necessary skills and 
experience for the role.
However, as an international company, 
the Board acknowledges that diversity 
of all types is a benefit and should be 
borne in mind when recruiting to all 
roles within the Company, and has a 
policy to provide equal opportunities 
to all. The Board’s policy is to request, 
where recruitment consultants are 
appointed for board appointment, that 
a proportion of female candidates are 
included in their shortlist.
Sir David McMurtry
Chair of the Nomination Committee
27th July 2017
Activities during the year
The committee met three times 
during the year to discuss executive 
management succession planning and 
to decide the recruitment process for 
the replacement of Norma Tang as 
Company Secretary, who gave notice 
of resignation in March. A recruitment 
consultant, Demeter Limited, was 
engaged to seek appropriate 
candidates for appointment to the dual 
role of general counsel and company 
secretary. The recruitment process is 
continuing. Demeter Limited has no 
other connection with the Company.
It was agreed that Will Lee will take 
over responsibility for chairing the 
International Sales and Marketing 
Board from the start of the 2018 
financial year.
In relation to non-executive positions, 
the four non-executive directors 
were all appointed within the last five 
years and the Board considers that 
they are working effectively together 
in supporting the Board and the 
Company. Consequently there were 
no further appointments or changes 
considered necessary during the year.

Key issues and activities
In addition to reviewing the financial reporting of the Company, the committee also spends a significant amount of time 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control processes and its internal and external audit activities. 
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 80 Significant issues in relation to 
the financial statements
As part of the reporting and review 
process, the committee has regular 
discussions with management 
and the external auditor relating to 
significant issues. For the current 
year the committee concluded that 
the carrying value of goodwill and 
the treatment of forward exchange 
contracts for hedging purposes were 
the two significant issues relating to the 
financial statements 
The committee first focused on 
the impairment testing by the 
Company of the carrying value of 
goodwill. By applying knowledge 
and making enquiries of the relevant 
cash-generating units, reviewing 
the forecasts and the sensitivity 
analysis, the committee agreed with 
the conclusion reached that the only 
impairment provisions required were for 
the goodwill arising on consolidation 
of Renishaw Diagnostics Limited and 
Measurement Devices Limited (relating 
to the spatial measurement business), 
both of which have been classified 
as discontinued operations and the 
goodwill provided for in full.
The committee then examined the 
Group’s technical compliance with 
IAS 39 given the hedging instruments 
utilised. A thorough assessment of the 
opening and closing positions indicated 
that certain of the Group’s open 
contracts did not qualify for hedge 
accounting. The committee satisfied 
itself that the fair values of the hedging 
instruments were not misstated in 
terms of the opening and closing 
Consolidated balance sheets, however 
a restatement of the prior year profit, 
with a corresponding increase to other 
comprehensive income was required to 
ensure compliance with IAS 39. 
As the Group originally intended that 
these contracts be qualifying hedging 
instruments, the committee considered 
the adoption of an alternative 
performance measure for profit which 
excludes the profit/loss arising on this 
restatement and the unwinding of the 
open contracts in this and future years. 
As such, the adjusted profit before tax 
disclosure has been adopted to provide 
stakeholders with a better measure of 
underlying performance.
The committee discussed these 
issues with the external auditor and 
was satisfied that its conclusions 
were consistent with those of the 
external auditor.
Approach to auditor 
appointment and audit quality
The committee has primary 
responsibility for making the 
recommendation on the appointment, 
reappointment and removal of the 
external auditor, which the Board 
puts to shareholders for approval at 
the AGM. 
As reported last year, a tender process 
for the appointment of the external 
auditor was undertaken in 2016. 
Following a recommendation from the 
committee to the Board, Ernst & Young 
LLP were formally appointed at the 
AGM in October 2016. The committee 
has monitored the transition activities 
and audit approach undertaken by 
Ernst & Young LLP by way of updates 
provided at Audit Committee meetings 
and further routine discussions 
between the committee chair, company 
finance representatives and the senior 
representatives of Ernst & Young LLP .
When the committee assesses the 
effectiveness of the external audit 
process and the quality of the audit 
work throughout the year it considers:
• any issues arising from the prior year 
audit (conducted by KPMG LLP); 
• the proposed audit plan including 
the identification of risks specific 
to the Group, audit scope and 
materiality thresholds; 
• the delivery of the audit in line with 
the plan; 
• the communication of matters arising 
during the audit to the committee; 
• meetings with the external auditor 
without management being present; 
• the independence and objectivity of 
the auditor; and
• feedback from executive management.
The contract for external audit will 
be put out to tender at least every 
ten years.
Independence of 
external auditor
In order to safeguard the independence 
and objectivity of the external auditor, 
the committee reviews the nature 
and extent of the non-audit services 
supplied, receiving reports on the 
balance of audit to non-audit fees. 
The non-audit services policy reflects 
the extended list of prohibited 
services as set out in the latest 
EU audit regulation. There are also 
specified services which require the 
prior approval of the Group Finance 
Director and chair of the Audit 
Committee before the auditor may be 
appointed to provide such services. 
In addition, there are specified levels of 
authorisation to be obtained before the 
auditor may be permitted to tender for 
non-audit services.
For 2017, the external auditor has 
provided £20,000 of non-audit work 
including a piece of work linked 
to the Audit Committee’s review 
of banking payments referred to 
below, and a piece of assurance 
work in India required under that 
country’s legislation.
An analysis of fees paid to Ernst & 
Young LLP is included in note 5 to the 
group financial statements.
Risk management and 
internal controls
The committee monitors the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls and risk management 
processes which allows it to maintain 
a good understanding of the business 
performance and key areas of 
judgement and decision making within 
the Group.
During the year a new Group Audit 
Manager was appointed, with 
the incumbent transferring to the 
role of Head of Group Finance. 
The reorganisation allows for the 
internal audit function to be fully 
independent of the day to day 
operations of the finance function. 
Internal audit is planning to expand its 
use of data analytical tools to enhance 
the focus of audit tests. The Committee 
determined the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function as detailed in the 
key issues and activities section above.
Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Strategic report
81 Governance
Audit Committee  
report continued
Following a period of strong growth, 
the committee commissioned a review 
of the Group Internal Control manual to 
ensure that Renishaw’s policies exceed 
best practice for an organisation of 
Renishaw’s size and structure; this 
review will also reflect the management 
comments that the new external 
auditors raise. The review will be 
completed during 2017/18.
Like many public and private sector 
organisations, the Company is a 
potential target for external banking-
related frauds, similar to those widely 
reported in the press. Consequently, 
the committee reviewed the controls 
applied to electronic and manual 
payments during the year to ensure 
they were sufficiently robust. 
The committee is satisfied that 
increased awareness of such frauds, 
internal audit’s focus on this area and 
the controls around bank payments 
are adequate to detect such a fraud 
although the Company recognises 
the increasing sophistication of such 
attempts and is directing additional 
resources to support its efforts in the 
wider cyber arena.
In the previous year, the committee 
reviewed the policy by which 
employees of the Company may, in 
confidence, raise matters of concern, 
including possible improprieties 
in financial reporting or other 
matters. In line with the committee’s 
recommendation, the Board enhanced 
the policy in February 2017 by 
implementing an external reporting line. 
The committee also monitors the 
effectiveness of the Company’s 
procedures to avoid any bribery related 
to the activities of the Group.
Details of risk management and internal 
controls are set out on pages 50 to 51 
and 76.
Fair, balanced and 
understandable report 
and accounts
One of the key governance 
requirements is for the Annual report to 
be fair, balanced and understandable 
and that it provides the shareholders 
with sufficient information to assess 
the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy. Ensuring that this 
standard is met requires continuous 
assessment of the financial reporting 
issues affecting the Group on a year-
round basis in addition to a number 
of focused exercises that take place 
during the accounts production 
process within a strict timeframe.
The processes adopted in relation 
to the Annual report included 
the following:
• specific ownership and responsibility 
for the individual sections was 
allocated and documented;
• during the compilation period, 
regular meetings were held with 
members of Group Finance, Group 
Secretariat, CSR and Corporate 
Communications, all primary authors 
of the Annual report. These meetings 
ensured that there was appropriate 
linkage between the various sections 
of the report and that reporting 
was balanced;
• an extensive review was undertaken 
to ensure factual accuracy;
• a qualitative review of the entire 
Annual report was undertaken to 
ensure that it promotes consistency 
and balance between the 
component elements;
• at the committee’s first meeting in 
July 2017, the committee reviewed 
an initial draft of the Annual report, 
during which it probed and tested 
certain disclosures;
• at the committee’s second meeting 
in July 2017, the committee 
challenged the fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment and 
examined whether appropriate 
balance and equal prominence 
had been given to favourable and 
unfavourable events; and
• following review and comment by 
both the committee and the Board, 
the Annual report was subject to final 
approval by the Board.
The committee was satisfied with the 
process undertaken in preparing the 
Annual report. Following discussions at 
its July 2017 meetings, the committee 
advised the Board that the Annual 
report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the 
performance, strategy and business 
model of the Company. 
The directors’ statement on a fair, 
balanced and understandable Annual 
report is set out on page 75.

Statement from the Chair of 
the Remuneration Committee
Introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present the Directors’ remuneration 
report for 2017.
The report complies with the 
requirements for reporting on directors’ 
pay introduced in October 2013 and is 
split into the following three sections:
1.  this statement from me as the Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee; 
2.  the remuneration policy (pages 86 
to 89) which is to be put before 
the shareholders at the AGM on 
20th October 2017 and which is 
intended to apply for a three-year 
period from that date; and 
3.  the annual report on remuneration 
(pages 90 to 93), setting 
out information on directors’ 
remuneration paid during the year 
ended 30th June 2017, and how 
our policy will be implemented in 
the year ending 30th June 2018. 
Review of the Remuneration 
Committee’s activities
The committee met seven times during 
the year in order to:
• set targets at the start of the year 
for the annual bonus, with reference 
to the Company’s budgets and 
forecasts. The targets reflected the 
committee’s expectations for profit 
growth and its desire to reinforce 
the importance of the cash position 
following several years of strategic 
capital investment. Targets and 
associated bonus scheme rules were 
communicated to executive directors 
at the start of the financial year. 
These targets are disclosed later in 
this report;
• consider Will Lee’s remuneration, 
following his appointment to the 
Board as Group Sales and Marketing 
Director, following Ben Taylor’s 
retirement at the end of July 2016. 
Will’s initial remuneration was set 
below our target market position 
for the role (and significantly below 
Ben’s package), with a base salary 
of £325,000 but with the expectation 
that it would increase substantially, 
subject to performance, once he 
became established in the position. 
Shareholders will note that as a result 
of Will’s excellent performance in 
the role this year that the Committee 
has awarded Will a substantial salary 
increase to take his salary to around 
that of the other non-founding 
executive directors – a base salary 
of £398,000; 
• appoint Mercer Kepler as 
independent professional 
remuneration advisers; 
• approve director salary increases 
and bonuses, and the Chairman and 
Chief Executive’s expenses; and
• conduct a detailed review of 
the Company’s remuneration 
policy, further details of which are 
provided below.
Directors’ remuneration report
We achieved a record turnover of £536.8m with 
underlying revenue growth of 14%. Adjusted profit 
before tax was £109.1m, and statutory profit before 
tax was £117 .1m, an increase of 25% on an adjusted 
basis. Our total shareholder return during the year 
was 67%, ranking Renishaw in the top 25 in both 
the FTSE 250 and FTSE 350.

Remuneration Committee 
role and composition
The Remuneration Committee 
is responsible for deciding the 
Company’s framework of executive 
director remuneration and setting 
remuneration packages for 
each of the executive directors. 
The committee’s aim is to motivate 
and retain executive directors by 
rewarding them with competitive 
salary, benefit packages and 
incentives. The incentives are 
linked to the overall performance 
of the Group and, in turn, to the 
interests of the shareholders.
The committee reviews annually 
the executive directors’ 
remuneration in the context of 
the Group’s performance during 
the year.
The committee also reviews 
the remuneration structure and 
packages for the next level of 
senior leaders across the business 
to ensure it is competitive and 
fair, and that there is appropriate 
progression for those identified as 
potential successors to the Board 
and senior executive team.
All the members of the committee 
are non-executive directors, 
comprising Kath Durrant (Chair), 
Sir David Grant, Carol Chesney 
and John Jeans. The terms of 
reference of the committee are 
published on the Company’s 
website. Executive directors attend 
meetings of the committee by 
invitation for parts of the agenda as 
appropriate. Independent advisers 
are used as required.

Review of the remuneration 
policy
Three years ago at our 2014 AGM 
shareholders approved a new three-
year remuneration policy for Renishaw, 
with 86% of votes in favour. At the 
2015 and 2016 AGMs shareholders 
supported the implementation of our 
policy with 98% in favour. This year 
we are seeking approval of a new 
remuneration policy that is designed to 
operate over the next three years. 
We have reviewed our policy taking 
into account:
• the strategic opportunities and 
operational challenges the Company 
may face in the next few years;
• the external corporate 
governance environment;
• commentary from advisory bodies; 
and
• the views of our shareholders, 
including the majority shareholders.
This year we have operated with the 
support of independent professional 
remuneration advisors. Giving due 
consideration to all these inputs, 
applying our own experience, and 
assessing the needs of Renishaw, 
the committee concluded that some 
changes should be made to the 
present policy. In May 2017 we wrote 
to all our shareholders outlining our 
proposals and inviting feedback. 
Where feedback was received this 
was also taken into account by 
the committee. 
In summary, the proposed changes to 
the policy include: 
• introduction of a new deferred 
annual equity incentive plan, with 
a maximum opportunity of 50% of 
salary. This deferred annual equity 
incentive will only be earned for 
performance beyond the level at 
which the maximum annual bonus 
is payable. Any award made under 
the deferred annual equity incentive 
will be delivered in Renishaw shares 
that normally vest on the third 
anniversary of grant, subject to 
continued employment;
• introduction of a minimum 
shareholding requirement for 
executive directors of 50% of salary; 
and 
• clarification in the recruitment 
policy of the flexibility available to 
the committee to buy out awards 
forfeited by external appointees, 
if necessary, to secure the 
right individual. 
In considering these proposed 
policy changes the committee 
considered the following areas to be 
of particular importance:
(1) Performance
Renishaw is well placed to continue 
its long term growth trajectory, based 
on its continued commitment to 
innovation and product development. 
The Company, whilst retaining 
significant capability in the UK, 
continues to successfully expand 
its sales, marketing, applications 
engineering and distribution presence 
around the world. Its global reach and 
relevance to high-value manufacturing 
mitigates to some extent the potential 
headwinds posed by Brexit uncertainty. 
We expect Renishaw to continue 
to be positioned to perform well. 
Stretching performance targets 
are therefore at the heart of our 
remuneration approach for executive 
directors and leaders supporting 
them. Target setting takes place in a 
strategic context, and seeks to reflect 
our expectation that Renishaw will 
continue to grow substantially over the 
long term, but also takes into account 
the opportunities and challenges 
that can affect businesses with short 
order books. 
In the past year, performance in the 
core metrology businesses has been 
strong, innovation in these businesses 
continues apace and relationships 
with high-value manufacturers and 
organisations in their supply chain 
continue to deepen. 
Proposed changes to the remuneration 
policy include the introduction of an 
additional opportunity for executive 
directors to earn a deferred annual 
equity incentive award in the event 
that performance exceeds the annual 
bonus maximum performance target. 
Any deferred annual equity incentive 
award would be earned only for 
additional performance beyond the 
current maximum performance level, 
and would be capped at 50% of salary. 
The decision to propose deferred 
shares and a longer term element to 
remuneration is intended to help align 
non-founder executive directors with 
long-term shareholder interests, and 
help smooth remuneration through 
business cycles. 
(2) Succession
Under the leadership of Sir David 
McMurtry and John Deer the Company 
has developed into a formidable global 
force in the science and application of 
advanced metrology solutions. A key 
role of the Remuneration Committee is 
to help the Board ensure that we are 
capable of attracting, developing and 
retaining the next generation of leaders. 
In developing the proposed new 
remuneration policy the committee has 
taken into account the potential need 
for the Company to attract and retain 
leadership talent during the life of the 
next policy.
The Company has strong internal 
candidates for promotion and 
succession to the Board, and the 
proposed changes to the policy 
provide additional flexibility in the event 
that it is necessary to recruit externally. 
The proposals provide the flexibility to 
compensate new recruits (if necessary) 
for incentive awards they may have 
to forfeit on joining Renishaw. In such 
an event the fair value of any buyout 
award would not exceed the fair value 
of the awards being replaced, taking 
into account vesting and performance 
criteria. Awards would as far as 
possible be replaced on a like-for-
like basis. 
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 84 The committee has also taken a 
decision that where appointments 
are made, salaries may be set at 
a level that subsequently requires 
staged increases to the package, 
rather than the more typical large 
single increase on appointment. 
This enables us to ensure that new 
appointees demonstrate they can fully 
perform in their new role before they 
can move to the median package for 
the role. This approach may require 
the committee to subsequently 
apply a higher percentage increase 
to the individual’s salary than the 
average percentage increase across 
the workforce. 
(3) The views of our shareholders
An unprecedented level of commentary 
regarding executive pay has been 
seen over the past year in the UK 
media. Institutional shareholders 
and their governance departments, 
advisory bodies, the government and 
other political parties have offered 
their perspectives. Renishaw’s 
peers, international competitors, our 
customers and employees have their 
views too. The committee is mindful of 
all these views and opinions and has 
sought to steer a path that ensures 
that the remuneration policy can 
be supported by a majority of the 
institutional and private shareholders, 
as well as by our majority shareholders 
– and is in the best long-term interests 
of the Company. 
Historically, feedback from proxy 
advisors and some institutional 
shareholders has questioned the 
absence of a long term incentive for our 
executives. The committee therefore 
explored a range of alternatives to best 
address this concern. Renishaw is a 
long-term business, and its leadership 
has invested significantly in R&D over 
many decades. The culture of the 
business is imbued with a long-term 
perspective and a desire to innovate. 
In reviewing alternatives for a long-
term incentive, the committee was 
necessarily cognisant of the views of 
the Company’s majority shareholders 
who concur with the commentary in 
the recent BEIS Select Committee 
report that traditional LTIPs are not 
necessarily right for all companies. 
The committee is therefore proposing 
to introduce a longer term element 
in the form of the deferred annual 
equity incentive plan, alongside a 
new requirement for all executive 
directors to build up and maintain a 
minimum shareholding. In this way, 
we believe that the new remuneration 
policy will help align executives’ 
remuneration more closely with 
Company performance and the long-
term interests of all shareholders. 
It will also help address the impact 
of the absence of an LTIP on the 
overall competitiveness of the 
package. The initial level of minimum 
shareholding required will be 1× 
the maximum opportunity available 
under the new deferred annual equity 
incentive plan, broadly in line with 
the ratio of minimum shareholding 
requirements and share-based 
incentive opportunities at other FTSE 
250 companies.
The committee has also proposed a 
change in the policy to place a cap 
on total remuneration which we hope 
will provide additional assurance 
to shareholders.
The details of the proposed 
remuneration policy are contained in 
the following pages. The committee 
and the Board recommend this policy 
to shareholders, and hope we can 
count on your support.

Total 
remuneration
To attract, motivate 
and retain talented 
executive directors 
to support delivery of 
Renishaw’s strategy 
and maximise long-
term shareholder 
value.
Executive director remuneration 
is designed to be simple, 
conservative, and aligned with 
shareholder interests. 
A cap on total remuneration 
at upper quartile of the 
relevant market for the 
position in question, will 
apply.
Described below 
in relation to each 
constituent element

Our total remuneration policy comprises the following constituent elements:
Element

Purpose and

Base salary To provide a 
competitive 
remuneration 
package to motivate 
and retain executive 
directors of the 
required quality to 
help the Group meet 
its objectives to 
deliver the Group’s 
strategy.
Renishaw aims to pay base 
salaries between median and 
upper quartile, reflecting that its 
variable pay opportunities remain 
significantly below market. 
Executive director salaries are 
benchmarked against equivalent 
positions for relevant industrial 
sectors based on factors such as 
sector, size and location.
Base salaries are reviewed annually 
taking into account the average 
increase across the Group, and 
specifically the UK where executive 
directors are located in the UK.
Salaries are set to deliver 
total remuneration in 
accordance with the policy 
defined above.
Base salary increases 
will normally be capped 
at the level of salary 
increases for the broader 
workforce, unless the 
committee in its absolute 
discretion determines 
that a higher increase 
is appropriate. Example 
circumstances include: 
to reflect a significant 
change in a director’s role 
or responsibilities, or if 
(in shareholders’ interests) 
a director was intentionally 
appointed on a below-
market total remuneration 
opportunity initially and their 
subsequent performance in 
the role warrants an above-
average salary increase.
The rationale for any 
above-average increase will 
be disclosed in the relevant 
Annual remuneration report.

Benefits provided on an ongoing 
basis include:
• a car or car allowance;
• private medical insurance;
• life assurance;
• long-term disability cover;
• home telephone costs.
If, on the recruitment of a new 
executive director, relocation is 
required to the director’s place of 
work, the necessary relocation 
support may be provided.
Excluding accommodation 
and relocation costs, 
benefits are capped at 
£50k p.a.
Not applicable.
Annual short-
term bonus
To incentivise and 
reward execution 
of the Group’s 
objectives.
The committee sets Group 
performance targets, including a 
threshold below which no bonus 
is earned increasing from zero on 
a straight-line basis to a target 
at which 75% of salary would be 
earned, and to a cap at which a 
maximum 100% of salary could be 
earned. 
Part or all of any bonus paid may 
be subject to repayment in the 
event of any material financial 
misstatement, error in calculation or 
misconduct.
100% of salary Based on Group 
performance, primarily 
measured by profit 
before tax (the key 
measure of Group 
performance used 
by shareholders 
and by the Board). 
The committee may 
introduce other 
metrics (financial and 
non-financial) to reflect 
the Group’s priorities, 
or make adjustments 
to appropriately 
reflect underlying 
performance, provided 
that the bonus will 
always be subject to 
achievement of the 
threshold financial 
performance. 
Targets will be set 
around the Group’s 
internal strategic plan.
Any non-financial 
metrics shall not 
form more than 25% 
of the overall bonus 
opportunity.
Deferred 
annual equity 
incentive plan
As per the annual 
short-term bonus 
above.
If performance exceeds the level at 
which a maximum annual short-
term bonus is earned, incremental 
profit growth beyond this level may 
be rewarded through a deferred 
annual equity incentive. Any such 
award is deferred in shares for a 
period of three years. 
Dividends may accrue on deferred 
shares over the deferral period 
and, if so, will be paid as additional 
shares (or a cash equivalent) on 
vesting.
Part or all of any deferred annual 
equity award may be subject to 
repayment in the event of any 
material financial misstatement, 
error in calculation or misconduct.

Approach to recruitment 
remuneration
When agreeing the remuneration 
package for a new executive director, 
the committee will apply the policy 
for the existing executive directors 
to ensure a reasonably consistent 
approach, except as set out below. 
For an external hire, base salary will be 
set in line with the factors set out in the 
policy table, taking into account the 
individual’s experience and the amount 
required to attract the individual to join 
the Company. The committee may also 
consider paying compensation to new 
hires who forfeit any award under the 
variable remuneration arrangements 
with a previous employer. Any such 
buyout awards would have a fair value 
no higher than that of the awards being 
replaced, and would be structured as 
far as possible to replicate the awards 
being forfeited, in terms of vesting 
horizons and performance linkage. 
Where a new executive director is 
required to relocate from their home 
location to take up their role, the 
committee may provide reasonable 
relocation assistance and other 
appropriate allowances if business 
needs require it. 
When an internal appointment is 
made, any pre-existing obligations 
will be honoured and payment will be 
permitted under the policy.
Committee discretion in 
exceptional circumstances
The committee retains discretion in 
exceptional circumstances to offer 
a long-term incentive to support 
Renishaw in securing the best 
executive director candidate if the 
committee considers it to be in 
shareholders’ best interests to do so. 
Any use of this discretion would be 
limited by our internal policy for the 
aggregate of all incentive opportunities 
(as a percentage of salary) not to 
exceed market median, and for an 
individual executive director’s total 
remuneration not to exceed upper 
quartile. Any use of this discretion 
would be accompanied by a full 
rationale in the relevant Annual 
remuneration report.

Pension To provide a 
competitive pension 
as appropriate to 
motivate and retain 
executive directors of 
the required quality 
to meet the Group’s 
objectives
Each of Allen Roberts and Geoff 
McFarland receives a payment of 
15% of salary, being the amount that 
would otherwise be contributed to a 
pension scheme on their behalf.
Will Lee is entitled to an annual 
pension contribution of 15% of 
salary to the Company’s defined 
contribution scheme, but, as agreed 
by the committee, most of this is 
taken as a salary supplement, with 
the level of pension contribution 
dependent on the value of his 
pension pot from time to time and 
the annual allowance.
For any new executive director, 
annual contributions of 15% of salary 
would be made to the Company’s 
defined contribution scheme or all or 
part as an allowance paid in lieu, as 
agreed by the committee.
Geoff McFarland and Will Lee are

Minimum 
shareholding

Supports the 
alignment of 
executive and 
shareholder interests
Executive directors are expected to 
build up and maintain a level of share 
ownership of at least 50% of base 
salary.
50% of any net vested share awards 
(after sales to meet tax liabilities) 
must be retained until the minimum 
shareholding guideline is met.
Not applicable Not applicable
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 88 Service contracts and policy on 
payment for loss of office
The executive directors’ service 
contracts require 12 months’ notice of 
termination by either party. There are no 
obligations in any executive director’s 
service contract or non-executive 
director’s letter of appointment which 
would require the Company to pay a 
specific amount of compensation for 
loss of office. 
The executive directors’ service 
contracts reflect the Company’s policy 
regarding notice periods. No payment 
will be made for a termination by the 
Company for a breach by the executive 
director of his or her service contract. 
In other cases, payment in lieu of notice 
will be considered up to the 12 months’ 
notice period to cover base salary, 
benefits and pension contributions. 
If additional compensation is required 
to be considered, such as on a 
settlement agreement, the committee 
will consider all relevant commercial 
factors affecting the specific case. 
Statement of consideration 
of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group
The committee takes into account 
the pay and employment conditions 
of the Group in the country in which 
the executive director resides, and 
is satisfied that the approach taken 
is fair and reasonable based on 
market conditions and practice and 
the best interests of shareholders. 
When considering the annual salary 
review, the average base salary 
increase awarded to employees 
provides a guide when determining 
the salaries of the executive directors 
(located in the same country). 
The Company does not specifically 
consult with employees on its executive 
director remuneration policy.
Statement of consideration of 
shareholder views
The committee has taken into account 
feedback provided by external 
shareholders when drawing up the 
remuneration policy. At the AGM 
in 2016, the advisory vote on the 
Directors’ remuneration report received 
proxy votes of 97.97% in favour. At the 
AGM in 2014, the binding vote on the 
remuneration policy received proxy 
votes of 86.42% in favour. The main 
feedback related to the absence of a 
long-term share incentive, which the 
committee has sought to address 
through the proposed introduction 
of the deferred annual equity 
incentive plan. 
Non-executive directors’ policy table
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the executive directors and consists of a board fee only. 
There is no entitlement to any additional fees nor any bonus, incentive plans or pension. Set out below is a table showing the 
fees for the non-executive directors of the Company:
Element  
of remuneration
Purpose and  
relevance to strategy Operation Maximum Performance measures
Board fees To provide a 
competitive fee to 
attract and retain 
non-executive 
directors of the 
required quality to 
meet the Group’s 
objectives.
All non-executive directors are paid the 
same fee, irrespective of membership of, or 
their chairing of, board committees.
The fees are reviewed annually with 
reference to fees payable to non-executive 
directors of companies of a similar size and 
complexity.
Reasonable expenses that are incurred by 
directors in undertaking their duties as a 
director are reimbursed
The maximum 
aggregate non-
executive director 
fees payable 
are set by the 
Company’s Articles of 
Association, currently 
an aggregate of 
£300,000 per annum.
Not applicable.
The non-executive directors are appointed for an initial three-year period subject to annual performance review and re-election 
at AGMs, unless terminated earlier by either party on one month’s written notice. Appointments will not normally continue 
beyond nine years in office.

Bonus
The committee establishes bonus targets taking into account the strategic growth expectations of the business, other financial 
parameters and strategic objectives that are required to be achieved. This year two financial measures were targeted, no non-
financial measures were used. 
Under the current policy executive directors may earn up to 100% of base pay as a bonus. For the year in question, the bonus 
was determined by two elements:
1.  Group profit growth (85% of the total opportunity)
This was based on how far the Group’s Adjusted Profit Before 
Tax (APBT) performance in 2017 exceeded the APBT for 2016 
(£87.5m). 
Adjusted profit before tax for the present year grew by 25% 
to £109.1m, and resulted in a payment level of 73% for this 
element of the bonus scheme (worth 62% of salary).

2011 1,066 100% n/a
2010 472 0% n/a
2.  Group cash generation (15% of the total opportunity)
Given the uncertain macroeconomic environment at the start of 
the year, and a reducing level of cash reserves the committee 
decided it was prudent to set a target for cash balances to 
be improved.
The cash balance at the end of the year was £51.9m compared 
to net £21.3m at the end of the previous year, resulting in a 
payment level of 100% for this element of the bonus scheme 
(worth 15% of salary).
As a result of performance against the APBT and cash targets 
set for the 2017 bonus, executive directors received a bonus 
worth 77% of salary.

Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 92 Will Lee was promoted to Group Sales 
and Marketing Director early in the 
financial year. This was a significant 
promotion from his previous role 
and, in line with our approach to 
ensuring merit-based pay, his salary 
on appointment was set below market 
median with the intent to keep this 
under review once he had established 
himself in the new role and had the 
opportunity to prove his capabilities. 
His performance since appointment 
has been assessed by the Board as 
excellent, with his leadership of the 
global sales and marketing organisation 
being particularly strong, and his 
contribution to the Board providing 
deep insight to key decisions. As noted 
in the Chairman’s statement, Will Lee 
will take over responsibility for chairing 
the International Sales and Marketing 
Board from the start of the new 
financial year. As a result, his salary will 
be increased to a competitive level, by 
22.46% for the 2018 financial year.
Annual bonus
As set out in the policy, the maximum 
bonus opportunity for the year ending 
30th June 2018 will continue to be 
100% of salary for executive directors. 
The bonus for the year ending 30th 
June 2018 will be based on financial 
targets. The bonus scheme targets 
have been set based on the policy 
as set out in the policy table, and will 
be disclosed in next year’s Annual 
remuneration report.
Deferred annual equity incentive
For the 2018 financial year, executive 
directors will be eligible for an award 
of up to 50% of salary under the 
new deferred annual equity incentive, 
subject to stretching targets (in 
excess of the level required for the 
annual bonus to pay out in full) being 
achieved. Any award under this 
plan will be delivered in Renishaw 
shares that normally vest on the 
third anniversary of grant, subject 
to continued employment over that 
period. The targets set in relation to 
the deferred annual equity incentive 
will be disclosed in next year’s Annual 
remuneration report.
Consideration by directors of 
matters relating to directors’ 
remuneration
During the year, the Remuneration 
Committee considered the amount 
of the executive directors’ salary and 
the framework for the annual bonus. 
The members of the Remuneration 
Committee for this purpose were:

in reviewing and benchmarking the 
director and senior management 
remuneration arrangements. 
Mercer Kepler is a founder member of 
the Remuneration Consultants Group 
and, as such, voluntarily operates 
under the code of conduct in relation 
to executive remuneration consulting 
in the UK. Total professional fees 
paid to Mercer Kepler during the year 
were £46,300. Mercer Kepler was 
appointed by the committee and have 
not advised the Company on any other 
matters. During the year, the actuarial 
advisory division of Mercer Limited 
(Mercer Kepler’s parent company) 
provided advice to the trustees of the 
Company’s UK defined benefit pension 
scheme and in relation to the defined 
contribution scheme. This work is 
entirely separate from the work done 
by Mercer Kepler for the committee. 
The committee is of the opinion that 
the advice received from Mercer Kepler 
is objective and independent.

Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 94 Annual general meeting
The notice convening the AGM and an 
explanation of the resolutions sought 
are set out in a separate circular. At the 
meeting, the Company will be seeking 
shareholder approval for, amongst 
other things, the ability to make market 
purchases of its own ordinary shares, 
up to a total of 10% of the issued 
share capital, as well as the approval 
of a new forward-looking Directors’ 
remuneration policy intended to 
continue for the next three years.
The directors consider that all the 
resolutions proposed are in the 
best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders as a whole 
and unanimously recommend that 
shareholders vote in favour of the 
resolutions, as they intend to do in 
respect of their own holdings.

Employees
The retention of highly-skilled 
employees is essential to the future of 
the business, and the directors place 
great emphasis on the continuation 
of the Company’s approved training 
policy. Health and safety matters are 
given special attention by the directors 
and well established systems of safety 
management are in place throughout 
the Group to safeguard employees, 
customers and visitors.
Employment policies are designed to 
provide equal opportunities irrespective 
of race, religion, sex, age, disability or 
sexual orientation. Proper consideration 
is given to applications for 
employment from disabled people 
where suitable for appropriate 
vacancies. Employees who become 
disabled whilst with the Company 
will be given every opportunity to 
continue their employment through 
reasonable adjustment to their working 
conditions, equipment, or where this 
is not possible, re-training for other 
positions. They will also be afforded 
opportunities to continue training and 
gain promotion on the same basis as 
any other employee.
Details on information provided to 
employees on the performance 
of the business, consultation with 
employees and performance incentives 
are contained in the description of 
corporate social responsibility activities 
set out on pages 54 to 63.
There are no agreements with 
employees providing for compensation 
for any loss of employment that occurs 
because of a takeover bid.
Donations
No political donations were made 
during the year.
Controlling shareholders’ 
arrangements
The Listing Rules require that premium 
listed companies with “controlling 
shareholders” (defined as a shareholder 
who individually or with any of their 
concert parties exercises or controls 
30% or more of the votes that may 
be cast on all or substantially all the 
matters at the Company’s general 
meeting) must enter into a relationship 
agreement containing specific 
independence provisions.
The independence provisions required 
by the Listing Rules are that:
(i)  transactions and arrangements with 
the controlling shareholder (and/
or any of its associates) will be 
conducted at arm’s length and on 
normal commercial terms;
(ii)  neither the controlling shareholder 
nor any of its associates will take 
any action that would have the 
effect of preventing the Company 
from complying with its obligations 
under the Listing Rules; and
(iii)  neither the controlling shareholder 
nor any of its associates will 
propose or procure the proposal 
of a shareholder resolution which 
is intended or appears to be 
intended to circumvent the proper 
application of the Listing Rules.
By virtue of his shareholding in 
the Company, Sir David McMurtry 
(Chairman and Chief Executive 
36.2% shareholder) is a controlling 
shareholder. John Deer (Deputy 
Chairman, together with his wife, 
16.8%) is also a controlling shareholder 
by virtue of a long-standing voting 
agreement between John Deer (and 
his wife) with Sir David McMurtry. 
The Board confirms that the Company 
has not been able to enter into 
a relationship agreement with its 
controlling shareholders, containing 
the independence provisions required 
by the Listing Rules. The Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) has been 
notified of this, as required by 
the Listing Rules. The controlling 
shareholders have informed the Board 
that they are not willing to enter into a 
relationship agreement because they 
are of the view that the requirement to 
enter into the relationship agreement 
infringes upon their rights as 
shareholders and their track record 
demonstrates that they act in the best 
interests of the Company.

Governance
As a result of there being no 
relationship agreement in place, the 
Listing Rules provide that certain 
enhanced oversight measures will 
apply to the Company.
This means that, unless and to the 
extent that the FCA agrees otherwise, 
all transactions with the controlling 
shareholders must be approved by the 
Company’s shareholders (excluding the 
controlling shareholders) in accordance 
with the related party transaction 
requirements of the Listing Rules, and 
none of the normal exemptions apply.
Guidance has been received from 
the FCA about the application of the 
enhanced oversight measures to the 
remuneration and benefits received 
by the controlling shareholders in 
their capacity as executive directors 
(in accordance with the Company’s 
approved remuneration policy) as 
well other ordinary course corporate 
matters, such as the payment of 
dividends by the Company to all 
shareholders. The FCA has confirmed 
that either these are not transactions 
or arrangements that fall within the 
enhanced oversight measures or that 
the FCA will permit a modification of 
the enhanced oversight measures 
so that they will not apply provided 
that the arrangements remain in the 
ordinary course of business and, in the 
case of salary reviews and bonuses, 
provided that they fall within the small 
transaction exemption in the Annex 
to LR 11. This guidance continues 
to apply in respect of remuneration 
awarded under the new remuneration 
policy, if approved at the AGM.

Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual report and the 
group and the company financial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare group and company 
financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law the directors 
have prepared the group financial 
statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union (EU) and have 
prepared the company financial 
statements in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards, including FRS 
101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
Under company law the directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the group and the company and of 
their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the group and 
company financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• for the group financial statements, 
state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
• for the company financial 
statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the company financial statements; 
and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
group and the company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position 
of the Group and the Company; 
and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and 
the Company to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the directors are also responsible for 
preparing a strategic report, directors’ 
report, directors’ remuneration report 
and corporate governance statement 
that complies with that law and 
those regulations.
The directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of 
the directors in respect of the 
annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of 
our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set 
of accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the Group and of the Company and 
the undertakings; and
• the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ report include a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business during the year and 
the position of the Company and the 
Group at the year end, together with 
a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
We consider the Annual report and 
financial statements, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 98 Overview of our audit approach
Key audit matters •  Revenue recognition as a result of inappropriate cut off via manipulation of timing of 
revenue recognition.
•  Susceptibility to management override through the posting of manual topside 
adjustments during the consolidation process.
•  The valuation of the Group’s forward currency derivatives and assessment of 
hedging activities.
• Carrying value of goodwill.
Audit scope •  We performed an audit of the complete financial information of seven components 
and audit procedures on specific balances for a further six components.
•  The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted 
for 94% of Profit before tax, 92% of Revenue and 90% of Total Assets.
Materiality •  Overall Group materiality of £4.7m which represents 4.6% of Group Profit before 
tax for both continuing and discontinued operations.
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; 
the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated to the 
Audit Committee
Revenue recognition.
Revenue recognition as a result of 
inappropriate cut off via manipulation 
of timing of revenue recognition, 
continuing revenue of £536.8m (2016: 
£427.2m) and discontinued revenue of 
£7.2m (2016: £7.0m).
As described in note 1 of the 
consolidated financial statements, 
where certain products require 
installation, part of the revenue may 
be deferred until the installation is 
complete. Furthermore, where goods 
and services are sold as a bundle, 
the fair value of services is deferred and 
recognised over the period to which 
the service relates with the remaining 
revenue recognised on despatch. No 
revenue should be recognised if there 
are significant uncertainties regarding 
recovery of the consideration due, 
or the possible return of goods. This 
results in the potential for management 
manipulation of the timing of revenue 
recognition.
Refer also to page 80 (Audit Committee 
report).
We identified and assessed the design of key 
controls to validate that revenue recognition 
was appropriate and applied in accordance 
with the Group’s accounting policies.
We performed cut off procedures by testing 
items from revenue recognised during the 
year and subsequent to year end to gain 
assurance over the completeness and 
existence of deferred revenue balances at 
year end. 
We tested credit notes issued after the 
balance sheet date to assess appropriate 
revenue recognition in the period.
We looked for and tested journal entries 
within normal business processes relating to 
revenue transactions close to the year end 
to ensure they were valid, by agreeing the 
journals to originating documentation.
We performed testing on revenue recorded 
through journal entries outside of normal 
business processes to establish whether a 
service had been provided in the financial 
year to support the revenue recognised.
We performed other substantive, 
transactional testing and analytical 
procedures to validate that revenue 
transactions had been appropriately recorded 
in the Consolidated income statement at the 
right time.
The above work was performed at all full 
scope and specific scope locations with third 
party revenue streams.
We ensured that the financial statement 
disclosures were in accordance with 
accounting standards. 
Based on our procedures we are 
satisfied that the revenue cut-off 
was appropriate.

Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated to the 
Audit Committee
Management override
Susceptibility to management override 
during the post-close consolidation 
adjustments process.
We consider that management is in a 
position to perpetrate fraud through the 
manipulation of top-side journal entries 
during the consolidation process.
We focused on this area due to the 
manual nature of the consolidation 
process and the non-routine 
judgemental nature of some of the 
journals posted.
We performed walkthroughs of the 
consolidation process at various month ends 
throughout the year, including the interim and 
year end to assess the design effectiveness of 
the underlying consolidation process.
For all full and specific scope locations we 
independently verified the results of the 
consolidated entities by agreeing the results 
included in the consolidation directly to the 
results audited by the component audit teams. 
For a sample of the remaining entities we 
verified the results of the consolidated entities 
to the underlying source data.
We selected all consolidation journals 
exceeding 15% performance materiality and 
obtained evidence to verify the validity and 
accuracy of the journals being posted.
We found no evidence of 
management override in the  
post-close consolidation 
adjustments.
The valuation of the Group’s 
forward currency derivatives and 
assessment of hedging activities
Refer to the Audit Committee report 
(page 80 to 81) and notes 1, 13 and 
25 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
As described in note 1 of the 
consolidated financial statements 
the Group uses derivative financial 
instruments to manage risks arising from 
changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates relating to forecast sales. 
The Group designates certain derivatives 
as hedges of a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability or 
a highly probable forecast transaction 
(cash flow hedge). Hedge accounting 
is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated 
or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. 
Changes in the fair value of foreign 
currency derivatives which are ineffective 
or do not meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting in IAS 39 are recognised in 
the Consolidated income statement.
We focused on this area due to the 
complexity of some of the derivatives 
entered into, and the magnitude of the 
carrying value of the derivative assets 
and liabilities on the balance sheet, 
being £3.5m and £56.7m respectively 
(2016: £0.9m and £70.6m). 
We obtained direct external confirmation of 
the valuation for each of the forward currency 
contracts held and agreed these to the fair 
values of the derivatives recorded by the 
Group.
We ensured that the requirements of IAS 
39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement (IAS 39) were met by:
•  ensuring the appropriateness of the 
methodology used by management 
to hedge account. We reviewed the 
terms and conditions of all the different 
categories of forward currency contracts 
open at the year end and determined 
whether hedge accounting was 
permissible under IAS 39;
•  challenging management’s assessment 
of whether hedge accounting was 
permissible under IAS 39 for forward 
currency contracts open at the previous 
year end; 
•  using EY specialists to test a sample of 
valuations to ensure that the fair values of 
the forward currency derivatives had been 
reasonably calculated;
•  using EY specialists to evaluate 
management’s documentation and 
assessment of hedge effectiveness; and
•  ensuring that the financial statement 
disclosures were in accordance with 
accounting standards.
As at 30th June 2016 certain 
forward foreign currency open 
contracts were treated as 
qualifying for hedge accounting 
when they did not meet the hedge 
effectiveness criteria. This has 
resulted in a prior year restatement, 
being a £25.8m reduction to 
profit (excluding tax impact) 
and a £25.8m increase in Other 
Comprehensive Income (excluding 
tax impact). We have confirmed 
that the disclosures in note 25 
were in accordance with the 
requirements of IAS 8, Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors. 
We confirmed that the valuation 
of the Group’s forward currency 
derivatives, the assessment of 
hedging activities for the year 
ended 30th June 2017 and the 
disclosures within notes 13 and 
25 were in accordance with the 
requirements of IAS 39, Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement.
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 100 Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated to the 
Audit Committee
Carrying value of goodwill 
Refer to the Audit Committee report 
(page 80 and 81); and notes 1 and 10 of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We focused on this area due the 
size of the goodwill balance of 
£13.3m (2016: £21.3m) and because 
(i) significant levels of goodwill have 
arisen from Renishaw plc acquisitions 
in recent years, (ii) management’s 
assessment of value in use of the 
Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) 
involves judgement about the future 
results of the business and discount 
rates applied to future cash flow 
forecasts, (iii) adverse changes in 
assumptions, particularly relating to 
forecast cash flows and discount rates, 
could reduce the recoverable amount 
below the carrying amount, and give 
rise to an impairment charge and (iv) a 
number of these acquisitions are still in 
the research and development stage 
which makes forecasting inherently more 
judgemental.
We challenged management’s assumptions 
used in its impairment models for assessing 
the recoverability of the carrying value of 
goodwill. We focused on the appropriateness 
of CGU identification, methodology applied to 
estimate recoverable values, discount rates 
and forecast cash flows. Specifically:
•  we validated that the changes in CGUs 
identified were consistent with changes in 
the business and reflect the lowest level at 
which management monitors goodwill in 
accordance with the requirements of IAS 
36, Impairment of Assets (IAS 36);
•  we tested the methodology applied 
in the value in use calculation as 
compared to the requirements of IAS 
36 and the mathematical accuracy of 
management’s model;
•  we inspected the cash flow forecasts 
used in the valuation to ensure that they 
were consistent with information approved 
by the Board and reviewed the historical 
accuracy of management’s forecasts by 
comparing to actual performance;
•  we challenged management on its cash 
flow forecasts and the growth rates for 
the year ended 30th June 2018 and 
beyond by considering evidence available 
to support these assumptions, their 
consistency with findings from other areas 
of our audit and by performing sensitivity 
analyses;
•  the discount rates and long term growth 
rates applied within the model were 
assessed by an EY business valuation 
specialist, including comparison to 
economic and industry forecasts, 
where appropriate;
•  for certain CGUs with lower headroom, 
we performed sensitivity analyses by stress 
testing key assumptions in the model with 
downside scenarios to understand the 
parameters that, should they arise, could 
lead to a different conclusion in respect of 
the carrying value of goodwill; and
•  we considered the appropriateness of the 
related disclosures provided in note 10 of 
the Group financial statements. 
The entire goodwill balance was subject to 
full scope audit procedures by the primary 
audit team.
Based on the results of our work, 
we agree with management’s 
conclusion that an impairment of 
goodwill at a CGU level is required 
in the current year, amounting 
to £8.4m, disclosed within 
discontinued operations. 
We confirmed that the disclosures 
within note 10 were in accordance 
with the requirements of IAS 36, 
Impairment of Assets.
In the prior year the risks of material misstatement were identified as Carrying Value of Inventory and Carrying Value of Goodwill.
Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Strategic report
101 An overview of the scope of 
our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our 
evaluation of materiality and our 
allocation of performance materiality 
determine our audit scope for each 
entity within the Group. Taken together, 
this enables us to form an opinion on 
the consolidated financial statements. 
We take into account size, risk profile, 
the organisation of the group and 
effectiveness of group-wide controls, 
changes in the business environment 
and other factors such as recent 
Internal audit results when assessing 
the level of work to be performed at 
each entity.
In assessing the risk of material 
misstatement to the Group financial 
statements, and to ensure we had 
adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial 
statements, of the 47 reporting 
components of the Group, we selected 
13 components covering entities within 
China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, 
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, 
South Korea, UK and USA, which 
represent the principal business units 
within the Group.
Of the 13 components selected, we 
performed an audit of the complete 
financial information of seven 
components (“full scope components”) 
which were selected based on their 
size or risk characteristics. For the 
remaining six components (“specific 
scope components”), we performed 
audit procedures on specific accounts 
within that component that we 
considered had the potential for the 
greatest impact on the significant 
accounts in the financial statements 
either because of the size of these 
accounts or their risk profile. 
For the remaining components, 
audit procedures were undertaken 
to respond to any potential risks of 
material misstatement to the Group 
financial statements.
The reporting components where 
we performed audit procedures 
accounted for 94% (2016: 83%) of 
the Group’s Profit before tax, 92% 
(2016: 90%) of the Group’s Revenue 
and 90% (2016: 78%) of the Group’s 
Total Assets. 
For the current year, the seven full 
scope components contributed 
93% (2016: 83%) of the Group’s 
Profit before tax. The full scope 
Profit before tax coverage of 93% 
represents six full scope components 
having a positive contribution of 98% 
offset by one full scope component 
having a negative contribution of 5%. 
The full scope entities contributed 87% 
(2016: 83%) of the Group’s Revenue 
and 81% (2016: 78%) of the Group’s 
Total Assets. 
The specific scope components 
contributed 1% (2016: 0%) of 
the Group’s Profit before tax, 5% 
(2016:0%) of the Group’s Revenue 
and 9% (2016: 0%) of the Group’s 
Total Assets. The audit scope of these 
components may not have included 
testing of all significant accounts of the 
component but will have contributed to 
the coverage of accounts significant to 
the consolidated Group. 
Of the remaining 34 components that 
together represent 6% of the Group’s 
Profit before tax, none are individually 
greater than 5% of the Group’s Profit 
before tax. For these components, we 
performed other procedures, including 
analytical review to respond to any 
potential risks of material misstatement 
to the Group financial statements.
The following charts illustrate the 
coverage obtained from the work 
performed by our audit.
Changes from the prior year 
We have increased the scope of 
components in China, India, Italy, 
Mexico, South Korea and Spain to 
specific scope. 
Involvement with component 
teams 
In establishing our overall approach 
to the Group audit, we determined 
the type of work that needed to be 
undertaken at each of the components 
by us, as the primary audit engagement 
team, (primary audit team), or by 
component auditors from other EY 
global network firms operating under 
our instruction. Of the seven full scope 
components, all audit procedures were 
performed on two of these directly 
by the primary audit team, and of the 
six specific scope components, all 
audit procedures were performed on 
four of these directly by the primary 
audit team. The primary audit team 
performed all the audit procedures 
on two full scope components, one 
located in the UK and one located

Independent auditor’s report  
to the members of Renishaw plc 
continued
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 102 in the USA, and four specific scope 
components located in Italy, Spain, 
Mexico and China respectively. For the 
remaining five full scope components 
and two specific scope components, 
where the work was performed by 
component auditors, we determined 
the appropriate level of involvement to 
enable us to determine that sufficient 
audit evidence had been obtained as a 
basis for our opinion on the Group as 
a whole.
At the start of the audit a meeting was 
held with representatives from all full 
scope component teams. In addition, 
during the current year’s audit cycle, 
visits were undertaken by the Senior 
Statutory Auditor, or his designate, to 
the component teams in Germany, 
India, Ireland and the USA. These visits 
involved discussing the audit approach 
with the component team, discussing 
key risk areas, meeting with local 
management, and attending planning 
meetings. The primary audit team 
interacted regularly with the component 
teams during all stages of the audit, 
reviewed key working papers, 
attended all closing meetings via 
video conferencing facilities and were 
responsible for the scope and direction 
of the audit process. This, together with 
the additional procedures performed 
at Group level, gave us appropriate 
evidence for our opinion on the Group 
financial statements.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality 
in planning and performing the audit, 
in evaluating the effect of identified 
misstatements on the audit and in 
forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or 
misstatement that, individually or in 
the aggregate, could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial 
statements. Materiality provides a basis 
for determining the nature and extent 
of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for 
the Group to be £4.7 million 
(2016: £4 million), which is 4.6% 
(2016: 5 %) of Group Profit before 
tax for continuing and discontinued 
operations. We believe that Group 
Profit before tax for continuing and 
discontinued operations provides us 
with a consistent year-on-year basis 
for determining materiality and is a 
generally accepted auditing benchmark 
for listed entities. 
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the 
individual account or balance level. 
It is set at an amount to reduce to an 
appropriately low level the probability 
that the aggregate of uncorrected 
and undetected misstatements 
exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, 
together with our assessment of the 
Group’s overall control environment, 
our judgement was that performance 
materiality was 75% (2016: 75%) of 
our planning materiality, namely £3.5m 
(2016: £3m). We have set performance 
materiality at this percentage due to 
the past history of few misstatements 
indicating a lower risk of misstatement 
in the financial statements.
Audit work at component locations 
for the purpose of obtaining 
audit coverage over significant 
financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage 
of total performance materiality. 
The performance materiality set 
for each component is based on 
the relative scale and risk of the 
component to the Group as a whole 
and our assessment of the risk of 
misstatement at that component. In the 
current year, the range of performance 
materiality allocated to components 
was £0.5m to £2.3m (2016: £2m). 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified 
misstatements are considered as being 
clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee 
that we would report to them all 
uncorrected audit differences in excess 
of £0.235m (2016: £0.2m), which is set 
at 5% of planning materiality, as well as 
differences below that threshold that, 
in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected 
misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality 
discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in 
forming our opinion.
Other information
The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual 
report set out on pages 1 to 96, 
including the Strategic Report, set out 
on pages 1 to 65, Governance, set out 
on pages 66 to 96, and Shareholder 
information, set out on pages 148 to 
150, other than the financial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon. 
The directors are responsible for the 
other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information 
and, accordingly, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the 
financial statements, our responsibility 
is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify such material 
inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a 
material misstatement in the financial 
statements or a material misstatement 
of the other information. If, based 
on the work we have performed, 
we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of the other information, 
we are required to report that 
fact. We have nothing to report in 
this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to 
report in regard to our responsibility to 
specifically address the following items 
in the other information and to report 
as uncorrected material misstatements 
of the other information where we 
conclude that those items meet the 
following conditions:
•  Fair, balanced and 
understandable set out on 
page 75 – the statement given by 
the directors that they consider 
the Annual report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the 
group’s performance, business 
model and strategy, is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or 
Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Strategic report
103 •  Audit Committee reporting 
set out on pages 79 to 82 – the 
section describing the work of 
the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the audit 
committee; or
•  Directors’ statement of 
compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code

UK Corporate Governance Code 
containing provisions specified for 
review by the auditor in accordance 
with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do 
not properly disclose a departure 
from a relevant provision of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
Opinions on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work 
undertaken in the course of the audit:
•  the information given in the 
Strategic report and the Directors’ 
report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements; and 
•  the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ report have been 
prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are 
required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and the 
parent company and its environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified material 
misstatements in the Strategic report or 
the Directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect 
of the following matters in relation 
to which the Companies Act 2006 
requires us to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records 
have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for 
our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
•  the parent company financial 
statements and the part of the 
Directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; 
or
•  certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
•  we have not received all the 
information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
responsibilities statement set out on 
page 97, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view, and for 
such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, 
the directors are responsible for 
assessing the Group and Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting 
unless management either intends to 
liquidate the Group or the Company or 
to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities 
for the audit of the 
financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed. 
Explanation of the extent 
to which our audit can 
detect fraud
The objectives of our audit, in respect 
to fraud, are: to identify and assess 
the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements due to fraud; 
to obtain sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence regarding the assessed 
risks of material misstatement due 
to fraud, through designing and 
implementing appropriate responses; 
and to respond appropriately to fraud 
or suspected fraud identified during 
the audit. However, the primary 
responsibility for the prevention and 
detection of fraud rests with both those 
charged with governance of the entity 
and management. 
Independent auditor’s report  
to the members of Renishaw plc 
continued
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 104 Our approach was as follows: 
•  We obtained an understanding 
of the legal and regulatory 
frameworks that are applicable to 
the Group and determined that 
the most significant frameworks 
which are directly relevant to 
specific assertions in the financial 
statements are those that relate to 
the reporting framework (IFRS, FRS 
101 and the Companies Act 2006 
and UK Corporate Governance 
Code) and the relevant tax 
compliance regulations in the UK 
and overseas jurisdictions in which 
the Group operates as referred to in 
the ‘Tailoring the Scope’ paragraph 
above. In addition, we concluded 
that there are certain significant 
laws and regulations which may 
have an effect on the determination 
of the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements being 
the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority, the Bribery Act 2010, 
Occupational Health and Safety 
Regulations, the Data Protection 
Act 1998, and export controls.
•  We understood how the Group 
complies with these legal and 
regulatory frameworks through 
our assessment of the Group’s 
approach to governance, 
demonstrated by the Board’s 
approval of the Group’s governance 
framework and the Board’s review 
of the Group’s risk management 
and internal control processes. 
As a result of the Board’s review 
of the Group’s risk management 
and internal control framework 
an executive risk committee was 
established which in turn formed 
working groups to focus on anti-
bribery, information and cyber 
security, and data protection. 
The Group’s anti-corruption 
culture is embedded in Renishaw’s 
Group Business Code and Anti-
Bribery Policy. 
•  We assessed the susceptibility of 
the Group’s financial statements 
to material misstatement, 
including how fraud might occur 
by: considering the programs 
and controls that the Group has 
established to address risks 
identified by the entity, or that 
otherwise prevent, deter and detect 
fraud; how senior management 
monitor those programs and 
controls, and evaluating conditions 
in the context of incentive/pressure 
to commit fraud, considering the 
opportunity to commit fraud and 
the potential rationalisation of the 
fraudulent act.
•  Based on this understanding we 
designed our audit procedures to 
identify non-compliance with such 
laws and regulations identified in the 
paragraphs above. Our procedures 
involved: journal entry testing, with 
a focus on manual consolidation 
journals and journals indicating 
large or unusual transactions 
based on our understanding of the 
business; inquiries of legal counsel, 
executive management, internal 
audit, divisional heads and all full 
and specific component finance 
managers; and focused testing, as 
referred to in the Key Audit Matters 
section above.
A further description of our 
responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on 
the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at https://www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required 
to address
•  Following the recommendation 
of the Audit Committee, we were 
appointed as auditors by the Board 
of Directors of Renishaw plc and 
signed an engagement letter on 
11th November 2016. We were 
appointed by the Company at the 
AGM on 13th October 2016 to 
audit the financial statements for 
the year ending 30th June 2017 
and subsequent financial periods. 
The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement including previous 
renewals and reappointments is 
one year, covering the year ending 
30th June 2017.
•  The non-audit services prohibited 
by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Group 
or the Company and we remain 
independent of the Group and the 
Company in conducting the audit. 
•  The audit opinion is consistent 
with the additional report to the 
Audit Committee.

Notes:
1.  The maintenance and integrity of 
the Renishaw plc website is the 
responsibility of the directors; the 
work carried out by the auditors 
does not involve consideration of 
these matters and, accordingly, the 
auditors accept no responsibility 
for any changes that may have 
occurred to the financial statements 
since they were initially presented 
on the website.
2.  Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Notes (forming part of the financial statements)
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
Renishaw plc (the Company) is a company incorporated in the UK. The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company 
and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and equity account the Group’ s interest in associates and joint ventures. 
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group. 
The group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (adopted IFRS). The parent company financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”. The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in Sterling, which is the Company’ s functional currency and the Group’ s presentational currency, and all values are rounded 
to the nearest thousand (£’000).
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these group 
financial statements. Judgements made by the directors, in the application of these accounting policies, that have a significant effect 
on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are noted below.
The Group identified a number of prior period adjustments during the year, resulting in a restatement of the comparative period in the 
2017 financial statements, as detailed in note 25. A third balance sheet has not been presented as the movements are identified in 
the Consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
Renishaw GmbH, Pliezhausen, Germany has chosen to exercise the right under section 264 – sub-section 3 of the German 
Commercial Code (HGB) on exemption and preparation. The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial 
statements of Renishaw GmbH, Pliezhausen, Germany.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, subject to fair value items referred to in the 
derivative financial instruments note below. The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied in preparing both 
the 2016 and 2017 financial statements.
Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainties
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under 
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are 
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The areas of key estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgement that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment 
to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are listed below:
Critical accounting judgements
(i) Capitalisation of development costs
Product development costs are capitalised once a project has reached a certain stage of development and these costs are 
subsequently amortised over a five-year period. Judgements are required to assess whether the new product development has 
reached the appropriate point for capitalisation of costs to begin. Should a product be subsequently obsoleted, the accumulated 
capitalised development costs would need to be immediately written off in the Consolidated income statement.
(ii) Discontinued activities
The closure of certain lines of business have been treated as discontinued operations on the basis that the directors are of the opinion 
that the underlying performance of the business is better reflected by classifying these items as discontinued.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
(i) Inventory
Determining the value of inventory requires judgement, especially in respect of provisioning for slow moving and potentially obsolete 
inventory. Management consider historic and future forecast sales patterns of individual stock items when calculating inventory 
provisions. For most inventory lines, provisions are based on the excess levels held compared to a maximum three year outlook. 
Where strategic purchases of critical components have been made, an outlook beyond three years is considered where appropriate. 
The sensitivities around estimates vary significantly from line to line. Financial statements

1. Accounting policies (continued)
Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainties (continued)
(ii) Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities
Determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation requires judgement in respect of the assumptions used to calculate 
present values. These include future mortality, discount rate, inflation and salary increases. Management makes these judgements in 
consultation with an independent actuary. Details of the estimates and judgements in respect of the current year are given in note 14.
(iii) Amortisation of intangibles and impairment
The periods of amortisation of intangible assets require judgements to be made on the estimated useful lives of the intangible 
assets to determine an appropriate rate of amortisation. Future assessments of impairment may lead to the writing off of certain 
amounts of intangible assets and the consequent charge in the Consolidated income statement for the accelerated amortisation. 
Capitalised development costs are written off over five years, the period over which demand forecasts can be predicted with 
more certainty.
(iv) Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash-generating units (CGUs) to which goodwill 
has been allocated. The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGUs and also the selection of 
appropriate discount rates, which involves judgement, to calculate present values (see note 10).
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries – Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed or has rights to 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are exercisable. The acquisition date is the date 
on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling 
interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a 
deficit balance.
Application of the equity method to associates and joint ventures – Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity 
method (equity accounted investees) and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’ s investment includes goodwill identified on 
acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’ s share of the total 
comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence commences 
until the date that significant influence ceases. When the Group’ s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, 
the Group’ s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has 
incurred legal obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation – Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses 
arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are 
eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’ s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same 
way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
New, revised or changes to existing accounting standards
The following accounting standards have been issued but are not yet effective and have not been applied by the Group:
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers – This is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018. 
The new standard requires the separation of performance obligations within contracts with customers and the contractual value 
to be allocated to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is then recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied. 
The introduction of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the results of the Group due to the relatively 
straightforward contractual terms and conditions with customers.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments – This is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018. The introduction of this 
standard is not expected to have a material impact on the net assets or results of the Group, but may result in additional disclosures.
IFRS 16 Leases – This has a mandatory effective date of 1st January 2019. The new standard will eliminate the classification of 
leases as either operating or finance leases and result in operating leases being treated as finance leases. This will result in previously 
recognised operating leases being treated as property, plant and equipment along with a finance leases creditor. The introduction 
of this standard will increase the value of property, plant and equipment and the finance lease liability on the balance sheet but it is 
unlikely to have a material effect on the profit in any year.

1. Accounting policies (continued)
Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Consolidated income statement when the significant risks and rewards 
of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is normally the time of despatch. Where certain products require installation, 
part of the revenue may be deferred until the installation is complete. No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties 
regarding recovery of the consideration due, or the possible return of goods. Revenue from the sale of services is recognised over 
the period to which the service relates. Where goods and services are sold as a bundle, the fair value of services is deferred and 
recognised over the period to which the service relates with the remaining revenue recognised on despatch.
Foreign currencies
Consolidation - Foreign subsidiaries’ results are translated into Sterling at weighted average exchange rates for the year, which is 
effected by translating each foreign subsidiary’ s monthly results at exchange rates applicable to each of the respective months. 
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into Sterling at the foreign exchange 
rates ruling at that date. Differences on exchange resulting from the translation of overseas assets and liabilities are recognised in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Transactions and balances - Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reported at the rates prevailing 
at the time, with any gain or loss arising from subsequent exchange rate movements being included as an exchange gain or loss 
in the Consolidated income statement. Foreign currency differences arising from transactions are recognised in the Consolidated 
income statement. 
Hedging of net investments in foreign operations - Gains and losses arising on currency borrowings used to hedge the foreign 
currency exposure on the net assets of the foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensive income and expense and 
accumulated in equity, to the extent that hedge accounting criteria are met and are included in the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and expense. Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated income statement. 
The effectiveness of the hedging is tested monthly.
Foreign currency derivative cash flow hedges
Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency rates relating to overseas sales. 
The Group does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes. Foreign currency derivatives are stated at their fair value being 
the estimated amount that the Group would pay or receive to terminate them at the balance sheet date based on prevailing foreign 
currency rates.
Changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives which are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and in the currency hedging reserve, and subsequently transferred to the carrying amount 
of the hedged item or the Consolidated income statement. Realised gains or losses on cash flow hedges are therefore recognised in 
the Consolidated income statement in the same period as the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any 
cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument previously recognised in equity is retained in equity until the hedged transaction 
occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is then 
transferred to the Consolidated income statement.
Changes in fair value of foreign currency derivatives which are ineffective or do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting in IAS 39 
‘Financial instruments: recognition and measurement’ are recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. 
Deferred consideration relating to acquisitions is subject to discounting to the date of acquisition and subsequently unwound to the 
date of the final payment. Goodwill arising on acquisition represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair 
value of the net identifiable assets acquired, net of deferred tax. Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or 
which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control 
is transferred to the Group.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. It is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or earlier 
if there are any indications of impairment. The annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated 
recoverable amount and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is lower. Impairment losses are recognised through 
the Consolidated income statement.
Intangible assets such as customer lists, patents, trade marks, know-how and intellectual property that are acquired by the Group are 
stated at cost less amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to the Consolidated income statement on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets included in the 
Consolidated balance sheet reflect the benefit derived by the Group and vary from five to ten years. Financial statements
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 114
1. Accounting policies (continued) 
Intangible assets – research and development costs
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an expense as incurred. Expenditure on 
development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group intends and has 
the technical ability and sufficient resources to complete development, future economic benefits are probable and the Group can 
measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes. The  
expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Other development 
expenditure is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over five years and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less 
accumulated impairment losses. Capitalised development expenditure is removed from the balance sheet ten years after being 
fully amortised. 
Intangible assets – software licences
Intangible assets, comprising software licences that are acquired by the Group, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. The useful life of each 
of these assets is assessed on an individual basis and they range from 2 to 10 years. 
Property, plant and equipment
Freehold land is not depreciated. Other assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided to write off 
the cost of assets less their estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years, Plant and equipment 3 to 25 years, Vehicles 3 to 4 years.
Impairment on non-current assets
All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that their carrying value may be impaired. 
An impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated income statement to the extent that an asset’ s carrying value exceeds its 
recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the asset’ s net realisable value and its value in use. An asset’ s value in use 
represents the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or from the cash-generating unit to which 
it relates. The present value is calculated using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset concerned.
Goodwill and capitalised research and development costs are subject to an annual impairment test.
Inventory and work in progress
Inventory and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In respect of work in progress and finished 
goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses that are required to bring 
inventories to their present location and condition. Overheads are absorbed into inventories on the basis of normal capacity or on 
actual hours if higher.
Warranty provisions
The Group provides a warranty from the date of purchase, except for those products that are installed by the Group where the 
warranty starts from the date of completion of the installation. This is typically for a 12-month period, although up to three years is 
given for a small number of products. A warranty provision is included in the financial statements, which is calculated on the basis of 
historical returns and internal quality reports.
Discontinued activities
Where a line of the Group’ s business is treated as a discontinued operation, the financial statements have been re-presented and 
restated where required as if operations discontinued during the current year had been discontinued from the start of the comparative 
year. Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as a profit 
or loss after tax from discontinued operations in the Consolidated income statement.
Alternative performance measures
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with adopted IFRS and applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. In measuring our performance, the financial measures that we use include those which have been derived from 
our reported results in order to eliminate factors which distort year-on-year comparisons. 
These are considered non-GAAP financial measures. We believe this information, along with comparable GAAP measurements, is 
useful to investors in providing a basis for measuring our operational performance. Our management uses these financial measures, 
along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our performance (see note 24).

1. Accounting policies (continued) 
Employee benefits
The Group operates contributory pension schemes, largely for UK, Ireland and USA employees, which were of the defined benefit 
type up to 5th April 2007, 31st December 2007 and 30th June 2012 respectively, at which time they ceased any future accrual for 
existing members and were closed to new members. 
The schemes are administered by trustees who are independent of the group finances. Pension scheme assets of the defined benefit 
schemes are measured using market value. Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted 
at the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability. Remeasurements arising 
from defined benefit schemes comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on scheme assets (excluding interest) and the effect of 
the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest). The Company recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other 
expenses related to defined benefit schemes are included in the Consolidated income statement.
The pension schemes’ surpluses, to the extent that they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full and presented 
on the face of the Consolidated balance sheet under employee benefits. Where a guarantee is in place in relation to a pension 
scheme deficit, liabilities are reported in accordance with IFRIC 14. Foreign-based employees are covered by state, defined benefit 
and private pension schemes in their countries of residence. Actuarial valuations of foreign pension schemes were not obtained, apart 
from Ireland and USA, because of the limited number of foreign employees. For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to 
the Consolidated income statement represents the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
Accruals are made for holiday pay, based on a calculation of the number of days holiday earned during the year, but not yet taken.
Going concern
The Group’ s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set 
out in the Strategic report, where also given are details of the financial and liquidity positions. In addition, note 20 in the financial 
statements includes the Group’ s objectives and policies for managing its capital, details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group has considerable financial resources at its disposal and the 
directors have considered the current financial projections. As a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual report and accounts.
Taxation
T ax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. T ax is recognised in the Consolidated income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and expense. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income 
for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in 
previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition 
of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business 
combination and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised 
only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Government grants
Government grants, comprising R&D tax credits are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as a deduction 
against expenditure.
Pension scheme cash escrow account
The Company holds a pension scheme escrow account as part of the security given for the UK defined benefit pension scheme. 
This account is shown within current assets in the Consolidated balance sheet as it may be used to settle pension scheme liabilities 
immediately upon enforcement of the charge over the account.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term (with an original maturity of less than three months) deposits. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated statement 
of cash flow. Financial statements

2. Segmental analysis
Renishaw manages its operations in two segments, comprising metrology and healthcare products. The results of these segments 
are regularly reviewed by the Board to allocate resources to segments and to assess their performance. The Group evaluates 
performance of the segments on the basis of profit before interest, tax and discontinued operations. Within the operating segment 
of metrology, there are multiple product offerings with similar economic characteristics, and where the nature of the products and 
production processes and their customer base are similar. More details of the Group’ s products and services are given in the

Phased reductions in the UK rate of corporation tax to 19% from 1st April 2017 and 17% from 1st April 2020 have been substantively 
enacted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated based on the rate expected to be applicable when the relevant 
item reverses.

7. Income tax expense (continued) 
The tax for the year is lower (2016: lower) than the weighted average of the UK standard rate of corporation tax of 19.75% (2016: 20%).

Other differences (107) 359
T ax charge on profit 13,132 8,988
Effective tax rate 12.9% 15.9%
The current year patent box benefit of £4.0m is significantly higher than the prior year as a result of favourable exchange rate 
movements. Prior year adjustments totalling a credit of £3.0m arose primarily from the correction of a deferred tax liability held in 
respect of the currency translation reserve. 
The Group’ s future effective tax rate (ETR) will mainly depend on the geographic mix of profits and whether there are any changes 
to tax legislation in the Group’ s most significant countries of operations. Phased reductions in the UK rate of corporation tax to 
19% (from 1st April 2017) and 17% (from 1st April 2020) have been substantively enacted which is expected to impact the ETR in 
due course. T ax rate reductions are being considered in a number of countries where the Group operates. The patent box benefit 
has a significant impact on the ETR and is unpredictable due to factors such as currency rate movements and the level of capital 
allowances claimed in any given year. The Group does not expect the future tax rate to be materially impacted by the changes 
to the international tax landscape resulting from the package of measures developed under the OECD base erosion and profit 
shifting project. 
8. Discontinued operations
In October 2016, the Group decided to discontinue operations at Renishaw Diagnostics Limited (healthcare segment) and in June 
2017, to discontinue the spatial measurements business (metrology segment), on the basis of continued losses. Certain assets of the 
business were sold. Financial information relating to the discontinued operations is set out below:

Goodwill acquired has arisen on the acquisition of a number of businesses and has an indeterminable useful life. Therefore it is not 
amortised but is tested for impairment annually and at any point during the year when an indicator of impairment exists. Goodwill is 
allocated to the CGUs, which are mainly the statutory entities acquired. This is the lowest level in the Group at which goodwill is 
monitored for impairment and is at a lower level than the Group’ s operating segments. In the following table, only the goodwill relating 
to the acquisition of R&R Fixtures, LLC is expected to be subject to tax relief. Financial statements

T otal acquired goodwill 13,258 21,268
The recoverable amounts of acquired goodwill are based on value in use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections 
based on either the financial business plans approved by management for next five financial years, or estimated growth rates over 
the five years, which are set out below. The cash flows beyond this forecast are extrapolated to perpetuity using a nil growth rate on a 
prudent basis, to reflect the uncertainties over forecasting further than five years.
Key assumptions
The key assumptions utilised in the value in use calculations are:
Discount rate
The following pre-tax discount rates have been used in discounting the projected cash flows:
2017
Discount rate
2016
Discount rate
itp GmbH 12% 12%
Renishaw Software Limited 12% 12%

Renishaw Software Limited 5% growth rate 5% growth rate
R&R Fixtures, LLC 5 year business plan 5 year business plan
Renishaw Mayfield S.A. 5 year business plan 5 year business plan
These forecast cash flows are considered prudent estimates based on management’ s view of the future and experience of past 
performance of the individual CGUs and are calculated at a disaggregated level. The key judgement within these business plans is the 
forecasting of revenue growth, given that the cost bases of the businesses can be flexed in line with revenue performance. 
The average growth rates included in the significant CGUs’ business plans are as follows:
2017
Average revenue 
growth
2016
Average revenue 
growth
R&R Fixtures, LLC 14% 13%
These business plans are recognised as key inputs to the impairment calculation. They are monitored by management regularly and 
updated for expected variances in future performance. 
Sensitivity to key assumptions
Management have performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions detailed above.
Notes continued Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Strategic report
123
10. Intangible assets (continued)
Discount rate
An increase of 5% in the discount rate would not result in an impairment on any of the CGUs. Management believe any increase in 
discount rates above 5% to be remote.
Forecast cash flows and future growth rates
Given the average revenue growth assumptions included in the five-year business plans, management’ s sensitivity analysis involves 
a reduction of 10% in the forecast cash flows utilised in those business plans and therefore into perpetuity. For there to be an 
impairment there would need to be a reduction of 44% for R&R Fixtures, LLC. Management deem the likelihood of this reduction to 
be remote.

14. Employee benefits
The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world. As noted in the accounting policies, actuarial valuations of 
foreign pension schemes are not obtained for the most part because of the limited number of foreign employees. The major scheme, 
which covers the UK-based employees, was of the defined benefit type. This scheme, along with the Ireland and USA defined benefit 
schemes, has ceased any future accrual for current members and these schemes are closed to new members. UK, Ireland and USA 
employees are now covered by defined contribution schemes.
The total pension cost of the Group for the year was £20,238,000 (2016: £18,061,000), of which £165,000 (2016: £184,000) related 
to directors and £6,292,000 (2016: £4,854,000) related to overseas schemes. 
The latest full actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme was carried out as at September 2015 and updated to 30th 
June 2017 by a qualified independent actuary. The mortality assumption used for 2017 is S2PMA and S2PFA tables, CMI (core) 
2016 model with long-term improvements of 1% per annum.

Note C.36 gives the analysis of the UK defined benefit pension scheme. For the other schemes, the market value of assets at the end 
of the year was £20,386,000 (2016: £17,646,000) and the actuarial value of liabilities was £24,312,000 (2016: £23,348,000).
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is around 24 years.
For a sensitivity analysis of certain elements of the UK defined benefit pension scheme, see the Financial review section of 
the Strategic report. It is expected that contributions to defined benefit schemes for the next financial year will be at a similar level to 
the current year.

An agreement has been entered into with the trustees of the UK defined benefit pension scheme in relation to deficit funding plans 
which supersede all previous arrangements. The Company has agreed to pay all monthly pensions payments and lump sum 
payments, and transfer payments up to a limit of £1,000,000 in each year (Benefits in Payment).
A number of UK properties owned by the Company are subject to fixed charges. One or more of the properties may be released from 
the fixed charge if on a subsequent valuation, the value of all properties under charge exceed 120% of the deficit. 
The Company has also established an escrow bank account, which is subject to a floating charge. The balance of this account was 
£12,850,000 at the end of the year (2016: £15,279,000). The funds will be released back to the Company from the escrow account 
over a period of 6 years.
The agreement continues until 30th June 2031, but may end sooner if the deficit (calculated on a self sufficiency basis as defined in 
the agreement) is eliminated in the meantime. At 30th June 2031 the Company is obliged to pay any deficit at that time. All properties 
will be released from charge when the deficit no longer exists. The charges may be enforced by the trustees if one of the following 
occurs: (a) the Company does not pay any Benefits in Payment; (b) an insolvency event occurs in relation to the Company; or (c) the 
Company does not pay any deficit at 30th June 2031.
Under the Ireland defined benefit pension scheme deficit funding plan, a property owned by Renishaw (Ireland) Limited is subject to a 
registered fixed charge to secure the Ireland defined benefit pension scheme’ s deficit.
No scheme assets are invested in the Group’ s own equity.
The present value of projected future contributions under the new agreement relating to the UK defined benefit scheme exceeds the 
value of the deficit at the year-end, therefore, under IFRIC 14, the UK defined benefit pension scheme’ s liabilities have been increased 
by £16,200,000, to represent the maximum discounted liability as at 30th June 2017 (2016: £15,400,000).

20. Financial instruments
The Group has exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk arising from its use of financial instruments. This note presents 
information about the Group’ s exposure to these risks, along with the Group’ s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and 
managing the risks.
Fair value
There is no significant difference between the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and their carrying value in the 
Consolidated balance sheet. All financial assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost, apart from the forward exchange contracts, 
which are held at fair value, with changes going through the Consolidated income statement unless subject to hedge accounting.
The fair values of the forward exchange contracts have been calculated by a third party expert, discounting estimated future 
cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future exchange rates, representing level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy. 
The IFRS 13 level categorisation relates to the extent the fair value can be determined by reference to comparable market values. 
The classifications range from level 1 where instruments are quoted on an active market through to level 3 where the assumptions 
used to arrive at fair value do not have comparable market data. 
Credit risk
The Group’ s liquid funds are substantially held with banks with high credit ratings and the credit risk relating to these funds is therefore 
limited. The Group carries a credit risk relating to non-payment of trade receivables by its customers. Credit evaluations are carried out 
on all new customers before credit is given above certain thresholds. There is a spread of risks among a large number of customers 
with no significant concentration with one customer or in any one geographical area. The Group establishes an allowance for 
impairment in respect of trade receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
An analysis by currency of the Group’ s financial assets at the year end is as follows:

The above trade receivables, other receivables and cash are predominately held in the functional currency of the relevant entity, with 
the exception of £5,324,000 of Euro-denominated trade receivables being held in the Company, along with some foreign currency 
cash balances which are of a short-term nature. Also, see note below on net assets and associated borrowings, regarding the holding 
of foreign currency borrowings by the Company in respect of its hedging activity.

The maximum exposure to credit risk is £221,286,000, comprising the Group’ s trade and other receivables, cash and cash 
equivalents and derivative assets.
Liquidity risk
The Group’ s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when due, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’ s reputation. The Group uses monthly cash 
flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements.
In respect of net cash, the carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the deposits and borrowings. 
Interest rates are floating and based on libor/libid, which can change over time, affecting the Group’ s interest income. An increase of 
1% in interest rates would result in an increase in interest income of approximately £400,000.
The market value of forward exchange contracts is determined by reference to market data.

Market risk
As noted in the Strategic report under Principal risks and uncertainties, the Group operates in a number of foreign currencies with the 
majority of sales being made in these currencies, but with most manufacturing being undertaken in the UK, Ireland and India.
Exchange rates and sensitivity analysis
The Group has hedged a significant proportion of its forecasted US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen revenues and hence the impact on 
the Group’ s results resulting from fluctuations in these exchange rates against Sterling is lessened.

Average Euro forward contract rates 1.16 1.23
Average Japanese Yen forward contract rates 151 125
The Company has US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Euro forward contracts which mature after the balance sheet date. The fair value of 
these contracts at the year end resulted in a loss carried forward of £43,040,000 (2016: loss £56,460,000). 
The nominal amounts of foreign currencies relating to these forward contracts are, in Sterling terms:
2017

£’000
US Dollar 394,858 354,416
Euro 136,903 132,013
Japanese Yen 89,782 81,581
The Group classifies these forward contracts as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. The forward contracts cover monthly 
revenues over the next three and a half years. Further details are noted in the treasury policies in the Financial review section of the 
Strategic report.
For the Group’ s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, if Sterling appreciated by 5% 
against the US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen, this would increase profit before taxation and other equity by the following amounts:

Net assets and associated borrowings
The Group maintains foreign currency borrowings as a method of providing hedging against the currency translation risk of the 
net assets of its overseas subsidiaries. The level of hedging in place at the year end for the major currencies and their relative base 
borrowing interest rates, were:
Currency

US Dollar 74,532 49,975 0%
Euro 59,323 42,880 0%
Japanese Yen 24,042 19,998 1.25%
The currency borrowings are short-term, with floating interest rates. For the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries not hedged, a 5% 
change in exchange rates will affect reserves by approximately £6,100,000.
Capital management
The Group defines capital as being the equity attributable to the owners of the Company, which is captioned on the Consolidated 
balance sheet. The Board’ s policy is to maintain a strong capital base and to maintain a balance between significant returns to 
shareholders, with a progressive dividend policy, whilst ensuring the security of the Group supported by a sound capital position. 
The Group may adjust dividend payments due to changes in economic and market conditions which affect, or are anticipated to 
affect, group results. Financial statements

24. Alternative performance measures 
Alternative performance measures are - Revenue at constant exchange rates, Adjusted profit before tax, Adjusted earnings per share 
and Adjusted operating profit. 
Revenue at constant exchange rates is defined as revenue recalculated using the same rates as were applicable to the previous year 
and excluding forward contract gains and losses. 
Revenue at constant exchange rates

Adjusted profit before tax, Adjusted earnings per share and Adjusted operating profit - These measures are defined as the profit 
before tax, earnings per share and operating profit after excluding gains and losses in fair value from the forward currency contracts 
which did not qualify for hedge accounting.
The losses from fair value of financial instruments not effective for cash flow hedging have been excluded from statutory profit before 
tax, statutory earnings per share and statutory operating profit in arriving at adjusted profit before tax, adjusted earnings per share and 
adjusted operating profit to reflect the Board’ s intent that the instruments would provide effective hedges.
The Board consider these alternative performance measures to be more relevant and reliable in evaluating the Group’ s performance.

25. Restatement of previous year
The previous year’ s results have been restated for the following:
Certain foreign currency forward contracts used as hedging instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting as they did not 
meet the hedge effectiveness criteria set out in the International Accounting Standard IAS39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement. T o ensure technical compliance with this standard it has been deemed necessary to restate the 2016 
financial statements resulting in a £25.8m reduction to the profit before tax for that year and a corresponding increase in other 
comprehensive income.
In October 2016, the Board decided to discontinue operations at Renishaw Diagnostics Limited (RDL), resulting in the closure of the 
business. The RDL business has been accounted for as a discontinued activity, with comparative figures for the previous year being 
restated accordingly. In June 2017, after an extensive review of the spatial measurements business, the Board decided to discontinue 
this line of business. This business has also been accounted for as a discontinued activity, with comparative figures for the previous 
year being restated accordingly. 
The R&D tax credit, previously accounted for within the Income tax expense line has been reclassified to be part of cost of sales, 
thereby showing it as part of the profit before tax. Financial statements

C.26. Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
financial statements of the Company. 
Basis of preparation
The financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 
101). In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (adopted IFRS), but makes amendments where necessary in order 
to comply with the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
– A cash flow statement and related notes.
– Comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets and intangible fixed assets.
– Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries.
– Disclosures in respect of capital management.
– The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.
– Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the 
exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ and the 
disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments disclosures’.
The Company identified a number of prior year adjustments during the year, resulting in a restatement of the comparative year in the 
2017 financial statements, as detailed in note C.40. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments. 
Historical cost is based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies are 
set out below.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and 
loss account.
Investments 
Investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for permanent impairment losses. 
Property, plant and equipment, and depreciation
Property, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost 
of assets less their estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years 
Plant and equipment – 3 to 25 years 
Motor vehicles – 3 to 4 years 
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and labour plus overheads 
applicable to the stage of manufacture reached.
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. Expenditure on development 
activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Company intends and has the 
technical ability and sufficient resources to complete development, future economic benefits are probable and the Company can 
measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
Notes to the Company financial statements Financial statements
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 138
C.26. Accounting policies (continued)
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the Company’ s profit for the year. Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that they will be recovered.
Employee benefits
The Company operated a contributory pension scheme, of the defined benefit type up to 5th April 2007, after which this scheme was 
closed for future accruals to existing members and was closed to new members. Since 5th April 2007, the Company has operated a 
defined contribution scheme.
The scheme is administered by trustees who are independent of the Company finances. 
Pension scheme assets in the defined benefit scheme are measured using market value. Pension scheme liabilities are measured 
using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term 
and currency to the liability. The expected return on the scheme’ s assets and the interest on the scheme’ s liabilities arising from the 
passage of time are included in other finance income.
The pension scheme’ s surplus, to the extent that it is considered recoverable, or deficit is recognised in full and presented on the face 
of the balance sheet.
Accruals are made for holiday pay, based on a calculation of the number of days’ holiday earned during the year, but not yet taken 
and also for the annual performance bonus.
Warranty on the sale of products
The Company provides a warranty from the date of purchase, except for those products that are installed by the Company where 
the warranty starts from the date of completion of the installation. This is typically for a 12-month period, although up to three years is 
given for a small number of products. A warranty provision is included in the accounts, which is calculated on the basis of historical 
returns and internal quality reports.
Derivative financial instruments 
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
The Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and 
financing activities. Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at cost and then subsequently remeasured at fair value. 
Where a forward contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in future cash inflows, the effective part of any gain or loss on the 
forward contract is recognised directly in equity. Any effective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the 
income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income 
statement immediately.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at 
that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on such translation are recognised in the income statement.
Going concern
The Company’ s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Strategic report, where also given are details of the financial and liquidity positions. In addition, note 20 in the financial 
statements includes the Company’ s objectives and policies for managing its capital, details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Company has considerable financial resources at its disposal and the directors have considered the current financial projections. 
As a consequence, the directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual report and accounts.

C.36. Employee benefits
The Company operated a defined benefit pension scheme, which, in April 2007, ceased any future accrual for current members 
and was closed to new members. Employees of the Company are now covered by a defined contribution scheme. See note 14 
regarding details of charges relating to the UK defined benefit pension scheme liabilities.
The total pension cost of the Company for the year was £13,644,000 (2016: £12,915,000), of which £165,000 (2016: £184,000)

2017 by a qualified independent actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary for the scheme were:
30th June 2017 30th June 2016 30th June 2015
Rate of increase in pension payments 3.3% 3.2% 3.4%

Share fraud
Renishaw has received reports that our 
shareholders have received unsolicited 
calls from overseas firms offering to 
purchase their shares for a price in 
excess of the current market price in 
order to mount a hostile takeover bid. 
Please be aware that this is likely to be 
a scam, with the intention of obtaining 
payment from shareholders of a bond 
or legal fee in order to secure the share 
transaction, which never materialises, 
or obtaining an option to purchase 
shares with no fixed transfer date. 
There are other types of share fraud or 
“boiler room scams” and therefore if 
you receive any unsolicited investment 
advice the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) advises the following:
•  make sure you get the correct name 
of the person and organisation 
and make a record of any other 
information they give;
• check that they are properly 
authorised by the FCA before getting 
involved by visiting www.fca.org.uk/
register and contacting the firm using 
the details on the register;
•  the FCA also maintains a list of 
unauthorised overseas firms who 
are targeting or have targeted UK 
investors and any approach from 
such firms should be reported to the 
FCA so that the information can be 
kept updated;
•  report the matter to the FCA 
on their consumer helpline 
0800 111 6768 or using the share 
fraud reporting form available at 
www.the-fca.org.uk/consumers/
report-scam-unauthorised-firm; and
• you could also contact the police 
via the national fraud reporting 
centre Action Fraud on 0300 123 
2040 or email@actionfraud.org.uk. 
Action Fraud will be particularly 
interested if you sent money to 
a bank account or other type 
of money transfer.
