Annual Report and Accounts 2017 1 At a Glance
Our vision is to become the UK’s 
market-leading, non-standard credit 
company, with our customers at the 
very heart of our business. 
As an established, relationship-driven 
consumer finance provider, we focus 
on responsible lending and fair, helpful 
service to meet the needs of customers 
with complex credit histories throughout 
the UK.
What We Do
Our customers are usually ineligible 
for credit from mainstream lenders. 
By offering small, affordable loans of 
up to £1,000, either in cash or on a 
Morses Club Card, we proudly provide 
our customers with an essential service.
The Group is currently in the process of 
obtaining its full regulatory permissions 
with the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) and continues to operate 
under interim permissions. We operate 
primarily via a network of self-employed 
agents from the same communities as 
their customers. Loans are finalised in 
person by a Morses Club agent who 
then collects the repayments each 
week. These personal connections allow 
us to know our customers and their 
needs, developing strong relationships 
that often endure for many years. 
Treating Customers Fairly
We are a responsible lender and our 
commitment to fair customer treatment 
is woven throughout our business. 
In independent satisfaction surveys, 
over 95% of both employees and agents 
said they understood the importance 
of treating customers fairly.
Every time a customer borrows from 
us, their agent conducts an affordability 
check with them in person, helping 
to ensure good customer outcomes. 
We make our rates clear and never 
charge missed or late payment fees  
or interest. Our customer-centric 
approach to lending helps to keep  
our customer satisfaction scores 
consistently high.

Customer Satisfaction Research
Mustard Research, an independent 
research agency, contact 200 quality 
customers on our behalf on a monthly 
basis and conduct short telephone 
surveys with them; each survey takes 
about 10 minutes to complete.
The survey covers customer satisfaction 
with our service and their thoughts on 
our product offering, as well as what 
they would like to see in the future. 
The data from these surveys gives us 
important insights into our customers, 
our market and our opportunities.
Our customer satisfaction research has 
allowed us to define what good service 
looks like for Morses Club, and identify 
any areas where we can improve. 
We acknowledge that we cannot 
provide great service without the hard 
work of our employees and agents, and 
results from our customer satisfaction 
research are circulated to each area of 
the business and monitored closely 
each month.
We are proud of the consistently high 
satisfaction results we receive – which 
are consistently above 95%.
To ensure that we continue to provide our 
customers with exceptional customer service  
as well as products and services that meet  
their needs, Morses Club conducts independent 
customer satisfaction research.
Paid-up Customer Research
In addition to our monthly customer 
satisfaction research, we conduct 
independent paid-up customer 
research every year. During FY17 , 
there were two waves of this research, 
conducted by Mustard Research on 
our behalf.
In each wave of paid-up customer 
research, a sample of 500 customers 
who have paid off their loan and left 
Morses Club in the previous 12 months 
are contacted by telephone and asked 
to complete a short 10-minute survey.
The surveys are important in identifying 
any trends as to why people have 
chosen to leave Morses Club, and in 
determining any service improvements 
we may need to make. 
Paid-up customer research is a key part 
of our customer retention activity.

Chairman’s Statement
T oday’s Business is Built on a Proud Heritage
The Group’s shares were first admitted 
to trading on AIM on 5 May 2016.
The Company has achieved the main 
strategic objectives which were set 
by the Board at the time of the Initial 
Public Offering (IPO), namely the 
implementation of the Morses Club 
Card and the purchase of Shelby 
Finance Limited, whose online system 
has been used as the platform for the 
recent launch of our online lending 
product trading as Dot Dot Loans. As a 
result of these investments, the Group 
has continued to grow both its revenue, 
by 10% and adjusted profit by 5% to 
£99.6m and £17 .7m respectively. 
Reported PBT grew by 8% to £11.2m.

Home Collected Credit (HCC) provider, 
offering loans with personal, 
professional and friendly service to 
customers nationwide.
We are committed to Treating 
Customers Fairly, a culture which is

We put our customers at the heart of 
everything we do and actively monitor 
and develop the ways in which we

customer satisfaction levels at above 
95%, representing compelling evidence 
of our customer-centric culture.
The Board
As part of the corporate governance 
work prior to the admission to AIM, 
three additional, Independent Non-
Executive Directors were appointed  
to the Board: Sir Nigel Knowles,  
Joanne Lake and Patrick Storey. 
Between them, they bring a wealth  
of experience in compliance, financial 
services, legal, investment banking, 
accounting, and general business 
matters to Board deliberations.  
Further details are set out on pages  
30 and 31. The full Board of seven 
Directors now comprises a majority of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors.

we have set about the task of 
implementing a best practice approach 
to ensure that we are transparently 
governed and managed within a culture 
of integrity and accountability.
Our Corporate Governance Report

External Landscape
The Non-Standard 
Consumer Credit Market 
Home Collected Credit (HCC) is part  
of the wider UK non-standard credit 
market. This market consists of secured 
and unsecured lending and is made 
up of approximately 10 million people.
Non-standard credit is the provision 
of secured and unsecured credit 
to consumers other than through 
mainstream lenders. Lenders providing 
non-standard credit typically lend 
on an unsecured basis and the 
market is characterised by high-
frequency borrowing.
HCC is a specialised and well-established 
segment of the non-standard credit 
market, with approximately 1.8m people 
using its services regularly.
HCC customers are generally part of 
the C2, D and E socio-economic groups. 
Loans are small and unsecured and 
typically given in cash; this model is 
facilitated via self-employed agents.
Other forms of non-standard credit, 
eg instalment loans, do not operate  
in the same way as HCC and rely on 
fully-online lending.
Regulatory Landscape
Regulatory responsibility for HCC 
was transferred from the Office of 
Fair Trading to the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) in April 2014. 
Morses Club operates within a legislative 
and regulatory framework set out in the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974 and 2006 
along with the FCA’s handbook and 
associated guidance notes. 
Morses Club’s HCC business currently 
operates on an interim permission from 
the FCA whilst application for full 
authorisation is considered. Morses 
Club has provided all of the requested 
information to the FCA and is continuing 
an open dialogue with the FCA 
regarding full authorisation. Full 
permission is anticipated during 2017 .
Morses Club conducts its business 
taking account of all relevant legislation, 
secondary legislation, regulation and 
practice applicable to UK HCC lenders.
Shelby Finance Limited, trading as 
Dot Dot Loans, is operating under 
full authorisation. 
Competitor Landscape
The largest three HCC lenders have  
an aggregate market share of 
approximately 65%. Below this level,  
the market is highly fragmented with 
multiple small lenders operating at 
a local level.
Morses Club is currently the second 
largest HCC lender with c.216,000 
customers nationwide.
The number of HCC lenders in the UK 
has decreased due to tighter rules and 
regulations. Morses Club has acquired 
several smaller HCC businesses as a 
result of this and these acquisitions 
continue to make up part of our growth 
strategy in 2017 . 
Digital Opportunity
We believe that new digital technologies 
will change the way many traditional 
HCC lenders interact with their customers. 
This is already happening through online 
loan applications, automated credit 
approval processes and the use of 
pre-paid cards, like the Morses Club 
Card, in addition to cash.
Morses Club believes that there will always be a segment 
of the population that relies on Home Collected Credit (HCC). 
Our developing technology platforms and expertise will not 
only give us the ability to better support our customers and 
agents, but also enable us to address other segments of the 
far larger UK non-standard lending market.

Morses Club is the second largest 
player in the UK HCC Market with 
c.216,000 customers.
Our customers are based throughout 
the UK, and we operate using nine 
regional networks which contain multiple 
branches. Managers and agents from 
each branch are relatively local to the 
areas they serve and are often part 
of their customer communities.
Our customer numbers have grown 
by 9% in the last 12 months and due 
to our robust credit policy, as well 
as affordability checks and general 
forbearance, we have increased 
our level of good quality customers.

and will be looking to create an online 
customer portal. Our monthly customer 
satisfaction surveys have shown that 
there is significant customer interest 
in this, particularly among the 18-35 
customer demographic.
Digital technology and communications 
are there to underpin and enhance 
the relationship between agents and 
customers in the HCC space, not to 
replace it.

How This Creates Value 
We use retained earnings and lower cost debt 
facilities to lend to our customers at a margin, 
and control the lending risk and costs in order 
to deliver consistent shareholder returns. 
Our ability to do this successfully relies on: 
 – an established national infrastructure of 
experienced agents and management to deliver 
the right products to the right customers;
 – technology to ensure regulatory compliance 
and efficient processes and controls;
 – well-considered compliance and controls to 
maintain our ethos of the customer being 
at the centre of everything we do; 
 – a customer base of c. 216,000 that brings 
economies of scale to the organisation; 
 – an experienced management team with 
a clear understanding of the dynamics of 
non-standard lending; and
 – vision and technology to enhance the services 
to existing customers and develop into the 
broader non-standard lending space.
What Makes Us Different? 
Treating the Customer Fairly is embedded into our approach 
to lending. The interest charged is agreed up-front for each 
loan – we never charge additional interest, even if the loan 
extends beyond its original term. 
 – Repayments collected 
weekly by agents
 – Experienced agents, 
familiar with their 
customers’ communities
 – Agents are self-employed 
and paid in commission
 – Frequent contact with 
agents means there is 
always an open channel 
of communication 
with customers 
 – Issues identified quickly 
and sensitively, supporting 
customers in difficulty 
 – Robust complaints process
 – Customer satisfaction 
consistently above 95%
 – Customers cite agent 
relationship as a top 
reason for high satisfaction
 – Additional loans available 
for suitable customers 
according to strict criteria
 – Affordability checks are 
completed for every 
single loan
 – Proactive customer

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 11 Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Growth Strategy
The HCC business has benefited  
from a strong pipeline of territory  
builds. These are opportunities where 
experienced agents join us to build 
customer growth in specific areas. 
These agents already have an excellent 
grasp of what it takes to build good 
relationships with customers, thus 
representing a key source of premium-
quality growth. 
Technology
A strong technology platform brings  
a number of advantages. Our core 
underwriting system for HCC has a fully 
developed automated credit control 
engine at its centre. This not only 
enhances good decision making on 
the doorstep but allows the business  
to maintain compliant and highly 
personalised customer service. 
Our mobility platform integrates fully 
with our core underwriting system, and 
provides highly developed functionality 
to our field teams and agents. This has 
led to increased efficiency gains and 
has virtually eradicated paper from the 
operation, as well as giving us highly 
controlled impairment. 
Our strategy to build a digital platform 
that spans all our products and services 
is underway. This strategy will exploit 
the existing platforms and bring new 
Our strategy to build

This strategy will exploit

features to our customers. Crucially,  
our technology platform increases  
our potential to develop products and 
services and to embed regulatory 
compliance, to make it simpler as well  
as enforceable and auditable. It means 
that training in processes, procedures 
and behaviours can be delivered  
online, with minimal disruption to  
daily operations and management  
in the field. 
Acquisitions
Acquiring smaller businesses within 
the HCC sector is still achievable, 
but careful assessment of the quality 
of the business, timing and pricing 
are important factors in securing 
acquisitions at the right price. For the 
first time, due to the acquisition of 
Shelby Finance Limited, we are now 
able to purchase online instalment loan 
competitors, giving us more options 
to consider when selecting potential 
targets. This important activity will remain 
one of our focal areas for 2017/18.
Online Instalment Loan Product
As well as accelerating our IT platform 
capabilities, the purchase of Shelby 
Finance Limited has also provided us 
with the valuable benefit of full approval 
by the regulator in this very large 
market sector. Retraction by 
competitors, toxic brand associations 
and the need for our competitors and 
We have continued to invest  
in technology to support our 
strategic plan to offer customers 
a broader range of products  
and the ability to access credit 
more flexibly.
Paul Smith
Chief Executive Officer
In addition to the successful introduction 
of the Morses Club Card in April 2016, 
we are delighted to have launched our 
new online instalment product, Dot Dot 
Loans in March 2017 . 
We have a number of developments 
planned for the coming year as part 
of our expansion into customer rewards, 
customer communication channels, 
social media, and financial and  
card-related services.
We remain confident in our outlook, 
with a strong pipeline of territory builds 
for our growth plan, and continue to see 
attractive acquisition opportunities in the 
Home Collected Credit (HCC) and the 
wider non-standard finance markets.
Strategic Report
Morses Club PLC 12 new entrants to take volume risks, form 
a part of the competitive landscape. 
The fact that we suffer none of these 
disadvantages means that we are 
well-positioned to enter this market.
HCC Market Conditions
The HCC competitive environment 
continues to reduce, although at 
a slower rate than in previous years. 
Consumer demand continues its 
modest growth. The key drivers to 
out-performing the sector are 
technologies that will lower costs, 
increase capacity, improve productivity, 
enforce good compliance adherence 
and improve our relevance and appeal 
to younger, digitally confident 
consumers. Morses Club has already 
invested in all of these technologies and 
is reaping the rewards described, with 
8% overall growth in loans, 10% growth 
in high-quality cohorts and 5% growth 
in the under-35 market.
The business is now in a position to lower 
the cost to serve in both HCC and online 
lending markets and to improve its 
productivity. Overheads as a percentage 
of revenue have already started to fall, 
reducing to 56.9% from 58.9% in FY16. 
There is capacity for the business to 
grow using the existing field resource, 
with an increase of up to 28% in the ratio 
of customers to a business manager. 
Technology and Customer Service
We have continued to concentrate 
on using technology to help drive 
further improvements to the customer 
experience. The efficiency of our agents 
and managers has been a key focus. 
As a result of our investment in better 
technologies we can now devote more 
management time to delivering the 
right outcomes for customers, helping 
those in difficulty and supporting agent 
development. The agents themselves 
now face far less manual administration 
with the eradication of paperwork 
and the ability to sign loan agreements 
on their tablet. This in turn eases the 
business operation, improves work-life 
balance and enhances loyalty to 
Morses Club, thus reducing agent churn. 
Digitising our business has brought 
many planned and subtle advantages 
in addition to those already detailed. 
The fact that every part of the lending 
and collecting process is digitally 
and geographically time-stamped 
means that we can deliver enhanced 
management reporting from our data 
warehouse. This makes us a much more 
transparent organisation.
The platform has also allowed us to 
automate credit decisions based on 
policy with minimal levels of intervention 
or management overrides. This ensures 
responsible lending and sound 
compliance, as evidenced by our 
controlled impairment and the 
increase in the proportion of debt in 
our best performing arrears bands.
The installation of tailored risk 
management systems and complaint 
management systems illustrate how  
we have adopted the same systematic 
approach in these areas, too. Our 
committee structures, risk framework, 
corporate governance policies and 
our high-quality executive and  
non-executive Board structure all 
culminate in an approach closely 
resembling that of a large, main market 
PLC. I am proud that we are equipped 
and empowered by robust, systematised 
processes managed by highly skilled 
and ethical management teams.
The fact that we are developing our 
technology for customer interface 
and customer use is a hugely positive 
aspect of the business. The outcome 
for the customer is that Morses Club 
is more accessible as a financial option 
in their daily life. For the first time in our 
history, we can gather detailed data on 
the spending behaviour of our customer 
base. This helps us significantly in 
designing even better value-added 
services for our customers, which in 
turn will improve customer acquisition 
(particularly amongst younger 
age groups) and retain more high-
quality customers. 
Regulatory Context
I believe that the best way to create 
a positive relationship with the 
regulator is to focus on the customer. 
Our improvements and investments 
have been made with our customers’ 
satisfaction in mind. It is however no 
accident that the developments in 
which we have invested also enable 
us to be more productive, reduce our 
operating costs, re-use technology 
many times over for the same 
investment case and, of course, 
to attract and retain customers. 
The primary vision of better customer 
outcomes via technology investment will 
be the key to maintaining a harmonious 
relationship, something which I believe 
we are on course to achieve.
Marketing
Morses Club has been in existence for 
over 130 years and has strong brand 
loyalty and identity. Our website traffic 
demonstrates that this positive brand 
awareness reaches beyond the HCC 
market into the wider , non-standard 
credit market, too. This will be a major 
advantage to us as we grow our brand 
and reputation in, and potentially 
beyond, the online instalment market.
Morses Club Card
Morses Club Card is our pre-paid Visa 
debit card which allows customers to 
receive loans via card rather than cash. 
The card allows customers to pay for 
goods and services electronically as well 
as access cash via cash machines, free 
of charge. Further benefits of the card 
include greater security for agents 
and customers, as the cards are PIN 
protected. In addition, customers have 
access to an online portal, a mobile app 
as well as the opportunity to earn 
cashback from selected retailers.
E-loans
We have made a strong start in our 
diversification strategy. Our online 
lending brand launched in March 2017 .  
A fully interactive customer portal and 
downloadable mobile app will mean 
easier, two-way communication with 
customers. As the delivery and 
awareness platforms continue to 
develop, we will be able to take 
much larger strides into customer 
retail benefits (such as discounting 
and cashbacks). Our expansion of 
our Morses Club Card base, the portal 
and app platforms will allow us to 
offer simple financial services to our 
customers and we will encourage our 
customers to share their experience 
of Morses Club on social media, 
improving our reputation and relevance 
with emerging, younger markets. 
Market Opportunities
The Board remains vigilant to market 
developments that could help accelerate 
our strategy and augment our vision. 
We are currently reviewing several 
growth and diversification opportunities 
and our horizon-scanning capabilities 
will ensure that we identify and evaluate 
these opportunities as they emerge.

A Modern Lens on a Traditional Business
E-loans for the Online Customer
The core business of Morses Club PLC is 
Home Collected Credit (HCC). However, 
our growth strategy incorporates a plan 
to broaden our products and services. 
Morses Club launched Dot Dot Loans – 
an online instalment loan product – in 
March 2017 . The operational model and 
target demographic are fundamentally 
different from the HCC product. Every 
loan is applied for and approved online, 
and repayments are collected from the 
customer’s bank account, on an agreed 
date each month.
Dot Dot Loans typically targets C1/C2/D 
profile customers with a moderate but 
steady income. We anticipate that the 
two products will see only a small overlap 
of customers.
The new brand website is mobile-
responsive, designed to meet the needs 
of this different set of consumers who 
may have access to a wider range of 
financial options, and who expect fast, 
easily-accessible products. 
Why an e-loan?
HCC customers make up approximately 
30% of the 10 million people in the 
non-standard credit market. Dot Dot 
Loans helps us to access the remaining 
eight million UK consumers who want 
online instalment credit. By adding 
brands to the Morses Club product 
portfolio, we are strengthening our 
brand presence. 
Why Dot Dot Loans?
We based the e-loan product branding 
on the results of consumer research 
conducted in August 2016.

 Dot Dot 
Loans speaks to consumers in a clear 
and friendly manner, giving all the facts 
without lots of financial jargon. The 
brand differentiates itself from its 
competitors and will have the same 
focus on responsible lending, good 
customer outcomes and treating 
customers fairly as Morses Club.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 19 Chief Financial Officer’s  
Operational and Financial Review
The results for the Group for the 52 
weeks to 25 February 2017 illustrate 
our aim of controlled growth, with credit 
issued up by 18%, revenue up by 10% 
and adjusted profit before tax up by 
5%. Statutory profit before tax is also 
up 8%. Impairment as a percentage of 
revenue of 24.4% (FY16: 20.8%) remains 
comfortably within our guidance 
range of 22.0% to 27 .0%. Despite the 
increased costs of compliance and PLC 
status, the ratio of total operating costs 
to revenue decreased by 7% because 
the benefits of our scale and improved 
technology drove greater efficiencies.
Net tangible assets, being net assets 
less intangible assets arising from 
acquisitions, plus capitalised software, 
increased by 14% to £54.4m with the net 
receivables growing by 8% to £61.2m. 
The value of gross customer receivables 
with our top performing customers 
increased by 10%.
Group Results
Credit issued to customers for the 
year increased by 18% to £144.1m  
(FY16: £122.2m) of which 5% can be 
attributed to acquisitions made during 
this period. Core growth reflected a 
successful territory build strategy in 
which we carried out 105 builds in the 
year and their quality remains strong. 
Revenue increased by 10% to 
£99.6m (FY16: £90.6m) while the cost 
of collections rose by 17% to £22.4m 
(FY16: £19.2m), representing 22.5% 
(FY16: 21.2%) of revenue. There are 
several reasons for the disproportionate 
increase in collection costs. Firstly, the 
cost of increased territory build subsidies 
to agents joining from competitors 
accounted for £1.2m compared with 
£0.7m last year. Management’s view is 
that this is a business development 
cost as new territory builds are usually 
loss-making in the first year, but result 
in high-quality profitable customers 
thereafter. Secondly, agents inherited 
from acquisitions are generally more 
expensive, creating an estimated cost 
increase of £0.5m this year (FY16: 
£0.1m). Finally, shortening the average 
loan duration, and therefore the finance 
charges, decreases the income to cash 
yield, making the commission paid (this is 
cash-based) relatively more expensive.
Commission Breakdown
£m FY17 FY16
Agent commission 21.2 18.5

Total commission 22.4 19.2
The Group’s financial performance continues 
to reflect our underlying aims of controlled 
growth through responsible lending, with a 
continued focus on impairment, improving 
the quality of our customer base.
We believe this leads to higher returns on 
assets and improved shareholder returns.
Andy Thomson
Chief Financial Officer
The Group achieved 
an impressive return 
on equity of 27 .2% 
(FY16: 27 .9%),  
an outstanding 
achievement given 
our comparatively 
low gearing.
Strategic Report
Morses Club PLC 20 Impairment of £24.3m (FY16: £18.8m) 
was 29% higher than last year, 
increasing as a percentage of revenue 
from 20.8% to 24.4%. 
This increase reflects the very low 
impairment in the prior year due to 
modest growth in credit issued in the 
first half of that year and the second 
half of the year before. These lower 
levels of growth are attributable to 
the acquisition and integration of the 
Shopacheck Financial Services business 
at the time. This was a major undertaking 
and meant that management were 
focused on assessing the customer 
base that we had inherited and 
harmonising IT systems, credit policy 
and other processes and procedures 
rather than on new customer growth.
This current impairment level is still well 
within our concept of an appropriate 
range of 22% to 27% for an established 
Home Collected Credit (HCC) business.
Impairment is arguably more closely 
related to credit issued, and on this 
metric the level of impairment of 16.8% 
of credit issued is only slightly higher 
than 15.4% of credit issued last year.
Overheads of £34.6m were broadly 
in line with last year’s £34.1m, despite 
increased costs associated with being 
a listed company and the increased 
investment in compliance activities.  
The continued focus on improving 
operational efficiency resulted in the 
reduction of overheads as a percentage 
of revenue from 37 .6% last year to 
35.1% this year, an efficiency 
improvement of 7%.
The adjusted profit before tax 
increased to £17 .7m from £16.8m last 
year, an improvement of 5%. Adjusted 
earnings per share increased to 10.8p 
from 10.2p last year.
Reported profit before tax increased 
to £11.2m from £10.4m last year, an 
improvement of 8%. 
A table of adjustments between 
reported profit before tax and adjusted 
profit before tax is shown on page 22.
The Board proposes  
a final dividend of  
4.3p, making a total  
of 6.4p for the year .  
This excellent dividend 
reflects our confidence in 
the business’ prospects 
and our commitment  
to generating high 
income yields for 
our shareholders.

The amortisation of intangibles reflects 
the unwind of intangible assets in 
connection with acquisitions. This 
reduction reflects both the lower level 
of acquisitions in the current year and 
reduced levels of amortisation in 
connection with prior year acquisitions. 
Intangible assets are amortised over 
their useful economic life, which is based 
on the expected life of the acquired 
customer relationships. Due to the 
behavioural profile of our customers, 
this will naturally result in a greater 
amortisation charge in the early years, 
with a corresponding reduction in later 
years. No intangible asset is recognised 
for new customers agents may identify 
subsequently, which management 
considers to be a conservative approach.
In FY17 , the business incurred costs of 
£2.2m in connection with its IPO on  
5 May 2016.
Other non-operating costs are primarily 
in connection with non-recurring 
restructuring costs of the business  
and were higher in FY16 due to the 
costs associated with integrating the 
Shopacheck Financial Services business 
into Morses Club.
Online Lending
The additional costs associated with 
establishing our online lending facility 
were less than £0.1m and have 
therefore not been separated out 
from the core business performance.
Return on Equity
The Group calculates its return on equity 
(ROE) as profit before tax, amortisation 
of intangible assets arising on 
acquisitions, the one-off costs of the 
IPO and other non-operating costs as a 
percentage of the average book value of 
the shareholder funds during the period. 
The Group achieved an impressive 
27 .2% (FY16: 27 .9%) for the current 
year, a particularly pleasing result 
given the low gearing level by 
comparison with our peers.
Net Margin
The adjusted net margin, which  
excludes amortisation of intangibles on 
acquisitions, the one-off costs of the 
IPO and other non-operating costs, 
decreased to 17 .7% compared to 18.6% 
last year, primarily due to sales growth 
and investment in our business.
Because credit-issued growth 
exceeded revenue growth and given 
that impairment is closely related 
to sales, the like-for-like impact of 
impairment cost to revenue on margin 
reduced it by 1.7%. Furthermore, the 
additional cost of the agent commission 
subsidies impacted net margins by 1.2% 
against only 0.8% in the previous year.
The net margin for the period 
decreased only slightly to 11.3% from 
11.5% last year as the amortisation of 
intangibles on acquisitions charge 
reduced to £3.7m from £5.4m.
Acquisitions and Goodwill
In this period, the Group made six 
acquisitions of loan book assets along 
with the staff who TUPE across under 
such transactions. The total sum paid 
for these books was £5.7m, generating 
intangible assets and goodwill of £2.6m. 
This was a lower level of activity 
compared to last year when we paid 
£7 .9m and generated intangible assets 
and goodwill of £2.8m.
In addition, we acquired the shares  
of Shelby Finance Limited in which an 
established online lending platform and 
associated credit decision infrastructure 
formed the primary asset.
Impairment of 16.8% 
of credit issued remains 
broadly comparable 
to the prior year of 
15.4% of credit issued.
Strategic Report
Morses Club PLC 22 The lower intangible amortisation for 
the year of £3.7m compared with 
£5.4m in the previous year arises from 
both the reduced level of acquisitions 
and lower amortisation of intangible 
assets from prior year acquisitions.
Dividend
Subject to Shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting on 20 June 
2017 , the Board proposes to pay a 
final dividend of 4.3p per ordinary 
share payable on 21 July 2017 to all 
shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 23 June 2017 . 
This payment is additional to the interim 
dividend of 2.1p per ordinary share 
already paid, making a total dividend  
for the year of 6.4p. The high dividend 
payment reflects the Board’s confidence 
in the business’ prospects and our 
commitment to provide a strong 
income yield to our Shareholders.
Balance Sheet
The total equity for the Group has 
increased from £55.4m at the end of 
last year to £61.4m. It should be noted 
that there is no final dividend accounted 
for in our first period as a listed company.
Net tangible assets, which exclude 
intangible assets arising on acquisitions, 
have increased by 14% to £54.4m 
from £47 .8m at the end of last year.
Our main book asset is the net 
customer loan book which increased in 
value to £61.2m from £56.8m at the 
end of last year, an increase of 8%. 
Gross receivables from customers 
(before impairment provisioning, which 
includes discounting of cash flows) 
increased by 5% in the year. The higher 
growth in the net balance sheet value 
reflects the Group’s continued drive to 
improve loan book quality and thus 
reduce impairment provisions.
This growth follows a period of 
contraction in the loan book since  
March 2014 while we upgraded the 
debt quality of our Shopacheck 
Financial Services business acquisition.
Funding
At the end of the financial year our 
debt stood at £10.0m, a marginal rise 
from the previous year’s £9.0m.
Christmas represents the Group’s peak 
borrowing period: in this financial year, 
borrowing reached £21.5m, compared 
with £20.0m in the previous year.
The Group currently has a £25m 
revolving debt facility with Shawbrook 
Bank PLC. It is secured by a debenture  
on our business assets and runs until 
March 2019, with a further term-out 
period until September 2019. The facility 
is subject to both financial and debt 
quality covenants which are typical of 
this form of lending. The Group has 
met these covenants historically and 
expects to do so for the duration of 
the facility.
Whilst this facility is sufficient to fund 
modest business growth and maintain  
a progressive dividend policy, the 
Directors are working to secure 
additional facilities in order to exploit 
any new business opportunities that 
arise. We would also like to build 
relationships with more than one 
lending institution.
The Board is keen to emphasise 
that any increase in gearing will 
always be firmly founded on our 
culture of Treating Customers Fairly.
Cash Flow
Cash from core activities in the year 
generated £15.1m in cash (FY16: 
£13.6m), of which £6.8m (FY16: £10.6m) 
was invested in business acquisitions 
and capital expenditure.
The dividend payment in FY16 of £17 .5m 
reflects many years of undistributed 
earnings as a private company. 
A summary cash flow is shown below:
£m FY17 FY16
Cash from Core Activity 15.1 13.6

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 23 Principal risks are a risk or a combination 
of risks that, given the Group’s current 
position, could seriously affect the 
performance, future prospects or 
reputation of the Group. They include 
those risks that could materially threaten 
our business model, performance, 
solvency or liquidity, or prevent us from 
delivering our strategic objectives. 
The Board has the overall responsibility 
for ensuring that risk is appropriately 
managed across the Group. The Board 
has established the Group’s risk appetite 
and strategy and approved its 
frameworks, methodologies, policies, 
and roles and responsibilities. 
The Group has an internal audit 
manager who reports to the Audit 
Committee Chairman. The internal 
audit manager’s priorities have been 
agreed by the Board’s Audit Committee 
and Risk & Compliance Committee  
and focus on (i) high residual risks 
and (ii) those risks which have been 
significantly reduced by Group actions 
and procedures. 
The Group’s approach to risk 
management is underpinned by the 
‘Three Lines of Defence’ model which 
is summarised in the diagram below.
Responsibility for the First Line of 
Defence resides with the front-line 
business divisions and functions 
(eg operations and finance). Line 
managers are directly accountable for 
identifying and managing the risks arising 
in their functional or business area.
The Second Line of Defence comprises 
the Group’s central and independent 
risk management and compliance 
functions with responsibility for 
oversight, compliance monitoring and 
reporting to the Board’s Risk & 
Compliance Committee and the 
Executive Risk Committee. This is led by 
the Risk and Compliance Director who 
reports to the Chairman of the Risk & 
Compliance Committee and to the CEO.
The Third Line of Defence includes the 
internal audit manager who reports to 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and is independent of the First and 
Second Lines of Defence. In addition, 
external accountants undertake a 
quarterly audit on behalf of the Group’s 
external lenders.
Line of Defence Role Functions
First Line  
of Defence
Direct responsibility for the performance 
and monitoring of front-line control activities across 
the business
 – Field operations – regional managers,  
area managers and business managers 
 – Central operations
 – Banking and finance
Second Line  
of Defence
 – Support and challenge the business via control 
activities
 – Independently review the effectiveness of front-line 
control activity 
 – Manage fraud
 – Compliance, risk and financial crime
Third Line  
of Defence
Independently assess and assure:
 – Internal control framework 
 – Risk management effectiveness
 – Internal audit
 – Use of third-party specialists to assist  
the internal auditor
 – Use of third-party internal auditors and legal specialists
The Group maintains a risk register 
covering the entire business. Risks are 
rated according to the probability of 
occurrence and potential impact. 
Each risk is assigned to an appropriate 
individual and all mitigation and action 
plans are recorded.
The Group operates only in the UK 
financial services sector and the 
Directors believe that whatever form 
Brexit may take, it is not a material risk 
to the business. The principal risks faced 
by the business by risk category are as 
displayed on pages 26 and 27 .
The Directors, through the Risk & 
Compliance Committee, have carried 
out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity.
Risk Management
Strategic Report
Morses Club PLC 24 Viability Statement
The Directors consider the Group’s 
viability as part of their continuing 
programme of monitoring risk. For 
the purposes of assessing the future 
prospects of the Group, the Directors 
have selected a three-year timeframe. 
This timeframe was selected as it 
corresponds with the Board’s strategic 
planning horizon. The assessment has 
been made with reference to the 
Group’s current position and prospects, 
the Group’s strategy, the Board’s risk 
appetite and the Group’s principal risks 
and uncertainties and how these are 
identified, managed and mitigated 
(as shown on pages 26 and 27).
The strategy for the Group is included 
on pages 16 to 19 and its business 
model is on pages 10 and 11. Home 
Collected Credit (HCC) is a long-
established offering, and parts of the 
Group have been undertaking this 
business for more than 80 years.
The Directors review and renew the 
three-year strategic plan at least 
annually. Progress against the strategic 
plan is reviewed every month by the 
Board through presentations from the 
Executive Management Team on the 
performance of their respective 
business units, the assessment 
of market opportunities, and the 
consideration by the Board of its 
ability to fund its strategic ambitions.
In addition to standard internal 
governance, the Group is also monitored 
against key financial covenants tied in 
with current funding facilities. These are 
produced and submitted on a monthly 
basis with key schedules included in the 
monthly board papers.
The Group is profitable and cash 
generative. It currently has a debt 
facility in the form of a £25m revolving 
facility secured by a debenture on the 
assets of the business. This facility 
expires in March 2019 and it is the Group’s 
policy to renew such a facility well in 
advance of this date. The Directors 
are very confident that the credit facility 
will be renewed prior to March 2019.
Due to the short-term nature of its 
products, the Group is well placed to 
react promptly to any changes in its 
liquidity requirements.
Based on the above, the Board confirms 
that it has a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will continue to operate 
and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, 
for the next three years.

Morses Club PLC 26 Type of Risk Definition Impacts Mitigation
Operational 
Risk
This describes the risk of loss arising 
from inadequate or failed 
procedures, systems or policies, 
employee errors, system failures, 
fraud, other criminal activity – 
indeed any event which disrupts 
business processes.

protection of agents and 
staff in the home collect 
environment.
 – Failure to recruit and retain 
key staff.
All agents and staff participate 
annually in a personal safety  
review and follow our home/

obligations on time.
 – Funding is not available 
to achieve growth targets.
The Group currently has a debt 
facility in the form of a £25m 
revolving facility secured by a 
debenture on the assets of the 
business. This facility expires in 
March 2019 and it is the Group’s 
policy to renew such a facility well 
in advance of this date. This is 
sufficient to fund modest business 
growth. The Directors are also 
actively engaged in securing 
additional facilities in order to exploit 
business opportunities in the future.
IT Risk
Cyber risks.  – IT systems and networks 
can be damaged and/or 
information can be lost 
owing to third party actions.
The Group has an ongoing 
programme to conduct regular 
vulnerability assessments against 
our core infrastructure services.  
Penetration testing of our external 
and internal networks helps 
to identify new or emerging 
security concerns.
The potential that a given threat will 
exploit vulnerabilities of an asset or 
group of assets, causing harm to 
the organisation. The risk of an 
event is measured in terms of its 
probability and its consequences.

continuation policy and procedure 
are in place. Service level 
agreements and business 
continuation plans are verified and

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 27 Chairman’s Introduction to Governance
Board of Directors
As part of the process leading to the 
Company’s Initial Public Offering (IPO) 
and in order to strengthen our 
governance arrangements, three 
new Non-Executive Directors 
were appointed to the Board on 
14 April 2016 prior to the Group’s 
admission to AIM on 5 May 2016.
The Board currently comprises five 
Non-Executive Directors and two 
Executive Directors, whose biographies 
are presented on pages 30 and 31. 
The Board considers four of the 
Non-Executive Directors (myself, 
Joanne Lake, Patrick Storey and 
Sir Nigel Knowles) to be independent 
in character and judgement because 
while we each own shares in the 
Company, we all have significant other 
business interests and activities. 
The Board as a whole considers 
the Non-Executive Directors’ minor 
shareholdings in the Company to be 
advantageous to shareholders, as in 
addition to our fiduciary duties our 
interests are aligned with shareholders 
in general. Non-Executive Directors are 
not entitled to share options and there 
are no cross-directorships between 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board comprises 
five Non-Executive 
Directors and two 
Executive Directors.  
Peter Ward has been appointed 
by Perpignon Limited and so is 
not considered to be independent. 
Sir Nigel Knowles has been appointed 
as the Senior Independent Director.
Much work was done during 2016 
to build a Board equipped with the 
experience and expertise to drive the 
Group’s future direction, strategy and 
culture. All five Non-Executive Board 
members were appointed for an initial 
one-year term of office. Following a 
review of their effectiveness and 
commitment, both individually and 
collectively, by the Nominations 
Committee (which I chair), all have 
been recommended to the Board for 
an extension of their appointments for 
the remaining two years, subject to 
annual review and to election by the 
shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 20 June 2017 .
All Directors have access to the 
Company Secretary, Dave Belmont, who 
is responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures are observed. Any Director 
wishing to do so may take independent 
advice at the Group’s expense.
Committed to a high standard of corporate 
governance, from the date of the IPO, the 
Directors have adopted the provisions of  
the September 2014 edition of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (although being 
AIM listed, the Group is not obliged to comply 
with this). The only exception is the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report which has been 
prepared in accordance with AIM Rule 19. 
The Directors believe that this approach is 
a firm foundation for good governance and 
clarifies not only the appropriate allocation 
of duties, authority and responsibilities, but 
also the way the Group meets its legal and 
regulatory obligations.

shareholders for the Group’s proper 
management. A Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement in respect of the financial 
statements appears on page 42 of

need to enable the Board to discharge 
its duties. 
There is a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board. Certain items 
are delegated to specific committees, 
as set out on pages 34 to 36. The 
formal schedule of matters reserved 
for the Board includes the determination 
of strategy, approval of the budget and 
major capital expenditure.
The Board meeting agenda normally 
comprises a review of monthly 
management accounts, a CEO review of 
activity, a review of potential acquisitions 
and other growth opportunities, together 
with an update on the progress of the 
Group’s other strategic objectives.
The April Board meeting covers the 
approval of the preliminary results and 
the year-end financial statements, 
whilst the October meeting approves 
the interim results. The November 
meeting is dedicated to annual strategy 
and is held in partnership with the 
executive management team.
Board Evaluation
As Independent Chairman, I carried out 
an informal and internal Board evaluation 
process between November 2016 
and January 2017 . My performance 
as Chairman was evaluated by the 
Non-Executive Directors and led by the 
Senior Independent Director, Sir Nigel 
Knowles, with input from the executive 
team. The requirement for more 
formalised succession planning was 
actioned during the year. The quality 
of management information produced 
to the Board on a monthly basis was 
also further enhanced during the year 
as a result of ongoing feedback.

Governance
Morses Club PLC 32 Leadership
During the period since the Group’s 
shares were listed on the AIM Market, 
the Group has been controlled through 
a Board of Directors comprising two 
Executive and five Non-Executive 
Directors. The Chairman is mainly 
responsible for the running of the 
Board. He has to ensure that all 
directors receive sufficient relevant 
information on financial, business and 
corporate issues prior to meetings. The 
Board has a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it and currently meets at 
least 10 times per year. It is responsible 
for overall Group strategy, acquisition 
and divestment policy, approval of 
major capital expenditure projects and 
consideration of significant financing 
matters. It monitors the exposure to key 
business risks and reviews the strategic 
direction of the business. This includes 
its code of conduct, its annual budgets, 
its progress towards achievement 
of those budgets and its capital 
expenditure programmes. The 
Executive Directors are responsible 
for all matters affecting the 
performance of the Group and for 
the implementation of strategy, 
policies, budgets and the financial 
performance of the Group.
Effectiveness
Prior to the Group’s admission to AIM, 
the Nominations Committee conducted 
a formal, rigorous and transparent 
process to identify and recruit three 
additional Non-Executive Directors. 
The search for candidates was 
conducted, and appointments made, 
on merit, using objective criteria and 
with due regard for the benefits of 
diversity for the Board, including gender. 
The three appointees, Sir Nigel Knowles, 
Joanne Lake and Patrick Storey bring 
a wealth of experience covering 
compliance, financial services, legal, 
accounting, investment banking and 
general business matters.
There has been an induction plan for 
each of the new Non-Executive 
Directors. The Board has been briefed 
by the Group’s lawyers on the subject of 
the Market Abuse Regulations. Further 
briefings are planned on the subjects of 
General Data Protection Regulation and 
the Senior Managers Certification 
Regime. In addition, Directors are 
updated with developments in 
corporate governance requirements.
The Group’s CEO is appraised every six 
months by the Chairman. The Chairman 
has been evaluated by the Non-
Executive Directors led by the Senior 
Independent Director. During this first 
year as an AIM-listed company, the 
Chairman has undertaken an informal 
and internal evaluation of the Directors, 
the Board, and the Board’s committees. 
All of the Directors have been 
considered able to allocate sufficient 
time to the Company to discharge 
their responsibilities.
The Company Secretary is available  
to provide advice and services to all 
Board members and is responsible  
for ensuring Board procedures are 
followed. All directors are able to take 
independent advice in furtherance 
of their duties if necessary.
Accountability
Financial Reporting
Reviews of the performance and 
financial position of the Group are 
included in the Strategic Report 
within pages 12 to 27 , and present  
a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group’s position 
and prospects. The Directors’ 
responsibilities in respect of the 
financial statements are described 
on page 42 and those of the auditor 
on page 48.
Internal Control and Risk 
Management Systems
The Board acknowledges that it is 
responsible for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management, 
and for reviewing its own effectiveness 
on an annual basis. Such a system 
is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure in pursuit of 
the Group’s overall business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable, not 
absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Group’s 
internal control systems are reviewed 
regularly with the aim of continuous 
improvement. Whilst the Board 
acknowledges its overall responsibility 
for internal control, it believes strongly 
that senior management within the 
Group’s operating businesses should 
also contribute in a substantial way 
and this has been built into the process.
The Board discharges or intends to 
discharge its duties in this area through:
 – the review of financial performance 
including budgets, KPIs and forecasts 
on a monthly basis; 
 – the receipt of regular reports which 
provide an assessment of key risks 
and controls and how effectively 
they are working; 
 – scheduling annual Board reviews  
of strategy including reviews of the 
material risks and uncertainties 
facing the business;
 – the receipt of reports from senior 
management on the risk and 
control culture within the Group;
 – the presence of a clear 
organisational structure with defined 
hierarchy and clear delegation of 
authority; and
 – ensuring that there are documented 
policies and procedures in place.
Through the Risk & Compliance 
Committee, the Board reviews the 
risk management framework and 
the key risks facing the business. The 
finance department is responsible 
for preparing the Group financial 
statements and ensuring that 
accounting policies are in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards. All financial information 
published by the Group is subject to 
the approval of the Audit Committee.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 33
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements The Board. with advice from the Audit 
and the Risk & Compliance Committees, 
is satisfied that a system of internal 
controls and risk management is in 
place which enables the company to 
identify, manage and evaluate risks.
This process has been in place for the 
year under review and up to the date 
of approval of the report and financial 
statements. The process is regularly 
reviewed by the Board and accords 
with the guidance in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
The Board intends to keep its risk 
control procedures under constant 
review particularly as regards the 
need to embed internal control and  
risk management procedures further 
into the operations of the business  
and to deal with areas of improvement 
which come to management’s and the 
Board’s attention.
Relations with Shareholders
The Group communicates with 
institutional and private investors and 
responds quickly to all queries received 
verbally or in writing. All Shareholders 
will have at least 20 working days’ 
notice of the Annual General Meeting 
at which all Directors will be present  
and available for questions. The  
Board is aware of the importance  
of maintaining close relations with 
investors and analysts for the Group’s 
market rating. Twice-yearly road shows 
are conducted by the CEO and CFO 
when the performance and future 
strategy of the Group is discussed with 
larger shareholders. Queries from all 
shareholders are dealt with by the CFO: 
in addition, members of the Board 
obtain regular feedback from major 
shareholders and discuss this at  
Board meetings.
Board Committees
The terms of reference of all 
of the Board committees are 
available from the Group’s 
registered office and on its website 
at www.morsesclubplc.com. 
Copies of the service contracts and 
letters of agreement of each of the 
Directors are available at the Group’s 
registered office during business hours 
and will be available for inspection at 
the AGM for at least 15 minutes prior 
to and until the conclusion of the AGM. 
Remuneration & Corporate Social 
Responsibility Committee
The Remuneration & Corporate Social 
Responsibility Committee comprises 
three Non-Executive Directors, of whom 
two, Joanne Lake and Stephen Karle, 
are independent. The members of the 
Committee are:
 – Joanne Lake (Chairman);
 – Stephen Karle; and
 – Peter Ward.
The Remuneration & Corporate Social 
Responsibility Committee meets 
at least twice a year and on other 
occasions as deemed appropriate 
by the Committee’s Chairman.
The Committee Chairman is appointed 
by the Board on the recommendation 
of the Nominations Committee. 
A full Remuneration & Corporate 
Social Responsibility Committee 
report appears on pages 37 to 39.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee meets at least 
four times each year. 
The Audit Committee comprises 
all of the Group’s Non-Executive 
Directors, namely:
 – Patrick Storey (Chairman);
 – Stephen Karle;
 – Sir Nigel Knowles;
 – Joanne Lake; and
 – Peter Ward.
The Committee monitors and reviews 
the Group’s financial reporting from 
information provided by management 
and the auditor. The Committee reports 
to the Board on the Group’s full and 
half year results having examined the 
accounting policies on which they are 
based and ensured compliance with 
relevant accounting standards. 
External Audit
The Group’s external auditor is 
Deloitte LLP.
The Committee is responsible for 
reviewing the objectivity, independence 
and cost effectiveness of the 
external auditor.
The Committee also reviews the 
performance of the auditor taking 
into account the services and advice 
provided to the Group and the fees 
charged for these services. Details of 
the auditor’s total fees for the year can 
be found on page 60. The Group does 
not currently have a formal non-audit 
work policy, but the Committee maintains 
regular scrutiny of the auditor’s 
activities and charges.
Corporate Governance Report

Governance
Morses Club PLC 34 Deloitte LLP was first appointed as 
auditor of Morses Club Limited with 
effect from 1 March 2009. Since 
then, Morses Club Limited acquired 
Shopacheck Financial Services and 
the resulting Group was listed on AIM in 
May 2016. During this period of change, 
the Group has valued the continuity 
of the existing auditor’s appointment. 
On the basis of its review of the 
performance of the auditor since  
the IPO last year , the Committee has 
recommended to the Board that Deloitte 
be proposed for re-appointment at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Deloitte has indicated its willingness 
to continue in office. The Committee 
confirms that there are no contractual 
obligations that restrict the Committee’s 
choice of external auditor in the future.
Internal Audit Function
During the Autumn of 2016, we 
established an internal audit function 
and appointed a suitably qualified and 
experienced internal audit manager 
who reports directly to the Audit 
Committee Chairman. The internal 
audit function objectively reviews the 
Group’s internal control processes 
against the risk-based internal audit 
plan and audit charter approved by the 
Committee. The plan is based primarily 
on output from the risk management 
process, but it is flexible and may 
include ad-hoc investigations and 
other assurance work agreed by 
the Committee. Specialist technical 
knowledge and resource is externally 
sourced if and when required.
Meetings of the Committee
The Audit Committee meets with the 
external auditor without the presence 
of executive management at least once 
each year to discuss matters relating to 
its remit and any issues relating to the 
audit. The Committee has direct and 
unrestricted access to both internal and 
external audit functions. The Chairman 
also has regular contact with the 
external auditor, the Chief Financial 
Officer and the internal audit manager 
outside the formal meetings to ensure 
that any areas for discussion are dealt 
with in a timely manner.
The work undertaken by the Committee 
included the following activities:
 – a review of the full-year results 
including the Annual Report and 
Accounts, preliminary results 
statement and the external auditor’s 
report. In reviewing these documents 
and determining whether they were 
fair, balanced and understandable, 
the Committee also considered 
the work and recommendations 
of management;
 – an interim results statement review;
 – a consideration of the 
appropriateness of accounting 
policies and critical accounting 
estimates and judgements, including 
a review of information from the 
Chief Financial Officer and reports 
from the external auditor setting 
out their views on the accounting 
treatments and judgements in the 
financial statements;
 – a consideration of the level of 
non-audit work carried out by the 
external auditor and the seeking of 
assurances from the auditor that 
it maintains suitable policies and 
processes ensuring independence; 
 – a review of arrangements, for 
example whistleblowing, by which 
staff may, in confidence, raise 
concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of financial 
reporting or other matters; and
 – a review of the going concern 
assumptions when considering 
interim and final results statements 
and long-term viability in the case 
of the final results statement, 
taking into account internal 
financial projections. 
We acknowledge that the external 
auditor has reviewed the significant 
areas of judgement and subjected 
them to robust challenge. Significant 
areas of judgement considered by the 
Committee included:
1. Impairment
The Group makes judgements in 
relation to identifying objective evidence 
of impairment and calculates the 
provision by reference to historical 
payment performance to estimate the 
amount and timing of expected future 
cash flows. These estimates are revised 
annually and approved by the Board. 
2. Revenue Recognition
Under IAS 39, interest income should 
be recognised on the shorter of the 
expected life or the contractual life of 
the loan. Under IAS 39, the Committee 
has judged that interest income should 
be recognised over the contractual life 
of the loan based on historical loan 
book performance.
3. Acquisitions
During the period, the Group has made 
a number of acquisitions. Management 
has made judgements as to whether 
each of the acquisitions constitute 
a business and therefore is required 
to be accounted for as a business 
combination in accordance with IFRS 3.
Customer lists have been allocated 
a fair value on acquisition as the 
relationships are an important influence 
on the revenue-generating capacity 
of the business. Agent networks have 
also been identified and capitalised as 
an intangible asset.
The amount of goodwill initially 
recognised as a result of an acquisition 
is dependent on the allocation of the 
purchase price to the fair value of the 
identifiable assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed. The determination 
of the fair value of the assets and 
liabilities is based, to a considerable 
extent, on management’s judgement.

Risk & Compliance Committee
The Risk & Compliance Committee  
is scheduled to meet four times  
each year.
The Morses Club strapline is ‘Putting 
You First’: customers are at the heart 
of the Group’s culture, vision and values. 
In recent years, the level of public and 
regulatory scrutiny of the Group’s 
marketplace has grown. The Board 
recognises the importance to the 
business of risk and compliance, and 
the need to devote time and energy  
to these vital areas.
In January 2017 , the Board therefore 
divided the Audit & Risk Committee 
into two separate committees: the 
Audit Committee and the Risk & 
Compliance Committee. 
The Risk & Compliance Committee 
comprises all of the Non-Executive 
Directors of the Group, namely:
 – Patrick Storey (Chairman);
 – Stephen Karle;
 – Sir Nigel Knowles;
 – Joanne Lake; and
 – Peter Ward.
In addition, the following executives are 
also Committee members:
 – Paul Smith (Chief Executive Officer);
 – Andy Thomson (Chief 
Financial Officer);
 – Ian Cooper (Risk and Compliance 
Director); and
 – Barrie Grimshaw (Business  
Change & IT Director).
The Risk & Compliance Committee 
is responsible for reviewing and 
reporting to the Board on a number 
of topics, including:
 – the Group’s risk appetite (the extent 
and categories of risk regarded by 
the Board as acceptable for the 
Group to bear);
 – the Group’s risk management and 
internal controls framework (its 
principles, policies, methodologies, 
systems, processes, procedures 
and people);
 – the arrangement for the 
identification, assessment, 
monitoring management and 
oversight of risk with regard 
to processes and procedures;
 – the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls, compliance 
monitoring and risk 
management systems; and
 – the Group’s procedures for 
preventing and detecting money 
laundering and fraud.
A section covering the Group’s risks 
can be found on pages 24 to 27 .
 Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee is 
responsible for ensuring that the 
Board has a formal and transparent 
appointments procedure. It also has 
primary responsibility for reviewing the 
Board’s balance and effectiveness, 
identifying the Board’s skills gaps and 
those individuals who might best fill 
them. Committee policy will ensure that 
appointments are made on merit and 
with respect for the benefits of the 
Board’s diversity.
The Nominations Committee comprises 
all of the Group’s Non-Executive Directors:
 – Stephen Karle (Chairman);
 – Sir Nigel Knowles;
 – Joanne Lake;
 – Patrick Storey; and 
 – Peter Ward.
The Group recognises the importance 
of diversity both at Board level and 
throughout the whole organisation. The 
Board and the Nominations Committee 
are committed to increasing diversity 
and the Group is determined to recruit 
outstanding candidates with diverse 
backgrounds, skills, ideas and culture.
In future, the Nominations Committee will 
take responsibility for arranging formal 
Board appraisals. During this first year, 
the Board made an assessment that 
it was appropriate for the Chairman 
and Senior Non-Executive Director to 
conduct an informal internal evaluation.
The Nominations Committee meets at 
least once each year.
Disclosure Committee
The Disclosure Committee comprises:
 – Stephen Karle (Chairman);
 – Sir Nigel Knowles;
 – Joanne Lake;
 – Patrick Storey; 
 – Peter Ward; 
 – Paul Smith (Chief Executive Officer); 
and
 – Andy Thomson  
(Chief Financial Officer).
The Company is required to make 
timely and accurate disclosure of 
all information required to meet the 
legal and regulatory obligations and 
requirements arising from its listing 
on the London Stock Exchange under 
the Market Abuse Regulations. 
The Disclosure Committee exists to help 
the Company meet these requirements. 
The Committee’s responsibilities include 
determining the timely disclosure of 
material information, and assisting 
in the design, implementation and 
periodic evaluation of disclosure 
controls and procedures.
The first meeting of the Committee 
was on 21 February 2017 .
Executive Committee
The Group has established an Executive 
Committee which is chaired by the Chief 
Executive Officer and meets each week 
on which there is not a Board meeting. 
The Executive Committee is 
accountable to the Board and its 
responsibilities include the daily 
management of the Group’s affairs. 
Members of the Executive Committee 
meet regularly with the Board and 
are frequently invited to attend 
Board meetings.
The Executive Committee has three 
long-standing committees, a Credit 
Risk Committee, a Health & Safety 
Committee and a Risk & Compliance 
Executive Committee in order to assist 
its supervision of these important areas.
Governance
Morses Club PLC 36 The Directors’ Remuneration Statement 
deals with the remuneration for those 
Directors in place when the Company 
was listed on AIM in May 2016. During 
the year, a number of Directors in the 
Company resigned prior to the Company’s 
securities being listed on AIM. The 
Director’s Remuneration Report only 
discloses the individual remuneration 
of Directors who have served since the 
Company’s securities have been listed 
on AIM. The aggregate remuneration 
of the Directors who served prior to IPO, 
but subsequently resigned was £0.1m.
Remuneration and Corporate Social 
Responsibility Committee
The Board has appointed a Remuneration 
Committee (“the Committee”) which is 
chaired by Joanne Lake (Independent 
NED), and comprises Peter Ward 
(NED) and Stephen Karle (Independent 
Chairman). Dave Belmont (Company 
Secretary) also attends all meetings. 
The Committee was established as a 
direct consequence of the Company’s 
successful listing on the AIM Market 
in May 2016. 
The terms of reference for the 
Committee are available from the 
Company’s Support Centre in Birstall. 
The Committee has studied Section B 
of the Best Practice provisions annexed 
to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority and has voluntarily disclosed 
the information given below.
This Committee’s principal function is 
to determine the Company’s policy on 
executive remuneration. No Director 
plays any part in formal decisions about 
their own remuneration. The HR and 
Communications Director and Chief 
Financial Officer provide relevant 
updates on financial and general 
Company remuneration matters as 
invited individuals only. The Committee 
meets periodically when it has proposals 
to consider – generally three times a 
year. In any event, the Committee would 
meet no less than twice a year. 
The Committee’s policy aims primarily 
to attract, retain and motivate high-
calibre individuals via a competitive 
remuneration package designed to suit 
the market, taking account of regulatory 
requirements and the need to create 
an appropriate mix between fixed and 
variable rewards (both short and 
long-term) for Directors. Executives’ 
remuneration comprises basic salary, 
performance-related bonus, pension 
benefits, other benefits in kind and a 
deferred share bonus scheme granted 
pursuant to the Morses Club PLC Group. 
The Remuneration Policy is due for 
renewal at the AGM in 2017 , and the 
Committee will conduct a full review 
of the policy this year. As part of the 
Company’s preparation for listing on 
AIM in May 2016, Morses Club had 
external assistance in developing its 
approach to Directors’ remuneration.
Executive Remuneration Policy
The incentive arrangements currently 
in place include a salary, bonus, 
contributions to a defined contribution 
pension scheme and a deferred share 
bonus scheme, which together sit within 
the lower quartile of market expectations 
against other financial companies of a 
similar size. As the organisation grows, 
we expect that the remuneration policy 
will be reviewed. However, the Executive 
team and the Committee are both 
committed to prudence during the 
early period post-listing, and to deliver 
shareholder value as well as embedding 
the Company’s strategy. 
Executive remuneration was reviewed 
as a consequence of the IPO listing, 
taking account of the need to balance 
executive remuneration with that of 
the rest of the organisation. 
Our remuneration policy is underpinned 
by core principles as outlined below. 
 – Remuneration is determined within 
the Company’s risk appetite, and is 
subject to oversight and approval by 
the Remuneration Committee. 
Directors’ Remuneration Statement
The approach to 
Directors’ remuneration 
has been undertaken 
taking account of the 
regulatory environment, 
shareholder needs and 
market requirements,  
as well as individual 
team roles. 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 37
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements  – Key FCA principles, including the 
principles of Treating Customers 
Fairly apply throughout. Although 
all employees should contribute 
towards a commercial result, 
remuneration is designed to drive 
a ‘balanced scorecard’ approach, 
based on responsible lending 
principles and outstanding individual 
performance. Delivery of good 
customer outcomes is central to the 
Company’s remuneration approach. 
 – Remuneration structures will be 
developed in line with the appropriate 
regulatory environment and the 
Company’s values.
 – A blend of short-term and long-term 
incentives will support the long-term 
security of the Company and 
its employees.
 – For key roles, remuneration will take 
account of pay structures in the 
external market. Remuneration 
structures will reflect the size 
and the scope of any given role.
 – Remuneration will be driven by 
Company as well as individual 
performance, with a foundation 
of fairness and ability to pay. 
 – We will communicate policies clearly 
and in a timely manner. 
Business Context and Committee 
Decisions on Remuneration
The Company successfully listed on 
AIM in May 2016. As detailed in the 
report, key elements of the Company’s 
business strategy with regard to 
technology, acquisitions and targeted 
financial performance have been 
delivered. We have also made 
significant progress in developing 
new products and services for 
our customers.

Relationship with Our 
Majority Shareholder
As a result of the IPO on 5 May 2016, 
the shareholding of the majority 
shareholder in the Company, Perpignon 
Limited, reduced from 100% to 51%.
Perpignon Limited has entered into a 
relationship agreement which contains 
provisions to ensure that, inter alia, 
there is no interference with the 
independent operation of the Board 
and that the Company’s transactions 
with Perpignon Limited are effected  
at arm’s length and on a normal 
commercial basis. Perpignon Limited 
can, subject to applicable laws and 
regulation, appoint one Director to the 
Board for as long as it holds more than 
20% of the rights to vote at a general 
meeting of the Company. The first such 
Director appointed under this right is Mr 
Peter Ward. The Board confirms that, 
since the admission of the Company’s 
shares on to AIM, the Company has 
complied with the independence 
provisions included in the relationship 
agreement and that, so far as the 
Company is aware, Perpignon Limited 
and its associates have also complied 
with such provisions. 
Political Donations
The Group made no political donations 
during the year ended 25 February 2017 .
Going Concern 
The Directors have considered the 
appropriateness of the going concern 
basis in preparation of these financial 
statements. They are satisfied that 
the Group has sufficient resources 
to continue its operations for the 
foreseeable future. They therefore 
continue to adopt a ‘going concern’ 
approach in preparing the condensed 
financial statements. A separate 
viability statement (see page 25) is 
contained in the Strategic Report.
Disclosure of Information to the Auditor
The Directors confirm that:
 – so far as each Director is aware, 
the auditor is aware of all relevant 
audit information; and
 – the Directors have taken all 
necessary steps that they ought 
to have taken as Directors in order 
to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information, and to 
establish that the auditor is aware 
of that information.
This confirmation is given and should 
be interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Our Auditor
A resolution will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting to reappoint 
Deloitte LLP as the Group’s auditor and 
to give the Directors the authority to 
determine the auditor’s remuneration.
AGM Notice
The notice convening the Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 20th

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 41
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under the law,  
the Directors are required to prepare 
the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union and have also 
chosen to prepare the parent Company 
financial statements under IFRS as 
adopted by the EU. Under company law, 
the Directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the company and of 
the profit or loss of the company for 
that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 – properly select and apply 
accounting policies;
 – present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner  
that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable 
information; 
 – provide additional disclosures  
when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRS are insufficient 
to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
 – make an assessment of the 
company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the 
company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud  
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
a)  The financial statements, prepared  
in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the company and the 
undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
b)  The strategic report includes a  
fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and  
the position of the company and  
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
Directors’ Responsibilities
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties  
that they face; and
c)  The annual report and financial 
statements, taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the company’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

Morses Club PLC 42 Opinion on financial statements of Morses Club PLC
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
25 February 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the 52 weeks then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
 – the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements that we have audited comprise:
 – the Consolidated Income Statement;
 – the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets;
 – the Group and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity; 
 – the Group and Parent Company Cash Flow Statements; and
 – the related notes 1 to 26.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRS as adopted by 
the European Union and, as regards the parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006.
Summary of our audit approach
Key risks The key risks that we identified in the current year were:
 – Impairment provisioning; and
 – Revenue recognition.
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £0.95m which was determined on the basis of 
7 .5% of adjusted pre-tax profit.
Pre-tax profit was adjusted for Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) costs of £2.2m, as this is a one-off cost 
and would distort the materiality level.
Scoping The Group is made up of Morses Club PLC, which is the main trading entity, and its two subsidaries, 
being Shopacheck Financial Services Limited and Shelby Finance Limited. 
All entities in the Group are within our audit scope and the audit of these entities are performed 
directly by the Group audit team.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Going concern and the Directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or 
draw attention to in relation to:
 – the Directors’ confirmation on page 25 that they have carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity;
 – the disclosures on pages 26-27 that describe those risks and explain 
how they are being managed or mitigated;
 – the Directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements about 
whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material 
uncertainties as to the Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period 
of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements; and
 – the Directors’ explanation on page 25 as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why 
they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We confirm that we have nothing material to add 
or draw attention to in respect of these matters.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the 
going concern basis of accounting and we did 
not identify any such material uncertainties. 
However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, this statement 
is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors and confirm that we are independent of the 
Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with those standards.
We confirm that we are independent of the 
Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those 
standards. We also confirm we have not 
provided any of the prohibited non-audit 
services referred to in those standards.

Financial Statements
Morses Club PLC 44 Risk description How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Key observation
Impairment provisioning 
The assessment of the Group’s 
calculation of the £34.8m provision for 
impairment losses against loans and 
receivables is complex and requires 
management to make significant 
judgements, being: the identification of 
loss events (the “Impairment Trigger”); 
the estimation of future cash flows 
used to determine the provision 
required; and the level of ‘incurred 
but not reported’ (“IBNR”) risk in 
the element of the book that has 
not reached the Impairment Trigger. 
Changes to these assumptions 
can have a material impact on the 
impairment provision. We therefore 
focus our work on assessing the 
appropriateness of these 
assumptions. 
Management’s associated accounting 
policies are detailed on pages 54-58 
with detail about judgements in 
applying accounting policies and critical 
accounting estimates on pages 57-58 
and within the Audit Committee report 
on page 35. The quantum of the 
provision is set out in note 14 to the 
financial statements. 
We first understood management’s process and key 
controls around impairment provisioning by undertaking 
a walk-through. Following identification of the key 
controls we evaluated the associated design and 
implementation of such controls. Specifically, we 
assessed the implementation of controls that the 
Group has in place to manage the risk of inappropriate 
assumptions being used within impairment provisioning.
We used internal IT specialists to test the general IT 
controls over the loan administration systems. We 
performed design and implementation testing over the 
manner in which data is extracted from these systems to 
determine impairment and completed walk-through testing 
of the models to confirm that they are working as intended.
We used data analytics to test the mechanical accuracy 
and completeness of the models on which impairments are 
calculated by using our IT specialists to test the extraction of 
source data from the lending systems and recalculating the 
provision in accordance with the approved provisioning policy.
We challenged the appropriateness of the key 
management assumptions used in the impairment 
calculations for loans and receivables including, specifically, 
the estimation of future cash flows and the identification 
of impaired accounts. This involved analysis of the Group’s 
historical cash collection experience and benchmarking the 
key assumptions to external economic and industry data.
We concluded that the 
impairment models 
were working as 
intended and our 
IT specialists’ 
work around the 
completeness 
and accuracy of 
data identified no 
significant issues.
The estimation of 
future cash flows 
within the models 
were reasonable, albeit 
with a measure of 
conservatism applied.
We found the 
assumptions relating 
to the identification 
of impaired accounts 
within the incurred 
loss models to be 
appropriate.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Risk description How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Key observation
Revenue recognition
Revenue recognition and specifically 
the application of the requirement in 
IAS 39 “Financial Instruments” (“IAS 
39”) to recognise revenue on loans 
using an effective interest rate 
method is a complex area. It requires 
management to make a judgement 
relating to the expected life of each 
loan to determine the effective 
interest rate.
Changes to these assumptions 
could significantly impact the level 
of revenue recognised in any given 
period. We therefore focus our work 
on assessing the appropriateness of 
estimated behavioural lives and the 
validity and accuracy of the deferred 
revenue balance. 
Management’s associated accounting 
policies are detailed on pages 54-58 
with detail about judgements in 
applying accounting policies and critical 
accounting estimates on pages 57-58 
and within the Audit Committee report 
on page 35.
We first understood management’s process and key 
controls around revenue recognition by undertaking a 
walk-through. Following identification of the key controls 
we evaluated the associated design and implementation 
of such controls. Specifically, we assessed the 
implementation of controls that the Group has in place 
to manage the risk of inappropriate assumptions being 
used within the effective interest rate models.
We used internal IT specialists to test the general IT 
controls over the loan administration systems. We 
performed design and implementation testing over 
the manner in which data is extracted from these 
systems to determine the effective interest rate 
and completed walk-through testing of the models 
to confirm that they are working as intended.
We tested the mechanical accuracy of the models 
which are used to determine revenue by agreeing a 
sample of model inputs back to underlying source data.
We used internal IT specialists to independently create an 
expectation of the gross loan originations and associated 
revenue to recalculate the level of deferred revenue to be 
held on the balance sheet. The effective interest rate was 
also recalculated for a sample of loans. 
We challenged management’s key assumptions, 
including the expected life of each loan, by reference 
to the Group’s historical experience, and assessed 
whether the revenue recognition policies adopted 
were in compliance with IAS 39. 
We found the models 
to be working as 
intended and our IT 
specialists’ work around 
the recalculation of the 
gross loan originations 
identified no significant 
issues. 
The underlying 
assumptions applied 
within the models, 
specifically in respect 
of the expected life 
of each loan used to 
create the product’s 
effective interest rate, 
were found to be 
reasonable. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Financial Statements
Morses Club PLC 46 Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both 
in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £0.95m.
Basis for determining materiality 7 .5% of adjusted pre-tax profit.
Rationale for the  
benchmark applied
We determined materiality using adjusted pre-tax profit as we considered  
this to be the most appropriate measure to assess the performance of the Group. 
Pre-tax profit was adjusted for Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) costs of £2.2m,  
as this is a one-off cost and would distort the materiality level.
PBT
Group materiality
£0.95m
Component materiality range

Audit Committee reporting threshold
£0.0475m
Group materiality
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £47 ,500, 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the 
Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
The Group is made up of the main trading and parent entity of Morses Club PLC and two subsidaries, being Shopacheck 
Financial Services Limited and Shelby Finance Limited. These companies account for 100% of the Group’s net assets, 100% of 
the Group’s revenue and 100% of the Group’s pre-tax profit. We performed testing over the consolidation which is prepared 
at the parent entity level only. 
All entities in the Group are within our audit scope and the audit of these entities is performed directly by the Group audit 
team. These audits are executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group 
materiality and ranged from £0.475m to £0.9m.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of 
these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures 
of directors’ remuneration have not been made.
We have nothing to 
report arising from 
these matters.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report 
is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed.
We confirm that 
we have not 
identified any such 
inconsistencies or 
misleading 
statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). We also comply with the International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and 
tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and 
systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the 
financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

1 Accounting Policies
General Information
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office 
is Kingston House, Centre 27 Business Park, Woodhead Road, Birstall, Batley, West Yorkshire, WF17 9TD.
Accounting Convention
The financial statements have been prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the 
European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU lAS Regulation. The Company 
financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS endorsed by the European Union. These financial 
statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The consolidated financial statements incorporate 
the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the period ended 25 February 2017 .
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative for the first time in the current year. The amendments 
clarify that an entity need not provide a specific disclosure required by an IFRS if the information resulting from that 
disclosure is not material, and give guidance on the bases of aggregating and disaggregating information for disclosure 
purposes. However, the amendments reiterate that an entity should consider providing additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users of financial statements to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The adoption of these amendments has not resulted in any impact on the financial performance or financial position 
of the Group.
New and Amended Standards Adopted by the Group and Company
IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative
IFRS 11 Acquisition of an Interest in a Joint Operation
IAS 16 & 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Sale of Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements
Annual Improvements to IFRS: 2012-2014 Cycle
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following standards and interpretations which have not been 
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment amendments
IFRS 9  Financial Instruments
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements amendments
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 16 Leases
IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows amendments
IAS 12 Income Taxes amendments
IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures amendments
The adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 may have a material impact on the financial assets reported by the Group. It is not 
practical to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a more detailed review is undertaken.
Implementation of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
In July 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued the final IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which  
will become mandatory for the Group as of 1 March 2018. The standard reflects the classification and measurement, 
impairment and hedge accounting phases of the IASB’s project to replace the International Accounting Standard IAS 39 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments, to be classified at amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income (OCI) or fair value through profit or loss, on the basis of the entity’s business model for managing 
financial assets and its contractual cash flow characteristics. If a financial asset meets the criteria to be measured at 
amortised cost or at fair value through OCI, it can be designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value 
option if doing so would significantly reduce or eliminate an accounting mismatch. Equity instruments that are not held for 
trading may be accounted for at fair value through OCI, with no subsequent reclassification of realised gains or losses to 
the income statement, while all other equity instruments will be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial Statements
Morses Club PLC 54 IFRS 9 classification and measurement requirements for liabilities are unchanged except that any gain or loss arising on a 
financial liability designated at fair value through profit or loss that is attributable to changes in the issuer’s own credit risk 
(own credit) is presented in OCI and not recognised in the income statement.
IFRS 9 further introduces a revised impairment model which will require entities to recognise expected credit losses based 
on unbiased forward-looking information. This replaces the existing IAS 39 incurred loss model which only recognises 
impairment if there is objective evidence that a loss is already incurred and would measure the loss at the most probable 
outcome. The IFRS 9 impairment model will be applicable to all financial assets at amortised cost, lease receivables, debt 
financial assets at fair value through OCI, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. In addition, IAS 39 requires 
the impairment to be based on the fair value loss for available for sale debt rather than estimated future cash flows.
The measurement of expected loss will involve increased complexity and judgement including estimation of probabilities 
of defaults, loss given default, a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimation of expected lives, estimation 
of exposures at default and assessing increases in credit risk.
The adoption of IFRS 9 may have a material impact on the financial assets reported by the Group as a result of the 
expected credit loss approach for impairment assessment. It is not practical to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect 
of this standard until a more detailed review is undertaken. A project team will be formed over the coming months with a 
view to determine the financial impact on the business for disclosure in the 2018 financial statements.
The implementation of all other standards is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Basis of Consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn 
up to 25 February 2017 . 
Revenue Recognition
Interest income is recognised in the income statement for all loans and receivables measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method (EIR). The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows of the loan back 
to the present value of the advance. Under IAS 39, credit charges on loan products continue to accrue at the EIR on all impaired 
capital balances throughout the life of the agreement irrespective of the terms of the loan and whether the customer is 
actually being charged arrears interest. This is referred to as the gross-up adjustment to revenue and is offset by a corresponding 
gross up adjustment to the loan loss provisioning charge to reflect the fact that this additional revenue is not collectable. 
See Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty on pages 57 to 58 for more information.
Net Loan Book
All customer receivables are initially recognised at the amount loaned to the customer. After initial recognition, the amounts 
receivable from customers are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The Directors assess on an ongoing basis whether there is objective evidence that a loan asset or group of loan assets is 
impaired and requires a deduction for impairment. A loan asset or a group of loan assets is deemed to be impaired only if 
there has been a trigger event. A trigger event is defined as when the cumulative amount of two or more contractual weekly 
payments have been missed in the previous 13 weeks. Impairment is calculated using models which use historical payment 
performance to calculate the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows from each arrears stage. Impairment is then 
calculated by estimating the future cash flows for such impaired loans, discounting the cash-flows to a present value using the 
original EIR and comparing this figure with the balance sheet carrying value. All such impairments are charged to the income 
statement. For all accounts which are not impaired, a further incurred but not reported (IBNR) provision is calculated and 
charged to the income statement based on management’s estimates of the propensity of these accounts to default from 
conditions which existed at the balance sheet date.
Key assumptions in ascertaining whether a loan asset or group of loan assets is impaired include information regarding the 
probability of any account going into default and information regarding the likely eventual loss including recoveries. These, 
and assumptions for estimating future cash flows are based upon observed historical data and updated as management 
considers appropriate to reflect current and future conditions. All assumptions are reviewed regularly to take account of 
differences between previously estimated cash flows on impaired debt and the eventual losses.
Business Combinations
Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is 
measured at fair value. At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised 
at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
 – deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes.

1 Accounting Policies continued
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of business combinations, representing any excess of fair value of the consideration given 
over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Gains on acquisition arising on the purchase of a business are recognised directly in the income statement.
Other Intangible Assets
Other intangible assets include acquisition intangibles in respect of customer relationships and agent networks as well as 
software, servers and licences. 
The fair value of customer relationships on acquisition has been estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows from 
the relationships over their estimated useful economic lives of 10 years, such estimate being based on previous experience of 
similar acquisitions. The assets will be amortised over their estimated useful lives in line with the realisation of their expected 
benefits. Due to the behavioural profile of our customers, this will naturally result in a greater amortisation charge in the early 
years with a corresponding reduction in later years.
The fair value of agent networks on acquisition is calculated based on the estimated cost of developing a similar network 
organically. The assets are amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of 10 years, such estimate being based on 
previous experience of similar acquisitions, in line with the realisation of the expected benefits arising from the customer 
relationships associated with the agent network.
Software, servers and licences are stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment. Amortisation is provided 
at the following annual rates in order to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its estimated useful life. 
Software – 20% on cost 
Servers and licences – 20% on cost
Amortisation is included within administration expenses.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each 
asset over its estimated useful life. 
Computers and PDAs – 20%-33% on cost 
Fixtures & fittings – 20% on cost 
Investment in Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain 
benefits from such entities’ activities. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the 
Company. They are de-consolidated from the date on which control ceases.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand. Bank overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the 
extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
Pension Costs and Other Post-retirement Benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the Group’s pension scheme are 
charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Going Concern
The Directors have considered the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis in preparing these 
financial statements.
The Group has prepared a three-year business plan which is a continuation of its strategy of generating growth through 
organic and acquisitive means.
In addition to standard internal governance, the Group is also monitored against key financial covenants tied in with the 
current funding facilities. These are produced and submitted on a monthly basis, with key schedules included in the monthly Board 
Papers.
The Group is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which arise as a result of the current economic environment. In 
determining that the Group is a going concern these risks, which are described in the principal risks and uncertainties section, 
have been considered by the Directors. The Directors have considered these risks in the Group’s forecasts and projections 
which highlight continued profitability for the foreseeable future.
Financial Statements
Morses Club PLC 56 After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. 
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is recognised at the 
prevailing rate at which it is expected to unwind.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than 
in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. 
In addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill. 
Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made 
on such a basis.
Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Leasehold
Costs incurred in refurbishing or fitting out leasehold properties are capitalised and depreciated over the length of the relevant 
lease. At period end, these assets had a £nil carrying value having been fully depreciated during the period.
Share-based Payments
The Company operates an equity-settled share-based compensation scheme.
The fair value of the share options granted is recognised over the vesting period to reflect the achievement of performance 
conditions over time. The charge relating to grants to employees of the Company is recognised as an expense in the profit 
and loss account.
The fair value of the share options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, is calculated using 
established option pricing models, principally Monte Carlo simulation. The probability of meeting non-market vesting 
conditions, which include profitability targets, is used to estimate the number of share options which are likely to vest.
Exceptional Items
Exceptional items are items that are unusual because of their size, nature of incidence and which the Directors consider 
should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results.
Segment Reporting
IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed 
by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Committee (“ExCo”).
All results are viewed as one segment by the CODM for the purposes of management decisions. This is because all operations 
are conducted within the UK and all material operations are of the same nature and share the same economic characteristics 
including a similar customer base and nature of products and services (ie consumer credit). As a result, the Group only has 
one reportable segment, being consumer credit.
Due to the size of Shelby Finance Limited relative to the Group, it has not been considered to be a separate cash generating 
unit (CGU) in the current period. Shelby Finance Limited is an instalment loan business and so is not integrated within the 
operation of the Company.
Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
The following areas are the critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that the Directors have made in 
applying the Group’s accounting policies:
Critical Accounting Judgements:
Business Combinations
During the period, the Company has made a series of acquisitions. Management has made judgements as to whether each 
of the acquisitions constitutes a business and therefore is required to be accounted for as a business combination in 
accordance with IFRS 3. 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 57
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the 52 week period ended 25 February 2017
continued
1 Accounting Policies continued
Goodwill
The amount of goodwill initially recognised as a result of a business combination is dependent on the allocation of the purchase 
price to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of 
the assets and liabilities is based, to a considerable extent, on management’s judgement most notably the fair value 
assigned to the acquired loan book and the acquired intangible assets.
Allocation of the purchase price affects the results of the Group as intangible assets with finite lives are amortised, whereas 
intangible assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill, are not amortised and could result in differing amortisation charges 
based on the allocation to intangible assets with finite lives and those with indefinite lives.
Revenue Recognition
Under IAS 39 interest income should be recognised on the shorter of the expected life or the contractual life of the loan. 
Under IAS 39 management has judged that interest income should be recognised over the contractual life of the loan based 
on historical loan book performance.
Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
Impairment
The Group reviews its portfolio of loans and receivables for impairment at each balance sheet date. For the purpose of 
assessing the impairment of customer loans and receivables, customers are categorised into arrears stages as this is 
considered to be the most reliable indication of payment performance. The Group makes judgements to determine  
whether there is objective evidence which indicates that there has been an adverse effect on expected future cash flows.
Once a loan is deemed to be impaired, the Group is required to estimate the quantum and timing of cash flows that will be 
recovered, which are discounted to present value based on the EIR of the loan. Receivables are impaired when the cumulative 
amount of two or more contractual weekly payments have been missed in the previous 13 weeks, since only at this point do 
the expected future cash flows from loans deteriorate significantly. Impairment is calculated using models which use historical 
payment performance to generate the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows from each arrears stage. Management 
use a combination of historical cash performance curves to estimate future cash flows. These estimations are revised annually 
and approved by management. In addition to this provision a further provision is made for receivables that have not yet 
missed two or more payments in the previous 13, but may have the propensity to become impaired in the near future.
The impairment provision is a key estimation that is calculated based on collection curves derived from a three-year average  
of actual performance.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (CGUs). 
Upon acquisition, the activities of the acquired entities are closely aligned to those of the Company and are deemed to have 
been integrated rather than remain as separate CGUs. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of 
the discounted future cash flows of the Company using a discount rate of 10% and a terminal value based on a minimum 
future growth rate of 2%.
Other Intangible Assets – Customer Lists
Customer lists have been allocated a fair value on acquisition as the relationships are an important influence on the revenue 
generating capacity of the business.
The customer lists have been valued based on the present value of expected future cash flows.
The calculation of the customer list intangible asset reflects a number of key judgements and estimates, which have a 
material effect on the carrying value of the asset. These include:
 – cash flow forecasts have been produced following acquisitions, which involves a number of judgements and estimates, 
particularly in respect of future business volumes from acquired customers, collections performance and an appropriate 
discount rate; and 
 – the customer list intangible assets are amortised in line with the realisation of their expected benefits.
The nature and inherent uncertainty relating to the above judgements and estimates means that the forecast cash flows 
may be materially different from actual cash flows. A material future reduction in forecast surplus cash flows from customer 
lists would necessitate a full impairment review and the possibility of a material impairment charge in future periods.

Diluted earnings per share calculates the effect on earnings per share assuming conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary 
shares. Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated for awards outstanding under performance related share incentive 
schemes such as the Deferred Share Plan. The number of dilutive potential ordinary shares is calculated based on the number 
of shares which would be issuable if the performance targets have been met.
On 25 February 2016, the Company cancelled 72,705,000 shares and divided the remaining into 129,500,000 1p shares. 
This transaction changed the number of ordinary shares outstanding without a corresponding change in total equity. For the 
2016 financial period, the Earnings per Share calculation has been adjusted retrospectively in accordance with IAS 33 (26), 
increasing the weighted average number of shares by 55,500,000.

Morses Club PLC 62 Allocation of goodwill to cash generating units
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (CGUs). 
Upon acquisition, the activities of the acquired entities are closely aligned to those of the Company and are deemed to have 
been integrated rather than remain as separate CGUs. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of 
the discounted future cash flows of the Company using a discount rate of 10% and a terminal value based on a minimum 
future growth rate of 2%. The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the goodwill impairment assessment. The Group 
believes that there are no reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions in the next year which would result in the 
carrying value of goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount.
The carrying value of goodwill at each period end was as follows:

Impairment –
At 25 February 2017 2,011
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. On 28 February 2015 the 
Company acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Shopacheck Financial Services Ltd (SFS) from its immediate 
parent company, Perpignon Limited.  
On 10 January 2017 the Company acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Shelby Finance Limited. As a result, 
the Company owns 100% of the ordinary share capital of the following subsidiary undertakings, which are included in 
the Group’s consolidation: 
 – Shopacheck Financial Services Limited (SFS), a Company registered in England and Wales (Company number: 07067456) 
with Registered Office, Kingston House, Centre 27 , Woodhead Road, Birstall, Batley, West Yorkshire, WF17 9TD, whose 
principal activity was the provision of consumer credit and is currently non-trading. 
 – Shelby Finance Limited, a Company registered in England and Wales (Company number: 08117620) with Registered 
Office, Kingston House, Centre 27 , Woodhead Road, Birstall, Batley, West Yorkshire, WF17 9TD, whose principal activity 
is the provision of consumer credit. 
During the prior period, SFS paid a dividend in specie of £68,599,000 to the Company which resulted in a reduction in the 
intercompany balance to £1,321,416 with a corresponding reduction in SFS’ net assets by this amount. As a result, the Company’s 
investment in SFS was reduced to its recoverable amount, which was deemed to be the revised net assets of SFS, resulting 
in an impairment of £63,500,887 .
Shopacheck Financial Services Limited and Shelby Finance Limited both qualify for an exemption to audit under the 
requirements of Section 479A of the Companies Act 2006. As such, no audit has been conducted for these companies 
in the current financial year.

The credit risk inherent in amounts receivable from customers is reviewed under impairment as per note 1 and under this 
review the credit quality of assets which are neither past due nor impaired was considered to be good. The above analysis 
of when loans are due is based upon original contractual terms which are not rescheduled rather than payment performance 
over the last 13 weeks. The carrying amount of amounts receivable from customers whose terms have been renegotiated 
that would otherwise be past due or impaired is therefore £nil (2016: £nil)

24 Financial Instruments
The Group and the Company’s principal financial instruments are amounts receivable from customers, cash, bank overdrafts 
and bank loan.
The Group and the Company’s business objectives rely on maintaining a well-spread customer base of carefully controlled 
quality by applying strong emphasis on good credit management, both through strict lending criteria at the time of 
underwriting a new credit facility and continuous monitoring of the collection process.
As at 25 February 2017 , the Company and Group’s indebtedness amounted to £10,000,000 (2016: £9,000,000). 
Currency risk
The Group has no exposure to foreign currency risk. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the Group will suffer loss in the event of a default by a customer or a bank counterparty. A default 
occurs when the customer or bank fails to honour repayments as they fall due.
(i) Amounts receivable from customers
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk on amounts receivable from customers as at 25 February 2017 is the carrying 
value of amounts receivable from customers of £61,227 ,412 (2016: £56,831,014).
Credit risk is managed using a combination of lending policy criteria, credit scoring (including behavioural scoring), policy rules, 
individual lending approval limits, central underwriting, and a home visit to make a decision on applications for credit.
The loans offered to customers are short-term, typically a contractual period of between 20 and 52 weeks, with an average 
value of approximately £500. The loans are underwritten in the customer’s home by an agent with emphasis placed on 
any previous lending experience with the customer and the agent’s assessment of the credit risk based on a completed 
application form and the home visit. Once a loan has been made, the agent visits the customer weekly to collect repayments. 
The agent is well placed to identify signs of strain on a customer’s income and can moderate lending accordingly. Equally, 
the regular contact and professional relationship that the agent has with the customer allows them to manage customers’ 
repayments effectively even when the household budget is tight. This can be in the form of taking part-payments, allowing 
missed payments or occasionally restructuring the debt in order to maximise cash collections.
Agents are primarily paid commission for what they collect and not for what they lend, so their main focus is on ensuring 
loans are affordable at the point of issue and then on collecting cash. Affordability is reassessed by the agent each time 
an existing customer is re-served. This normally takes place within 12 months of the previous loan because of the short-term 
nature of the product.
Arrears management is a combination of central letters, central telephony and field activity undertaken by field management. 
This will often involve a home visit to discuss the customer’s reasons for non-payment and to agree a suitable resolution.
(ii) Bank counterparties
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk on bank counterparties as at 25 February 2017 was £3,984,553 (2016: £3,755,291). 
Counterparty credit risk arises as a result of cash deposits placed with banks.
Counterparty credit risk is managed by the Board which ensures that the Group’s cash deposits are only made with high-
quality counterparties with the level of permitted exposure to a counterparty firmly linked to the strength of its credit rating.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will have insufficient liquid resources available to fulfil its operational plans and/or to 
meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Liquidity risk is managed by daily monitoring of expected cash flows and ensuring that the group maintains headroom on 
its committed borrowing facilities to fund growth and contractual maturities for at least the following 12 months. Funding is 
available through a £25,000,000 revolving asset based credit facility. The Group’s liquidity risk is shown in the following tables 
which measure the cumulative liquidity gap. Most of the Group’s financial assets are repayable within one year which results 
in a positive liquidity position.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s activities do not expose it to significant financial risks of changes in interest rates. There is considered to be no 
material interest rate risk in cash, trade and other receivables; trade and other payables.
Capital risk management
The Board of Directors assess the capital needs of the Group on an ongoing basis and approve all capital transactions. 
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The fair values of amounts receivable from customers, bank loans and overdrafts and other assets and liabilities are considered 
to be not materially different from their book values. Fair values which are recognised or disclosed in these financial statements 
are determined in whole or in part using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are supported by prices from 
observable current market transactions in the same instrument (ie without modification or repackaging) and based on available 
observable market data. The fair value hierarchy is derived from Level 3 inputs in accordance with IFRS 13 as the instruments are 
not traded in an active market and the fair value is therefore determined through discounting future cash flows.
The following table sets out the carrying value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the categories 
of financial instruments set out in IAS 39. Assets and liabilities outside the scope of IAS 39 are shown within non-financial 
assets/liabilities:

Morses Club PLC 80 25 Share-Based Payments
The Deferred Share Plan (DSP)
The Company introduced this share option plan on 26 April 2016. 1,002,310 share options were issued under the plan on 
admission to AIM and subsequent share options are granted to Executive Directors and senior managers on a rolling annual 
basis at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The initial awards granted to the Company’s senior management team on Admission will be subject to three performance 
conditions. The first of these conditions will be measured over a period of one year from Admission assessing the Company’s 
absolute total shareholder return (“TSR”). 25 per cent of the initial Awards will vest for 7 .5 per cent annual TSR growth, rising 
on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting for 12.6 per cent annual TSR growth, subject to the other performance conditions 
referred to below.
Notwithstanding the satisfaction of the TSR performance condition referred to above, any vesting of these initial awards 
will be subject to the satisfaction of two further performance conditions measured up to the end of the financial year ending 
February 2019 (ie the full three-year performance period). In order for these awards to vest, the Company will have to 
achieve the budgeted level of profit before tax for each of the financial years ending in February 2017 , 2018 and 2019. 
The vesting of the initial awards is also conditional on the Remuneration Committee determining that, over the period 
finishing at the end of the financial year ending in February 2019:
 – the Company’s internal and external audits and compliance training delivery have been satisfactory;
 – the Company has obtained and retained all relevant FCA authorisation for the carrying on of its business; and 
 – the participant has not been subject to any disciplinary action and their personal performance has been satisfactory.
For any subsequent annual grants, the Remuneration Committee will set any performance conditions by reference to the 
Company’s long-term strategy, which may include total shareholder return and/or financial metrics and/or key strategic goals 
to support long-term value creation. It is the Remuneration Committee’s current intention that the vesting of any Awards 
granted to the Company’s senior management team in respect of the financial years ending February 2018 and 2019 will 
at least in part be subject to the Company’s TSR performance.
Any performance condition may be amended or substituted if one or more events occur which cause the Remuneration 
Committee to consider that an amended or substituted performance condition would be more appropriate and not 
materially less difficult to satisfy.
Awards will not be granted to a participant under the DSP over Ordinary Shares with a market value (as determined by 
the Remuneration Committee) in excess of 100 per cent of salary in respect of any financial year.
As of the balance sheet date, the estimated market value of each share option granted is £1.15. No share options lapsed/
were forfeited during the year. This has resulted in a charge to the profit and loss account of £126,159 during the year.
