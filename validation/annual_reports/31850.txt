PRODUCE INVESTMENTS AT A GLANCE
Leading the way in  
the UK potato industry
The Group has operations throughout the UK in seed production, growing and 
packing and serves a number of market sectors including retail, foodservice, 
wholesale and trading. The Group is split into three segments:
1. Fresh 
Which comprises Greenvale AP, Jersey 
Royal Company Limited and Rowe 
Farming, and accounts for 77.4% of Group 
revenues. Customers include a number  
of the UK leading grocery retailers and 
wholesale and foodservice companies. 
2. Processing
Which accounts for 3.3% of Group revenues. 
Ingredients supplied are used by a large 
number of food manufacturers in products 
such as diced potato salads and mashed 
potato for fish cakes and ready meals.
3. Other
Includes the seed business, Restrain  
Company Limited and direct trading,  
and accounts for 19.3% of Group revenues. 
The seed business exports circa 25%  
of total production. The proportion of 
revenues for Restrain from overseas were 
similar to last year, being circa 70% of total.
GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY
The Produce Investments Group has a number of 
businesses located across the UK and the recent 
acquisitions of Rowe Farming in 2012 and The Jersey 
Royal Company Limited in 2014 complement and add 
strength and diversity to the Group. In addition circa 
25% of our seed revenues come from overseas, and 
sales of Restrain, our ethylene storage and ripening 
business, are growing outside the UK.

A more diverse  
customer base
GREENVALE AP
Greenvale traded successfully 
through a less stable year 
characterised by lower yielding crops 
and higher raw material prices. 
However new business wins during 
the year and continued investment in 
the new ERP system see the business 
well positioned for future growth. 
Greenvale AP (GVAP) is a unique vertically integrated 
business. This starts with our seed variety and 
development programme and also includes our 
seed potato business and our own growing potato 
operations in Perthshire, the Scottish Borders and 
the Eastern Counties, making us the biggest grower 
of fresh table potatoes in the UK. GVAP procures 
from 200 growers in the UK, most of whom we 
supply seed to, and along with the potatoes from 
our own growing operations provide our pack sites 
with the material to store, manage and pack for our 
key customer base 364 days of the year.
STRATEGY IN ACTION 04 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
A strong finish  
from a difficult start
The Group ended on a high in a year of two halves. I am pleased to report  
a strong performance in the second half of our financial year, confirming  
the effectiveness of our strategic approach and the success of the diversified  
business model we have developed in our established produce operations. 
RESULTS
As we anticipated in the interim report, the 
second half saw a much improved trading 
result as we began to recover higher raw 
material costs in our core Greenvale potato 
business, enjoyed a strong season for Jersey 
Royals and started to realise the benefits of 
our new ERP system. This has delivered a 
Group operating profit before exceptional 
items for the year of £8.4m (2016: £9.2m),  
in line with our expectations, and a profit 
before tax of £6.6m (2016: £3.5m) despite 
the increased loss before tax of £1.0m  
(2016: loss £0.2m) reported in the first half.
DIVIDEND
The Board recommends an increased final 
dividend of 5.026 pence per share (2016: 
4.88 pence). Together with the interim 
dividend of 2.44 pence per share (2016:  
2.44 pence) paid in April, this makes a total 
dividend for the year of 7.466 pence (2016: 
7.32 pence), a rise of 2.0%. Subject to the 
approval of shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM), the final dividend 
will be paid on 5 December 2017 to ordinary 
shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 3 November 2017.
BOARD CHANGES
I will be retiring at the AGM on 29 November 
2017, as will Non-Executive Director (NED) 
Sean Christie. Having served two full 
three-year terms, Senior independent  
NED Sir David Naish will also be retiring by 
rotation. Barrie Clapham will resume the 
position of Chairman on an interim basis  
as the Group commences a recruitment 
process to find a more permanent 
successor. Liz Kynoch will continue in her 
role as NED, as will Robert Johnston, the 
principal representative of the Jerry Zucker 
Revocable Trust, the largest shareholder  
in the Group, who joined the Board as NED 
on 9 June 2017. The Board will continue  
to work in a sustainable way to deliver 
incremental shareholder value over the 
longer term.
STRATEGY 
Following the restatement of the  
Company Strategy at the interims in  
March, the Board has decided to revert  
to the original strategy of growing the 
business through strategic acquisitions of 
quality businesses that offer synergies and 
product or customer diversification. At the 
same time we will continue to explore  
and fund the organic growth opportunities 
of the subsidiary companies. 
PEOPLE
On behalf of the Board, I would like  
to express sincere thanks to all our 
employees for their hard work in delivering 
these results, and for their continuing 
commitment to ensuring we provide  
our customers with products and service  
of the highest quality. Maintaining and 
improving these high standards is key  
to our future success. 
OUTLOOK
Looking to the year ahead, harvest is now 
progressing, although with the majority  
of the potato crop still in the ground, 
favourable weather is required during 
October to see the harvest safely secured. 
Assuming harvest proceeds as it should,  
an increase in the planted area will see a 
gross crop yield that will exceed demand 
and therefore deflate raw material prices.  
A solid start to the year sees trading in line 
with forecast and the new business gains, 
and new contractual arrangements with 
established customers give us much 
enhanced visibility on both volume and 
margins in our core retail potato business. 
We are achieving improved efficiencies in 
our two fresh potato processing sites,  
and anticipate further significant efficiency 
benefits from the implementation of our  Directors’ Report

REASONS TO INVEST IN PRODUCE INVESTMENTS
Produce Investments is a diverse business with a solid core at its foundation 
and continues to seek acquisition opportunities offering good returns and 
exciting growth prospects. The core business supplies fresh products 
364 days of the year, into a defensive category with high levels of 
customer penetration.
1. Improved margins
The Group continues to seek 
opportunities to add businesses that 
deliver higher margins and enhance 
profitability and shareholder returns.
2. Acquisition 
opportunities
The recent acquisitions demonstrate the 
Groups appetite and ability to complete 
and deliver on acquisitions. Management 
will continue to seek out and explore 
opportunities to further expand  
the Group through the addition of 
appropriate complimentary businesses.
3. New customers
The Group’s strategy is to continue to 
grow its sales with other key customers. 
The acquisition of both Rowe Farming 
and The Jersey Royal Company gives 
access to potential new customers.
4. Products diversification 
Our strategy is to seek opportunities that 
provide growth outside the fresh potato 
sector. This could come from processed 
products or other fresh vegetables 
where our key strengths in commercial 
and supply chain management can  
add value and deliver synergies.
new ERP system. All this allows us to feel 
confident in the Group’s ability to achieve 
good progress during the current year.
As a business predominantly growing and 
selling produce in the UK, our principal 
concern about Britain’s withdrawal from 
the EU is ensuring the continued availability 
of high quality seasonal labour. While  
we have encountered no difficulties in 
recruitment to date, and return rates of 
seasonal staff remain high, clear direction 
from the Government is required to ensure 
a Brexit agreement that maintains access 
to this essential resource. 
The Group continues to generate cash  
and we are well placed to continue our 
well-established and proven strategy  
of widening both our product range  
and customer base within our existing 
produce operations, and to exploit other 
opportunities for profitable acquisitions  
as these arise.

Directors’ Report

Overview
Strategic Report
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
Strength  
in diversity
Diversification, investment, new business gains and strengthened customer 
relationships have all helped us to overcome the significant challenges posed  
by rising raw material costs and continuing intense price competition in the  
UK retail market place.
FRESH
Our core potato business, accounting for 
circa 78% of Group revenues during the 
year (2016: circa 78%), traded successfully 
through a less stable year, characterised  
by lower crop yields, resulting in higher raw 
material costs and retail price deflation. 
Although the planted area for UK potatoes 
increased by just over 4% in the 2016 
harvest, below average yields resulted in  
a 4% reduction in the total crop to 5.22m 
tonnes (2015 harvest: 5.43m tonnes). With 
demand outstripping supply throughout 
the year, input costs remained consistently 
high. However, Kantar World panel data for 
the fresh retail potato market showed a 
decline in market value of 3.5% during the 
year, on relatively static volumes, reflecting 
the continuation of intense competition in 
the supermarket sector.
We have benefited from our strategic 
approach in this challenging market, 
securing increased volumes with a major 
retail customer for a fixed period of three 
years through the adoption of a more 
collaborative and transparent approach  
to supply chain management. This has 
delivered improved efficiencies for both 
parties. We are also pleased to announce 
that we have won a third mainstream retail 
account, again for an initial fixed period of 
three years. Sales into the non-retail sectors 
of foodservice and wholesale also showed 
good growth during the year, and the 
launch of Linwood Crops at the start of the 
year as a subsidiary trading division will 
support further growth in these sectors.
Following completion of our packing site 
rationalisation programme in 2015, we now 
operate two efficient facilities in Scotland 
and Cambridgeshire, both of which are 
very well placed for both the major UK 
potato growing areas and distribution 
channels. We have continued to drive 
productivity through investment in these 
sites, which accounted for a significant 
proportion of the Group’s operational 
capital expenditure during the year of 
£4.8m (net of Peacock farm packing facility 
acquisition) (2016: £3.7m).
We have also continued our investment in 
IT, following the successful transition in 2015 
from in-house servers to a cloud-based 
external provider, thereby reducing the risk 
of business disruption and improving our 
contingency planning and disaster recovery 
capability. The focus this year has been  
on the installation of our new ERP system 
which, as noted in the interim report, 
resulted in some additional costs during  
a longer than expected implementation 
process. The roll-out across both our UK 
packing sites has now been completed 
and we are pleased to report that it has 
bedded in well, and that the expected 
planning and process efficiencies are 
starting to be realised.
Our growing arm had a successful year, 
benefiting from higher raw material prices.

packing business also drove higher

FROM SEED TO TABLE
An illustrative timeline 10 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT (CONTINUED)
demand for seed, delivering a strong 
performance by our seed division. Our 
varietal development programme in this 
division continues apace, and we have a 
strong pipeline of new potato varieties 
coming through to market.
Our Cornish business of Rowe has had  
an average year growing, picking and 
marketing daffodils in a season that 
extends from late December to late April. 
Unfortunately rapid crop development 
resulted in an early harvest which 
compromised sales opportunities. 
Expansion of our production area has  
given us the opportunity to serve an 
extended customer base, enabling us to 
secure a number of new business wins 
during the year. In addition to daffodils, 
Rowe Farming also grows and supplies 
early potatoes from Cornwall, and made  
a successful start to the 2017 season.
Following a good and uninterrupted 
planting season, and subsequent 
favourable growing conditions, Jersey 
produced an excellent crop of new 
potatoes in 2017. Strong UK demand from 
the launch of the crop in late April into June 
ensured an equally successful sales season, 
and the performance of the business was 
further enhanced by our continued focus 
on cost control and efficiency gains.
PROCESSING
Our potato processing business has 
continued its recovery, benefiting from  
a new management structure and an 
ongoing focus on improved processes  
and efficiencies. We have invested in  
new cooking equipment and detection 
technology, extended our product  
range into the raw peel sector and  
gained new business as a result. The 
performance of the business was much 
improved in the closing months of the  
year and we are about to install a third 
production line in the factory to keep  
pace with growing demand.
OTHER
Our storage and ripening technology 
business enjoyed a better year, with 
recovery in two core markets. In addition, 
new member state chemical approvals 
within the EU have enabled Restrain to 
achieve a significant increase in its territorial 
reach within the last few months, giving 
solid grounds for optimism about its 
prospects in the year ahead.
FINANCES
The business remains cash-generative.  
An increase in net debt to £28.0m (2016: 
£18.1m) at the year end principally reflects 
our purchase during the year of a packing 
facility (land and buildings) in Jersey  
for £6.1m (cash), as well as higher stock 
valuations and increased trade receivables. 
Following the closure of Greenvale’s Kent 
packing facility in December 2015 we have 
removed all plant and machinery from the 
buildings and are confident that the sale  
of the site is now nearing completion.
PROSPECTS
The indications are that the planted  
area of potatoes in the UK has increased  
by approximately 4% for the second 
successive year. A timely planting season 
has been followed by variable growing 
conditions, and current predictions are  
for a 2017 crop that is of average yield  
and quality. If this proves to be accurate,  
it could deliver a gross yield as much as 9% 
greater than in 2016 at around 5.7m tonnes. 
This would usually indicate that we will 
have a season with more moderate raw 
material pricing compared with the 
2016/2017 season.
The diversity of our core business has 
delivered real benefits during the year 
under review. This proven model, the new 
retail business we have secured and the 
more transparent arrangements we have 
agreed with established customers, all give 
us increased confidence in our ability to 
achieve profitable growth in our established 
produce operations in the years ahead.

STRATEGIC REPORT
A year of  
two halves
The Directors present their report and financial statements of Produce Investments plc 
for the 53 weeks ended 1 July 2017. The current period was 53 weeks compared to the 
prior period of 52 weeks. References in this document to current and prior year refer to 
53 weeks (2017) and 52 weeks (2016), respectively.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The principal activity of the Company in  
the year under review was that of a holding 
company for the Produce Investment 
Group of companies, which grows, sources, 
packs and markets fresh potatoes, daffodils 
bulbs and flowers.
REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS
The Directors are content with the solid 
performance of the Group in the year to 
1 July 2017. Despite the difficult trading, 
high raw material costs and low yielding 
crop through the first half of the year, the 
Group, as forecast, recovered well and 
delivered one of its strongest six-month 
periods ever. Operating profit before 
exceptional items of £8.4m compared to 
£9.2m in the previous year, a decrease of 
9.1%. However, the second half of the year 
was significantly ahead of the same period 
last year, delivering £8.1m vs £5.8m, an 
increase of 40.7%. As reported during  
the half year results, trading in the second 
half recovered the majority of the high  
raw material costs through the pricing 
arrangements with our key customers. 
Profit before tax was £6.5m, an 88% 
increase vs the prior year (£3.9m). Profit 
before tax in the current year includes an 
exceptional charge of £1.0m announced at 
the half year. The exceptional items are the 
write off of suspense accounts identified  
by the business within legacy ERP systems 
(£0.5m), the shutting down of an animal 
feed plant at the Group’s Swancote site 
(£0.3m) and impairments arising from 
assets in the fresh business (£0.2m).
Revenue came in at £200.1m up 8.1% vs the 
prior year (2016: £185.1m), primarily on the 
back of increased selling prices driven by 
the high cost of raw material. Cost of Goods 
sold at £128.7m was up 11.8% on the back  
of the raw material cost and retailer pack 
size mix.
Working capital, viewed as Inventories, 
Biological assets, Trade receivables, and 
Trade payables has increased from £35.6m 
(2016) to £40.9m, (15%). Working capital has 
risen mainly as a result of the high priced 
raw material, however, extended customer 
terms have also contributed to this increase.
Property, plant and equipment is up  
£5.8m to £39.9m, primarily as a result  
of the Peacock Farm purchase on Jersey. 
Intangible assets are £15.6m at the year 
end; consistent with the prior year, the 
Directors have performed an impairment 
test on both Rowe Farming and Swancote 
Foods (detailed in Note 13). The Directors 
are content with the carrying values based 
on the testing performed. However, this will 
require both businesses to show some 
improvement in financial performance 
compared with the current year. 
Net debt increased to £28.0m (2016: £18.1m) 
as a result of the option exercised on 
Peacock Farm (£6.1m) and movements in 
working capital. The Group continues to 
generate cash. However operating cash 
flows in the current period were £3.4m 
(2016: £9.6m) as a result of increased 
customer terms, and the higher cost  
of inventory holding. 
Overall, most parts of the Group have 
performed well in the year. The core 
business traded successfully in a difficult 
season; it secured increased volumes and 
has delivered further efficiencies. Swancote 
has continued to recover, supported by a 
new management team and improved 
processes. Rowe had an average year, 
extending further our customer base, and 
the expanded production area has helped 
support this. Jersey had an outstanding

Identifying, assessing  
and prioritising risks
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Potential risks affecting the Group are continuously reviewed as part of our 
operational risk self-assessment process and actions to mitigate these are 
identified. The key fundamental risks are set out below:
RISK/UNCERTAINTY MITIGATION
BREXIT
 – The impact following the UK’s decision 
to leave the EU is still to be determined.
 – How the various food safety bodies  
and agencies interact over the coming 
months and years may well have an 
impact on our agricultural base.
 – Food safety, food crime and bio security 
will become increasingly important.
 – Protecting and having access  
to a flexible and internationally  
diverse workforce.
 – The Group is closely monitoring the negotiations and continues to work closely  
with the appropriate regulatory bodies and agencies to ensure all opportunities  
and challenges are equally met.
 – We believe our established links to our grower base, coupled with our reputation  
in supplying top quality traceable crop, may actually offer up opportunities in the 
post-Brexit era.
 – To date the Group has no issues as we have a high retention and return rate in our  
two seasonal businesses of Jersey and Rowe Farming. We have a long-standing  
policy of recruiting directly, offering good terms and favourable working conditions.
INTERRUPTION OR FAILURE  
OF IT SYSTEMS
 – Failure to maintain stable business 
systems in respect of both technical 
infrastructure platform and operating 
applications that serve the business 
requirements.
 – The Group has recently invested heavily and taken the decision to outsource its 
hardware infrastructure requirements in terms of hardware (servers) to an external 
third party. This includes disaster recovery contingencies and arrangements with  
the external provider that allow any possible disruption to be limited and therefore 
minimise any adverse operational impact.
 – Periodic reviews and tests are undertaken at all of our sites to ensure any manual 
operating procedures are up to date and effective to ensure the minimum amount  
of disruption should IT systems become unavailable for an unnecessary duration.
 – Robust systems with necessary and appropriate back-up procedures are in place  
at both third party provider and on-site.
 – Experienced internal and external support for hardware and external support 
available for operating systems.
CYBER CRIME
 – Failure to adequately protect the 
business from cybercrime.
 – At present, the Group’s main exposure 
to cybercrime is the misappropriation  
of data and cash.
 – Cybercrime is an ever-evolving 
landscape and it is therefore necessary 
to have multi-layers of protection and 
implement best-of-breed multi-level 
protection from world leading vendors.
 – The Group is investing in a significant IT transformation programme. 
 – Hardware has been outsourced a third party provider. In addition, the core business 
application solution Microsoft Dynamics NAV is being re-designed and upgraded 
from version 2009 to 2013 which brings additional controls and procedures  
as standard.
 – The security of the Groups IT equipment is regularly reviewed.
 – All equipment is installed with anti-virus/malware software designed to maximise 
protection.
 – All equipment is regularly updated with leading anti-virus software. 
 – All inbound emails are subjected to multi-vendor scan before being allowed into  
our network. 
 – Our cloud-based infrastructure is protected by our cloud provider’s choice  
of anti-virus software.
 – Policies and procedures are continuously reviewed and updated to cover the evolving 
landscape with appropriate communication and updates installed in real time. 15 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
Directors’ Report
Financial Statements
Overview
Strategic Report
RISK/UNCERTAINTY MITIGATION
IMPACT OF ADVERSE WEATHER
 – The Group’s operations are influenced 
by the volume and quality of the UK 
potato crop. In the event of a poor UK 
potato crop owing to adverse weather 
conditions, the Group is likely to suffer 
from an increased price for a proportion 
of its potato supplies.
 – The Group’s exposure to adverse 
weather conditions is increased due to 
its own growing operations, including 
Rowe Farming and Jersey Royal’s grown 
in Jersey.
 – The geographically diverse spread of third party procurement and the Group’s own 
growing operations, covering the main potato growing regions of the UK, reduces  
the risk to the Group of crop failure in any specific region.
 – Recent changes to the supply models with our core retail customers’ means we are 
more aligned to prevailing market conditions in any given season, thereby reduces  
the impact of crop variations on the Group’s financial performance.
 – An element of Jersey crop is supplied from third party growers which reduces the  
risk and exposure to the Group.
STAFF RECRUITMENT, 
DEVELOPMENT AND RETENTION
 – Our people are our biggest asset are  
key to the future success of the Group. 
The loss or failure to attract, develop  
and retain key individuals and staff 
would have a detrimental effect on  
the Group’s ability to operate and 
achieve its strategic objectives.
 – The Group has a rolling development programme in place to allow employees to 
improve learning and skills.
 – Individual performance reviews and assessments are routinely undertaken with  
all managers across the Group which focuses on individual development plans. 
Succession plans are in place and regularly reviewed for key management.
 – The Group also has a number of incentive schemes in place linked to performance 
criteria for both business unit and the Group which are designed to be competitive 
and help retention of key individuals.
 – Regular reviews are undertaken to benchmark ‘total benefits’ against external market 
environment to ensure these remain competitive.
DEBT FUNDING AVAILABILITY  
AND LIQUIDITY
 – The Group’s strategic objective is to 
grow the Group, which might require 
increased debt funding.
 – This could be affected by prolonged 
periods of market volatility or liquidity.
 – Regular and ongoing dialogue with existing and potential funders to ensure that 
appropriate levels of funding are available based on the current market conditions.
 – The Group seeks to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generation by its 
operations and applying cash collection targets. The Group also manages liquidity  
risk via revolving credit facilities and long-term debt.
 – For significant debts the Group will consider fixing interest rate payments using 
interest rate swaps and caps.
COMPETITION
 – The Group operates in a highly 
competitive market, particularly around 
product availability, quality and price.
 – The Group continually monitors and reviews market prices and undertakes regular 
customer reviews to ensure required service levels are being achieved.
 – Constant pipeline of innovation within the product range as well as new product 
development meetings with all customers.
 – New supply chain models with our core retail customers helps reduce the financial 
volatility of crop prices and allows for long-term planning.
 – Continue to focus and review operational efficiencies to ensure that the Group 
remains competitive in challenging market conditions.

Monitoring 
performance
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Board review performance using a number of both financial and  
non-financial key performance indicators (KPI’s). These are regularly reviewed  
as to their appropriateness, set and measured continuously in order to monitor 
performance and comparative efficiencies across the Group.
The principal financial KPI monitored by 
the Board is the Group operating profit. 
This enables the Board to monitor overall 
segment profitability. Profitability by 
segment is disclosed in the accompanying 
financial statements (Note 4). Profitability  
of the business is considered further in  
the review of the business at the start  
of the Strategic Report.
Non-financial KPI’s are principally efficiency 
related and include:
 – Volume of potatoes sold: overall total 
volumes have dropped slightly (2%). The 
change of retailer mix has contributed 
towards this; however, we are expecting 
to see a good uplift going into the 
2017/18 season as we are on board for  
a full year with the new customer base.
 – Yield %: the Group monitors the yield 
through its main fresh potato sites. 
During the year we have experienced  
a more balanced crop position and  
I am pleased to report that yields have 
increased further, up 0.9%, primarily  
on the Group’s ability in managing  
crop usage.
 – Man hours per tonne: the Group 
monitors the number of worked hours 
to pack fresh potatoes and this showed  
an adverse movement for the year,  
6.19 hours per tonne for 2017 vs 5.30 
hours per tonne, due to the last three 
months uplift in labour behind the  
full year increased volumes of two  
key customers. We expect this to 
stabilise and decrease throughout  
the coming period.

NOMINATIONS AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Composition of the Committee
The members of the Committee, all of whom are considered independent of the executive management team, are:
 – Sir David Naish (Chairman)
 – Liz Kynoch
 – Neil Davidson
Role of the Committee
The key responsibilities of the Committee are to make recommendations to the Board as to the: 
 – Board policy and elements for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Chairman;
 – individual elements of the remuneration of those Directors; and
 – grant of share-based incentives to Executive Directors and all other employees.
No Director takes part in any discussion directly concerning his own remuneration.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Company’s website at: www.produceinvestments.co.uk.
Advisers to the Committee
The Committee has appointed independent remuneration consultants, Hewitt New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Corporation)  
to advise on all aspects of senior Executive remuneration. 
The Committee also seeks advice where appropriate from the Group Human Resources Director and Company Secretary to ensure that 
the remuneration policy proposed by the Committee to the Board takes account of Company-specific factors relating to strategy and 
takes due account of pay and conditions in the Group as a whole.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Remuneration policy is based on the following broad principles set by the Committee:
 – to provide a market competitive remuneration package to attract and retain Executives of sufficient calibre;
 – to align remuneration to the business strategy;
 – to align the interests of Executive Directors with the interests of shareholders; and
 – to take account of: (i) pay and conditions throughout the Group; and (ii) established best practice as set out in institutional  
investor guidelines.
The objective of this policy is aligned with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Committee ensures that account is taken of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks when setting remuneration and is 
comfortable that remuneration packages do not raise any ESG risks by motivating irresponsible behaviour. The Committee also ensures 
that inappropriate operational and financial risk-taking is neither encouraged nor rewarded through the remuneration policies and that, 
instead, a sensible balance is struck between fixed and performance-related pay, short and long-term incentives and cash and share-
based remuneration.
Fixed vs performance-related remuneration
In order to incentivise management whilst aligning their interests with those of shareholders, a substantial proportion of the Executive 
Directors’ pay is performance-related, through an annual bonus plan (based on profit growth) and share-based long-term incentives 
(based on EPS). 
REMUNERATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors (other than the Chairman) are set by the Board. When setting these fees, due account is taken  
of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of similar companies, the time commitment of each Director and any additional responsibilities 
undertaken, such as acting as Chairman to one of the Board Committees or as Senior Independent Director. 
Currently the fee level for the Chairman is £90,000. The fee level for the Senior Independent Director, Sir David Naish is £45,000, 
comprising a base fee of £40,000 and an additional fee for Chairing the Remuneration Committee of £5,000. The fees for Liz Kynoch  
and Sean Christie are £40,000 and £45,000, respectively, with Sean Christie receiving an additional £5,000 annum for chairing the  
Audit Committee. Fees are still to be agreed with Rob Johnston and Barrie Clapham who joined the Board on 9 June 2017. 
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to receive pension entitlements or bonuses and may not participate in long-term  
incentive schemes.

Overview
Directors’ Report
ELEMENTS OF REMUNERATION
The components of the Executive Directors’ remuneration (other than the Chairman) are summarised below. 
(i) Basic salary
The salary of individual Executive Directors is reviewed with effect from 1 October each year. Account is taken of the performance  
of the individual concerned, together with any change in responsibilities that may have occurred and the rates for similar roles within  
the appropriate comparator groups.
The current salary levels are as follows:
 – Angus Armstrong £210,000
 – Jonathan Lamont £175,000
(ii) Bonus Plan
The maximum potential bonus payable to Executive Directors for the 2016/17 financial year is capped at 100% of salary. Bonuses are 
payable based on profitability of the Group. If the profit on ordinary activities before taxation shown in the Group’s audited financial 
statements ‘Profit’ is greater than the amount shown in the budget agreed at the commencement of the financial year, a proportion  
of that profit ahead of budget will be distributed to Executive Directors and other Executives through the Bonus Plan. The proportion to 
be distributed will be 20% of the excess if that excess is between £200,000 and £400,000, rising in increments of 1% for each additional 
£200,000 of the excess, up to a maximum of 30%. 
(iii) Long-term incentive arrangements
The Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is used to award share options to selected Executives to allow them to share in the success  
of the Company.
(iv) Benefits
It is Company policy to provide Executive Directors with a company car, private medical, income protection and health and life assurance. 
DIRECTORS’ SERVICE CONTRACTS, NOTICE PERIODS AND TERMINATION PAYMENTS
Executive Directors
The contract dates and notice periods for the Executive Directors are as follows:
Director Contract date Notice period from the Company Notice period from the Director

Executive Directors external appointments
Board approval is required before any external appointment can be accepted by an Executive Director. Currently neither Executive 
Director has any external appointments.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company but are appointed for an initial three-year term. Non-
Executive Directors are typically expected to serve for two three-year terms, although their appointment can be terminated either  
by them or by the Company on three month’s written notice. The Chairman’s notice period is six months. All Directors are required  
to stand for re-election by shareholders at least once every three years. The appointment dates of the Non-Executive Directors are:

27 September 2017  28 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report, the Strategic Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year. The Directors are 
required by the AIM Rules of The London Stock Exchange to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards ‘IFRS’ as adopted by the European Union ‘EU’ and have elected under company law to prepare the 
Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law).
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and performance 
of the Group. The Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to 
financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b. make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
c. for the Group financial statements state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and for the 
Company financial statements state whether applicable United Kingdom accounting standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the Company financial statements; and
d. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and the 
Company transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention  
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Produce 
Investments plc website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from the legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE  
PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 29 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
Strategic Report
Directors’ Report
Overview
Financial Statements
OPINION
We have audited the financial statements of Produce Investments plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the 53 
weeks ended 1 July 2017 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement, the 
Company balance sheet, the Company statement of changes in equity and the notes to the financial statements, including a summary  
of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial 
statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice)’.
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 1 July 2017 and  
of the Group’s profit for the period then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 – the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to SME listed entities and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
 – the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
 – the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the Group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least 
12 months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements  
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, 
including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Valuation of Biological assets (Note 5)
The Group has significant biological assets of £21.0m. The Group applies IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’ to account for these assets which requires the 
assets to be measured at their fair value less cost to sell. The valuation of these biological assets is inherently judgemental because:
 – the biological assets are growing within the ground at the balance sheet date and therefore management have to estimate the 
quantity of biological assets; and
 – the estimation of fair value less cost to sell involves judgement in determining both likely selling prices and also costs to sell.
Due to the degree of estimation and judgement involved in the valuation of biological assets, there is a significant audit risk that there 
may be a material error in the calculations provided by management.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  
TO THE MEMBERS OF PRODUCE INVESTMENTS PLC 30 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
Management provided us with an analysis of the biological assets held by the Group by business, together with their calculation of fair 
value less cost to sell. We performed audit work for each business and for each type of biological asset (being potatoes and daffodil 
bulbs) as follows:
 – Discussed the basis of the valuation with management, and compared it with the valuation performed in the prior year to identify 
any major changes in approach or input assumptions.
 – Considered the nature of the produce to ensure that we were satisfied that the asset should be recognised as a biological asset.
 – Compared the valuation methodology used with the requirements of IAS 41 and IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ to ensure that  
the valuation presented was technically compliant with these standards.
 – Compared the assumptions used to estimate the quantity of biological assets to a range of non-financial information, depending 
upon the specific nature of each business. This included planting records, harvest records (where biological assets have been 
harvested after the balance sheet date), land registers showing specific areas currently farmed by the Group and historic yields 
achieved in previous periods where relevant. 
 – Compared selling price assumptions to actual sales or purchase transactions that had taken place around or after the balance sheet 
date or, in the case of seed potatoes, by reference to similar seed potato sales in previous seasons.
 – Compared cost to sell assumptions to the actual costs incurred in the current year within the relevant business.
Given the degree of estimation, we aggregated both factual and judgemental differences that our work identified and considered these 
within the context of our overall audit.
Impairment of intangible assets (Note 13)
The Group has intangible assets of £15.6m at the balance sheet date and management have performed an impairment test on this 
balance. Impairment testing requires management to identify appropriate cash-generating units (CGUs), identify the carrying amount  
of the CGU and to determine the value in use of the CGU through performing net present value calculations.
Impairment testing involves a significant degree of judgement due to the level of estimation involved in estimating the likely future 
performance of the business. A material amount of goodwill relates to the processing CGU (also referred to as Swancote Foods) and to 
Rowe Farming. Given the performance of these businesses during the year, we identified that there was a significant audit risk that these 
CGUs might be impaired and that a material adjustment to carrying amount might be necessary.
Management provided us with an impairment test for each CGU detailed in Note 13. We performed audit work on these tests as follows:
 – Agreed the carrying amount of the CGU to underlying records at 1 July 2017.
 – Checked the arithmetical accuracy and methodology behind the calculation of the value in use of the CGU.
 – Compared the calculation of the discount rate used in the value in use calculation to a range of discount rates that we consider 
appropriate for the Group.
 – Checked the calculation of free cash flow to ensure that appropriate adjustments were made for capital expenditure and  
working capital.
 – Considered the forecasts used in the calculation of value in use, and compared them with historic results and future forecasts. We 
discussed these forecasts with management and challenged key assumptions, requesting supporting evidence where available.
Based on this work, we formed our own view as to the likelihood of future forecasts being achieved and discussed with management  
the key issues and sensitivities relating to the forecasts. We then focused on ensuring that the disclosures made in Note 13, particularly 
with regard to sensitivity, adequately described those key assumptions that might possibly change and result in impairment.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we set certain thresholds which help us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our 
audit procedures and to evaluate the effects of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. During 
planning we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judge would be material for the financial statements as a 
whole (FSM). During planning FSM was calculated as £1,800,000, which was not changed during the course of our audit. We agreed with 
the Audit Committee that we would report to them all unadjusted differences in excess of £10,000, as well as differences below those 
thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our audit scope included all components and was performed to component materiality. Our audit work therefore covered 100%  
of Group revenue, Group profit and total Group assets and liabilities. It was performed to the materiality levels set out above.

OTHER INFORMATION
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, 
other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are 
required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,  
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course  
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 16, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in  
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 53 WEEKS ENDED 1 JULY 2017
1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Produce Investments plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’) is a leading operator in the fresh potato and daffodil 
sectors. The Group has vertically integrated activities covering seed and bulb development, seed and bulb production, farming, 
processing/packing and supply of produce to the major retailers. The Company’s subsidiaries are listed in Note 27.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. Its registered office is Floods Ferry Road, Doddington, 
March, Cambridgeshire, PE15 OUW.
The financial year represents 53 weeks to 1 July 2017 (prior year 52 weeks to 25 June 2016).
2 BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the period ended 1 July 2017 and applied  
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the 
financial statements for the period. 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and 
biological assets, which have both been measured at fair value in line with applicable accounting standards. The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in British pounds sterling (£) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£´000) except when 
otherwise indicated.
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future and accordingly have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Further 
information regarding the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the 
financial statements on pages 32 to 65. In addition, the notes to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities  
and exposures to credit, market and liquidity risk. Cash balances and borrowings are included in Notes 14 and 17. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at 1 July 2017. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be 
consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting 
period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. All material intra-Group balances, income and expenses, unrealised 
gains and losses and dividends resulting from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in full. A change in the ownership interest of a 
subsidiary, without a change of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. Losses are attributed to the non-controlling interest 
even if that results in a deficit balance. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
 – Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary.
 – Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest.
 – Derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded in equity.
 – Recognises the fair value of the consideration received.
 – Recognises the fair value of any investment retained.
 – Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss.
 – Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss.
 
Changes in accounting estimates and disclosures
The Group has adopted all IFRS and IFRIC interpretations effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2017. 
 
Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed below:
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment (amendments)
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 16 Leases
IAS 7 Statement of cash flows
The Group is currently investigating the impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16. The Group expects that there will be no material impact on the 
consolidated financial statements resulting from the implementation of any of the other above standards. 38 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)
Key sources of estimation uncertainty and key judgements
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year are the valuation of biological assets, the measurement and impairment of intangible assets 
and the measurement of defined benefit pension obligations. 
The measurement of biological assets requires assumptions regarding expected yields of crops, percentage of crop that are saleable, and 
the expected market value at the date of harvest. Biological assets at the reporting date were valued at £21.0m (2016: £19.8m) (see Note 5 
for further disclosure). 
The Group reviews whether intangible assets are impaired on an annual basis, and this requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash-generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated. This involves estimation of future cash flows and choosing a suitable 
discount rate. Intangible assets at the reporting date had a net book value of £15.6m (2016: £16.1m) (see Note 13 for further disclosure). 
Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of future changes in salaries and inflation, as well as mortality 
rates, the expected return on assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate. Defined benefit pension obligations at the reporting 
date were valued at £9.0m (2016: £7.3m) (see Note 21 for further disclosure). 
Summary of significant accounting policies
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary  
is the fair values, at the date of acquisition, of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Group.  
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. 
Acquisition-related costs incurred are expensed. For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest  
in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees’ identifiable net assets.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation 
in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. If the business 
combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is 
remeasured to fair value as at the acquisition date through the income statement.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in  
the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity in the acquiree, over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary 
acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated 
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of  
the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the 
portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Investments in associates
The Group’s non-controlling investments in other entities are accounted for on one of two bases, depending on the conditions relevant  
to each investment.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence. Where such conditions exist, the entity is accounted for using the 
equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus 
post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying 
amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. The income statement reflects the share  
of the results of operations of the associate. Where there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Group 
recognises its share of any changes and discloses this, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and  
losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.
The share of profit of associates is shown on the face of the income statement. This is the profit attributable to equity holders of the 
associate and therefore is profit after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associates. 39 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
Strategic Report
Directors’ Report
Overview
Financial Statements
Where the Group does not exert significant influence on an entity in which the Group holds a non-controlling investment, this investment 
is accounted for at fair value, less provisions for any impairment as discussed below.
After application of either the equity or cost method in line with the circumstances described above, the Group determines at each 
reporting date whether there is any evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the 
amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the 
impaired amount in the income statement.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates and sales taxes (e.g. Value 
Added Tax) or duty. The Group assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal 
or agent. The Group has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its revenue arrangements. The following specific recognition 
criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer. 
Usually the risks and rewards of ownership transfer on despatch of the goods, however, for some customers, the risks and rewards of 
ownership pass to the buyer when the goods arrive with the buyer. Revenue from the sale of potatoes, daffodil flowers and bulbs to 
retailers and processors, is recognised on despatch. Revenue from the sale of seed potatoes is recognised on confirmed delivery. Given 
that goods are principally fresh food products that arrive with the buyer within hours of despatch, the date of despatch and the date of 
arrival are typically the same. 
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease terms. Rentals paid in advance are 
recognised as deferred revenue. 
Biological assets and agricultural produce
The Group’s operations include activities which are agricultural in nature and are subject to the recognition, measurement and disclosure 
requirements of IAS 41 Agriculture. The Group has identified its potato and daffodil bulb crops in the ground as biological assets. These 
assets are measured on initial recognition and at the end of each reporting period at fair value less cost to sell. Gains or losses arising on 
initial recognition of both biological assets and agricultural produce and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in the 
income statement in the period in which they arise. 
Taxes
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from  
or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted, by the reporting date. Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and not in the income statement. 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, except:
 – Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not  
a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
 – In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences  
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
 – Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences, including the carry forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:
 – Where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit or loss; and
 – In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, 
deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable 
future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 40 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Taxes (continued)
Deferred tax (continued)
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are 
reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the 
deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year 
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at 
the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items 
are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Deferred tax assets 
and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities 
and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund. From 
31 October 2007 the defined benefit plan ceased to accrue benefits going forward and accordingly there are no current service costs.  
The Group will continue to fund the scheme to ensure that it can meet its obligations. The cost of providing benefits under the defined 
benefit plan is determined using the Projected Unit Credit method, calculated by an independent actuary every three years, and updated 
on an annual basis. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity and included as part of other comprehensive income.
The past service costs are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. If the 
benefits have already vested, immediately following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, past service costs are recognised.
The defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less past service costs and actuarial 
gains and losses not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled. Plan assets are not 
available to the creditors of the Group, nor can they be paid directly to the Group. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated 
in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension 
liability. Asset fair values are based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities it is the published bid price. The value 
of any defined benefit asset recognised is restricted to the sum of any past service costs and actuarial gains and losses not yet recognised 
and the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to 
the plan.
In addition to the defined benefit plan, the Group operates a stakeholder scheme and a personal pension plan. These are both defined 
contribution schemes. Contributions payable into these schemes during the period are charged to the income statement as they fall due. 
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in 
the statement of financial position.
Share-based payment transactions
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date which they are granted and 
is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to 
the award. Fair value is determined using either a Monte Carlo pricing model or Black Scholes option pricing model, depending on the 
nature of the share option.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance criteria 
are satisfied.
At each reporting date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described 
above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in profit or loss, with a corresponding entry 
in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the 
cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised 
over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair 
value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is 
recognised if this difference is negative. 41 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
Strategic Report
Directors’ Report
Overview
Financial Statements
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any cost not yet recognised  
in profit or loss for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation  
or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in profit or loss.
Financial assets 
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, 
held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, 
as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a timeframe established by regulation or convention in the 
marketplace are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
The Group’s financial assets include cash and short-term deposits and trade and other receivables.
Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings  
or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its 
financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, 
net of directly attributable transaction costs. The financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, accruals, bank overdrafts, loans and borrowings and derivative  
financial instruments.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and 
the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
From time to time the Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate risk. These derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value at the 
end of each reporting period. These instruments have been designated as ‘financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss’. Accordingly, assets and liabilities arising from these derivative financial instruments are carried in the Statement of Financial Position 
at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement. The Group has not designated any derivatives for hedge accounting. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and/or accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such 
cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the 
recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, the Group 
recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation, respectively. Likewise, when a major inspection is 
performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are 
satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. The present value of the expected 
cost for the decommissioning of the asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a 
provision are met. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
 – Buildings   4 to 50 years
 – Plant and equipment  5 to 15 years 
 – Fixtures and fittings  2 to 10 years 
 – Land is not depreciated.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no  
future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement when the  
asset is derecognised. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial year end and 
adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
The asset held for resale is held at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The carrying value currently reflects the 
expected net realisable value and is reviewed as required.  42 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date: 
whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use  
the asset. 
Group as a lessee
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are 
capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate  
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in the income statement. Leased assets are depreciated 
over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease 
term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term. Operating lease payments are 
recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised 
over the lease term on the same bases as rental income. 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are 
not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the income statement in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of 
intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. All intangible assets of the Group, other than goodwill, are assessed as having 
finite lives.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication 
of impairment. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least  
at each financial year end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes  
in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised within administrative and other 
operating expenses in the income statement.
Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditures on an individual project are recognised as an intangible asset when 
the Group can demonstrate:
 – The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.
 – Its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset.
 – How the asset will generate future economic benefits.
 – The availability of resources to complete the asset. 
 – The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development.
Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. Such assets are amortised straight line 
over five years, being the period of expected future benefit. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually. 
Customer relationships
The customer lists for Swancote Foods are amortised on a straight line basis over a useful economic life of 15 years.
Patents and licences
Patents are the accumulated costs of applying for patents in the UK. An amortisation period of three years (straight line) is used as a 
conservative estimate of the length of effectiveness of the patent. 43 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

Overview
Financial Statements
Impairment of non-financial assets including goodwill
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when 
annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual 
asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where 
the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair 
value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used. 
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the 
function of the impaired asset.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s 
recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does 
not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed in future periods.
Foreign currency translation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in British pounds, which is also the parent company’s functional currency. 
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are 
measured using that functional currency. 
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group entities at their respective functional currency rates prevailing at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency spot 
rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. All differences are taken to the income statement. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the 
dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates 
at the date when the fair value is determined.
Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and 
conditions are accounted for as follows:
 – Raw materials – purchase cost on a first-in, first-out basis.
 – Finished goods and work in progress – cost of direct materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on 
normal operating capacity but excluding borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated 
costs necessary to make the sale.
Agricultural produce is recognised at fair value less costs to sell at the date of harvest. Once harvested, these goods are subsequently 
accounted for under IAS2 in the same manner as other inventories purchased from third parties.
Cash and short-term deposits
Cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with 
an original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the consolidated statement cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist 
of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, 
the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any 
provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement. 
Exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement those material items of income and expense which, 
because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders  
to understand better the elements of financial performance in that year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to better 
assess trends in financial performance. 44 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

3 INVESTMENTS 
The Group has non-controlling investments in five companies which are classified as associates or other investments and listed below. 
Organic Potato Growers (Scotland) Limited – Associate
The Group has a 33.3% interest in Organic Potato Growers (Scotland) Limited, a company incorporated in Scotland which is involved in 
the growing of potatoes. 
Organic Potato Growers (Scotland) Limited is a private entity that is not listed on any public exchange. Organic Potato Growers (Scotland) 
Limited reports its financial performance with a year end of 31 May. The following table illustrates summarised unaudited financial 
information of the Group’s investment in Organic Potato Growers (Scotland) Limited:

A dividend of £nil was received in the year (2016: £nil).
BROP – Investment 
The Group has a 30% interest in BROP, a company incorporated in the Czech Republic which is involved in the growing and selling of 
potatoes. BROP is a private entity that is not listed on any public exchange. The Group does not exert significant influence over this entity 
and therefore does not regard it as an associate. The Group has reached this conclusion because there is no Group involvement in BROP’s 
day-to-day trading and management, no participation in everyday decisions, no exchanges of personnel between the entities and no 
essential technical information exchanged between the entities.
The Group accounts for its interest in BROP at fair value of £65,000 (2016: £21,000).
Kernow Grain Ltd – Investment
The Group has an investment, valued at fair value of £57,000 (2016: £57,000) in Kernow Grain Ltd as part of the acquisition of Rowe Farming 
Ltd. Kernow Grain Ltd is a cooperative of farmers who are required to invest a figure based on their level of activity in the company. 
ABG Biofumigants Limited – Investment 
During 2016 the Group established a three-way joint venture in ABG Biofumigants Limited and therefore holds 33.3%. The business is  
currently dormant.
The Little Spud Company Limited – Investment
During 2017 this entity was incorporated. The Group controls 25% of this newly established enterprise. The business was incorporated  
on 4 April 2017 and will trade potatoes.
4 OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION
Management have determined the operating segments based on the reports utilised by the Directors for making strategic decisions. 
These are split as follows:
 – Fresh
 – Processing
 – Other
Fresh includes the sites, staff, and assets that grow, source, pack and deliver fresh produce to customers, ranging from large retailers and 
wholesalers to small private businesses. This covers potatoes, daffodils and bulbs.
Processing includes the staff and assets that supply pre-prepared potato products which are ultimately sold as ingredients for  
food manufacturers. 45 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

Overview
Financial Statements
Other includes all remaining activities of the Group. This comprises of the Greenvale AP Limited potato seed business, Greenvale AP 
Limited potato trading, where Greenvale acts as an intermediary between the farmer and the end customer, Restrain Company Limited 
(an ethylene storage and ripening business) and Linwood Crops Limited (a potato trading business).
Management monitors the operating results of each business location separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource 
allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss and is measured 
consistently with operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. However, Group financing costs and income taxes  
are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not segmented for management 
information purposes. Assets and liabilities are discussed further below.
Inventory, receivables and payables are managed centrally and balances cannot be easily apportioned between separate segments. 
Consequently, no segmental analysis of these items is presented.

(2016: £144,437,000).
The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The 
revenues and operating profit per reportable segment agree in aggregate to the consolidated totals per the financial statements. 
Segmentation of assets and liabilities
Investments in associates and other investments (Note 3) are not segmented. Such items are managed at Board level and are not integral 
or specifically linked to the operations of any of the Group segments. 
Other non-current financial liabilities all relate to the Fresh segment. 
No segmentation is presented in respect of receivables, payables, financing, loans and cash. The Group Financial Control team manages 
these items independently from the operating segments. The centralised structure of the finance records does not permit an accurate 
allocation of receivables and payables between segments. 46 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

4 OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
Segmentation of assets and liabilities (continued)
The asset held for resale is the former trading location of Kent Potato Company Limited. As it is not currently being used for trading 
purposes it is not included within the segmental split of property, plant and equipment (see below).
Taxation matters are managed by the Group Financial Control team and are not segmented.
Inventories and biological assets are managed centrally by the Group procurement team. Inventories are usually stored at a Group location 
most appropriate for the supplier to deliver the goods to, usually the closest geographical location to the supplier. The inventories are then 
used in the delivery of goods and services to all segments within the Group. 
The Group Financial Control team coordinates prepayments, accruals and provisions and these are not segmented. 
All deferred revenue relates to the ‘Other’ segment.

During the year the Directors reviewed the segmental analysis of intangible assets. The Directors identified that certain intangible assets 
carried as ‘Processing’ assets, were actually being supported by ‘Fresh’ segment customers. This has been the case since the acquisition  
of Swancote Foods processing business. Given the challenges faced by Swancote Foods over the past two years and the importance of 
identifying any impairment risks (see Note 13), the Directors reviewed the intangible assets acquired with Swancote Foods and allocated 
them between Processing and Fresh, in line with the benefits that were expected to accrue from that acquisition. Consequently, the 
Directors have reallocated £4,992,000 from Processing to Fresh, representing the goodwill that was considered to be covered by Fresh 
business opportunities arising from the acquisition of Swancote Foods. This reallocation has been made in both the current and the prior 
year segment split.

5 BIOLOGICAL ASSETS
2017 
£’000
2016 
£’000
Opening value of biological assets 19,792 19,379
Biological assets acquired – 780
Harvested potatoes transferred to inventories (13,857) (19,852)
Harvested daffodil bulbs transferred to inventories (1,078) (350)
Changes in fair value 116 760
Growing costs invested in the crop 16,033 19,075
Closing value of biological assets 21,006 19,792
The fair values above are attributable to consumable biological assets, where the Group has ownership of such assets at the reporting 
date. The fair values have been calculated as the present value of the net cashflows expected to be generated by harvested produce at 
the reporting date. The key assumptions used in determining the fair value have been as follows:
 – Future costs of growing are based on forecast amounts.
 – Selling prices for potatoes are based on management’s estimate of the year’s harvest prices.
 – Ware yields between 5-23 tonnes per acre, depending on variety.
 – Seed yields between 7-22 tonnes per acre, depending on variety.
 – Daffodil bulb yields 6-20 tonnes per acre.
Certain biological assets are consumed and replanted as part of the Group’s farming strategy (seed potatoes and daffodil bulbs). The 
determination of the selling price for these assets involves more estimation, but the Directors are satisfied that suitable active market 
prices are used in their valuation.
The biological assets represent the following:
 – Crops of partially grown potato plants at each reporting date (£9.5m).
 – Bulb stocks which may remain in the ground for between one and eight years, from which daffodils will grow at certain times of the 
year, which will be dormant for the rest of the year (£11.5m).
Potato crops are usually planted between January and May each year, depending on the geography, variety and weather. Harvesting 
normally occurs between April and October. The Group plants between 4,500 and 7,500 acres with potato seed every growing season, 
with an expected yield of 60,000-100,000 tonnes of potatoes at harvest. This ‘own grown’ harvest of potatoes supplements the external 
purchases required to meet the demands of the Group’s customers. Financial risk is therefore restricted to the actual costs invested in the 
crop, and this is monitored regularly to ensure that there are no exposures in the asset base of the Group.
The Group has in the ground between 2,000 and 2,500 acres of bulb stocks, of which 150 to 350 acres are harvested and replanted each 
year. These biological assets provide daffodils for sale, bulbs for replanting and bulbs for sale. Financial risk is consistent with potato crops 
(see above). Given that 1,650-1,850 acres are ordinarily expected to remain in the ground for greater than one year, the value of bulbs 
which are not current assets is estimated to be £8.5m-£10.5m.
The fair value, less costs to sell, of produce harvested from biological assets during the period was £13,857,000 (2016: £19,852,000).
There are no restrictions on title of the crops growing in the ground. However, as part of HSBC Bank’s overall charge on the assets of the 
business, the bank reserves the right to place a charge on all inventory of the Group, including biological assets, in the event that such 
security is required.
The Group had commitments at the reporting date of £1,500,000 (2016: £1,300,000) in respect of developing or acquiring biological 
assets. This represents land rents and planting costs payable during the remainder of the growing cycle. 48 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

Assets used as security
Land and buildings with a carrying amount of £18.9m (2016: £12.2m) are subject to a first charge to secure two of the Group’s bank loans 
(Note 14).
Assets held for sale
Shown separately in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is £1.25m in respect of the site in Kent that is held for sale. The Group 
expect to complete on the sale of the site within a year of the period end. 
The Group has options to purchase the entire share capital of three companies that all hold property in Jersey at a combined option price 
of £6.0m. These options were acquired for £3 in total at the time of the acquisition of the The Jersey Royal Company Limited and all expire 
in May 2019. The Directors consider the fair value of these options to be £nil (2016: £nil). 53 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

The carrying amount of goodwill includes amounts attributable to the following;
 – the acquisition of Swancote Foods (£0.6m) completed in July 2007 (Processing segment);
 – customer access and processing synergies (‘Synergies’) arising in the Fresh segment resulting from the Swancote Foods acquisition 
(£5.0m, Fresh segment);
 – the acquisition of Rowe Farming (£6.4m) completed in October 2012 (Fresh segment); and
 – the acquisition of The Jersey Royal Company (£0.9m) completed in May 2014 (Fresh segment). 
The carrying amount of customer relationships (£2.6m) is attributable solely to the acquisition of Swancote Foods and relates to the 
customers acquired with that business. This is attributable entirely to the Processing segment.
The Group tests goodwill and the value of customer relationships for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently where impairment 
indicators exist, by comparing the carrying value of the cash-generating unit (CGU) with its value in use. Value in use is estimated based on 
future cash flow discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money. An impairment charge arises where the carrying value exceeds the value in use. 
The inputs into cash flow forecasts are based on the most recent budgets/forecasts approved and reviewed by the Directors for the 
following year and extended forward for the next four years based on expected growth within that CGU over that period. At the end  
of year five, a terminal value is calculated using a long-term growth assumption of 2%. 
The key inputs to the cash flow forecasts are:
 – forecasted changes in volumes (by consideration of future sales plans and production capacity); 
 – revenues (by management’s growth estimates of revenue to existing and new customers based on an understanding of the needs  
of those customers obtained through working relationships);
 – cost of sales and direct costs (by assessing efficiency of processes and underlying anticipated purchase prices);
 – future anticipated capital expenditure; and
 – movements in working capital.  54 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
13 INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)
Based upon the impairment tests performed, the Directors have concluded that there is no material impairment across any of the 
Group’s goodwill or intangible assets. The key assumptions for each CGU, for which the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets 
allocated is significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets of the Group, are as follows:
CGU
Swancote 
Foods Synergies
Rowe 
Farming
Segment Processing Fresh Fresh
Carrying amount £6.3m £5.0m £26.0m
Value in use £7.3m £8.8m £28.2m
Key assumptions
2018 forecast EBIT £0.47m £0.67m £1.93m
EBIT growth – 2019 to 2022 10% 0% 5%
Pre-tax discount rate 9.5% 9.5% 9.5%
Comments in respect of each CGU and the key assumptions adopted are as follows:
Swancote Foods
Since the contamination incident at Swancote Foods in May 2015 and the disruption to that business, the Directors continue to carefully 
monitor the Swancote recovery plan. The key issue for this facility is securing additional volume to take the facility back to and beyond 
the production volumes achieved prior to the contamination issue. The Directors continue to believe that this remains achievable.
Comments relative to the key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are as follows:
 – 2018 forecast EBIT of £470,000 is based on the latest forecasts prepared. This is higher than in the past two years, when Swancote has 
been loss-making. The Directors are confident that this improved EBIT will be achieved due to a new customer that is expected to 
deliver a further 5,000T of processing and thus increase overall production to approximately 18,000T. At the date of approval of the 
annual report, the contract with this new customer is not yet signed but the Directors confirm that they expected this to be finalised 
during the remainder of 2017.
 – EBIT growth of 10% from 2019 through to 2022 is expected to result from increased production volumes, primarily to existing 
customers, through broader product offering.
Synergies
The Fresh business has benefited from the original Swancote acquisition through access to original Swancote customers and the 
processing of outsized potatoes. The revenue and savings from this original acquisition continue to be enjoyed by the Fresh business.  
The key assumptions, in the value in use calculation, reflect past experience and remain consistent with those used in previous periods.
Rowe Farming Limited
Rowe Farming Limited’s business has enjoyed significant growth of its capacity, sales volumes and asset base over the past three years 
against a backdrop of stagnant sales prices and margins in a number of markets. The Directors and management have reviewed the 
customer base and sales strategies on a customer by customer basis and identified a number of areas of development for the business  
in the short and medium term. 
Comments relative to the key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are as follows:
 – 2018 forecast EBIT of £1.93m is based on the latest forecasts prepared and is significantly higher than the EBIT achieved in 2017. 
However, this level of EBIT is at a level consistent and also below other years since acquisition. The Directors are confident that the 
increase in EBIT will be achieved through achievable increases in price, through pursuing new retail customers, and also due to 
adverse trading issues experienced in 2017 not being expected to recur.
 – EBIT growth of 5% from 2019 through to 2022 is expected to be driven through increasing sales penetration into retail, and a shift 
away from wholesale.
Discount rate – all CGUs
The discount rate of 9.5% has been determined based upon calculating the weighted average cost of capital for the Group with reference 
to comparable companies operating within the sector. 55 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

Sensitivity analysis
As part of their overall review, the Directors have determined that there is a reasonably possible change in a key assumption that could 
give rise to an impairment for both Swancote Foods and Rowe Farming. The extent to which the value in use as calculated exceeds 
carrying amount is disclosed in the table above, together with the key assumptions. 
The following table sets out each key assumption and the extent to which it would need to change (in isolation) to result in value in use 
equalling carrying amount for the Swancote Foods and Rowe Farming CGUs.
Key assumptions where a reasonably possible change could result in impairment:

Key assumption that 
would result in value in use 
equalling carrying amount
Swancote Foods
2018 forecast EBIT £0.47m £0.41m
EBIT growth – 2019 to 2022 10% 6%
Pre-tax discount rate 9.5% 10.7%
Rowe Farming Limited
2018 forecast EBIT £1.93m £1.78m
EBIT growth – 2019 to 2022 5% 0.5%
Pre-tax discount rate 9.5% 10.2%
In performing this sensitivity analysis, the Directors note the relatively small headroom within the impairment tests and the reality that 
key assumptions need only change slightly to result in carrying amount equalling value in use.
14 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
The Group from time to time uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on interest-bearing loans and borrowings, which mean 
the Group pays a fixed interest rate rather than being subject to fluctuations in the variable rate. The Group has not designated these 
derivatives as cash flow hedges. These are aged in line with the maturity of the loans against which they were taken out. Consequently 
such derivatives are treated as current in these financial statements.

21 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
The Group operates a defined contribution stakeholder scheme and personal pension plan for various employees, the assets of which are 
held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. Contributions to these defined contribution pension plans 
for the period amounted to £397,000 (2016: £475,000).
The Group also operates a Defined Benefits Scheme, the Greenvale Produce Pension Plan. The benefits provided by the Plan are final 
salary-defined benefits with the contributions paid by the Group on a balance of cost basis. The plan is run by the Trustees of the Plan 
who ensure that the Plan is run in accordance with the Trust Deed & Rules of the Plan and complies with legislation. The Trustees are 
required by law to fund the Plan on prudent funding assumptions under the Trust Deed & Rules of the Plan. The contributions payable  
by the Group to fund the Plan are set by Trustees after consulting the Group. The assets of the Plan are invested in managed funds with 
Legal & General Investment Management. The Plan closed for all accrual on 31 October 2007. 
The Trustees use the defined accrued benefits method for determining funding. This method is suitable for funding a scheme that is 
closed for future accrual. During the period ended 1 July 2017, the Group paid contributions at a rate of £46,000 per month, a total of 
£552,000 (2016: £552,000). This rate is subject to review on completion of the actuarial valuation currently being undertaken for the 
scheme as at 1 July 2016. In addition, the Group pays all of the costs of administering the Plan and any levies required by the Pensions 
Protection Fund and the Pensions Regulator.
The following list is not exhaustive but covers the main risks for the Plan. Some of the risks can be reduced by adjusting the funding 
strategy with the help of the Trustees, for example: investment matching risk. Other risks cannot easily be removed, for example: longevity 
risk, and the Group must be aware of these risks and ask the Trustees to monitor them closely. 
Investment Return Risk: if the assets under perform returns assumed in setting funding targets, then additional contributions may  
be required. 
Investment Matching Risk: the Plan invests primarily in equity type assets. If equity type assets fall in value significantly, additional 
contributions may be required.
Longevity Risk: if future improvements in mortality exceed the assumptions made then additional contributions may be required.
Legislative Risk: Government may introduce overriding legislation which leads to an increase in the value of Plan benefits.
Solvency Risk: as the funding target is not a solvency target, the assets of the Plan may not be sufficient to provide all members with  
the full value of their benefits on a Plan wind up.

The mortality assumptions for 2017 follow the standard table known as S2NXA with CMI_2016 projection model with a long-term 
improvement rate of 1.25% p.a. For 2016, mortality assumptions followed the tables S1NMA (males) and S1NFA (females), projected by year 
of birth using the 2012 CMI mortality projection method with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1%. Assuming retirement at age 
65, the life expectancy in years is now as follows:
2017 2016
For a male aged 65 now 87 87
For a female aged 65 now 89 90
Sensitivity analysis:
The impact on the defined benefit obligation of changes in the significant assumptions, based on the 2013 actuarial valuation (the most 
recent valuation completed for the plan trustees prior to the current valuation work), is shown approximately below:
Assumption varied
Defined benefit 
obligation
% change
As at 1 July 2017
Discount Rate 1% p.a. lower +27%
Inflation (in payment and deferment) rate 1% p.a. higher +25%
Life expectancy one year higher +5%
The figures assume that each assumption is changed independently of the others. Therefore, the disclosures are only a guide because 
the effect of changing more than one assumption is not cumulative. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 
approximately 24 years. 61 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

22 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLANS
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) 
Since 2007 the Group has operated an HMRC-approved CSOP scheme whereby share options were granted to key personnel within  
the business. Options vest if and when the Group’s achieved profit before interest and taxation (PBIT) meets or exceeds a percentage  
of budgeted PBIT. Performance targets are split over three years. All option awards are broken into three separate and equal tranches  
to be measured against the actual results in each of the three years for which options have been granted.
The criteria for vesting options are as follows:
 – If 100% of budget is met, all options available for that year vest.
 – If, in years one and two, 80 to 100% of budget is met, that portion of the options available in that year vest, with the remaining vesting 
in the following year provided PBIT target is met in full in the following year.
 – If less than 80% of budget is met, no options vest.
 – In the final year, if 80 to 100% of target is achieved, that portion of options will vest and the remaining options will lapse.
CSOP options were granted in October 2007, May 2009 and May 2010 to various key personnel. Vesting criteria were measured against 
the results of the Group between 2008 and 2014. As of 28 June 2014, all CSOP options granted have now either vested or lapsed. As such, 
there are not currently any charges to income in respect of these options. The contractual life of each option granted is ten years. There  
is no cash settlement alternative. The scheme allows for exercising of the options not earlier than three years after the option grant date, 
and not later than ten years after the option grant date. The expected life of the options is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns 
that may occur. 
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
During the period ended 1 July 2017, options were granted to the incoming chairman as part of his remuneration package. These  
options were approved by shareholders at the AGM on 28 October 2016. The grant was for 454,545 options. The vesting of these options  
is conditional upon market conditions relating to the future share price. In the event these options vest, all options relating to this grant  
will be exercisable at an exercise price of £0.01. The contractual life of each option granted is ten years. There is no cash alternative. The 
expected life of the options is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. At the balance sheet date, these options have 
not yet vested but remain outstanding.
Senior Executive Incentive Plan (SEIP)
During the period ended 25 June 2011, share options were granted to seven senior executives on flotation of the business onto AIM. This 
was a one-off event, where vesting was conditional solely on successful flotation. A total of 828,064 options were granted, each at an 
exercise price of £0.01. The options may be exercised at any point from one year after flotation date and not later than ten years from 
flotation date. The contractual life of each option granted is ten years. There is no cash alternative. The expected life of the options is not 
necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
During the period ended 1 July 2017, share options were granted to ten senior managers. Vesting was conditional on the achievement  
of certain performance targets. A total of 747,023 options were granted at an exercise price of £1.39. The weighted average exercise price  
of options granted in the period was £1.39. Options which vest may be exercised at any point from one year after the grant and not later 
than ten years from grant date. The contractual life of each option granted is ten years. There is no cash alternative. The expected life of  
the options is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. Targets for the year, however, were not met and all options 
granted in respect of this scheme therefore lapsed. Consequently, no options remain outstanding in respect of this grant, and no charge 
has been recorded in respect of these options.
Save As You Earn (SAYE)
During the period ended 27 June 2015, the Group commenced an HMRC approved SAYE (Sharesave) scheme, which was open to all 
UK-based employees who had been in service for more than a year. Under this scheme, employees save a regular portion of their net  
pay for a period of three years. After three years, the employees are entitled to use their saved income to purchase shares at a pre-agreed 
discounted price. Alternatively, the employees can opt to have their savings returned to them as cash, along with any interest that HMRC 
may determine is payable from time to time. During the year to 27 June 2015, a total of 199,480 options were granted at an exercise price 
of £1.17. The scheme is of fixed duration, from June 2015 to June 2018, at which point the employees will have the choice to exercise their 
options, or recover their savings.
Charges in 2017
The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services rendered during the period ended 1 July 2017 is 
£280,000 (2016: £nil). All of this expense arises from equity share-based payment transactions. This is split as follows:

Valuation
The fair value of all options granted during the current period has been estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model (2016: Black 
Scholes option pricing model) taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The following table 
lists the inputs to the model used for the 53 weeks ended 1 July 2017 and 52 weeks ended 25 June 2016, respectively. 
2017 2016
Dividend yield 4.9% 5.0%
Expected share price volatility 30.7% 32.4%

Expected life of option (years) 4.0 2.0
Option strike price (£) 0.01 1.17
Share price (£) 1.49 1.29
The expected share price volatility has been derived from historic movements in the Produce Investments plc share price. The expected 
volatility reflects an assumption that historic share price volatility may be indicative of future trends. This may not reflect the actual  
future outcome.
At 1 July 2017, the weighted average remaining contractual life for outstanding options was as follows:

26 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
Financial risk associated with agricultural activities
Agricultural activities such as potato growing have inherent risk related to planting, growing and harvesting and are subject to the 
vagaries of the weather. In order to mitigate the financial risk associated with growing and harvesting potatoes, the Group continues to 
invest in developing and selecting varieties that are resistant to disease and also seeks to utilise modern harvesting equipment which is 
less susceptible to adverse weather and lifting conditions. The Group also enters into fixed price potato contracts with growers for the 
majority of its procurement. This protects the raw material cost from market fluctuation in all but the most abnormal seasons.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing the risks associated with interest rate, credit and liquidity risk. The Group has in place 
a risk management policy that seeks to minimise any adverse effect on the financial performance of the Group by continually monitoring 
the following risks:
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises as a result both its long and short-term borrowing facilities. The Group will, when it considers appropriate, 
manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of fixed interest rate swaps and caps.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates is not significant as primarily all of the Group’s operating activities 
are denominated in pounds sterling.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of its many customers. The Group has long-established policies and procedures for 
controlling customer credit risk. Credit limits are established for all customers based on internal rating criteria and are constantly 
reviewed and updated in accordance with the customer’s latest financial position.
The Group operates a debts insurance policy, covering the larger non-retail customers. No claims have been made against the policy  
in the year.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk from its customers is £32,973,000 (2016: £27,793,000) as disclosed in Note 16 – trade and 
other receivables.
The Group regularly monitors and updates its cash flow forecasts to ensure it has sufficient and appropriate funds to meet its ongoing 
operational requirements whilst maintaining adequate headroom on its facilities to ensure no breach in its banking covenants. 65 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

Capital management 
Capital is the equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to 
ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value. 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust 
the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, sell assets, return capital to shareholders or issue  
new shares.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of a gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by EBITDA. Net debt is calculated as 
total borrowings less cash. EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before any significant non-recurring items, interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation. The gearing ratio at the period end was 2.13 (2016: 1.26).

financial statements of Produce Investments plc are available from its registered office, Floods Ferry Road, Doddington, March, 
Cambridgeshire, PE15 0UW.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for diminution in value.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised 
in the financial statements. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing 
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Foreign currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the accounting 
date. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. All differences are taken to the profit 
and loss account.
Financing costs
The financing costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the 
carrying amount. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is derived from dividends from Group companies and is recognised when approved by the Board.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and/or accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost 
includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition 
criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, the Group recognises 
such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation, respectively. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed,  
its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All  
other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. The present value of the expected cost for the 
decommissioning of the asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
 – Buildings   4 to 50 years
 – Land is not depreciated
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no  
future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as  
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement when the 
asset is derecognised. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial year end and 
adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
Financial instruments
Trade, Group and other creditors (including accruals) payable within one year that do not constitute a financing transaction are initially 
measured at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost, being transaction price less any amounts settled. Where 
the arrangement with a creditor constitutes a financing transaction, the creditor is initially measured at the present value of future payments 
discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar instrument and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Share-based payments
The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date which they are granted and 
is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to 
the award. The fair value of equity options has been determined using either the Black Scholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo 
simulation model.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance criteria 
are satisfied.
At the balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period  
has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described 
above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the profit and loss account, with  
a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the 
cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised 
over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair 
value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is 
recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the 
profit and loss account for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation 
or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the profit and loss account.
3 RESULT FOR THE FINANCIAL PERIOD
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the parent company’s profit and loss account has not been included in these 
financial statements. The parent company’s profit for the financial period was £5,573,000 (2016: £1,007,000 loss). The Company was a 
holding company in both periods and did not trade. The results reflect dividend income from the subsidiary companies, offset by the 
interest costs of servicing the loans reflected on the balance sheet and the administrative costs of running the Company.
Auditor fees for the period were £30,000 (2016: £30,000). These were settled by the main trading subsidiary, Greenvale AP Limited.
The only persons providing services to the Company were the Directors. The Directors’ emoluments can be found on page 26. 70 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
