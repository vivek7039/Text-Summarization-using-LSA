Today Balfour Beatty is clearly 
focused on its chosen markets, 
winning new business on terms 
and conditions that balance 
risk and reward. Projects are 
monitored rigorously and 
regularly, with consistent 
processes and systems.
Philip Aiken AM
Chairman
Chairman’s introduction balfourbeatty.com/AR2017
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 03 Strategic Report
This is the third occasion, as Chairman 
of your Board, that I have written to 
you at the start of our Annual Report. 
When we embarked on the Build to 
Last transformation programme our 
commitment was to make Balfour Beatty 
a strong and sustainable company and 
the sector’s leading performer. 
Today Balfour Beatty is clearly focused on 
its chosen markets, winning new business 
on terms and conditions that balance 
risk and reward. Projects are monitored 
rigorously and regularly, with consistent 
processes and systems. The legacy 
contracts, which did so much damage 
to your company, are largely completed. 
This transformation has been 
achieved whilst maintaining one of the 
strongest balance sheets in the sector, 
maximising value in our Investments 
portfolio and paying a sustainable and 
progressive dividend.
It has been a long road, and we still have a 
distance to go; but returning the Group to 
industry-standard margins is now within 
sight. I am proud of the progress we have 
made so far. As we look forward with 
conﬁdence to the rest of 2018 and beyond, 
we will continue to Build to Last and 
strengthen Balfour Beatty. 
Performance
Underlying proﬁt from operations more 
than doubled to £196 million in 2017; 
with all of our earnings-based businesses 
reporting improved proﬁtability.
The Group’s cash performance was strong. 
During the year we had average net cash 
of £42 million – compared to £46 million 
average net debt in the previous year and 
reported year end net cash excluding 
non-recourse borrowings of £335 million. 
Balfour Beatty has a number of outstanding 
debt instruments: as a result of our strong 
ﬁnancial performance we were able to pay 
down some debt at the end of 2017 and 
we intend to reduce gross debt further 
in 2018.
The Investments portfolio maintained its 
Directors’ valuation at £1.2 billion, post 
disposals. The partial sale of our holding 
in the M25, London’s orbital motorway, 
demonstrates our commitment to 
maximise shareholder value, with the 
sale price considerably higher than a 
comparable market transaction from 2016.
We have continued our practice of only 
bidding for work on appropriate terms 
and for those projects best aligned to 
our capabilities. Our year end order book 
was £11.4 billion. 
Markets
In the UK, US and the Far East, 
governments are taking action to renew 
and improve essential infrastructure – 
work which Balfour Beatty is well placed 
to deliver.
Notably, in the UK we were selected to 
deliver two Lots of the new high speed 
railway (HS2) and won orders to construct 
the marine tunnels at the Hinkley Point C 
nuclear power plant. In the US, we secured 
work to reconstruct and improve the 
Southern Gateway – an 11-mile stretch 
of road in Dallas, Texas – and the 4.7-mile 
Green Line rail extension in Boston, 
Massachusetts.
The business continues to work 
constructively with industry bodies and the 
UK Government to identify and manage 
any challenges caused by the UK’s exit 
from the European Union. Whilst we have 
not seen an impact on our markets, any 
restrictions on the movement of workers 
would be likely to exacerbate the current 
shortages of skilled labour in our sector.
We continue to see opportunities for our 
Investments business to ﬁnance and 
deliver projects. In early 2018 we entered 
our ﬁrst major public-private partnership 
(P3) in the US civil infrastructure market 
for the Los Angeles World Airports 
Automated People Mover.
The Board
Barbara Moorhouse and Michael Lucki 
joined your Board in the summer of 2017.
Barbara has over 30 years of business and 
management experience in the private, 
public and regulated sectors. Michael has 
worked with construction and infrastructure 
providers for 40 years and has extensive 
knowledge of the US market.
I consider a balanced spread of disciplines, 
diversity and experience essential to the 
Board’s effectiveness and we will continue 
to take this into account when considering 
additional appointments. 
Very sadly, during the year, Steve Marshall, 
my predecessor as Chairman, passed away. 
I would like to express our condolences to 
his family and recognise the leadership he 
gave Balfour Beatty at a very challenging 
time for the Company.
Our people
The transformation of Balfour Beatty to 
date could not have been achieved without 
the energy, dedication and enthusiasm of 
our employees. On behalf of the Board 
I would like to thank all of our employees 
for their commitment once again this year. 
We are fortunate to work on some of 
the most impressive and exciting projects 
in the world and I am always delighted at 
the level of passion and pride I ﬁnd every 
time I visit a site. 
Safety is at the heart of the culture which 
the leadership team is creating at Balfour 
Beatty. Much of the work we undertake 
is inherently dangerous: taking measures 
which eradicate risk – or mitigate it where 
it cannot be completely removed – is vital 
if we are to ensure that everyone who 
comes into contact with Balfour Beatty is 
kept safe.
It is, therefore, with deep regret that I have 
to report that three people died during 2017 
whilst working on our projects, two in the 
US and one in the Far East. As a Board, we 
review each serious accident in detail and 
seek actions to prevent a reoccurrence; 
however I realise that this is of little comfort 
to the families of those who lost their 
lives and I use this letter to send formal 
condolences to the bereaved on behalf of 
the Board and everyone in our business.
Every time someone is injured, it reinforces 
why we must always strive to do more to 
make our industry safer.
Dividend
The results for 2017 demonstrate further 
progress in restoring Balfour Beatty to 
sustainable ﬁnancial strength and stability. 
As a result, your Board has felt able 
to recommend an increase in the ﬁnal 
dividend to 2.4p per share, bringing the 
total dividend for the year to 3.6p per share.
Conclusion
As we have all been reminded, contracting 
is a business that demands constant focus 
and control. Risks must be managed and 
processes and governance must be ﬁt 
for purpose and continuously applied. 
Delivering this requires quality leadership 
and a systematic approach to creating a 
culture which embeds this as our way 
of working. 
As you read this report, you will see many 
examples of how Balfour Beatty has learnt 
from the past and is embracing these 
disciplines. Today we look to the future 
with conﬁdence and excitement.
Balfour Beatty is ready for the challenges 
ahead. We Build to Last.

Today, Balfour Beatty is well 
placed to drive sustainable 
proﬁtable growth, underpinned 
by a strong balance sheet. 
Leo Quinn
Group Chief Executive
Group Chief Executive’s review balfourbeatty.com/AR2017
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 05 Strategic Report
These strong results demonstrate the 
transformation being delivered by the 
Build to Last programme. Today, Balfour 
Beatty is well placed to drive sustainable 
proﬁtable growth, underpinned by a strong 
balance sheet. It has strength and depth 
in leadership, a new, positive culture is 
being embedded and the business is well 
positioned in each of its chosen markets.
The Group reported an underlying proﬁt 
from operations (PFO) of £196 million 
(2016: £69 million) driven by material year-
on-year improvements in all earnings-based 
businesses. Both Support Services and 
US Construction reported PFO margins 
in the range of industry-standard margins. 
UK Construction continues on its positive 
trend, with a proﬁt from operations of 
£16 million (2016: £65 million loss).
The Group is on track to achieve industry-
standard margins in all of its earnings-
based businesses in the second half of 
2018 as it continues to drive three key 
levers for improved ﬁnancial performance: 
ﬁnalising the remaining historical contracts 
through to completion; reducing costs and 
raising productivity across its operations; 
and executing on the improved quality of 
the order book.
Cash remains the Group’s focus and 
ultimately the most important barometer of 
ﬁnancial performance. During the year, the 
Group had average net cash of £42 million 
(2016: £46 million net debt); at year end, 
the Group had net cash of £335 million 
(2016: £173 million). The year end ﬁgure 
includes £103 million received from the 
sale of a 12.5% stake in Connect Plus, 
the company which operates the M25 
London orbital motorway. The Directors’ 
valuation of the Investments portfolio 
has remained unchanged at £1.2 billion 
(2016: £1.2 billion), despite the Connect 
Plus M25 partial disposal, as a result of the 
continuing strong market for secondary 
infrastructure assets and the recent 
favourable changes in US tax regulations. 
The sale of a further 7.5% stake in the 
M25, for £62 million, was agreed on 
29 December 2017, although the cash 
was not received until 2018.
Balfour Beatty’s net cash position and 
the value of the Investments portfolio 
underline the ongoing strength of the 
Group’s balance sheet and place it in a 
strong position to further pay down gross 
borrowings in 2018. 
The order book decreased by 8% to 
£11.4 billion (2016: £12.4 billion), down 
3% at CER compared to prior year, and 
is directly in line with the order book at 
30 June 2017. The reduction is a result 
of the Group’s stated policy of selective 
bidding at appropriate terms for those 
projects best aligned with its capabilities. 
The business increased bid margin 
thresholds and focused on projects where 
Balfour Beatty’s capabilities can deliver 
value, coupled with a lower risk proﬁle, 
so that the Group wins work at appropriate 
terms and conditions.
Additionally, the order book does not yet 
include work won in two-stage design and 
build contracts, such as work awarded 
to Balfour Beatty’s 50:50 joint venture 
(Balfour Beatty VINCI) for two major 
civils packages, Lots N1 and N2, for 
the UK’s new high speed railway (HS2) 
valued at £2.5 billion. This type of work 
is characteristic of the strong pipeline 
of infrastructure projects in the Group’s 
chosen markets and aligns with its 
balanced attitude to risk and reward.
Consistent with the strategy to simplify 
the Group and focus on markets and 
geographies where it has a competitive 
advantage, Balfour Beatty exited the 
Middle East with the sale of its entire 
interests in Dutco Balfour Beatty and 
BK Gulf for £11 million. Both businesses 
were sold without future liabilities to 
the joint venture partner. Additionally, 
Heery International, a full-service US 
engineering and programme management, 
architecture and interior design ﬁrm, was 
sold for US$57 million, eliminating potential 
conﬂicts of interest with Balfour Beatty’s 
US Construction business.
Since the start of 2015, Balfour Beatty 
has also exited Indonesia and Australia. 
In Canada, following the imminent 
completion of the BC Children’s and BC 
Women’s hospitals in Vancouver, it now 
only holds Investments assets. 
With these moves, the Group is now able 
to maximise its strengths in its chosen 
markets in the UK & Ireland, US and 
Far East. 
Balfour Beatty is increasingly building its 
business model on a foundation of deep 
capability underpinned by risk reduction. 
This means focusing on speciﬁc markets 
with inherent growth, where Balfour Beatty 
has the right expertise to command market 
leading margins, while ensuring it deploys 
the governance and transparency to price 
contractual risk appropriately and manage 
project execution closely.

Why is it important? 
We deliver world-class buildings and infrastructure for our 
customers by constantly driving innovation. Our strongest 
differentiator is our engineering and project management 
capabilities. Having the best talent supported by the strongest 
supply chain creates a virtuous circle that ensures we win the best 
and most exciting projects to deliver. Expert is measured against 
employee satisfaction.

Why is it important? 
Customers must have conﬁdence in our ability to deliver and to 
do what we say we will do. A robust risk framework ensures that 
challenges are mitigated and projects are delivered in the right way. 
Satisﬁed customers provide us with the opportunities and projects 
for the future. Trusted is measured against customer satisfaction.

Why is it important? 
Health and safety is at the heart of everything we do – we must 
protect our employees, our supply chain partners, our customers 
and the public. Construction is an inherently dangerous business 
and without the highest standards of safety we do not have a 
licence to operate. A safe and healthy workplace is also happier, 
more motivated and more efﬁcient. Safe is measured against our 
commitment to Zero Harm.

Our priorities
Lean
The governance and processes introduced 
during Phase One of Build to Last have 
driven improved performance in all 
business segments and put Balfour Beatty 
on track to achieve industry-standard 
margins in the second half of 2018. 
The Group continues to re-engineer 
processes to drive efﬁciencies, reducing 
cost whilst maintaining or improving 
effectiveness. As a result, costs were 
reduced by a further £30 million in 2017, 
in addition to the £123 million of annualised 
cost savings delivered by Phase One 
of Build to Last.
Balfour Beatty’s UK operations continued 
to standardise systems with further 
upgrades to the Oracle R12 platform, 
including the introduction of an electronic 
payment platform for suppliers. In January 
2018, the US businesses migrated 
onto a single JD Edwards platform. 
The successful completion of these 
moves and the investment made into 
these systems in the Group’s two principal 
geographies over the last three years 
will be a signiﬁcant driver of future value, 
as beneﬁts continue to ﬂow in terms of 
reduced cost, raising productivity and 
improved transparency and assurance.
Expert
Balfour Beatty’s customers buy the 
Group’s capabilities through its expert 
people to deliver their projects. Therefore a 
priority is to recruit, train and retain the 
highest calibre of workforce. A growing 
pipeline of major infrastructure projects, 
particularly in the UK and US markets, will 
see increasing competition for skilled 
workers. The Group’s success in winning 
work on iconic and challenging engineering 
projects, such as HS2 and Hinkley Point C 
in the UK and Dallas’ Southern Gateway 
and the Los Angeles World Airports 
Automated People Mover in the US, 
demonstrates the signiﬁcant opportunities 
and unique potential for career 
development at Balfour Beatty. 
The Group metric for Expert is employee 
satisfaction. In 2017 the Group engagement 
index score was 60% (2016: 58%) in a 
period of continuing change and challenge.
Bench strength in leadership is essential to 
driving the business forward on a sustainable 
basis and to motivating high-quality 
employees. Since the beginning of 2018 
there have been further upgrades in this 
area with the promotion of three leaders. 
Balfour Beatty launched its 
Build to Last transformation 
programme in early 2015 as a 
framework to drive continuous 
improvement for all stakeholders 
against four goals – Lean, 
Expert, Trusted and Safe – 
as measured by cash ﬂow 
and proﬁt from operations, 
employee engagement, customer 
satisfaction and Zero Harm. 
Build to Last continued
 – Balfour Beatty continues to evolve 
its US organisation building on the 
standardisation and leaning out 
already delivered. At the year end 
the decision was taken to promote 
two internal candidates, to lead 
the Buildings and Civils businesses 
respectively. These appointments 
will leverage the Group’s market 
positions while maintaining the new 
contracting disciplines. 
 – In the UK, given the similar 
characteristics and requirements of key 
customers in the rail, power transmission 
and distribution and gas and water 
markets, the businesses serving 
these markets have been brought 
together under an experienced leader, 
to drive back-ofﬁce standardisation 
while maintaining a strong market, 
operational and safety focus.
In looking always to add to its depth of 
capability, Balfour Beatty was recently 
pleased to recruit over 150 valuable staff 
members following the Carillion liquidation. 
These people had worked alongside 
Balfour Beatty staff on the Aberdeen 
Western Peripheral Route (AWPR), A14 
or Manchester Smart Motorway joint 
ventures. Their signiﬁcant experience will 
bolster Balfour Beatty’s long-term capacity 
at a time of growing market demand. 
The Group has developed competency 
frameworks for key operational job families 
in the UK such as Project Management, 
Engineering and Commercial. This enables 
employees’ experience and competencies 
to be matched to contract risk and 
complexity, providing them with a clear 
career path and targeted development, 
whilst identifying recruitment priorities. 
These assessments now cover essentially 
all of the Project Management and 
Commercial workforce.
Balfour Beatty continues its sponsorship 
of The 5% Club, which encourages 
employers to provide ‘earn and learn’ 
training opportunities to address the UK’s 
skills gap and widen economic prosperity. 
During 2017 Balfour Beatty recruited 124 
apprentices, 93 graduates and 35 trainees. 
The percentage of the UK workforce in 
‘earn and learn’ positions at year end stood 
at 5.3%. Membership of The 5% Club 
now includes key clients and supply chain 
partners of Balfour Beatty all working to 
build the future capability to support the 
growing infrastructure market.
Phase One consisted of 24 months 
self-help. Rapid action was taken to remove 
management layers, upgrade leadership 
and strengthen governance within a 
simpliﬁed Group structure. In Phase Two 
(2017-2018) Balfour Beatty will return to 
industry-standard margins and in Phase 
Three deliver a Group with market-leading 
strengths and performance.
During 2017, Balfour Beatty made 
signiﬁcant progress on its four goals: balfourbeatty.com/AR2017
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 15 Strategic Report
Trusted Safe
Balfour Beatty intends that everyone who 
comes into contact with its work activities 
should not be harmed. 
Safety is actively managed and monitored 
through strong governance, a combination 
of leading and lagging performance 
indicators, training and competence and 
visible leadership working to establish a 
Zero Harm culture throughout the business.
Each week senior management report and 
consider any accident, ill health or near 
misses that have occurred and a weekly 
report, available to all employees, shares 
safety best practice as well as reporting on 
signiﬁcant incidents and learning which can 
be drawn from Balfour Beatty or elsewhere 
in the industry. Notwithstanding this, it is 
with deep regret that three people died 
during the year whilst working on the 
Group’s construction projects. 
In 2017, the indicators continued to trend 
positively, with the Group Lost Time 
Incident Rate (excluding international joint 
ventures) falling for the third successive 
year to 0.17 (2016: 0.22). 
Trusted is Balfour Beatty doing “what 
it says it will do” and is measured by 
customer satisfaction. 
During the year, 3,375 customer 
satisfaction reviews were carried out 
(2016: 2,107), primarily in the UK. 
The Group customer satisfaction average 
increased to 94% (2016: 91%). 
The governance and controls introduced 
under Build to Last, including the Gated 
Lifecycle, the Digital Briefcase and Project 
on a Page, create a disciplined, business-
like contracting framework. This provides 
management with a clear, consistent line 
of sight on all stages of work which is 
being bid and delivered, together with key 
tools for managing commercial risk and 
project execution.
The Gated Lifecycle, introduced in 2015, 
takes a project from the initial enquiry 
through to completion. The process 
reduces the risk of pursuing inappropriate 
opportunities and underbidding or 
accepting inappropriate levels of risk, 
including in respect of the cash proﬁle of 
projects. As the open debate around risk 
and reward created by the Gated Lifecycle 
becomes a perceived enabler to future 
success, so the process becomes an 
inherent driver of the Group’s culture. 
All new UK sales opportunities and projects 
are now using the Digital Briefcase, 
a secure web-based platform which 
digitises governance and document control 
through all stages of the Gated Lifecycle. 
Selected active projects were also installed 
retrospectively. The Digital Briefcase helps 
to ensure that correct procedure is being 
followed and that documentation is more 
easily accessible in the event of claims or 
other issues. In excess of 1,000 current 
or potential projects are now active on 
the system.
Over the last three years, the Group 
has derived more value-added business 
information through the use of business 
analytics. Project on a Page allows projects 
to be monitored in a timely and consistent 
manner, enabling early intervention where 
signs of adverse trends are detected, 
thus reducing risk to the business and 
strengthening customer relationships. 
The governance and controls now in place 
enable Balfour Beatty to: selectively bid 
business to match capability; assess and 
price risk appropriately; track (and thus 
intervene on) execution all the way through 
the lifecycle of a project, including the 
defect period; and ultimately drive higher 
margins for the Construction Services and 
Support Services businesses.
In May, Balfour Beatty was the ﬁrst 
company in the world to complete the ISO 
20400 assessment, the 2017 international 
standard for sustainable procurement. 
The standard ensures that key issues are 
considered in developing: a sustainable 
procurement policy and strategy; guidance 
in creating organisational conditions 
necessary to procure sustainably; 
guidance in setting priorities in sustainable 
procurement; and suggestions on how 
to improve the procurement process 
as a whole. Clients, particularly in the 
UK public sector, are increasingly taking 
into account social value and other 
environmental factors when making 
procurement decisions. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

What we have been doing in 2017
Construction Services
Financial review
Construction Services continued to make 
signiﬁcant progress during the course of 
the year. The segment improved from an 
underlying loss of £21 million in 2016, to 
an underlying proﬁt from operations of 
£72 million in 2017 primarily due to the 
improvements at UK Construction.
Underlying revenue increased by 2% to 
£6,649 million (2016: £6,537 million), a 2% 
decrease at CER. As expected, underlying 
revenues in the UK fell by 7%, as improved 
bidding disciplines and selectivity adopted 
under Build to Last resulted in lower levels of 
activity in previous problem areas. This was 
more than offset by an underlying revenue 
increase of 6% in the US (1% increase at 
CER) and a 5% increase at Gammon (1% 
increase at CER).
The turnaround of underlying proﬁt from 
operations at £72 million (2016: £21 million 
loss) is primarily a result of the UK which 
returned to underlying proﬁt of £16 million 
(2016: £65 million loss). Underlying proﬁt 
in the US at £41 million and Gammon at 
£15 million both improved year on year. 
The order book decreased by 11% (5% at 
CER) due to declines in the US and Gammon. 
The 22% (14% at CER) decrease in the US 
order book, although greater than anticipated, 
is consistent with the Group’s stated policy 
of selective bidding for those projects best 
aligned with its capabilities. Gammon’s order 
book decreased by 13% (7% at CER) as the 
timing of orders is more variable. The overall 
reduction was, in part, offset by the UK 
order book increasing by 17% to £2.7 billion, 
within the more disciplined and selective 
approach to bidding. The £2.5 billion (Balfour 
Beatty 50% joint venture) HS2 contracts 
won in July 2017 will not be included in the 
order book until the conclusion of the Early 
Contractor Involvement (ECI) at the end of 
2018 or in early 2019. 
The Group is continuing to manage 
problem contracts through to completion. 
Each requires a high level of leadership 
involvement to ensure the best achievable 
outcome and a positive effect on customer 
relations. In most cases, the positions taken 
are proving adequate, reﬂecting, as expected, 
a mix of projects successfully closed out 
ahead of expectation, as well as others where 
the outcome, although disappointing, is being 
managed to its best conclusion. A very limited 
number of contracts have disappointed 
outside of this expectation. The largest of 
these is Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route 
(AWPR) which has experienced ongoing 
schedule and cost issues. These contracts 
have impacted the underlying results of 
Construction Services.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 17 Strategic Report
As these challenges reduce, new 
contracts are coming on stream which 
were bid, won and are being executed and 
monitored within the Group’s framework 
of contracting disciplines. This means that 
the strong foundation created in the ﬁrst 
36 months of Build to Last will be reﬂected 
increasingly in improved project delivery. 
As this feeds through the business, 
management time can increasingly be 
refocused onto the many opportunities in 
the pipeline which play to  
Balfour Beatty’s capabilities.
In the construction portfolio there are a 
small number of long-term and complex 
projects where the Group has incorporated 
judgements over contractual outcomes. 
The range of potential outcomes as a result 
of uncertain future events could result in 
a materially positive or negative swing to 
proﬁtability and cash ﬂow. These contracts 
are primarily within the major infrastructure 
business units in the UK, US and Gammon.
Operational review
UK
£1,998m underlying revenue
^
£2.7bn order book
^
Underlying revenue in the UK fell by 7% 
to £1,998 million (2016: £2,143 million) 
but proﬁt from operations remained 
positive following the return to underlying 
proﬁt during the second half of 2016. 
The underlying proﬁt from operations 
at £16 million equates to a PFO margin 
of 0.8%, with the business targeting an 
industry-standard margin of 2%-3% in 
the second half of 2018. The UK order 
book increased by 17% to £2.7 billion as 
the business won a number of material 
projects including Hinkley Point C and 
MECD (the University of Manchester’s 
engineering campus development). 
The UK Construction business is organised 
into three business units consisting of:
 – Major Projects: focused on complex 
projects in key market sectors such 
as transportation, heavy infrastructure 
and energy
 – Regional: private and public, civil 
engineering, ground engineering, 
mechanical and electrical engineering, 
and building, providing customers 
with locally delivered ﬂexible and fully 
integrated civil and building services
 – Rail: civil engineering, track, power and 
electriﬁcation projects.
UK Construction is continuing to manage 
historical problem contracts through 
to completion. At the start of 2015, 89 
historical contracts were identiﬁed that had 
a material negative impact on proﬁtability 
and cash. As at the end of December 2017 
93% of these projects were at practical 
completion (90% at end December 2016) 
with over 80% at ﬁnancial completion 
(70% at end December 2016). 
The Group is working constructively with 
industry bodies and the UK Government to 
identify and manage any challenges caused 
by the UK’s exit from the European Union. 
At this stage Balfour Beatty has not seen 
an impact on the building market; however 
the Group remains vigilant to respond to 
any changes in market conditions. 
During the year, Balfour Beatty continued 
to focus on alignment of the Group’s 
world-leading expertise to its key 
customers’ requirements and providing 
them with a single primary point of contact 
accountable for the work which is delivered 
for them, across the organisation. In July, 
Balfour Beatty created an engineering 
consultancy collaboration in the UK with 
Atkins (now SNC-Lavalin), Mott McDonald 
and WSP . This partnership will focus 
Balfour Beatty’s procurement of design 
consultants for its projects towards Atkins,

The Major Projects business continues to 
pursue a number of major infrastructure 
opportunities across core transportation 
and energy markets. Over the next few 
years HS2, new nuclear power stations 
(Hinkley, Wylfa) and airport expansion 
(Heathrow) will all contribute to the UK 
Government’s investment in infrastructure, 
which is forecast to rise from 0.8% of GDP 
in 2015-16 to over 1% of GDP by 2020-21. 
In addition, the highways market continues 
to provide good growth opportunities 
following the UK Government’s proposed 
£35 billion funding for Highways 
England’s ﬁrst and second Roads 
Investment Strategies.
In June 2017, the Major Projects 
business successfully completed work 
on the M3 four-lane smart motorway 
between junction 4a for Farnborough 
and junction 2 for the M25. The project 
added an extra lane in both directions by 
converting the hard shoulder into a trafﬁc 
lane – increasing capacity and adding 
technology that will make the road more 
resilient for users. In September 2017, 
work was completed on the A21 upgrade 
project between Tonbridge and Pembury 
which now provides drivers with a new 
dual carriageway. 
During the year signiﬁcant progress has 
been made on ﬂagship projects. The UK’s 
biggest road construction project at 
present, the A14 in Cambridgeshire, had 
successfully completed more than a 
quarter of the project’s main construction 
work as it marked its ﬁrst year of 
construction in November. Following the 
liquidation of Carillion plc, Balfour Beatty 
has assumed Carillion’s share of this project 
with the revised three-way joint venture 
working well together on the project. At the 
Norwich Northern Distributor Road (NNDR) 
project, all bridge beams have now been 
installed along the new 20-kilometre road.
At the Aberdeen Western Peripheral 
Route (AWPR) project Balfour Beatty and 
Galliford Try continue to move ahead with 
the complex 58-kilometre project. As a 
result of the liquidation of previous joint 
venture partner Carillion, Balfour Beatty 
has recognised a one-off non-underlying 
loss provision of £44 million which reﬂects 
the Group’s additional loss on the contract. 
Completion is now expected in the 
summer of 2018. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

What we have been doing in 2017
On Crossrail, Balfour Beatty’s three 
major projects: C510 (Liverpool Street 
and Whitechapel Station tunnels); 
C512 (Whitechapel Station); and C530 
(Woolwich Station) all made signiﬁcant 
progress during the year. C510 is effectively 
complete with the other two projects on 
schedule for the December 2018 opening 
of the Elizabeth Line. 
At the Thames Tideway Tunnel work 
continues on the 6-kilometre West section 
which runs from Acton to Wandsworth. 
The ﬁrst tunnel boring machines (TBMs) 
have been delivered in preparation for the 
start of tunnelling later this year. The TBMs 
were transported along the Thames, in line 
with Tideway’s commitment to transport 
over 90% of materials by river, thereby 
reducing the number of road vehicle 
journeys needed.
During the year Major Projects won the 
tunnelling and marine works package for 
Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. 
The four-year package will include the 
construction of three marine tunnels – 
both onshore and offshore – totalling over 
9.5 kilometres in length and 7 metres in 
diameter to form part of the vital cooling 
system. This is the second major package 
Balfour Beatty will deliver at Hinkley 
Point C, following its appointment in 2015 
to the power station’s electrical works 
package in joint venture with NG Bailey.
Construction Services continued
In July, Balfour Beatty’s 50:50 joint 
venture with VINCI was awarded two 
major civil engineering lots (Lots N1 and 
N2) for the two northern stretches of 
HS2 Phase 1, closest to Birmingham. 
Balfour Beatty VINCI will deliver Lot N1, 
valued at c.£1.32 billion, and Lot N2, 
valued at c.£1.15 billion, between the 
Long Itchington Wood Green tunnel to 
the Delta Junction/Birmingham Spur and 
from the Delta Junction to the West Coast 
mainline tie-in respectively, in two-stage 
design and build contracts. The contracts 
are included in awarded but not contracted 
(ABNC) as the ﬁrst stage, a 16-month 
Early Contract Involvement (ECI) period, 
commenced on 28 July 2017. 
Also included in ABNC, the highways 
business has been selected to deliver two 
Smart Motorway packages to upgrade 
sections of the M6 (J2 – J4) and M4 (J3 – 
J12). Additionally, a contract from Highways 
England for the construction of a proposed 
lorry area near the M20 has been awarded 
and is currently under consultation. 
In February 2018, the M6 (J2 – J4) contract 
was formally awarded to Balfour Beatty.
The Regional business comprises:
 – Regional Construction: four regions 
(Scotland & Ireland, North & Midlands, 
South and London) providing public and 
private customers with locally delivered, 
ﬂexible and fully integrated civil and 
building services 
 – Balfour Beatty Ground Engineering: 
specialist geotechnical contractor 
providing innovative piling and ground 
improvement solutions across all sectors 
 – Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick: heavy 
mechanical and electrical (M&E) 
installations and building services.
The Regional business is focused on 
opportunities across ﬁve sectors – aviation, 
buildings, civils, defence and energy. 
Within Regional, in line with the Group’s 
strategy, the number of live projects has 
now fallen from over 400 at December 
2015 to around 225 by December 
2017. The business is now focused on 
fewer, larger contracts and continues to 
reduce its exposure to contracts under 
£5 million. This allows the business to 
focus on projects with better pricing and 
risk dynamics, but also improves the 
span of control as it operates fewer sites. 
There has also been a shift towards a lower 
risk contract portfolio, with a reduction in 
the number of ﬁxed price contracts offset 
by an increase in target cost contracts and 
framework agreements. Both target cost 
contracts and framework agreements 
require early contractor involvement (ECI) 
with the customer to ensure greater clarity 
around scope, schedule and cost which, 
in combination, reduces delivery risk for 
all parties.

In 2017, the Regional business successfully 
completed the Anchorsholme ﬂood 
prevention scheme in Blackpool to reduce 
ﬂood risk to around 5,000 properties. 
The new defences will help protect 
Blackpool’s tourism and recreational

baggage screening and handling systems 
for Heathrow airport; Redwood luxury 
retirement village for Audley; the renovation 
and new-build scheme at No.1 Palace 
Street in St James’, London; Forth Valley 
College, Scotland, and DRET secondary 
school in London. 
The Regional business had a number of 
successes in 2017. Notable new contract 
awards in the period included: 
 – £287 million contract for The University 
of Manchester to construct the 
Manchester Engineering Campus 
Development (MECD)
 – £179 million contract for the University 
of Sussex, to construct new student 
accommodation on campus which will 
provide bedrooms for 2,117 students, 
together with new student amenities 
and a Students’ Union building
 – £124 million Wokingham Public Road 
project, awarded through Scape
 – £63 million contract for Network Rail for 
the redevelopment of Glasgow Queen 
Street station
 – £53 million contract for a retirement 
village at Runneymede for 
Audley Villages. 
Included in ABNC, at year end the Group 
had been selected as preferred bidder for: 
the East Wick and Sweetwater residential 
development project; the Vine Street 
student accommodation project, London; 
and the Caernarfon bypass. The Regional 
business also continues to secure a 
number of signiﬁcant engineering projects 
operated by Scape Group, which is open 
to all public sector bodies in the UK and 
covers projects ranging from road repairs, 
new bridges and coastal defence works to 
light rail schemes and major road projects. 
In the Rail construction business, 
underlying revenues were lower as track 
and overhead line equipment projects 
between Slough and Maidenhead 
for Crossrail substantially completed. 
These projects contributed to a proﬁt 
improvement in this delivery unit. 
During the year, the Group was selected 
by Network Rail to electrify a 40-mile train 
route as part of the Great Western mainline 
upgrade. Balfour Beatty will be responsible 
for the remainder of the electriﬁcation 
between Cardiff and Bristol Parkway 
and will utilise the latest technology 
and innovations in design, construction 
and rail plant to drive efﬁciencies and 
improve safety. 
In February 2017, Balfour Beatty published 
its Staying on Track paper. This lays out the 
Group’s view that new funding models are 
essential to provide the UK’s rail industry 
with continuity of project ﬂow in order to 
support growth in innovation and skills. 
Further, in October, the Group published 
its Fast Track to Digital Railway: Delivering 
the Vision paper. This sets out the Group’s 
views on the Digital Railway, a rail industry-
wide programme encompassing a range of 
digitally enabled interventions to improve 
the passenger experience by unlocking 
much needed capacity in the network 
and delivering a railway system ﬁt for the 
future, which will stimulate and strengthen 
the UK economy.
US
£3,634m underlying revenue
^
£4.3bn order book
^
Underlying revenue in the US grew by 
6% in the period (1% increase at CER) 
to £3,634 million. The business reported 
an underlying proﬁt from operations for 
the year of £41 million (2016: £33 million). 
The underlying PFO margin at 1.1% is 
at the low end of the Group’s Build to 
Last Phase Two target of 1%-2% for US 
Construction. The trajectory is positive 
and market conditions are considered 
favourable. The 22% (14% at CER) 
decrease in the US order book, although 
greater than anticipated, is consistent 
with the Group’s stated policy of selective 
bidding for those projects best aligned with 
its capabilities. In January 2018, the US 
business was awarded, in joint venture, the 
US$1.95 billion Los Angeles airport (LAX) 
Automated People Mover project. 
Balfour Beatty continues to evolve its US 
organisation building on the standardisation 
and leaning out already delivered. 
At the year end the decision was taken 
to promote two internal candidates, to 
lead the Buildings and Civils businesses 
respectively. These appointments 
will leverage the Group’s market 
positions while maintaining the new 
contracting disciplines. 
Even before the 2016 presidential election, 
there was a strong market outlook for 
construction in the US. In December 
2015, the FAST Act (Fixing America’s 
Surface Transportation), a US$305 billion 
transportation bill was signed, providing 
funding for a ﬁve-year period. This bill 
permits longer term project planning 
horizons in the public market and is leading 
to improved visibility for publicly funded 
projects that had been slow to come to 
market. There are further opportunities 
being created with the number of state 
backed infrastructure bonds (US$35 billion 
of education bonds in California, over 
US$200 billion of multi-state transportation 
bonds), and an increase in US public-private 
partnership schemes.  Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Since 2014, over half of the 50 US states 
have increased state gasoline tax. In 2017 
alone, eight states passed legislation to 
increase their respective state gasoline 
tax, which will raise around US$5 billion in 
new funding for infrastructure. Additionally, 
many counties in various states have raised 
their sales tax from 0.5% to 1%, which 
will increase infrastructure funding by over 
US$2 billion per year. 
In the US approximately 85% of 
revenues are generated from the general 
building market (Buildings), with the civil 
infrastructure market (Civils) accounting 
for the remaining 15%. 
The Buildings business remains focused 
on working with repeat customers, in 
known geographies where it can deliver 
value. In 2017, the Group closed its 
Houston ofﬁce and continued to withdraw 
from bidding on most stick frame multi-
family housing. 
The Buildings business is focused on 
speciﬁc geographies, known as The 
Southern Smile. This starts in the Paciﬁc 
North West, runs through California, 
Texas, Florida and up through Georgia 
and the Carolinas to Washington DC. 
The core markets remain as commercial 
ofﬁces, education, hospitality, residential 
and healthcare.
In 2017, Buildings completed a number 
of notable projects including: the 
redevelopment of Microsoft Buildings 30, 
31 and 32 in Redmond; the 300 South Tryon 
25-storey ofﬁce tower in Charlottesville; 
the Alta Midtown, a mid- and high-rise 
residential facility in Atlanta; the 500 East 
Morehead ofﬁce building in Charlotte; 
and the JM Alexander Middle School 
in Huntersville, North Carolina. 
During the year signiﬁcant progress 
has been made on ﬂagship projects. 
In California, Balfour Beatty has started 
construction on a new US$38 million 
performing arts and recreation centre 
for Heart of Los Angeles (HOLA) 
and completed its largest concrete 
pour, involving 888 trucks, at a new 
US$276 million 42-storey residential tower 
at 500 Folsom in San Francisco. In the 
North West, Balfour Beatty is constructing 
Portland’s newest high-rise which will 
reach 19 stories and includes a hotel and 
175,000 square feet of ofﬁce space. 
In North Carolina the US$101 million Hotel 
Bennett in downtown Charlestown  
is due to open in 2018.
The Buildings business had a number of 
successes in 2017. Notable new contract 
awards in the period included: 
 – Matthews Southwest River Landing 
project, a US$260 million contract to 
build the River Landing Shops and 
Residences in Miami. The mixed-use 
project will offer over 2 million square 
feet of retail and residences in Miami’s 
Civic Centre, including two residential 
buildings which will feature 475 
rental apartments and a ﬁve-storey 
shopping centre
 – US$100 million contract for Cleburne 
Independent School District to deliver 
a 500,000 square feet update and 
expansion of Cleburne High School
 – US$130 million contract named Portals 
V, a 4-storey residential building with 
292 apartments, 76 condominiums, and 
12,400 square feet of amenity space 
in Washington DC
 – US$95 million contract named Paseo 
De La Riviera, a mixed-use development 
that will include a hotel, residences and 
retail in Coral Gables, Florida.
Included in ABNC, the business has been 
awarded: the US$260 million Harrison 
Medical Centre project in Seattle; a 
US$150 million contract for an Atlanta 
airport hotel; and a US$70 million contract 
for Disney in Orlando.
The Civils business continues to create 
value, operating in the largely regulated 
markets of rail, water and road. In 2017, 
Civils completed two notable road projects 
– the Dallas Horseshoe and Wilmington 
Bypass. The Dallas Horseshoe, which 
follows a distinctive U-shaped path, was 
a design-build project upgrading 73 miles 
of roadway and 37 bridges to reduce 
congestion. The completion of the I-140 
transportation loop around Wilmington, 
North Carolina, involved driving 184 36-inch 
concrete piles into the Cape Fear River 
to complete the three-mile bridge and 
roadway project.
Additionally during the year, signiﬁcant 
progress has been made on key contracts. 
At Caltrain, a US$697 million contract for 
the electriﬁcation of the 52-mile rail corridor 
between San Francisco and San Jose, the 
Group started to place the foundations 
for the conversion of the line from diesel 
trains to electric trains. In Denver, Balfour 
Beatty is currently adding 2.3 miles and 
three stations to the light rail line as part 
of a design-build contract. In California, 
the Group is currently on-site modernising 
the Rinconada water treatment plant by 
replacing and upgrading ageing facilities 
and overhauling the treatment process.
The Civils business had a number of 
successes in 2017. Notable new contract 
awards in the period included: 
 – US$1.08 billion (25% equal four-way 
joint venture between Balfour Beatty, 
Flour Corporation, The Middlesex 
Corp. and Herzog Contracting Corp.) 
Green Line Extension design and 
build contract for the Massachusetts 
Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) 
to design and build the new 4.7-mile 
commuter rail extension, associated 
infrastructure and seven new rail stations
 – US$625 million (45% Balfour Beatty, 
55% Fluor Corporation joint venture) 
contract to reconstruct and improve 
the Southern Gateway, an 11-mile 
stretch of road in Dallas, Texas. 
This contract followed the joint venture’s 
successful delivery of the adjacent 
Horseshoe project. 
In January 2018, Balfour Beatty was 
awarded the US$1.95 billion design, build, 
ﬁnance, operate and maintain contract 
for the Automated People Mover at Los 
Angeles International Airport (LAX) for 
Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA). 
This project will use expertise from each 
of the Buildings, Civils and Investments 
businesses. The design and build element 
of the contract has been awarded to the 
LAX Integrated Express Solutions (LINXS) 
joint venture comprising Balfour Beatty 
(30%), Fluor Corporation (30%), Flatiron 
West (20%) and Dragados USA (20%). 
The design and build works will include a 
2.25-mile, above ground airport transport 
system connecting the LAX central 
terminal area to the to-be-constructed 
consolidated rental car facility as well as six 
stations and a vehicle maintenance facility.

^
At Gammon, the Group’s 50:50 joint venture 
based in Hong Kong and Singapore, both 
revenue and proﬁt were up, but the order 
book declined as the timing of orders is 
more variable. During the year, two material 
contracts moved towards satisfactory 
conclusion. The Midﬁeld Terminal project 
reached an amicable settlement, without 
the need for arbitration, and the West 
Kowloon Terminus North project is now 
close to completion. 
The Group’s share of underlying 
revenue increased by 5% (1% at CER) 
to £1,017 million. Underlying proﬁt from 
operations increased to £15 million 
(2016: £11 million). During the year, the 
joint venture made a dividend distribution 
to Balfour Beatty of £37 million (2016: £nil). 
The order book declined by 13% (7% at 
CER) to £1.3 billion, as timing of orders is 
more variable around a small number of 
large building and civils contracts. The order 
book is spread across a number of public 
and private customers. In Buildings 
the focus is on productivity, efﬁciency 
and expanding the customer base on a 
selective basis. In Civils the strategy is 
to lever competitive advantage with a 
key area of future work likely to be from 
expansion of the airport in Hong Kong and 
other signiﬁcant infrastructure programmes 
such as the Central Kowloon Route in Hong 
Kong and the Rail Circle Line in Singapore. 
In 2017, the Buildings business completed 
the construction of: 33 Tong Yin Street 
(residential towers and retail areas); and the 
conversion of the ex-government Murray 
building into a hotel. 
During the year work continued on 
major Buildings projects including: the 
redevelopment of Somerset House into a 
48-storey ofﬁce building; the construction 
of the Lee Garden Three Project, which 
will include 20 ﬂoors of ofﬁce space 
atop a ﬁve-level retail complex; and the 
construction of a 71,000 square metre 
data centre for Global Switch in Hong 
Kong. Work has also continued in 2017 on 
a number of Civils projects in Hong Kong, 
including the West Kowloon Terminus 
North for the express rail link to Shenzhen, 
China, and the complex Tuen Mun-Chek 
Lap Kok (TMCLK) Viaduct project, which 
includes the design and construction of a 
dual two-lane sea viaduct. 
Gammon had a number of successes in 
2017. Notable new contract awards in the 
period included: 
 – HK$6.2 billion contract for the Highways 
Department of the Government of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region to construct the Kai Tak West 
section of the Central Kowloon Route in 
Hong Kong
 – HK$3 billion residential scheme for 
Great Eagle involving the development 
of eight medium-rise residential blocks 
overlooking Tai Po’s Tolo Harbour in 
Northern Hong Kong
 – HK$2 billion contract to create Hong 
Kong’s ﬁrst year round, all-weather 
water park at Tai Shue Wan for Ocean 
Park Corporation. Covering an area of 
over 693,000 square feet, the Ocean 
Park Water World project includes 
construction of the main building 
structure and ﬁt-out and installation of 
various indoor and outdoor attractions
 – S$230 million contract to construct

a HK$1.5 billion contract for the West 
Kowloon Cultural District Authority 
(WKCDA) in Hong Kong to deliver the 
extended basement and infrastructure 
works called the L1 Contract.

What we have been doing in 2017
Support Services
Financial review
The Support Services segment comprises 
utilities and transportation businesses. 
Utilities operates across power 
transmission and distribution and the gas 
and water sectors. Transportation operates 
across rail, highways and managed road 
schemes for local authorities.
Underlying revenue for the segment 
reduced by 4% to £1,061 million 
(2016: £1,103 million), as an increase in 
utilities was more than offset by lower 
transportation revenues. Underlying proﬁt 
from operations increased to £41 million 
(2016: £34 million), with the 3.9% 
(2016: 3.1%) underlying PFO margin in 
the middle of the Build to Last Phase Two 
industry-standard margin target of 
3%-5%. The order book was stable at 
£3.1 billion (2016: £3.1 billion) as growth 
in transportation was offset by an 
expected decline in utilities. 
Operational review
Underlying utilities revenue increased by 
3% to £608 million (2016: £590 million), 
driven by a 10% increase at gas and water 
which is in the middle of the regulatory 
period. The utilities order book fell 13% 
due primarily to the expected decline in 
gas and water. 
The power transmission and distribution 
business had a disappointing 2017 as it 
underwent signiﬁcant restructure and 
cost removal. The business is eliminating 
low-value works and areas which do not 
align to its risk proﬁle, including signiﬁcantly 
reducing its reliance on volume-based 
and second-tier subcontracting projects. 
The actions taken will ensure that the 
business is focused on the most proﬁtable 
areas of its market.
In the period, power transmission and 
distribution successfully completed the 
Bhlaraidh-Bennuien windfarm connections 
project (a combined overhead line, cabling 
and substations contract) near Fort 
Augustus in Scotland for SSE as well as 
the London Power Tunnels project for 
National Grid. 
The business has commenced work on 
the Eleclink project in conjunction with the 
Rail business. The installation of the HVDC 
interconnector will involve laying two 
50-kilometre cables through the Channel 
Tunnel and connecting them to converter 
stations in Northern France and Kent.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 23 Strategic Report
Balfour Beatty’s work, valued at  
c. €140 million, has drawn on its extensive 
experience in power transmission and 
distribution, construction and rail to lead 
the innovative design and installation of 
this project.
The power and transmission distribution 
business had a number of successes in 
2017. Notable new contract awards in the 
period included: 
 – £43 million contract for a major overhead 
line refurbishment scheme for National 
Grid in South Wales 
 – installation of a new £20 million overhead 
line to connect the Dorenell wind 
farm for SSE Networks using a new 
composite tower design, in addition 
to the award of a 10-kilometre cabling 
scheme for SSE 
 – contract awarded by SSE Power 
Distribution for the initial works of the 
design and refurbishment of ﬁve 132kV 
overhead lines across Southern England. 
This refurbishment will replace parts 
of the network that are coming to the 
end of their working life, making it more 
robust and resilient and minimising the 
risk of power cuts for customers in 
the area.
The power and transmission distribution 
business has a stable underlying market 
with increased National Grid spend for 
new nuclear offsetting a decline across 
the distribution market.
In gas and water, the revenue increase in 
2017 was due to the UK water regulatory 
cycle, as new contracts continue to mature 
under AMP6 (2015-2020). Many water 
contracts are extended over multiple AMP 
periods and the Group has already started 
to engage on the AMP7 planning cycle. 
The gas market is in the middle of the 
RIIO-GD1 period, with no changes likely 
before early 2021. 
In the period, the business commenced 
utility work on Heat Networks in 
Gateshead, as part of a Government 
funded initiative, and continued to construct 
the new Mayﬂower water treatment facility 
for South West Water. The Mayﬂower 
facility is under construction at a site near 
Roborough, north of Plymouth, and will 
replace the existing Crownhill facility, which 
dates from the 1950s and has reached the 
end of its natural life. 
The gas and water business expects a 
peak volume year in 2018, as it represents 
the middle of the current AMP/RIIO cycles.

A reconciliation of the Group’s performance measures to its statutory results is provided in the  
Measuring our performance section.
Underlying transportation revenues 
reduced by 12% to £453 million 
(2016: £513 million), due to expected 
volume declines from rail and highways. 
Highways revenues declined due to the 
end of a maintenance contract and lower 
capital spend on a number of contracts. 
The transportation order book grew by 
12%, due to increased order intake in 
highways and from local authorities.
In highways, the business was awarded 
the following contract extensions during 
the year:
 – £115 million, 17-month extension for 
Balfour Beatty Mott MacDonald, a 70:30 
joint venture, from Highways England to 
continue its service delivery for Area 10 
in the Northwest of England 
 – £80 million ﬁve-year Highways Services 
Partnership contract extension by 
Southampton City Council following 
a history of good performance and 
collaborative working with the local 
authority. The extension builds on 
the current 10-year contract which 
commenced in October 2010, extending 
it until the end of September 2025
 – £36 million nine-year contract extension 
for the M1-A1 Link Road (Lofthouse to 
Bramham) on behalf of Connect Roads, 
for ultimate customer Highways England.
The underlying highways market is positive 
with a continued Government focus on 
highways, with its proposed £35 billion 
funding for Highways England’s ﬁrst and 
second Roads Investment Strategies. 
In the rail business’s year end ABNC, rail 
was the preferred bidder for a four-year 
contract worth more than £40 million 
for the operation and maintenance of 
Network Rail’s ﬂeet of track maintenance 
Stoneblowers, and a seven-year contract 
worth in excess of £115 million for the 
supply, operation and maintenance of 
13 track maintenance Tampers, also 
to Network Rail. Post year end the 
Stoneblowers contract has subsequently 
been awarded to Balfour Beatty. 
Balfour Beatty’s Track Partnership contract 
with London Underground, to deliver 
essential track renewal work across the 
network, is due for re-tender in 2018.

Infrastructure Investments
Financial review
The Investments business delivered 
another strong performance, having 
continued its strategy of optimising 
value through the disposal of operational 
assets, whilst also continuing to invest 
in new opportunities. 
Underlying proﬁt from operations at 
£116 million (2016: £89 million) was 
higher than the prior year, predominantly 
due to an increase in proﬁt on disposals. 
Pre-disposals underlying operating proﬁt 
increased to £30 million (2016: £24 million) 
due to higher proﬁt from the US, 
primarily due to growth in new projects 
and a non-recurring fee associated with 
military housing. Net interest income 
remained broadly consistent year on year 
at £24 million (2016: £26 million) with 
underlying proﬁt before tax at £140 million 
(2016: £115 million). 
Operational review
In 2017, the Infrastructure Investments 
business added three new projects, made 
one full disposal and partially disposed of 
one asset. 
In the student accommodation sector the 
Group won a project for Purdue University 
in Indiana which will provide a 835-bed 
apartment complex on the campus. In the 
private rented and regeneration sector, 
the business acquired a 15% stake in a 
private rental housing portfolio covering 
three assets in Atlanta, Georgia, totalling 
882 units and encompassing 91 acres, 
and a 50% stake in a 228-unit community 
serving students enrolled at the University 
of North Carolina at Wilmington. 
In June, the business disposed of its 
interests in one residential housing project 
at Carmendy, Florida for £2 million. 
In December, the Group made a 12.5% 
partial sale in Connect Plus, the company 
which operates the M25 orbital motorway, 
for £103 million (proﬁt on disposal of 
£54 million). In the last week of the year 
the Group subsequently sold an additional 
7.5% stake in Connect Plus for £62 million 
(proﬁt on disposal of £32 million). Only the 
initial £103 million of cash was received 
before year end, with the further £62 million 
received in February 2018. Additionally, 
in February 2018, the Group made a third 
partial disposal, selling 5% of Connect 
Plus for £42 million (proﬁt on disposal of 
£21 million). In total, across the 2017 and 
2018 ﬁnancial years Balfour Beatty received 
£207 million for a 25% stake in Connect 
Plus. The Group retains a 15% holding in 
the Connect Plus M25 asset.

Financial close was reached on three new 
projects where the Group invests equity: 
the two private rented and regeneration 
projects acquired in 2017; and at Sussex 
University for new student accommodation 
on campus which will provide bedrooms 
for 2,117 students, together with new 
student amenities and a Students’ Union 
building. At year end ﬁve projects had not 
yet reached ﬁnancial close. In January 
2018, ﬁnancial close was reached 
at Purdue University. 
The business also closed on the second 
phase of a mixed-use project for The 
University of Texas in Dallas. In the second 
phase, the development team will expand 
the Northside ﬁrst phase development, 
delivering an additional 900 beds and more 
than 6,600 square feet of retail space. 
In addition, the Investments business 
reached ﬁnancial close on one fee-based 
student accommodation development 
project in Oklahoma. In fee-based projects, 
no equity will be invested. In January 2018, 
the business was named preferred bidder 
on the Automated People Mover project 
at Los Angeles airport. Balfour Beatty will 
own a 27% equity stake.
The Infrastructure Investments business 
continues to see signiﬁcant opportunities

Directors’ valuation of the Investments portfolio
Continued success in targeted sectors
Overview
The Directors’ valuation remained stable 
at £1,244 million (2016: £1,220 million) 
despite £105 million being realised from 
divestments in the period. The number 
of projects in the portfolio increased 
from 69 to 71. 
The Group invested £35 million 
(2016: £65 million) in new and existing 
projects. This reﬂected continued success 
in targeted sectors with three new projects 
included in the Directors’ valuation for the 
ﬁrst time. Cash yield from distributions 
amounted to £53 million (2016: £64 million) 
as the portfolio continued to generate cash 
ﬂow to the Group net of investment.
The business continued its strategy of 
maximising value through recycling equity 
from operationally proven projects, whilst 
preserving interests in strategic projects 
that offer opportunities to the wider Group. 
Two investments were sold or part sold 
during the year for £105 million. In June, 
the business disposed of its interests 
in one residential housing project at 
Carmendy, Florida for a cash consideration 
of £2 million. In December the Group 
made a 12.5% partial sale in Connect Plus, 
the company which operates the M25 
orbital motorway, for a cash consideration 
of £103 million. 
Unwind of discount at £97 million 
(2016: £90 million) is a function of moving 
the valuation date by a year with the result 
that future cash ﬂows are discounted by 
one year less. Operational performance 
movements resulted in a £33 million 
increase in the value of the portfolio 
(2016: £61 million), consisting mainly of 
an increase of £106 million due to the 
change in Federal corporate income tax 
rates enacted in the US and a £56 million 
reduction due to the rise in the value of 
sterling. The remainder was due to a 
number of changes in cash ﬂow forecasts, 
discount rates and economic assumptions.
The methodology used for the Directors’ 
valuation is unchanged, producing a 
valuation that reﬂects market value and 
which therefore changes with movements 
in the market. Cash ﬂows for each project 
are forecast based on historical and 
present performance, future risks and 
macroeconomic forecasts and which factor 
in current market assumptions. These cash 
ﬂows are then discounted using different 
discount rates based on the risk and 
maturity of individual projects and reﬂecting 
secondary market transaction experience. 
As in previous years, the Directors’ 
valuation may differ signiﬁcantly from 
the accounting book value of investments 
shown in the ﬁnancial statements, 
which are produced in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
rather than using a discounted cash 
ﬂow approach.
Demand for high-quality infrastructure 
investments in the secondary market 
continues to exceed supply and the Group 
will continue to sell investment assets 
timed to maximise value to shareholders. 
With the low interest rate environment 
likely to continue, the secondary market 
is expected to remain strong for the 
foreseeable future.
The Investments portfolio is split relatively 
evenly across the UK and North America 
(UK 51%, North America 49%). Within the 
UK portfolio roads is still the largest sector, 
despite the 12.5% partial sale of the 
Connect Plus M25 asset completed 
in 2017, whilst in North America US 
military housing dominates the portfolio. 
The Investments portfolio includes over 
£1 billion of projects that have completed 
the construction phase and are 
now operational.

Valuation – The portfolio value at a range of discount rates
UK portfolio
UK portfolio
In 2017 £6 million of equity was invested 
across four projects in the portfolio: the 
student accommodation project at Foundry 
Court in Glasgow; the regeneration 
development at East Wick & Sweetwater; 
and the biomass projects Birmingham 
Bio Power and Welland Bio Power. 
During the year, there was a partial sale of 
12.5% of the Connect Plus M25 project 
which generated proceeds of £103 million, 
above the Directors’ valuation of the asset. 
The Group agreed the sale of a further 
7.5% on 29 December 2017 for £62 million, 
reducing its interest in the asset to 20% 
at the year end. The proceeds from this 
sale were received in February 2018 and 
so are included in the Directors’ valuation 
at year end. 
In aggregate operational performance 
movements resulted in a £12 million 
reduction in value arising from the 
net effect of a number of changes to 
assumptions including higher short-term 
inﬂation rates, lower short-term interest 
rates, higher discount rates on projects 
where the risk is assumed to have 
increased and revised cash ﬂow forecasts 
for certain projects. 
Discount rates applied to the UK portfolio 
range between 7% and 12% depending 
on project risk and maturity. The implied 
weighted average discount rate for the 
UK portfolio is 8.5% (2016: 8.3%). A 1% 
change in discount rate would change the 
value of the UK portfolio by approximately 
£62 million.
Consistent with other infrastructure funds, 
Balfour Beatty’s experience is that there is 
limited correlation between the discount 
rates used to value PPP (and similar 
infrastructure investments) and long-term 
interest rates. In the event that interest 
rates increase in response to rising inﬂation, 
the impact of any increase in discount 
rates would be mitigated by the positive 
correlation between the value of the UK 
portfolio and changes in inﬂation. 
Following on from the OECD BEPS 
project’s recommendations, the UK 
Government passed legislation in 2017 
restricting the tax deductibility of interest 
expense. The legislation is complex and 
its application in certain areas will require 
further clariﬁcation, but the current 
assessment is that the impact on the 
Directors’ valuation is not material.

North American portfolio
In 2017, the business won three projects: 
two investments in private rental housing 
portfolios at Wilmington in North Carolina 
and Atlanta in Georgia; and a student 
accommodation project for Purdue 
University in Indiana. 
Investment of £29 million was made during 
the period in three existing and two new 
projects: two hospital projects in Canada 
and a student accommodation project 
at the University of Texas; and the two 
stakes acquired in private rental housing 
portfolios in Atlanta and Wilmington. 
Carmendy Square, Florida, was sold in 
the period, generating a net £2 million 
in proceeds.
Operational performance movements 
resulted in a £45 million increase in the 
value of the portfolio, consisting of an 
increase of £106 million due to the change 
in Federal corporate income tax rates 
enacted in the US, a £56 million reduction 
due to the strengthening of sterling against 
the US dollar and a £5 million reduction 
due to revised cash ﬂow forecasts for 
certain projects.
Discount rates applied to the North 
American portfolio range between 7.5% 
and 10%. The implied weighted average 
discount rate is 8.2% (2016: 8.2%) and 
a 1% change in the discount rate would 
change the value of the North American 
portfolio by approximately £84 million.
Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed 
by the US Government in December 
2017 there are provisions to restrict the 
tax deductibility of interest expense. 
The provisions are complex and their 
application requires clariﬁcation in a number 
of areas, but the initial assessment is that 
the restriction will not have a material effect 
on the Directors’ valuation. The Group will 
monitor the application of the rules and any 
forthcoming guidance.

As a value-led business that 
operates safely and ethically, 
Balfour Beatty acts responsibly 
to protect and enhance the 
physical and social environment. 
Building a sustainable business
Group-wide innovations  
driving success
Innovation, research and 
development
Balfour Beatty harnesses innovation that 
delivers value and efﬁciencies, improves 
safety, develops engineering capability and 
increases the pace of delivery.
Balfour Beatty captures the best ideas 
and invests in research and development. 
Innovations are embedded across the 
Group to become business as usual.
Innovation is essential for future success. 
At the end of 2017, Balfour Beatty launched 
an initiative to reduce activity on site by 
25% by 2025.
The challenge is to remove complex and 
repetitive activities from sites by rethinking 
design, production and installation.
My Contribution 
As a speciﬁc stream of the Build to 
Last programme, the Group-wide My 
Contribution initiative was launched in 2015 
and is now embedded in the business. 
My Contribution encourages staff to share 
ideas and solutions that could beneﬁt 
the business. In 2017, business leaders 
and Balfour Beatty’s My Contribution 
champions considered 2,000 ideas, which 
have the potential to save £2.8 million.
Business leaders and My Contribution 
champions were asked to shine the 
spotlight on the individuals and teams 
whose innovative ideas and suggestions 
have delivered proven beneﬁts during 2017.
The winning idea was the digital tool, 
Autodesk BIM 360™ Field, now embedded 
across UK Construction Services. 
This innovation drives defect-free delivery 
and has identiﬁed £1 million of savings. 
It takes site documentation and inspection 
requirements online, providing instantly 
accessible, up-to-date evidence, allowing 
customers to check progress and quality in 
‘real time’ and giving them a tool to support 
snagging and asset management.
Digital Balfour Beatty
Integrating and combining digital 
technologies delivers better outcomes 
throughout the project lifecycle. 
 – Problem-solving challenges, technical 
and digital hackathons carried out in 
2017 include a collaborative partnership 
between Balfour Beatty, Google and 
Flux, which resulted in the creation of 
the Asset Tracker mobile application. 
The app enables site-based users to 
easily manage, monitor and track plant. 
The mobile application also has potential 
for tracking other types of assets such 
as mobile and IT equipment.
 – Balfour Beatty’s power transmission 
and distribution business has developed 
an animated core site safety induction. 
This ensures a consistent message is 
delivered across all sites. The voiceover 
is provided by real people working 
on site. 
 – Balfour Beatty’s Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicles produce high-quality images, 
which are invaluable for inspections 
of bridges, major plant, pylons, site 
compounds and earthworks, and for 
surveying inaccessible areas.
In 2017 Balfour Beatty piloted trailblazing 
technologies to bring the virtual world 
to construction.
 – Utilising Mixed Reality the Microsoft 
HoloLens overlays 3D and 4D 
(3D + time) graphics onto the real 
world. In 2017 HoloLens combined 
with Synchro 4D software and 
Trimble SketchUp to create a ‘hybrid’ 
environment, mapping interactive 
virtual objects to the physical world. 
This enables Balfour Beatty to build a 
virtual project in the real world before 
construction begins.
 – The 3D Augmented Reality app/viewer 
provides 3D modelling viewable on 
site, which Balfour Beatty uses to 
demonstrate the impact of works to site 
teams, customers and stakeholders.
 – Balfour Beatty trialled the latest hand-
held mobile scanning device on a 
project in Hull, where pipework, ducting 
and services were easily and clearly 
mapped for inclusion into a 3D as-built 
model. A daily ‘walkthrough’ of the 
continually updated model accurately 
pinpoints potential safety and temporary 
works issues.
Worldwide innovation
Innovation occurs across the business 
and in collaboration with customers, joint 
ventures and the supply chain.
 – In 2017 Balfour Beatty introduced 
consistent 4D planning software across 
the worldwide business. The tools 
enable the engagement of people at 
all levels across the Group’s projects, 
including stakeholders and clients, 
design and construction teams.
 – Balfour Beatty’s India design team 
has grown to a 60+ strong technical 
team of experts in civil engineering, 
mechanical & electrical works and 
animation. Speciﬁc expertise includes 
the production of detailed 3D and 4D 
visualisations for many different areas 
of the business worldwide to maintain 
programmes, delivery and customer 
satisfaction and engage the whole team.
 – Omnicom Balfour Beatty is part of 
Balfour Beatty’s Rail Engineering 
Technology Services team based in 
York and Derby. It provides a range 
of innovative products and services 
to the rail industry that are improving 
safety performance and protecting the 
workforce. OmniVision
®
 uses machine 
vision to automate track inspection; 
OmniSurveyor3D
®
 maps environments 
using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) 
and cameras.
 – Balfour Beatty’s Channel Tunnel 
ElecLink project uses a range of 
automated machinery which removes 
labour-intensive activities, maximises 
productivity and enhances safety with 
animations to brief the methodology 
to the team.
 – Balfour Beatty’s power transmission 
and distribution business supplied the 
electrical interface for the world’s ﬁrst 
ﬂoating wind farm. The innovative 
Hywind Scotland, off the coast of 
Peterhead, features ﬁve turbines which 
are 253 metres tall with 78 metres 
submerged under the sea and anchored 
to the seabed by cables. This unique 
pilot project will eventually power 
20,000 homes.
 – At Forth Valley College’s new Falkirk 
campus, Balfour Beatty Ground 
Engineering has worked with design 
partners GI Energy to develop the UK’s 
ﬁrst ever large-scale driven pre-cast 
energy pile arrangement. More than 
800 thermal loops are integrated into 
the concrete foundations, creating 
exceptionally low carbon energy for 
the customer. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Collaborating with supply chain, 
industry and academia
The Group is involved with a large number 
of industry bodies sharing knowledge and 
learning within the industry.
Continued active involvement with industry 
groups, such as the newly formed client-
led Infrastructure Industry Innovation 
Platform (i3P), provides a platform for 
Balfour Beatty to inﬂuence the industry 
and share knowledge with peers. 
The Group has led the delivery of over 
£2 million of Innovate UK research grants, 
and is working with various industry 
groups delivering cutting edge technology 
that builds a competitive advantage and 
potential step change in productivity in 
design and construction.
Along with its supply chain, Balfour Beatty 
has developed an app, accessible via 
website or smartphone, that is used by 
Dangerous Goods vehicle operators and 
allows self-registration and notiﬁcation 
prior to entering into the Dartford tunnel. 
This eliminates 600 daily Dangerous Goods 
vehicle movements to and from the holding 
area, removing congestion from the heavily 
congested orbital motorway around 
London. Other developments include 
harnessing the Internet of Things, through 
which the deployment of sensors and 
Smart Water will enable remote monitoring 
of drainage systems and analytics to better 
assess the risk of ﬂooding and enable 
timely maintenance.
Balfour Beatty has been assessing buried 
utilities, building on the highly successful 
Mapping the Underworld (MTU) project 
funded by the Engineering and Physical 
Sciences Research Council since April 
2013. It has supported this project as 
an industrial partner throughout and has 
developed close links with the University 
of Birmingham.
Innovation through value engineering 
continues to be a key focus: Balfour Beatty 
has launched a collaborative UK Strategic 
Design Consultants partnership with 
Atkins, Mott MacDonald and WSP . This will 
be a different way of doing business and 
will deliver more value and enable the 
partners to win more quality business by 
working together with common goals.
Awards
Balfour Beatty’s range of innovation is 
recognised by diverse industry awards:
 – Balfour Beatty’s joint venture company, 
Gammon Construction, was recognised 
for its long-term contribution to 
innovation at the Construction Industry 
Council Awards in Hong Kong: the 
Bio-Inspired Anti-Vibration Exoskeleton 
(BIAVE), developed in partnership with 
the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, 
won ﬁrst prize for construction safety. 
Inspired by the X-shaped limb structure 
of birds and insects, it reduces hand-arm 
vibration by up to 90%

Health and safety
‘Safe’ is one of the four Build to Last goals 
and all the Group’s operations must ensure 
the health and safety of everyone who 
comes into contact with their activities. 
Zero Harm is Balfour Beatty’s vision, 
which means no injury, ill health or incident 
caused by its work activities. All operations 
are charged with constantly improving 
performance, sharing learning and 
best practice.
The Zero Harm objective is supported by 
the Group’s Health Safety Environment 
and Sustainability (HSES) strategy 
and risk-based prioritised action plans. 
These are formed around 12 key areas: 
communicating the vision; leadership; 
learning and sharing; co-ordinated 
governance; supply chain engagement; 
health and safety by design; improving 
management systems and processes; 
training and competence; behavioural 
safety; innovation, recognition and reward; 
performance indicators; and local initiatives. 
Group initiatives linked to the Zero Harm 
calendar are proactive and evidence-based. 
These include focused quarterly campaigns 
and Group-wide stand downs on key 
topics. In 2017 these included: interfaces 
between people and plant; excavations 
and underground services; winter working; 
working at height; environment interfaces 
with water and spills; treating health like 
safety; mental health; and dust.
Many parts of Balfour Beatty’s business 
reached millions of hours incident 
free, demonstrating that Zero Harm is 
achievable. Group-wide leading and 
lagging key performance indicators 
trended positively, with continued strong 
performance in the UK. The Group’s Lost 
Time Injury Rate (LTIR) increased from 
0.31 to 0.39, but improved from 0.22 to 
0.17 excluding the Group’s international 
joint ventures. 
Central to sustainable delivery of Zero 
Harm is Balfour Beatty’s Making Safety 
Personal (MSP) programme, based 
around four simple golden rules. In 2016 
the focus was engagement through 
workforce observations, which achieved 
a dramatic increase and this trend has 
continued into 2017. 2017 saw the roll-out 
of the MSP 1 foundation programme 
for everyone on making safe choices 
and the MSP 4 leadership programme. 
Further modules (MSP 2 and MSP 3) 
were successfully piloted.
Balfour Beatty’s industry-leading 
commitment to treating health like 
safety continues to focus on eliminating 
occupational disease and ill health. 
In the UK, Balfour Beatty was a founding 
member and remains actively engaged 
in the Health in Construction Leadership 
Group (HCLG). In 2017 the HCLG brought 
industry leaders, clients and contractors 
together in the follow-up to 2016’s ground-
breaking summit ‘Committing Construction 
to a Healthier Future’. The equally 
successful 2017 summit focused on how 
the 2016 commitment had been turned 
to action and the next steps for the future. 
One of these steps was the formation 
of the Mates in Mind charity to support 
UK construction workers. Balfour Beatty 
actively supports the charity and was one 
of ﬁve piloting organisations. Balfour Beatty 
has committed to rolling out the Mates 
in Mind programme to over 75% of its 
workforce by 2020. In 2017 Balfour Beatty 
trained 980 of its UK workforce and supply 
chain in mental health ﬁrst aid, supervisor 
training and starting the conversation 
around mental health. 
The business continued to win awards for 
its health and safety performance. In the 
UK, the Area 10 highways maintenance 
contract won Safety Project of the Year 
at the Chartered Institution of Highways 
& Transportation North West Awards. 
Balfour Beatty also won several national 
awards, including a RoSPA Gold award for 
outstanding safety performance by the 
Sellaﬁeld Box Encapsulation Plant Delivery 
Team (BEPDT). Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick 
was presented with the Engineering 
Construction Industry Association Safe 
Working Award. In the US, Balfour Beatty 
Rail was awarded its ﬁfth Platinum 
National Safe Railroad Contractor of the 
Year for its commitment to Zero Harm.
Employee survey results across the 
Group rated consistently highly on health 
and safety questions, a strong indicator 
of engagement. An independent review 
of the supply chain indicated that 81% 
believe Balfour Beatty is leading on health 
and safety. 
Sadly, despite these positive 
improvements, three workers lost their 
lives across the Group in 2017, two in 
the US and one in the Gammon joint 
venture in Hong Kong. All three workers 
were subcontractors. Each fatal accident 
was subject to a thorough investigation

People and leadership
The Build to Last transformation 
programme continues to be the foundation 
of the Group people plan. The central 
focus in 2017 has been on enhancing 
the Leadership development offering, 
improving employee engagement 
and supporting training and capability 
development through the Balfour Beatty 
Academy. Steps have also been taken 
to develop systems and further improve 
efﬁciency, including the launch of a UK 
self-service portal for administration, payroll 
and employee requests and queries.
Continued strong investment and focus 
on people and capability development 
resulted in the delivery of training to nearly 
3,000 delegates in the UK (an increase 
of 148% on 2016). Expectations around 
leadership and behaviours for high 
performance have been clariﬁed through 
the expansion of Balfour Beatty’s 
Behaviours and design of a comprehensive 
development offer to support leadership 
and management capability. In the US, the 
Propel Leadership Program is designed 
to gather high-performers on a regular 
basis to collaborate and learn new 
leadership talents.
The developmental programmes operate 
within the context of a Group-wide talent 
review process, ensuring consistent 
methodology and visibility of talent so that 
succession planning, leadership training 
and development interventions are applied 
in the most effective way. 
The Group’s development offer spans all 
roles, job families and levels. Key areas 
of focus were the Leading 4 Success 
leadership development programme in 
UK Construction, building line manager 
capability via Brilliant Basics and investing 
in development programmes for Project 
Leaders in Major Projects and Contract 
Leaders in Power. The Future Leaders 
programme was launched, bringing 
together talent from across the UK 
business, with the core objectives of 
investing in future leadership capability and 
potential, retaining talent and developing 
the leadership pipeline. In addition to 
formal programmes, bespoke development 
has been delivered through individual 
coaching, mentoring and structured 
feedback processes.
Employee engagement remains a key 
focus to support and enhance business 
performance. Since 2015, Group-wide 
engagement surveys have taken place 
annually, followed by key actions in 
response to survey results. In the survey 
held in November 2017, the Group 
employee engagement index score 
increased to 60% from 58% in 2016. 
More employees see better opportunities 
now and there are much improved 
responses around people feeling part of 
a team and believing that Balfour Beatty 
has a positive impact on the environment 
and local communities.
Emerging talent
The 5% Club works with UK employers 
and key inﬂuencers to inspire, educate and 
retain a growing number of apprentices, 
sponsored students and graduates 
through ‘earn and learn’ placements. 
The goal of The 5% Club is to increase 
the employment and career prospects 
of today’s youth and equip the UK with 
the skilled workforce it needs to safeguard 
Britain’s economy. Members pledge to 
work towards having a minimum of 5% 
of their employees in ‘earn and learn’ 
positions – apprentices, sponsored 
students and graduate trainees – within 
ﬁve years of joining.
In 2017, the Group recruited 93 graduates, 
124 apprentices and 35 trainees across the 
UK. The proportion of the UK workforce 
in ‘earn and learn’ positions has increased 
from 3.1% in 2014, to 5.3% at the end of 
2017. At 31 December 2017 the Group’s 
UK businesses were supporting 293 
graduates, 292 apprentices, 163 trainees 
and 19 year out industrial placement 
students on a range of schemes.
The 5% Club has recently revised its 
deﬁnition of sponsored students so that it 
now includes those studying for part-time 
further and higher education qualiﬁcations 
where supported by the Company. 
Balfour Beatty has always had a large 
number of employees – known as trainees 
– in these positions and so this has enabled 
the Group to reﬂect the proportion of early 
career employees in whom it is investing.
In the US, Balfour Beatty is committed 
to hiring and developing interns and in 
2017 employed 126 summer interns, 
providing training and on-the-job learning. 
The commitment is further demonstrated 
with the well-established High School 
Mentoring programme in Texas which 
provides educational and professional 
development experience and since its 
inception has hosted numerous high 
school interns and awarded several 
scholarships to students pursuing careers 
in construction management.
Balfour Beatty continues to support UK 
Government reforms on apprenticeships 
for the construction industry, participating 
in the development of a number of new 
Trailblazer standards.
Upskilling the UK’s infrastructure 
workforce
The Balfour Beatty Academy, along with 
the Communities of Practice, continues 
to blend in-house expertise with external 
knowledge to develop the professional 
and technical core of the business. 
Competency frameworks have been 
developed across the core job families to 
identify and support the development of 
key knowledge, skills and expertise. 
2017 has seen the continued investment 
in key strategic training initiatives. As part 
of the Build to Last focus, over 1,000 
employees have undergone training in 
commercial management, business 
development, negotiation skills and 
project management.  balfourbeatty.com/AR2017

Diversity and inclusion
Attracting and retaining the most capable 
talent from all backgrounds is key to 
building a high-performance culture. 
Leo Quinn, Group Chief Executive, is 
the Board-level sponsor for diversity and 
inclusion (D&I), supported by a steering 
committee that leads, advocates and  
co-ordinates diversity initiatives. 
There has been positive action to build 
strong foundations for Balfour Beatty’s 
work in D&I during 2017. The three-year 
UK D&I action plan has been updated and 
is closely aligned to the Group’s values of 
Talk Positively, Collaborate Relentlessly 
and Encourage Constantly, helping to 
build a strong culture of fairness, inclusion 
and respect. Afﬁnity networks, each 
sponsored by a member of the executive 
team, enable employee groups to network, 
share information, drive action and support 
each other. 
In 2017, 257 UK leaders and employees 
attended a programme speciﬁcally linked to 
the objectives of the Group’s D&I agenda. 
To support the creation of an inclusive 
environment, Unconscious Bias workshops 
have been rolled out to employees with 
direct reports. As part of Balfour Beatty’s 
drive to retain female talent, a three-day 
Women in Business career development 
programme has been launched to support 
women in accelerating their careers. 
In February 2017 Balfour Beatty joined the 
Apprentice Diversity Champions Network, 
working with other UK employers to 
increase the diversity of future apprentice 
intakes. A Returners’ programme was 
launched in 2017, to provide career 
placements to people who have been  
on a career break of two years or more. 
The Company’s efforts have been 
recognised externally – being shortlisted 
for a number of awards celebrating the 
Group’s commitment to D&I – along with 
Balfour Beatty employees who have 
featured in the Financial Times Top 100 
LGBT+ Executives and Top 50 Future 
Leaders. Award wins include CECA 
Inspiring Change, Women in Construction 
and Engineering, and Northern 
Power Women. 
The Company’s efforts across D&I have 
also been recognised outside the UK with 
awards including the Contractor of the 
Year Award by the National Association of 
Minority Contractors – Southern California 
Chapter (NAMC), the Company of the Year 
Award at the Women-In-Non-Traditional-
Employment-Roles (WINTER) Annual 
Awards Gala in Los Angeles, as well as 
individual awards to employees including 
the National Advocate of the Year award 
by the Women Construction Owners and 
Executives USA (WCOE) and a Women 
of the Year (Mujeres Del Año) Diversity 
Award by the Regional Hispanic Chamber 
of Commerce. 
Balfour Beatty is improving competitiveness 
within its supply chain by increasing its 
diversity and has spent more than 40% 
of total spend with SMEs over each of 
the last four years. The percentage spent 
with social enterprises and female-owned 
businesses has increased signiﬁcantly 
since 2014. The Group is also collaborating 
across the sector on the CITB funded 
Fairness Inclusion and Respect programme 
to develop a range of free resources for 
use in the supply chain to improve Equality, 
Diversity & Inclusion practice at all tiers.
Strategic partnerships are in place with 
WISE, Business in the Community and 
Stonewall. In 2017 the Group supported 
the Leonard Cheshire Disability Society 
by providing two placements and in 
2018 is sponsoring students through the 
Amos Bursary which supports young 
men of African and Caribbean descent, 
providing work experience placements, 
site tours, career days and mentors. 
In addition, Balfour Beatty recently joined 
companies across the industry to roll out 
Mates in Mind to help tackle the stigma of 
mental health. 
In October 2017, Balfour Beatty’s advocacy 
for the Armed Forces and support for 
employing veterans, encouraging reservists 
and engaging with military charities and 
cadet units saw the Company awarded 
Gold status, with the award being 
presented by His Royal Highness Prince 
Henry of Wales.
The Group remains committed to building 
a workforce of industry-leading people that 
represents the communities it works in. 
It is this commitment and the continued 
engagement of employees that will provide 
the foundations for Balfour Beatty’s 
future growth.

Business Integrity
Balfour Beatty has a well-developed 
Business Integrity programme which 
adopts a behaviours-based approach to 
ensure that the Group’s culture enables 
people to make the right choices and 
empowers them to speak up where others 
have not. The programme was originally 
launched in 2009 and underwent an 
effectiveness review in 2016. As a result 
of this review, a number of changes were 
made to the programme and the Business 
Integrity team’s approach in 2017.
The core of the programme remains the 
Balfour Beatty Code of Conduct, which is 
now web-based and can be accessed from 
any device with an internet connection 
(www.balfourbeattycodeofconduct.com). 
This enables site-based personnel to 
access the Code, along with clients 
and partners.
The changes identiﬁed in response to 
the 2016 review are designed to continue 
the process of embedding the programme 
within the Group in a consistent manner 
and changing behaviour: 
 – as the programme is relatively mature, 
a completely new approach to training 
on the Code of Conduct was launched 
during 2017. The Code of Conduct 
assessment tests knowledge in 12 risk 
areas and training is provided only on 
the areas failed. This has proven to be 
more effective and engaging than the 
previous training 
 – all those who complete the assessment 
are also required to provide a declaration 
about their own knowledge and 
behaviour in respect of the Code of 
Conduct and associated processes. 
This reinforces individual responsibility 
for displaying the right behaviour and 
complying with the Code
 – the Group’s approach to due diligence 
has also been updated by taking 
advantage of the services provided by 
third parties who specialise in collating 
data on individuals and organisations. 
This has made processes more efﬁcient 
and effective
 – a greater connection with the 
businesses was identiﬁed as being a 
requirement for the UK programme. 
This has been addressed by launching 
Business Integrity advisers during 
2017. These 22 individuals work within 
the UK businesses in a variety of roles 
and assist the Business Integrity team 
by communicating Business Integrity 
messages and initiatives, assisting with 
investigations and being a local point of 
contact for Business Integrity issues.
Speak up
Balfour Beatty encourages its staff and the 
wider community to report any concerns 
about unethical conduct. Trends and, where 
appropriate, details of cases raised are 
reported to the Audit and Risk Committee 
and each business unit. Whilst action is 
taken in respect of the immediate issues 
raised, this data also informs the longer 
term strategic direction of the programme. 
Ensuring all in-scope cases are investigated 
continues to be extremely important 
to encourage a change in behaviour 
and support those who raise concerns. 
This continued in 2017 with 100% of 
in-scope cases investigated. 
Areas of focus in 2018
The implementation of the changes to the 
Business Integrity programme will continue 
in 2018 with a particular focus on learning, 
technology, data and developing the 
network of Business Integrity advisers. 
Modern slavery 
Modern slavery is a brutal form of 
organised crime in which people are 
treated as commodities and exploited for 
criminal gain. The International Labour 
Organisation estimates that at any one time 
over 40 million men, women and children 
are working in conditions of modern 
slavery, including trafﬁcked persons. 
The vast majority of these people are in 
the supply chains of legitimate industries. 
Balfour Beatty is committed to working 
within the business and its supply chain 
to ensure a proactive approach is taken 
to tackling hidden labour exploitation and 
eliminating these practices. Further details 
of the Company’s approach to modern 
slavery and its updated Modern Slavery Act 
transparency statement for 2017 can be

Building a sustainable business
Using Our Blueprint to support 
communities and enable growth
Environmental performance
The Group’s sustainability strategy, Our 
Blueprint, sets out how Balfour Beatty will 
deliver long-term economic, social and 
environmental outcomes for its employees, 
customers, society and shareholders. 
It seeks to further embed sustainability 
throughout Balfour Beatty’s operations by 
providing a robust framework. For details 
on Our Blueprint and the Group’s wider 
sustainability performance, please visit:
  www.balfourbeatty.com/sustainability/
sustainability-dashboard/
Optimising environmental performance 
forms a key component of Our Blueprint 
and is essential for driving efﬁciencies and 
winning work. Balfour Beatty has been 
taking steps to reduce its carbon emissions 
and mitigate against the business risks of 
climate change.
The Group has continued to automate the 
collection of sustainability data by investing 
in software and developing in-house 
solutions to benchmark and monitor its 
environmental performance data at project 
level such as its Scope 1 and 2 Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) emissions.
Standards
Sustainability is an integral part of 
modern infrastructure projects: public 
sector customers require conformance 
to standards such as BREEAM, LEED
®
, 
BEAM, Green Mark, and CEEQUAL 
and these are important to planning 
authorities. Meeting these standards has 
resulted in £879 million revenue on green 
infrastructure projects in 2017. The Group’s 
certiﬁcations in this area and its technical 
knowledge improve the whole-life 
performance of customers’ built assets.
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions
The Group has seen a decrease in carbon 
emissions intensity in 2017 compared to 
2016 from 29.5 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent 
(CO 2e)/£m revenue to 22.3 tonnes of 
CO 2e/£m revenue. This has been largely 
driven by concerted efforts to manage 
energy and fuel and reduce associated

GHG emissions. Since establishing the 
baseline in 2010, tonnes of CO 2e/£m 
revenue have dropped by 46.3% from 41.5 
tonnes of CO 2e/£m revenue to 22.3 tonnes 
of CO 2e/£m revenue. The Group’s total 
CO 2e ﬁgure for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, 
has dropped by 113,745 tonnes of CO 2e 
(31.8%) from 357,983 tonnes of CO 2e to 
244,238 tonnes of CO 2e over the same 
period. As evidenced, the Group has made 
signiﬁcant progress in reducing energy 
and fuel consumption and associated 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which is 
leading to reduced operating costs and 
therefore improved value to customers 
and shareholders. Initiatives have included: 
improving the fuel efﬁciency of the Group’s 
ﬂeet; optimising the sizing of generators 
and the power proﬁle of projects; 
improving the energy efﬁciency of site 
cabins; and undertaking energy efﬁciency 
improvements to properties. In addition, 
a number of customers have expressed 
an intention to prequalify contractors on 
the basis of their carbon performance in 
the future which is driving performance in 
this area. 
Balfour Beatty’s 2020 goal is to achieve a 
50% reduction per £ million revenue of its 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions (against a 2010 
baseline). The Group’s performance to date 
illustrates it is on track to meet this target. 
Gammon Construction, the Group’s joint 
venture in Hong Kong/Singapore, accounts 
for approximately 41% of the Group’s 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions. It is certiﬁed 
to ISO 14064-1 international standard for 
quantifying and reporting greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions. Its Scope 1 and 2 
GHG emissions are independently veriﬁed 
by SGS. 
GHG reporting and assurance
Balfour Beatty’s GHG emissions are 
reported in accordance with the UK 
Government’s GHG reporting requirements 
covering all six Kyoto gases. The Group 
uses the operational control approach 
under the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard as at 
31 December 2017 to report emissions 
from its operations around the world. 
However, Balfour Beatty has chosen 
to report only using the location-based 
approach and not the market-based 
approach. Even though Balfour Beatty does 
procure signiﬁcant amounts of renewable 
electricity, the average DEFRA and IEA 
location-based conversion factors have 
been used for carbon reporting purposes in 
order not to detract from reducing energy 
intensive operations. Balfour Beatty’s 
energy consumption in MWh is shown on 
page 36 to allow readers to make more 
informed comparisons of its energy use. 
Although Balfour Beatty’s Scope 1 and 
2 CO
2e emissions dropped by 18.5% 
(55,260 tonnes) over the period from 
2016 to 2017, the number of MWh of 
energy dropped by 17.0% (175,345 MWh). 
This difference can be explained by the 
fact that different fuels have different 
carbon conversion factors, with some 
fuels attracting greater carbon conversion 
factors than others. Furthermore, the MWh 
table does not include fugitive emissions. 
The Energy Use table illustrates that there 
has been a greater switch towards 5% 
biofuel petrol blend and biodiesel different 
blend (other than 5%) accompanied by a 
reduction in both mineral petrol and mineral 
diesel. There has been a 23% reduction in 
5% biodiesel blend use. Balfour Beatty’s 
Scope 1 and 2 CO 2e emissions include 
emissions from assets that are otherwise 
not referred to across the rest of the 
ﬁnancial statements such as energy 
provided by landlords or clients that  
Balfour Beatty does not pay for.
The Group has determined and reported 
the emissions it is responsible for within 
this boundary and does not believe there 
are any material omissions. The Group 
uses the UK Government’s carbon 
conversion factors that were updated 
in 2017 to calculate its emissions into 
equivalent tonnes of carbon dioxide 
(CO 2e) and the IEA’s October 2017 set 
of international conversion factors for 
electricity (Scope 2) except for the UK 
where the UK Government’s conversion 
factors were used as they are more up 
to date. The Group has only reported on 
Heery’s Scope 1 and 2 data until the point 
of sale in October 2017. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

CDP
The Group is committed to addressing 
climate risk and reducing the lifetime 
emissions of the assets it builds, as 
evidenced by its performance in the global 
evaluation standard, the Climate Disclosure 
Project (CDP), where a B rating was 
achieved in 2017, compared to the industry 
average rating of C.
The annual rating is based on CDP’s 
evaluation of the Group’s strategy, goals 
and actual emissions reductions, as well 
as transparency and veriﬁcation of reported 
data. It assesses the completeness and 
quality of Balfour Beatty’s measurement 
and management of carbon footprint, 
climate change strategy, risk management 
processes and outcomes. The score’s 
purpose is to provide a summary of the 
extent to which companies have answered 
these questions in a structured format. 
Balfour Beatty’s B rating indicates that 
its team has provided comprehensive 
information in a transparent and 
open manner.
Community engagement
In many markets the ability to demonstrate 
the social value of the Group’s operations in 
economic terms is vital. To beneﬁt local areas, 
the Group uses local suppliers, employees 
and materials wherever possible, and invests 
in future talent through apprenticeship 
schemes and work placement opportunities.
Involved (Balfour Beatty’s community 
investment programme in the UK) was 
established in 2015 and focuses on three 
key areas where the Group can add value 
to its customers and the local community:
 – local employment and skills
 – supporting local businesses
 – community engagement through 
charitable fundraising, volunteering 
and mentoring.
Wherever the Group operates it seeks 
to integrate within the neighbourhood, 
supporting the local community, 
its businesses and its workforce. 
Involved gives Balfour Beatty the 
opportunity to work within a framework 
whereby the results of its interventions 
are captured and the beneﬁt to society 
shared with its customers and other 
interested parties.
Community investment through 
charitable fundraising
The Balfour Beatty Building Better Futures 
Charitable Trust was formed in 2009 to 
help the most disadvantaged young people 
in society. Through a mix of employee 
fundraising and ﬁnancial support provided 
by the Company, the Trust currently 
supports three charities: Barnardo’s, Coram 
and The Prince’s Trust. In 2017, employees 
raised over £20,964 through Building 
Better Futures. The Company matched this 
with an additional contribution and donated 
a total of £100,000. Since 2013 the Trust 
has raised £181,416 to support Barnardo’s, 
helping over 1,340 young people. 
Since 2010 the Trust has contributed over 
£470,000 to Coram, funding vital services 
for children and young people. 
The Group has been particularly active with 
the Prince’s Trust ‘Get Into’ programmes 
to help more young people into the 
Construction sector. This includes the 
‘Get into Construction’ programme, which 
the Group helped to shape and deliver 
nationally in 2017. Since the beginning 
of the partnership, the Group has raised 
over £1.3 million for the Prince’s Trust. 
In the UK, a further £157,424 was raised 
by employees for charitable purposes. 
The UK business also made in kind 
contributions of £95,107 to charities 
and made direct donations of £101,764.

Across the Group’s operations, employees 
volunteered 12,400 hours for charitable 
causes. This has brought multiple beneﬁts, 
including helping customer relationships, 
engaging with employees and supporting 
local communities.
The US Construction business contributed 
over US$430,000 to charitable causes in 
2017. Some of the organisations receiving 
donations are: 
 – Bridges to Prosperity 
 – American Heart Association
 –Make-A-Wish Foundation
 –YMCA.
In co-ordination with Bridges to Prosperity, 
an 11-member team of Balfour Beatty 
employees from across the US completed 
construction of a 100-metre suspended 
footbridge in Bolivia. The new footbridge 
helps the local community to cross a 
previously impassable river, providing 
access to healthcare, education and 
economic opportunities. 
In California, Balfour Beatty hosted its 
annual Golf Classic that raised more 
than US$135,000 for the Sharefest 
2017 Workday. The tournament raised 
money for seven Workday sites, sending 
230 low-income students to camp and 
providing ﬁve college scholarships to 
local students. 
In Texas, Balfour Beatty employees 
volunteered to mentor high school students 
as part of the ACE Mentor of Dallas 
programme. They taught students how to 
develop construction milestone schedules 
and site logistics plans based on an actual 
1.9 million square-foot, mixed-use project 
in Dallas, Texas. 
In 2017, Gammon Construction and its 
staff contributed to nearly 150 activities and 
community events in Hong Kong, mainland 
China and Singapore and provided 
over HK$2.4 million in sponsorships, 
scholarships and charitable donations. 
Gammon’s Next Generation Sustainability 
Panel and Young Professionals Group 
co-organised a three-month renovation 
project for the Fung Yuen Butterﬂy 
Reserve’s footpath network. Gammon’s 
Concrete Technology Department 
produced 2,700 paving bricks from waste 
concrete for the path renovations. 
In December 2017, the Tuen Mun-Chek 
Lap Kok viaduct link project team received 
an Outstanding Award from the Hong 
Kong Student Aid Society in recognition 
of its voluntary work repairing the Tung 
Wan Mok Law Shui Wah school and island 
hostel that were damaged by typhoons. 
Tax strategy
Balfour Beatty recognises that paying taxes 
arising from its activities is an important 
part of how it contributes to the societies 
which it helps to build. The Group makes 
a major contribution to the tax revenues of 
governments in the numerous territories in 
which it operates. For example, the Group’s 
tax contribution extends signiﬁcantly 
beyond corporation tax and the collection 
of substantial amounts of income tax 
and includes the payment of signiﬁcant 
employer social security contributions.
The Group’s tax strategy, approved by 
the Board, is to sustainably minimise 
tax cost whilst complying with the law. 
In doing so, it ensures it acts in accordance 
with Balfour Beatty’s ethics, values and 
Business Integrity programme.
The Group aims to meet all legal 
requirements, ﬁling all appropriate 
tax returns and making tax payments 
accurately and on time.
The Group’s tax strategy applies to all 
territories in which it does business.
Tax governance
Balfour Beatty has clear tax policies, 
procedures and controls in place which are 
overseen by the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer. 
A dedicated internal tax team, led by the 
Group Head of Tax, is responsible for the 
implementation of the Group’s tax strategy 
and supporting tax policies. Members of 
the tax team are highly experienced with 
appropriate professional qualiﬁcations 
and experience which reﬂect the 
responsibilities required for their roles. 
Tax risk appetite
The Group manages its tax affairs in a 
proactive manner that seeks to maximise 
shareholder value. The Group does not 
enter into artiﬁcial arrangements that lack 
commercial purpose in order to secure a 
tax advantage. The aim is to ensure full 
compliance with all statutory obligations 
and as a consequence attempt to minimise 
risk wherever possible.
Managing tax risk
There are a number of factors that affect 
the Group’s tax risk and these arise both 
internally and externally. Balfour Beatty’s 
ability to control these factors varies and its 
internal tax team works to minimise these 
risks to an acceptable level. For example:
 – new and developing tax legislation 
is monitored and where it is 
relevant Balfour Beatty participates 
in consultations issued by the tax 
authorities. When new or changed 
legislation is announced, the impact 
on the Group is assessed and active 
measures are taken to ensure there are 
adequate processes in place to comply 
with any change
 – tax risks in relation to compliance and 
reporting are managed by meeting 
regularly with professional advisers, 
industry groups and the tax authorities 
to both keep abreast of changes in these 
areas and to seek information on new 
systems and software 
 – risk in relation to tax in general is 
managed by the internal tax team and 
if a position is uncertain the Group may 
obtain third-party advice in order to gain 
clarity or support for a particular stance 
or approach.
Interaction with tax authorities
Balfour Beatty’s approach to its tax 
affairs is supported by an open, honest 
and positive working relationship with 
the tax authorities, with regular dialogue. 
Should any dispute arise with regard to the 
interpretation and application of tax law, 
the Group is committed to addressing the 
matter promptly and resolving it in an open 
and constructive manner. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Measuring our performance
Providing clarity on the Group’s  
alternative performance measures
Following the issuance of the Guidelines 
on Alternative Performance Measures 
(APMs) by the European Securities and 
Markets Authorities (ESMA) in June 2015, 
the Group has included this section in its 
Annual Report and Accounts with the 
aim of providing transparency and clarity 
on the measures adopted internally to 
assess performance. 
Throughout this report, the Group has 
presented ﬁnancial performance measures 
which are considered most relevant to 
Balfour Beatty and are used to manage the 
Group’s performance. 
These measures are chosen to provide a 
balanced view of the Group’s operations 
and are considered useful to investors 
as these measures provide relevant 
information on the Group’s past or future 
performance, position or cash ﬂows. 
The APMs adopted by the Group are also 
commonly used in the sectors it operates 
in and therefore serve as a useful aid for 
investors to compare Balfour Beatty’s 
performance to its peers. 
The Board believes that disclosing 
these performance measures enhances 
investors’ ability to evaluate and assess 
the underlying ﬁnancial performance of 
the Group’s continuing operations and the 
related key business drivers. 
These ﬁnancial performance measures are 
also aligned to measures used internally 
to assess business performance in the 
Group’s budgeting process and when 
determining compensation. 
Equivalent information cannot be presented 
by using ﬁnancial measures deﬁned in the 
ﬁnancial reporting framework alone. 
Readers of the Annual Report and 
Accounts are encouraged to review the 
ﬁnancial statements in their entirety.
Performance measures used to assess 
the Group’s operations in the year 
Underlying proﬁt from operations (PFO) 
Underlying PFO is presented before 
ﬁnance cost and interest income and is the 
key measure used to assess the Group’s 
performance in the Construction Services 
and Support Services segments. This is 
also a common measure used by the 
Group’s peers operating in these sectors. 
This measure reﬂects the returns to the 
Group from services provided in these 
operations that are generated from 
activities that are not ﬁnancing in nature 
and therefore an underlying pre-ﬁnance 
cost measure is more suited to assessing 
underlying performance. 
Underlying proﬁt before tax (PBT)
The Group assesses performance in its 
Infrastructure Investments segment using 
an underlying PBT measure. This differs 
from the underlying PFO measure used 
to measure the Group’s Construction 
Services and Support Services segments 
because in addition to margins generated 
from operations, there are returns to the 
Investments business which are generated 
from the ﬁnancing element of its projects. 
These returns take the form of 
subordinated debt interest receivable and 
interest receivable on PPP ﬁnancial assets 
which are included in the Group’s income 
statement in investment income. These are 
then offset by the ﬁnance cost incurred on 
the non-recourse debt associated with the 
underlying projects, which is included in the 
Group’s income statement in ﬁnance costs. 
Measuring the Group’s performance
The following measures are referred 
to in this Annual Report and Accounts 
when reporting performance, both in 
absolute terms and also in comparison 
to earlier years: 
Statutory measures 
Statutory measures are derived from the 
Group’s reported ﬁnancial statements, 
which are prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB). 
Where a standard allows certain 
interpretations to be adopted, the Group 
has applied its accounting policies 
consistently. These accounting policies 
can be found on pages 102 to 109.
The Group’s statutory measures take 
into account all of the factors, including 
those that it cannot inﬂuence (principally 
foreign currency ﬂuctuations) and also large 
non-recurring items which do not reﬂect 
the ongoing underlying performance of 
the Group. 
Performance measures 
In assessing its performance, the Group 
has adopted certain non-statutory 
measures because, unlike its statutory 
measures, these cannot be derived directly 
from its ﬁnancial statements. 
The Group commonly uses the following 
measures to assess its performance: 
a) Order book
The Group’s disclosure of its order book is 
aimed to provide insight into its pipeline of 
work and future performance. The Group’s 
order book is not a measure of past 
performance and therefore cannot be 
derived from its ﬁnancial statements. 
The Group’s order book comprises the 
unexecuted element of orders on contracts 
that have been secured. Where contracts 
are subject to variations, only secured 
contract variations are included in the 
reported order book.
Where contracts fall under framework 
agreements, an estimate is made of orders 
to be secured under that framework 
agreement. This is based on historical 
trends from similar framework agreements 
delivered in the past and the estimate of 
orders included in the order book is that 
which is probable to be secured. 
b) Underlying performance
The Group adjusts for certain 
non-underlying items which the Board 
believes assists in understanding the 
performance achieved by the Group. 
These items include: 
 – gains and losses on the disposal of 
businesses and investments, unless 
this is part of a programme of releasing 
value from the disposal of similar 
businesses or investments such as 
infrastructure concessions
 – costs of major restructuring and 
reorganisation of existing businesses
 – acquisition and similar costs related 
to business combinations such as 
transaction costs
 – impairment and amortisation charges 
on intangible assets arising on business 
combinations (amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets). These are non-
underlying costs as they do not relate 
to the underlying performance of 
the Group. 
From time to time, it may be appropriate 
to disclose further items as non-underlying 
items in order to reﬂect the underlying 
performance of the Group. 
The results of Rail Germany have been 
treated as non-underlying items as the 
Group is committed to exiting this part 
of the business. 
Further details of these non-underlying 
items are provided in Note 10. balfourbeatty.com/AR2017

e) Revenue including share of joint ventures and associates (JVAs)
The Group uses a revenue measure which is inclusive of its share of revenue generated from its JVAs. As the Group uses revenue as a 
measure of the level of activity performed by the Group during the year, the Board believes that including revenue that is earned from its 
JVAs better reﬂects the size of the business and the volume of work carried out and more appropriately compares to PFO. 
This differs from the statutory measure of revenue which presents Group revenue from its subsidiaries. 
A reconciliation of the statutory measure of revenue to the Group’s performance measure is shown in the tables in section (b). A comparison 
of the growth rates in statutory and performance revenue can be found in section (i).
f) Recourse net cash/borrowings
The Group also measures its performance based on its net cash/borrowings position at the period end. This is analysed using only elements 
that are recourse to the Group and excludes the liability component of the Company’s preference shares, which is debt in nature according 
to statutory measures, as this is excluded from the deﬁnition of net debt in the covenants set out in the Group’s facilities. 
Non-recourse elements are cash and debt that are ringfenced within certain infrastructure concession project companies.

g) Average net cash/borrowings
The Group uses an average net cash/borrowings measure as this reﬂects its ﬁnancing requirements throughout the period. The Group 
calculates its average net cash/borrowings based on the average opening and closing ﬁgures for each month through the period. 
The average net cash/borrowings measure excludes non-recourse cash and debt and the liability component of the Company’s preference 
shares, and this performance measure shows average net cash of £42 million for 2017 (2016: £46 million net borrowings). 
Using a statutory measure (inclusive of non-recourse elements and the liability component of the Company’s preference shares) gives 
average net borrowings of £117 million for 2017 (2016: £230 million).  Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Providing clarity on the Group’s alternative performance measures continued
h) Directors’ valuation of the Investments portfolio
The Group uses a different methodology to assess the value of its Investments portfolio. As described on pages 26 to 28, the Directors’ 
valuation has been undertaken using forecast cash ﬂows for each project based on progress to date and market expectations of future 
performance. These cash ﬂows have been discounted using different discount rates depending on project risk and maturity, reﬂecting 
secondary market transaction experience. As such, the Board believes that this measure better reﬂects the potential returns to the Group 
from this portfolio. 
The Directors have valued the Investments portfolio at £1.24 billion at year end (2016: £1.22 billion). The Directors’ valuation will differ from 
the statutory carrying value of these investments, which are accounted for using the relevant standards in accordance with IFRS rather than 
a discounted cash ﬂow approach.

^ 2017 valuation includes £62 million relating to the 7.5% second partial disposal of the Connect Plus M25 asset, as the disposal proceeds had not been received at year end. 
The proceeds were subsequently received on 23 February 2018.
The difference between the statutory measure and the Directors’ valuation (performance measure) of the Group’s Investments portfolio is 
not equal to the gain on disposal that would result if the portfolio was fully disposed at the Directors’ valuation. This is because the gain/loss 
on disposal would be affected by the recycling of items which were previously recognised directly within reserves, which are material and 
can alter the resulting gain/loss on disposal.
The statutory measure and the Directors’ valuation are fundamentally different due to the different methodologies used to derive the 
valuation of these assets within the Investments portfolio. 
As referred to in the Strategic Report on page 26, the Directors’ valuation is calculated using discounted cash ﬂows. In deriving these cash 
ﬂows, assumptions have been made and different discount rates used which are updated at each valuation date. 
Unlike the Directors’ valuation, the assets measured under statutory measures using the appropriate IFRS accounting standards are valued 
using a combination of the following methods: 
 –historical cost
 – amortised cost 
 – fair value for certain assets and liabilities within the PPP portfolio, for which some assumptions are set at inception and some are updated 
at each reporting period.
There is also an element of the Directors’ valuation that is not represented by an asset in the Group’s balance sheet. This relates to the 
management services contracts within the Investments business that are valued in the Directors’ valuation based on the future income 
stream expected from these contracts.

i) Constant exchange rates (CER) 
The Group operates across a variety of geographic locations and in its statutory results, the results of its overseas entities are translated 
into the Group’s presentational currency at average rates of exchange for the period. The Group’s key exchange rates applied in deriving 
its statutory results are shown in Note 3. 
To measure changes in the Group’s performance compared with the previous period without the effects of foreign currency ﬂuctuations, the 
Group provides growth rates on a CER basis. These measures remove the effects of currency movements by retranslating the prior period’s 
ﬁgures at the current period’s exchange rates, using average rates for revenue and closing rates for order book. A comparison of the Group’s 
statutory growth rate to the CER growth rate is provided in the table below:

Chief Financial Ofﬁcer’s review
Group ﬁnancial summary
In 2017, Balfour Beatty delivered a strong 
ﬁnancial performance. The Group’s income 
statement, cash ﬂow and balance sheet all 
strengthened as the progress made with 
Phase Two of Build to Last translated into 
improved ﬁnancial metrics. 
In the Group income statement, 
revenue was ﬂat, gross proﬁt increased 
and overheads reduced – resulting in 
increased proﬁtability. Underlying proﬁt 
from operations margins increased in all 
business segments as the Group remains 
on track to deliver industry-standard 
margins in the second half of 2018. 
Year end net cash stood at £335 million 
and importantly average net cash for the 
year was £42 million. 
The order book at £11.4 billion decreased 
by 8%, down 3% at constant exchange 
rates (CER), compared to prior year 
(2016: £12.4 billion). The year end 
£11.4 billion is directly in line with the 
order book at 30 June 2017. 
Underlying revenue was ﬂat at 
£8,234 million (2016: £8,215 million) 
as the Group continued with its more 
disciplined and selective approach to 
bidding. Underlying revenue at CER fell by 
3%. Statutory revenue, which excludes 
joint ventures and associates, was 
£6,916 million (2016: £6,923 million). 
Construction Services underlying 
revenue was up 2% (down 2% at CER) 
at £6,649 million (2016: £6,537 million) 
as growth in the US offset an expected 
decline in the UK. Support Services 
underlying revenue declined 4% at 
£1,061 million (2016: £1,103 million) as 
an increase in utilities was more than 
offset by lower transportation revenues.
Underlying proﬁt from operations increased 
to £196 million (2016: £69 million), 
with Construction Services, Support 
Services and Infrastructure Investments 
all reporting improved proﬁtability in the 
period. Underlying proﬁt from operations 
increased at all geographical business 
segments within Construction Services. 
Statutory proﬁt from operations increased 
to £148 million (2016: £17 million), primarily 
driven by the increase in underlying proﬁts.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 45 Strategic Report
Construction Services improved from 
a loss of £21 million in 2016, to a proﬁt 
from operations of £72 million in 2017 
as UK Construction reported a proﬁt of 
£16 million in the period (2016: £65 million 
loss). Support Services also improved, 
with underlying proﬁt from operations 
of £41 million (2016: £34 million). 
Infrastructure Investments increased 
from prior year, as partial sell-downs of 
the Connect Plus M25 asset generated 
an £86 million proﬁt on disposal of assets 
from the portfolio (2016: £65 million). 
Net ﬁnance costs increased to 
£31 million (2016: £7 million). The prior year 
comparison beneﬁted from a £19 million 
gain on foreign currency deposits, with the 
corresponding gain in 2017 at £1 million. 
Underlying pre-tax proﬁt from continuing 
operations increased to £165 million 
(2016: £62 million). The taxation charge 
on underlying proﬁts increased to 
£23 million (2016: £12 million). 
Underlying proﬁt after tax including 
discontinued operations for the year at 
£143 million (2016: £48 million) represents 
a material improvement over the previous 
year, primarily driven by the improvement 
in Construction Services. Total statutory 
proﬁt after tax for the year was £168 million 
(2016: £24 million), as a result of the net 
effect of non-underlying items.
Non-underlying items
The Board believes non-underlying items 
should be separately identiﬁed on the 
face of the income statement to assist 
in understanding the underlying ﬁnancial 
performance achieved by the Group. 
Non-underlying items of £20 million were 
a net credit to the proﬁt for the year from 
continuing operations (2016: £48 million 
net charge).
During the year signiﬁcant actuarial gains 
in the Group’s main pension fund, the 
Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (BBPF), 
led to the recognition of a deferred tax 
liability which was accounted for through 
reserves in line with the treatment of the 
pension movement. This, in turn, led to the 
recognition of additional UK deferred tax 
assets of £34 million which resulted in a 
tax credit being recognised in the income 
statement as a non-underlying item. 
The US Government has reduced the 
Federal corporate income tax rate from 
35% to 21% with effect from 1 January 
2018. The net impact of this change in 
2017 was a non-underlying £32 million tax 
credit in the income statement. 
On 15 January 2018, Carillion plc ﬁled for 
compulsory liquidation. Carillion was one 
of the Group’s joint operations partners in 
the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route 
(AWPR) project on a joint and several basis. 
As a result of Carillion’s liquidation, the 
Group and its remaining joint operations 
partner on the project, Galliford Try plc, are 
jointly liable to deliver Carillion’s remaining 
obligations on this contract in addition 
to each partner’s existing 33% share. 
As a result, the Group has recognised 
a one-off non-underlying loss provision 
of £44 million in 2017 which reﬂects the 
Group’s additional loss on the contract as a 
result of Carillion’s liquidation. The contract 
is expected to complete in the summer 
of 2018.
Other items included: £12 million of 
restructuring costs incurred relating to 
the Group’s Build to Last transformation 
programme; a £9 million charge relating 
to the amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets; and a £18 million gain on the 
disposal of Heery International Inc.
Taxation
The Group’s underlying proﬁt before tax 
from continuing operations for subsidiaries 
of £106 million (2016: £5 million) resulted 
in an underlying tax charge of £23 million 
(2016: £12 million).
Discontinued operations
The Group has presented its 49% 
interests in its Middle East joint ventures 
as discontinued operations in 2017, with 
comparatives restated accordingly. The sale 
of these interests was completed in March 
2017 and resulted in a non-underlying gain 
on disposal of £5 million in 2017.
Earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share from 
continuing operations were 20.9 pence 
(2016: 7.2 pence), which, along with 
a non-underlying earnings per share 
from continuing operations of 2.8 pence 
(2016: 7.0 pence loss), gave a total 
basic earnings per share for continuing 
operations of 23.7 pence (2016: 0.2 pence). 
Discontinued operations contributed 
0.1 pence (2016: 0.2 pence loss) to 
the total underlying basic earnings of 
21.0 pence per share (2016: 7.0 pence). 
Total basic earnings per share were 
24.7 pence (2016: 3.5 pence). 
Cash ﬂow performance
The total cash movement in the period 
resulted in a £162 million increase 
(2016: £10 million) to the Group’s net cash 
position to £335 million (2016: £173 million) 
driven by operating cash ﬂows and 
proceeds from investment disposals, partly 
offset by new investments in infrastructure 
assets and pension deﬁcit payments.
The £162 million improvement is primarily 
as a result of the continuing recovery in 
proﬁtability of the Group’s earnings-based 
businesses, particularly UK Construction. 
Operating cash ﬂows, before movements 
in working capital and pension deﬁcit 
payments, improved to an inﬂow of 
£39 million (2016: £58 million outﬂow). 
Working capital had an inﬂow of £27 million 
(2016: £48 million outﬂow) and pension 
deﬁcit payments were an outﬂow of 
£25 million (2016: £41 million).

Working capital
The Group has maintained the strong 
working capital position from December 
2016, with an inﬂow of £27 million in 2017 
(2016: £48 million outﬂow). 
Trade and other payables decreased 
during 2017, creating a working capital 
outﬂow of £92 million (2016: £60 million 
outﬂow), offset by a working capital 
inﬂow of £95 million (2016: £134 million 
outﬂow) from trade and other receivables. 
The offsetting reduction in both balances 
is predominantly due to contract timings 
and associated customer and supplier 
payments compared to the prior year and 
the ongoing completion of historical non-
underlying contracts.
Including the impact of foreign exchange 
and non-operating items, negative (i.e. 
favourable) working capital decreased 
to £888 million at 31 December 2017 
(2016: £894 million).

Net cash/borrowings 
The Group’s net cash position at 
31 December 2017, excluding non-
recourse net borrowings, was £335 million 
(2016: £173 million). Non-recourse 
net borrowings, held in wholly-owned 
infrastructure concessions, increased 
to £305 million (2016: £233 million). 
The balance sheet also includes 
£103 million (2016: £100 million) for the 
liability component of the preference 
shares. Statutory net debt at 31 December 
2017 was £73 million (2016: £160 million).
Pensions
Following the formal triennial funding 
valuation of the Balfour Beatty Pension 
Fund (BBPF) at 31 March 2016, the 
Company and the trustees agreed the 
key commercial principles of a plan 
for the BBPF to reach self-sufﬁciency 
during 2027, some three years earlier 
than previously planned. Under this plan 
Balfour Beatty will make cash contributions 
totalling £140 million over the next six 
years. There is an agreed dividend sharing 
mechanism such that if the dividend cover 
ratio falls below 2x from 2018 onwards, 
funding to the BBPF will be accelerated. 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer’s review
Following the formal triennial funding 
valuation of the Railways Pension Scheme 
as at 31 December 2016, the Group agreed 
to make ongoing deﬁcit contributions of 
£6 million per annum which should reduce 
the deﬁcit to zero by 2027.
The Group’s balance sheet includes net 
retirement beneﬁt assets of £32 million 
(2016: £231 million liabilities) representing 
net surpluses in the Group’s pension 
schemes, as measured on an IAS 19 
basis. This is primarily due to net actuarial 
gains of £242 million in the year within 
the Statement of Other Comprehensive 
Income, including a gain of £123 million 
from changes in discount rate methodology.
Goodwill 
The goodwill on the Group’s balance 
sheet at 31 December 2017 decreased 
to £874 million (2016: £937 million). 
The decrease was due to currency 
translation differences of £46 million and 
the disposal of goodwill relating to Heery 
International Inc of £17 million. The Group 
has conducted impairment reviews on its 
goodwill balance at the year end and has 
concluded that it was fully recoverable. 
Impact of IFRS 15
The Directors have completed their 
assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 
The Group will adopt the new standard 
from 1 January 2018 with the opening 
equity position as at 1 January 2018 
restated by a credit of £3 million to reﬂect 
the impact of transitioning to the new 
accounting standard. This adjustment 
primarily reﬂects the impact of unbundling 
a handful of contracts according to the 
Group’s assessment of its performance 
obligation to be delivered to the customer. 
Using the ﬁve-step model required by the 
new standard, the impact of the £3 million 
credit to equity represents the acceleration 
of revenue on transition to IFRS 15 which 
was not recognised by the Group under the 
previous revenue standards. IFRS 15 would 
have resulted in an immaterial impact on 
the Group’s income statement for the year 
ended 31 December 2017.
Banking facilities
The Group’s committed revolving credit 
facility totals £400 million. The purpose 
of this facility is to provide liquidity 
from a set of core relationship banks to 
support Balfour Beatty in its activities. 
The Group completed its reﬁnancing in 
December 2015 with the £400 million 
facility extending through to 2018. 
In November 2017, £375 million of the 
facility was extended until December 2020. 
At 31 December 2017, all of this facility 
was undrawn. 
Outlook
The Build to Last transformation 
programme is designed to deliver superior 
returns over the medium term for all 
stakeholders, from a Group which is Lean, 
Expert, Trusted and Safe. As a result of the 
successful self-help actions taken in Phase 
One, Balfour Beatty now has a strong 
foundation on which to deliver sustainable, 
proﬁtable growth. 
In Phase Two (24-month period to the 
end of 2018), the Group expects each of 
its Construction Services and Support 
Services businesses to continue their 
positive trajectory to achieve industry-
standard margins. Speciﬁcally, for these 
earnings-based businesses, the underlying 
proﬁt from operations margin targets are 
as follows:
UK Construction 2%-3%
US Construction 1%-2%
Support Services 3%-5%
The Group is on track to achieve industry-
standard margins in the second half of 
2018 as it continues to drive three key 
levers for improved ﬁnancial performance: 
ﬁnalising the remaining historical contracts 
through to completion; reducing costs and 
raising productivity across its operations; 
and executing on the improved quality of 
the order book. 
For Infrastructure Investments, during 
Phase Two of Build to Last, the Group will 
continue to sell assets, as appropriate, to 
maximise value to shareholders and invest 
in new opportunities. 
In Phase Three (2019+), Balfour Beatty 
aims to command a premium to industry-
standard margins as market-leading 
strength should be matched by market-
leading performance.
Dividend
Following the 1.2 pence per share 
dividend declared at the half-year, the 
Board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend 
of 2.4 pence per share, giving a total 
recommended dividend for the year of 
3.6 pence per share (2016: 2.7 pence). balfourbeatty.com/AR2017
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 47 Strategic Report
The Board recognises the importance of 
dividends to shareholders and anticipates a 
progressive dividend policy going forward.
Financial risk factors and going concern
The key ﬁnancial risk factors for the Group 
remain largely unchanged. 
The Group’s US private placement and 
committed bank facilities contain certain 
ﬁnancial covenants, such as the ratio of 
the Group’s EBITDA to its net debt which 
needs to be less than 3.0 and the ratio of its 
EBITA to net borrowing costs which needs 
to be in excess of 3.0. These covenants 
are tested on a rolling 12-month basis 
as at the June and December reporting 
dates. At 31 December 2017, both these 
covenants were passed as the Group had 
net cash and net interest income from a 
covenant test perspective. 
The Group is forecasting to remain within 
its banking covenants during the going 
concern assessment period.
The Directors have acknowledged the 
guidance Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: 
Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 
2009 published by the Financial Reporting 
Council in October 2009. In reviewing 
the future prospects of the Group, the 
following factors are relevant:
 – the Group has a strong order backlog
 – there continues to be underlying demand 
in infrastructure markets in the countries 
in which the Group operates
 – excluding the non-recourse net 
borrowings of PPP subsidiaries, 
the Group had net cash balances of 
£335 million at 31 December 2017
 – the Group’s portfolio of PPP investments 
comprises reasonably realisable 
securities which can be sold to meet 
funding requirements as necessary
 – the Group has access to committed 
credit facilities totalling £400 million 
through to December 2018 and 
£375 million to December 2020. 
At 31 December 2017, this facility was 
wholly undrawn. 
Based on the above and having made 
appropriate enquiries and reviewed 
medium-term cash forecasts, the Directors 
consider it reasonable to assume that the 
Group and the Company have adequate 
resources to continue for the foreseeable 
future and, for this reason, have continued 
to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
To appreciate the prospects for the Group 
as a whole, the complete Annual Report 
and Accounts 2017 needs to be read.

Introduction
Balfour Beatty’s risk management process continues to evolve 
to ensure it is reﬂective of the shape of the business and its 
operations. In 2017, the Enterprise Risk management team was 
repositioned to be fully aligned with the Internal Audit function 
to further sharpen the focus on the Group’s internal risk and 
control environment. The Group recognises that a consistent, 
agile and responsive approach to risk management is crucial 
to the sustainable delivery of its business objectives. 
Oversight 
To meet the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Board accepts overall responsibility for risk management 
and determines the nature and extent of the principal risks to be 
taken and assesses the effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal control systems that are in place to mitigate impacts. 
The business has in place several well established processes 
including the Gated Lifecycle and Project on a Page to enable senior 
leadership to engage with the work winning and operational teams 
to understand the Group’s risk exposure and manage it correctly.
Common risk infrastructure 
The dynamic structure of the Group’s risk management process 
allows the Group Chief Executive to monitor the risk proﬁle of the 
business via the Executive Risk Steering Group. Members of the 
steering group act as the executive sponsor for risk management 
within their business and functions and as such are in a position 
to directly inﬂuence custom and practice. The steering group 
undertook a reassessment of the Group Risk Register in 2017 
including mapping and assessing the internal control environment 
against an updated and more granular probability and impact matrix. 
Risk process 
The Enterprise Risk management team engages with the wider 
risk management leadership teams in a number of ways including 
Strategic Business Unit committees, a community of practice 
and day-to-day liaison. This two-way information share involves 
disseminating best practice on risk management across the 
enabling functions and businesses to ensure consistency of 
assessment and treatment of risk. As part of the Build to Last 
programme the application of effective risk management has 
been greatly improved and this culture will be further embedded 
in 2018 with the launch of Group Minimum Expectations for 
Risk Management.
Assessment 
The Gated Lifecycle remains central to Balfour Beatty’s risk 
management process with a mandatory assessment of risk and 
risk appetite being made at each review gate. In-house project 
management includes assessment and subsequent rating of risk 
and reinforcement of the importance of adherence to the Group’s 
commercial policies and practices. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Risk appetite
Balfour Beatty is 
committed to the 
transformation programme.
In driving out unnecessary 
cost and improving 
efﬁciencies it is essential to 
take some operational risk.
Such risks must not be at 
the expense of achieving 
the overall lean objective.

Risk appetite
Understanding risk is at the heart of Balfour Beatty’s decision-making process.
An ongoing appraisal of the Group’s risk proﬁle is made by the Board. The level of risk the Group is willing to accept is deﬁned as its risk 
appetite and has been set in the context of the interaction between risk assessment processes and its ability to mitigate and exert control 
over existing and emerging risks. Risk appetite within any organisation must be dynamic and determined by senior leaders and practitioners 
to ensure it is embedded in critical business processes.

Principal risks
Understanding our risk proﬁle
Understanding Balfour Beatty’s risk proﬁle and establishing the most effective way to manage, accept or transfer risk is central to the 
Group’s decision-making process. As such, the Board has made a robust assessment of the principal risks which the Group faces, the 
controls in place to remove or mitigate these risks and also whether these risks represent new, increased or decreased threats. 
The Group recognises that its risk proﬁle comprises interlinked and discrete risks. The principal risks as set out below should therefore 
be considered alongside the viability statement on page 57 and the discussion on ﬁnancial risk factors and going concern on page 47.

Risk description
The Group works on signiﬁcant, complex and 
potentially hazardous projects which require 
continuous monitoring and management of 
health and safety risks.
Causes
Some common themes where health 
and safety risks could arise are recognised 
and communicated, including:
 – risk identiﬁcation/assessment
 – processes that fail to deliver risk 
elimination or mitigation
 – failure in safety leadership
 – management of subcontractors
 – not brieﬁng people properly before 
setting them to work
 – failure to follow procedures
 – ongoing change programme and 
performance pressures, which may have 
an effect on people and their ability to 
remain focused on health and safety risks.
What impact it might have
Failure to manage these risks gives the potential for signiﬁcant harm to, or even the death of, 
employees, subcontractor staff or members of the public, as well as the potential for criminal 
prosecutions, signiﬁcant ﬁnes, debarment and reputational damage.
How it is mitigated
Balfour Beatty has detailed health and safety policies, procedures and initiatives to 
minimise such risks. These are reviewed and monitored by management and external 
veriﬁcation bodies.
Each business has experienced health and safety professionals in place who provide advice 
and support and undertake regular reviews.
The Safety and Sustainability Committee of the Board, as well as business-level Health and 
Safety executive leadership teams, meet regularly throughout the year to develop a consistent 
approach to health and safety best practice.
Training programmes (including behavioural) are in place.
Zero Harm action plans continue to be implemented and monitored.

Risk description
Failure to identify, price, and execute the right 
volume and quality of bids and investment 
opportunities to maintain a proﬁtable, 
sustainable order book and deliver value 
to stakeholders. 
Causes
Inaccuracy in:
 – assumptions behind investment decisions 
 – costs versus scope and time calculations
 – project programme and task 
duration estimates
 – design and speciﬁcations not fully 
developed or understood
 – assessment of the impact of inﬂation 
and exchange rates
 –contract management
 – negotiation of terms and conditions
 – assessment of customers’ liquidity/
creditworthiness
 – assessment of joint venture partners 
or supply chain.
What impact it might have
Failure to estimate accurately the risks, costs versus scope, time to complete, impact of 
inﬂation and exchange rates, and failure to understand speciﬁcation changes and contractual 
terms and how best to manage them could cause ﬁnancial losses.
In the event of disagreement with, failure of, or poor delivery performance by a joint venture 
partner, the Group could face ﬁnancial and reputational risks.
If any of the assumptions behind investment decisions prove incorrect, the proﬁtability 
of those investments could be reduced.
How it is mitigated
Consistent and shared policies and minimum commercial expectations including 
acceptable margins. 
A wide and ongoing range of training initiatives across all disciplines within the Group including 
Cash is our Compass and High Value Selling to drive increased commercial awareness and an 
understanding of expectations on margins and cost.
All bids are subject to rigorous estimating and tendering processes as part of the gateway 
review process.
Commercial/contractual reviews are conducted by key commercial and legal staff.
Deﬁned delegated authority levels are in place for approving all tenders and 
infrastructure investments.
Reviews are conducted following all tenders to ensure lessons are learnt, captured and 
applied to future tenders.
Before entering into a joint venture agreement, the Group reviews the relevant skills, 
experience, resources and values of joint venture partners to understand how they 
complement its own.
Investment appraisals are performed and reviewed by experienced professionals. The Group 
analyses the risks associated with revenues and costs and, where appropriate, establishes 
contractual and other risk mitigations. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Risk description
Failure to deliver projects at the required 
speciﬁcation on time and on budget to meet 
the expectations of customers and minimise 
the risk of delay-related damages and 
defect liabilities.
Causes
Failure to implement, maintain and 
challenge operational and commercial 
controls (as detailed within checklists at 
Gate reviews (4-6)) allowing:
 – unrealistic programming targets
 – non-availability of specialist resource
 – unrealistic progress assessments and 
cost to complete judgements
 – overly-optimistic claim 
recovery assumptions
 – incomplete visibility and appreciation of 
scale of commercial judgements
 – inaccurate and/or incomplete cost and 
value data or failure to analyse and report 
correctly, which could arise due to poor 
training, lack of supervision, lack of 
accountability or fear of reporting bad news
 – failings in administering the contract terms 
to safeguard or protect future claims, 
change and extensions of time (EOTs).
What impact it might have
Failure to manage or deliver against contracted customer requirements on time, on budget 
and to an appropriate quality could result in issues such as contract disputes, rejected 
claims, design issues, liquidated damages, cost overruns, failure to achieve customer 
savings and costs to rectify defective work – which in turn harm Balfour Beatty’s proﬁtability 
and reputation.
The Group may also be exposed to long-term obligations including litigation and costs to rectify 
defective or unsafe work.
Execution failure on a high-proﬁle project could result in signiﬁcant reputational damage 
and costs.
How it is mitigated
An increased focus on identifying and reporting risks, including the accuracy of cost and 
cash forecasting.
Consistent application of strong commercial management and contract 
administration processes.
Targeted recruitment of key staff within project delivery teams and senior management, 
together with ongoing and focused training of staff via the Balfour Beatty Academy.
Ongoing project resource reviews.
Gateway process embedded within each business and held on the Business Management 
System to increase accuracy and consistency within work winning and project delivery.
Site Mobilisation Hub in place to facilitate early and effective start-up on site.
Use of innovative and cost effective engineering and technical solutions. 
Planning and programming is undertaken to mitigate unforeseen events and changes.
Drive for defect-free delivery is being embedded at all levels.
Professional indemnity cover in place to provide further ﬁnancial safeguards.

Causes
Failure to correctly assess and prepare for:
 – the new GDPR 
 – the ongoing threat of cybercrime 
 – malicious intent and/or targeted attack
 – breakdown of key security software or 
management system.
What impact it might have
Crystallisation of this risk has the potential for:
 – the business facing legal proceedings, investigations or disputes resulting in business 
disruption, losses, ﬁnes and penalties and reputational damage
 – a reduction or loss of competitive advantage (including loss of intellectual property)
 – a negative impact on customer relationships, including loss of conﬁdence
 – exclusion from bidding opportunities.
How it is mitigated
Data Protection Ofﬁcers embedded throughout the businesses to ensure breaches are 
reported promptly and risks are appropriately escalated to the Group Data Protection Ofﬁcer 
for consideration and assessment.
Data protection programme covering policies, procedures and approved access levels in place 
alongside a comprehensive training plan.
The Group’s exposure has been reduced via a signiﬁcant reduction in approved suppliers.
All data is stored in secure data centres with strengthened back-up procedures.
Regular review and communication of the ever-changing cyber threats and how they 
manifest themselves in practical guidance that all employees and contractors understand. 
Use of up-to-date anti-viral software and increased patching of key software. 
All employees are trained in and must comply with information security 
management obligations.

Build to Last pillar: 
Expert
Risk description
The effects of national or market trends, 
political or regulatory change (including 
the UK’s exit from the EU and the change 
of administration in the US), or new 
developments in infrastructure expenditure 
or procurement may cause customers to 
re-evaluate existing or future projects.
Causes
Failure to plan for any potentially negative 
impacts, or to capture any opportunities 
that may be presented could lead to:
 – customers postponing, reducing or 
changing expenditure plans
 – wider than expected ﬂuctuations in inﬂation
 – increased competition (eg in the UK from 
foreign investors acquiring competitors)
 – increased supply chain risks (eg solvency, 
people and materials)
 – reduced revenue or pressure on margins.
What impact it might have
Any signiﬁcant changes in the level or timing of customer spending or investment plans could 
adversely impact the Group’s strategy, business model, revenue or proﬁtability in the short or 
medium term. 
Restrictions to the availability of skilled labour and competitively priced materials will lead 
to a loss of competitive advantage and a devaluation of the business.
Financial failure of a customer, including any government or public sector body, could result 
in not collecting amounts owed.
How it is mitigated
The Group’s strategy to focus on the more resilient and stable infrastructure markets and 
geographies will help mitigate this risk. The effect of spending changes in any one market is 
mitigated by the Group’s broad exposure to infrastructure markets and the continued need 
for infrastructure spending. Balfour Beatty also mitigates the effects of such market conditions 
by continuing to adapt its business model.
The Group is actively monitoring the potential impacts of the UK exiting the EU including 
potential market stimulation by the UK Government, freedom of movement, ﬁnance costs, 
exchange rates and commodity prices. A dedicated Group-wide forum is in place for this 
purpose and issues a Brexit position paper for external audiences which is updated every 
second month.
The ﬁnancial solvency and strength of counterparties is always considered before contracts 
are signed and such assessments are updated and reviewed whenever possible during 
the project lifecycle. The business also seeks to ensure that it is not over-reliant on any 
one counterparty.

Risk description
Inability to attract and retain required levels 
of skilled and competent staff to meet the

 – Lack of recognition and reward
 – Failure of businesses to promote 
good news stories
 – Failure to maintain a culture of pride 
in the workplace
 – Lack of a diverse workforce
 – Restrictions in the availability of 
skilled labour.
What impact it might have
Failure to recruit and retain appropriately skilled people could harm the Group’s ability to win 
or perform speciﬁc contracts, grow its business and meet its strategic objectives.
A high level of staff turnover or low employee engagement could result in a drop in conﬁdence 
in the business within the market, customer relationships being lost and an inability to focus 
on business improvements.
How it is mitigated
The Balfour Beatty Academy has been established in the UK to provide professional 
development and knowledge sharing opportunities and to ensure employees feel valued 
and specialisms are recognised.
Regular reviews of remuneration arrangements to ensure they are appropriate to help 
the Group attract, motivate and retain key employees.
Strong employee communication channels are in place celebrating individual, business 
and Group-level successes.
An annual Group-wide employee engagement survey is undertaken to measure 
engagement and appropriate actions are developed and communicated.
Recruitment and retention rates are measured and regularly reviewed across all parts 
of the business.
Afﬁnity networks have been established to create a diverse and inclusive 
working environment.
Emerging talent is supported via a range of graduate, apprenticeship, trainee and industrial 
placement/internship schemes including The 5% Club (see page 32).
Competency frameworks within core job families identify and support the development 
of key knowledge, skills and expertise.

Owner: 
The Board
Build to Last pillar: 
All
Risk description
The momentum gained via the policies, 
process, and practices of Build to Last 
is not maintained and potential beneﬁts 
are not realised. 
Causes
To enable the transformation programme 
to succeed, a culture of adhering to the 
Build to Last principles must be continued 
and enhanced.
Failing to grow this culture could result from:
 – ineffective communication
 – inadequate resourcing (ﬁnancial, physical 
and people) 
 – complacency within core disciplines
 – new systems and processes being used 
without appropriate controls being in place 
and/or tested.
What impact it might have
Failure to capture fully the beneﬁts of Build to Last could result in the Group’s ability to deliver 
sustained proﬁt being jeopardised.
How it is mitigated
Ensuring Build to Last continues to deliver the Group’s standard operating procedures 
is a strategic priority for the Group and is being led by the Group Chief Executive.
Controls include:
 – continuing to embed the Build to Last culture within each business unit
 – senior leadership communication across the businesses is clear and frequent
 – new systems and processes are deployed with training plans and in agreed phases
 – employee surveys form a key part of the programme
 – leaders throughout the business frequently monitor the delivery and impacts 
of the programme
 – senior leadership is well experienced in delivering business transformation successfully.

No change 
Owner: 
The Board
Build to Last pillar:

Risk description
Inability of the Group to maintain the ﬁnancial 
strength required to operate its business and 
deliver its objectives.
Causes
Failure to manage ﬁnancial risks, including 
forecasting material exposures, and the 
ﬁnancial resources of the Group that underpin 
its ability to:
 – meet ongoing liquidity obligations so that 
it remains a going concern
 – meet ﬁnancial covenants as set out in 
ﬁnancing facility agreements
 – maintain the conﬁdence of customers 
and key markets and therefore continue 
to win long-term contracts.
What impact it might have
Failure to deliver effectively the required ﬁnancial strength will mean the Group:
 – fails to meet ﬁnancial covenant tests, as set out in its ﬁnancing facility agreements, 
that would lead to an event of default if not remedied within a speciﬁc grace period
 – fails to pass the required tests that allow it to continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of preparing the ﬁnancial statements
 – loses the ability to compete for key long-term contracts that are critical to the delivery 
of its long-term objectives and viability. 
How it is mitigated
The Group operates with a centralised treasury function that is responsible for managing 
key ﬁnancial risks, cash resources and the availability of liquidity and credit capacity. 
The Group maintains signiﬁcant undrawn term committed bank facilities with a banking 
group of high credit-quality to underpin the liquidity requirements of the Group.
The Group maintains signiﬁcant bank and surety bonding facilities to deliver trade ﬁnance 
requirements of the Group on an ongoing basis. 
The Group operates standardised reporting, forecasting and budgeting ﬁnancial processes.

Risk description
Supply chain partners are not able to meet 
the Group’s operational expectations and 
requirements including availability, ﬁnancial 
stability, technical ability, quality, safety, 
environmental, social and ethical.
Causes
 – Supply chain failure risk, exacerbated 
during, and when emerging from, 
tough economic conditions
 – Over-reliance on a limited number 
of suppliers
 – Retention of subcontracted parties 
in buoyant markets
 – Inadequate assessment of supply 
chain partner capabilities and process 
(including safety, ethics, quality, material 
stewardship, child labour, forced labour 
and modern slavery)
 – Failure to accurately assess project 
resource requirements and key deliverables
 – Unethical treatment of the supply chain.
What impact it might have
Failure of a subcontractor or supplier would result in the Group having to ﬁnd a replacement 
or undertaking the task itself. This could result in delays, additional costs or a reduction in 
quality owing to lack of expertise.
Mistreatment of suppliers, subcontractors and their staff, or poor ethical standards in the 
supply chain, could lead to legal proceedings, investigations or disputes resulting in business 
disruption, losses, ﬁnes and penalties, reputational damage and debarment.
How it is mitigated
The Group aims to develop long-term relationships with key subcontractors, working closely 
with them to understand their operations and dependencies.
Contingency plans in place to address subcontractor failure including replacement supplier list.
Lessons are learnt from supply chain performance.
All UK trade suppliers and subcontractors are assessed using the Constructionline service 
that collects, assesses and monitors standard company information through a question set 
aligned to PAS 91, the industry-standard pre-qualiﬁcation questionnaire.
The risk management framework and the gateway review process allow for early 
(Gates 1-4) and ongoing (Gate 6) assessment of the appropriateness of resource allocation 
and dependencies.
My Contribution programme generates ideas for more effective procurement and resourcing.
The Group obtains project retentions, bonds and/or letters of credit from subcontractors, 
where appropriate to mitigate the impact of any insolvency.

Risk description
The Group operates in various markets 
that present business conduct-related 
risks involving fraud, bribery or corruption, 
whether by its own staff or via third parties 
such as agents, partners or subcontractors. 
Those risks are higher in some countries and 
sectors. Overall, the construction industry 
has a higher risk proﬁle than other industries.
Causes
 –Corruption
 –Bribery
 – Fraud, deception, false claims or 
false accounting
 –Unfair competition
 – Human rights abuses, such as child 
and other labour standards generally, 
illegal workers, human trafﬁcking 
and modern slavery
 – Unethical treatment of and by 
the supply chain
 – Risk of ethics and values being 
compromised as a result of 
commercial pressures
 – Other emerging ethical risks.
What impact it might have
Failure by the Group, or employees and third parties acting on its behalf or in partnership, 
to observe the highest standards of integrity and conduct could result in legal proceedings 
(including prosecution under the UK Bribery Act), investigations or disputes resulting in 
business disruption, losses, ﬁnes and penalties, reputational damage and debarment.
How it is mitigated
The Business Integrity function promotes, monitors, assesses awareness of and provides 
training on, the Code of Conduct. The function provides reports to the Audit and Risk 
Committee and has the full support of the Board.
Each business unit, supported by the Business Integrity function, is responsible for 
embedding the Code of Conduct. 
The Group has a range of risk assessment, due diligence and procurement controls that are 
designed to identify and manage risks with third parties. 
Independent third-party whistleblowing hotline and dedicated email are in place and actively 
promoted. All in-scope complaints are independently investigated by the Business Integrity 
function and appropriate action is taken, where necessary.

Causes
The Group is unable to ensure that the 
trustees of the pension funds react effectively 
to or manage:
 – changes in interest rates
 – inﬂation or life expectancy trends 
 – intervention by regulators or legislators
 – investment performance of

Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2016, 
the Directors have assessed the viability 
of the Group over a three-year period to 
31 December 2020.
The Directors consider this period to be 
appropriate because this is the period 
aligned to the current order book and 
for which there is a good visibility of 
the pipeline of potential new projects. 
This period also allows greater certainty 
over the forecasting assumptions used 
in labour and material pricing, skills and 
availability. In the longer term, there 
is also signiﬁcant political uncertainty. 
There is inherently limited visibility of 
contract bidding opportunities beyond 
the three-year period, and the accuracy 
of any forecasting exercise will also be 
impeded by the uncertainty around the 
costs involved to deliver these contracts. 
Consequently, the Group performs its 
medium-term planning over three years.
The Directors and the Executive Risk 
Steering Group continue to monitor the 
principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten the execution 
of its strategy, its business model, future 
performance, solvency and liquidity. As part 
of assessing the Group’s future viability, 
the Directors have considered these 
principal risks and the mitigations available 
to the Group. These principal risks and the 
consequent impact these might have on 
the Group as well as mitigations that are 
in place are detailed on pages 51 to 56. 
In their assessment of the Group’s viability, 
the Directors have also considered the 
need to be successful in implementing 
the Group’s Build to Last transformation 
programme and to focus on its strategic 
priorities of Lean, Expert, Trusted and Safe 
detailed on pages 12 to 15. 
By the end of 2016, the Group had 
successfully exceeded its Phase One Build 
to Last targets of £200 million cash in: 
£100 million cost out. The Group continues 
to exploit opportunities to re-engineer 
processes to drive efﬁciencies, reducing 
cost whilst maintaining or improving 
efﬁciencies. The Group is now in Phase 
Two of its Build to Last programme, which 
aims towards achieving industry-standard 
margins in its earnings-based businesses. 
As part of Phase Two, it remains critical 
that the principles embedded in Phase One 
of Build to Last are maintained in order to 
achieve these industry-standard margins, 
although this is also dependent to a certain 
extent on the Group’s ability to selectively 
win new contracts which will be partly 
impacted by political changes, particularly 
in the UK and the US.
The Directors have assessed the Group’s 
viability in conjunction with its current 
position as well as its ﬁnancial projections 
in the context of the various debt facilities 
and associated covenants. These ﬁnancial 
projections are based on the Group’s 
Three Year Plan, which has been built 
up through a bottom-up basis with a 
Group overlay which provides a more 
top-down view to align to the Group’s 
strategic objectives. These projections 
indicate that the projected headroom, 
provided by the Group’s net cash position 
and under the debt facilities currently 
in place, are adequate to support the 
Group over the next three years, whilst 
still enabling the Group to repay its 
£410 million debt falling due in the next 
three years. In the three-year period, 
the Group is also not projecting to draw 
down on its revolving credit facility of 
£400 million to 31 December 2018 and 
£375 million to 31 December 2020. 
In testing the headroom available under the 
key sensitivities modelled, the Directors 
have assumed that the expiring debt 
facilities will be fully repaid and will not 
be replaced with another form of debt. 
The Group’s projections have been stress-
tested against key sensitivities which could 
materialise as a result of crystallisation 
of one or a combination of the Group’s 
principal risks with the aim of stress-testing 
the Group’s future viability against severe 
but plausible scenarios. These severe but 
plausible scenarios include:
 – failure to manage effectively the 
uncertainties caused by Britain’s exit 
from the EU 
 – an inability to collect 
recoverable amounts
 – an operating event that damages 
the Group’s reputation and results 
in signiﬁcant penalty 
 – more onerous payment terms 
demanded from suppliers leading to 
a reduction in creditor payment days 
 – failure to realise further projected 
beneﬁts from Build to Last. 
The above scenarios result in: 
 – a reduction in revenue
 – a reduction in margin 
 – an increase in operating costs 
 – a slowdown in the Group’s investments 
disposal programme 
 – negative changes to working capital. 
The Directors also assessed a ‘perfect 
storm’ scenario by combining multiple 
scenarios above and modelling the 
resulting downside to stress-test the 
Group’s viability if these cash ﬂows were 
to immediately and simultaneously come 
under severe threat. This scenario is 
aimed to test the viability of the Group if 
it was to experience a catastrophic failure 
and to allow the Directors to assess the 
mitigations available to avoid this. 
In assessing the Group’s viability under 
these severe but plausible scenarios 
(including in the instance of a ‘perfect 
storm’), the Directors have also 
considered the Group’s projected cash 
position (which excludes cash that is 
not immediately available to the Group), 
bank facilities and their maturity proﬁle 
and covenants, the borrowing powers 
allowed under the Company’s Articles of 
Association and the fact that the Group’s 
PPP investments comprise reasonably 
realisable securities which can be sold to 
meet funding requirements if necessary.
It is unlikely, but not impossible, that 
the crystallisation of a single risk would 
test the future viability of the Group; 
however, unsurprisingly, it is possible 
to construct scenarios where either 
multiple occurrences of the same risk, 
or single occurrences of different principal 
risks, could put pressure on the Group’s 
ability to meet its ﬁnancial covenants. 
The Directors have considered the strength 
of the mitigations available to the Group 
and whether these are sufﬁcient to avoid 
a catastrophic outcome to the Group’s 
viability and believe that there are sufﬁcient 
mitigations immediately available to 
minimise this risk. 
Based on the assessment undertaken to 
stress-test the Group’s viability against 
severe but plausible scenarios, and taking 
into account the strength of mitigations 
that are immediately available to the Group, 
the Directors have concluded that there is 
a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year period until 31 December 2020.

governance, including the way the Group 
conducts its business and its approach to 
ethical matters, and sets the risk appetite 
appropriate to delivering the Group’s 
strategy. It is committed to providing 
effective leadership by ensuring that 
those governance principles are adhered 
to throughout the Group, supported by 
an effective framework of systems and 
controls which deﬁne clearly delegations 
of authority and accountabilities. 
Further details of how the Board manages 
risk can be found on pages 65 and 66.
As Chairman, it is my role to ensure that 
the executive leadership and the Board 
are able to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively and, within that, I have 
responsibility to ensure that a robust 
succession plan is in place to cover 
all eventualities. 
The Board comprises a majority of 
non-executive Directors whose role it 
is to challenge constructively, scrutinise 
the performance of management in 
meeting agreed targets and contribute 
to the development of strategy. 
Maureen Kempston Darkes, who has 
served as a Director since July 2012 and 
chair of the Safety and Sustainability 
Committee, retired at the AGM in 2017. 
I am delighted to welcome two new non-
executive Directors to the Board, Barbara 
Moorhouse who joined in June and 
Michael Lucki who joined in July.
Non-executive Directors are appointed 
to the Board for an initial three-year term 
and, subject to continuing satisfactory 
performance and re-election by 
shareholders at AGMs, are expected to 
serve two three-year terms. The Board 
may invite a Director to serve beyond six 
years but any such extended period would 
be subject to particularly stringent review.
The Directors believe that the Board 
provides effective leadership. Details of the 
Directors are set out on pages 60 and 61. 
Very sadly, during the year, Steve 
Marshall, my predecessor as Chairman, 
passed away. I would like to express our 
condolences to his family and recognise 
the leadership he gave Balfour Beatty at 
a very challenging time for the Company.
Diversity
Appointments to the Board are made 
on merit and candidates are assessed 
against objective criteria through a 
rigorous selection process, overseen 
by the Nominations Committee. We ask 
search ﬁrms to identify suitable female 
candidates although we do not believe 
in gender quotas. 
Diversity and inclusion are key 
components of our talent management 
and development programmes, details 
of which can be found on the Company’s 
website balfourbeatty.com.
Accountability
We believe that Balfour Beatty’s processes 
and procedures have been further 
strengthened during the year with the 
development of a Business Management 
System for all aspects of UK business 
practice and ever greater harmonisation 
of HR systems and of ﬁnancial reporting 
platforms, enabling the Board to present 
a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group’s trading position 
and its prospects. We continue to keep 
under review the matters reserved to 
the Board and the terms of reference 
of its Committees. Copies can be found 
on the Company’s website.
Remuneration
The remuneration policy was approved 
by shareholders at the 2017 AGM. 
Details of how we intend to operate 
that policy in 2018 can be found in the 
Remuneration report on pages 76 to 87.
Relations with shareholders
Our investor relations programme is of 
critical importance to the Board. The Board 
routinely receives reports from the investor 
relations team and analysts, together with 
feedback from any meetings which the 
Directors have with institutional investors. 
As Chairman, I seek to meet, at least 
annually, with representatives of the UK 
Shareholders Association. We recognise 
the AGM as an important opportunity for 
private investors to engage with the Board. 
All resolutions will, however, be put to a 
poll rather than a show of hands to ensure 
that shareholders who are not able to 
attend the meeting have their votes fully 
taken into account.

Roles 
The roles of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive are 
separate, with a clear division of responsibilities between the 
running of the Board and executive responsibility for running the 
Group’s businesses. Their respective roles are formally recorded 
and are available to view on the Company’s website as are those 
of the Senior Independent Director.

Board and Committee meetings
Procedures for Board and Committee meetings remain largely 
unchanged from previous years. The Company Secretary is 
responsible for advising the Board on appropriate governance 
matters and for ensuring a good information ﬂow and that Board 
procedures are properly followed. He is available to individual 
Directors for advice on Board procedures.
Details of the number of meetings of the Board and its Committees 
held during the year and attendance of Directors thereat are set 
out on page 63. Outside the formal schedule of meetings, the 
non-executive Directors met without the executive Directors 
present on a number of occasions. Meetings are normally held at 
one of the Company’s London ofﬁces.
The Board has six standing Committees. In the cases of the Group 
Tender and Investment Committee and the Finance and General 
Purposes Committee, membership comprises the executive 
Directors and other members of the senior management team.
All non-executive Directors have an open invitation to attend 
any Committee meeting. A number of the Directors took this 
opportunity during the year.
Board and Committee meetings typically take place over two 
consecutive days with the ﬁrst day allocated to Committee 
meetings and ending with a ‘focus’ presentation by a member of 
the leadership team. Board meetings will usually include a ‘deep 
dive’ presentation from one of the business units as well as an 
agenda focusing on key priorities for the Group, including:
 – progress with the Build to Last transformation programme
 – strategy and budgets
 – operating structures, processes and costs
 – the Group’s ﬁnancial performance
 – bid and project updates
 – legacy contract out-turns
 – annual and interim ﬁnancial statements
 – health and safety performance
 – signiﬁcant human resources issues, including succession 
planning and diversity
 – reports from the head of the business integrity function
 – consideration of issues relating to major disputes, proceedings 
or other matters of potentially adverse effect on the 
Group’s reputation
 – reports by non-executive Directors on site visits
 – the sale of investment assets 
 – the results of employee engagement surveys.
Conﬂicts of interest and contracts of signiﬁcance
The Board has established a policy and procedures relating to 
Directors’ conﬂicts of interest. Where conﬂicts of interest arise, 
the Board has power to authorise them. None of the Directors 
had a conﬂict of interest during the year.
None of the Directors had a direct or indirect material interest in any 
contract of signiﬁcance with any Group company during the year.

Directors’ independence
At its meeting in January 2018, the Board considered the 
independence of the non-executive Directors against the criteria 
speciﬁed in the Code and determined that each of them continues 
to be independent.
A non-exhaustive list of the key strengths of the Directors is 
set out in the table below. Details of their service agreements, 
emoluments and share incentives are shown in the Remuneration 
report starting on page 76.
Following the performance evaluations of each of the 
non-executive Directors, it is conﬁrmed that the performance 
of each continues to be effective and demonstrates commitment 
to the role.
Responsibility and delegation
The Board is responsible for the success of the Company and 
has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its decision which 
includes the matters summarised below:
 – determining the Group’s strategic direction
 – approving annual budgets and ﬁnancial reporting, including the 
annual and half-year results and interim management statements
 – approving interim, and recommending ﬁnal, dividends
 – approving major acquisitions, disposals and capital expenditure
 – approving contracts, contract tenders and bid submissions above 
speciﬁed values or of an unusual nature or complexity
 – ensuring the necessary ﬁnancial and human resources 
are in place to achieve objectives and review 
management performance
 – setting the Company’s values and ethical standards
 – approving policies and systems for risk management 
and assurance.
The Board reviewed its list of reserved matters, most recently, at its 
meeting in July 2017. The full list and the terms of reference of the 
Board Committees are available on the Company’s website: 
 www.balfourbeatty.com/investors
The day-to-day management of the business is delegated to 
executive Directors and the Group’s senior management.
The Directors are experienced and inﬂuential individuals from 
varied commercial, professional and international backgrounds. 
Their diverse and balanced mix of skills and business experience, 
as shown below, is key to the effective functioning of the Board 
and its Committees, ensuring matters are fully and effectively 
debated and challenged.

Induction
Directors undertake a thorough induction programme and receive 
a range of information about the Company when they join the 
Board, including access to a portal on which all Board papers are 
stored, Balfour Beatty’s Code of Conduct and processes for dealing 
in Balfour Beatty shares. In addition, they take part in a series of 
one-to-one meetings with other members of the Board, senior 
executives in the businesses and the Company’s external advisers, 
which include brieﬁngs on the Group’s business strategy, ﬁnancial 
procedures, business development, legal and other key issues.
The Directors’ induction programme also provides the foundation 
for continuing professional development. This takes place 
throughout the year by way of a series of internal and external 
updates, including visits to operating companies to meet local 
management and visits to Balfour Beatty projects, both in the UK 
and overseas.
For a copy of the Code of Conduct see: 
  www.balfourbeattycodeofconduct.com/
Training and development
In discussion with the Directors and Company Secretary, each year 
the Chairman determines whether there are any speciﬁc training 
needs identiﬁed by the Directors, which can be addressed by the 
topic being included at a future Board meeting. Directors are also 
enrolled in the Deloitte Academy, a seminar-led programme for 
directors of UK listed companies, which provides regular updates 
throughout the year on the principal governance and other matters 
of which directors of a listed company should be fully aware.
Board evaluation
Introduction
In keeping with the Code, the Board undertakes external 
evaluations, typically every three years, with internal evaluations 
in the intervening two years. The most recent external evaluation 
was carried out in early 2016, in respect of 2015, by Lintstock, 
an external facilitator. For 2017, the evaluation has been conducted 
using internal resources and considered the performance of 
the Board and its Committees, as well as the Chairman and 
individual Directors.
2017 evaluation
During October 2017, the Chairman conducted an evaluation review 
with all Board members, the results of which were summarised 
and presented to the Board for discussion in November 2017. 
The review was tailored to the speciﬁc circumstances of Balfour 
Beatty and covered the composition, expertise and dynamics of 
the Board, the Board’s management of time, the support afforded 
to the Board, the Board’s oversight of strategy and succession 
planning. Any reported comments made during the reviews 
were unattributed.
Key conclusions from the evaluation
Overall, Directors considered that the Board and its Committees 
are working effectively and that year-on-year performance 
improvements are apparent. The quality and timeliness of 
management information continues to be good and the 
relationships between executive and non-executive Directors 
has strengthened during the year. There is a good knowledge 
of the issues and opportunities facing the Group amongst the 
non-executive Directors and the recent appointees are already 
contributing strongly to discussions. All non-executive Directors 
are encouraged to make regular visits to project sites throughout 
the UK and overseas and are individually and collectively involved 
in project reviews. The Board will continue to undertake at least 
one visit to the US each year, combining a series of presentations 
by the US leadership team with site visits.
Annual General Meeting and Class Meeting of  
Preference Shareholders
The AGM will be held at Painters Hall, 9 Little Trinity Lane, London 
EC4V 2AD on Thursday 24 May 2018 commencing at 11am. 
Immediately following the AGM, a Class Meeting of the holders 
of the Company’s cumulative convertible redeemable preference 
shares will be held. Shareholders are encouraged to attend these 
meetings and ask any relevant questions they may have.  balfourbeatty.com/AR2017

Risk management and internal control
Risk management
An assessment of risk is central to the Group’s strategic decision-
making process and an essential part of meeting the requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code. By delivering effective risk 
management and understanding its exposure to risk, the business 
is better able to protect its reputation, ensure long-term viability and 
generate sustainable shareholder value. Balfour Beatty maintains 
an agile and comprehensive internal control environment. Key risks 
are identiﬁed and a decision made to treat, tolerate, terminate 
or transfer potential exposure dependent upon the Group’s risk 
attitude or appetite. For more information, refer to pages 48 to 56. 
The Board has applied principle C2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code by embedding continuously evolving risk 
management processes throughout the Group at all levels which 
form an integral part of day-to-day business activity. 
Roles and responsibilities
The Board is responsible for the implementation and oversight of 
Balfour Beatty’s risk management framework. It sets the Group’s 
appetite for and attitude to risk in pursuit of its agreed strategic 
objectives and therefore the level of risk that can be taken by Group, 
strategic business unit and individual business unit management 
without speciﬁc Board approval. Group policies, procedures and 
delegated authority levels set by the Board provide the structure 
in which risks are reviewed and escalated to the appropriate level 
within the Group, up to and including the Board, for consideration 
and approval. 
The roles and responsibilities of the Board, its Committees, 
strategic business unit and individual business unit management 
are set out below.

Effectiveness continued
Risk management process
Balfour Beatty’s risk management policy requires that all business 
units implement effective arrangements and management controls 
across all operations for the management of risk. The Group’s 
approach to risk management is to reduce the likelihood of risk 
events occurring, mitigate the adverse impact of such events 
and identify opportunities where taking risks might beneﬁt the 
business. Balfour Beatty is relentless in ensuring that a positive risk 
management culture remains embedded at all levels.
When pursuing new opportunities, an assessment of risk forms 
a key part of the work winning process. Risks are continuously 
assessed to ensure potential exposure remains within an 
accepted tolerance.
Additionally, the Board sets and regularly reviews delegated 
authority levels which act as triggers for the escalation of matters 
requiring approval. In relation to work winning, this means projects 
above a certain value, or those with unusual characteristics, such 
as a move into new markets, require approval by the Group Tender 
and Investment Committee or the Board, as appropriate.
Reporting structures ensure that risks are monitored continually, 
mitigation plans are reviewed and signiﬁcant exposures which 
develop are reviewed within the business unit or by Group senior 
management via the Executive Risk Steering Group.
Effective risk management cannot stand still. In 2017 signiﬁcant 
improvements have been made to further align the Group’s risk 
management and audit functions to bring greater focus on the 
assurance mapping process. This work will continue in 2018 
as part of the ongoing review of risk aggregation and escalation. 
Review of the Group’s business continuity arrangements will 
ensure that Balfour Beatty remains resilient to the ever-changing 
threats it faces in delivering its business objectives. 
Internal control
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management systems and internal control and regularly reviews 
their effectiveness. The Group’s systems and controls are designed 
to ensure exposure to signiﬁcant risk is managed appropriately. 
The Board recognises that any system of internal control is 
designed to understand and manage rather than eliminate the risk 
and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. In addition, not all the material joint 
ventures in which the Group is involved are treated, for these 
purposes, as part of the Group. Where they are not, systems 
of internal control and risk management are applied as agreed 
between the joint venture partners.
Central to the Group’s systems of internal control are its processes 
and framework for risk management. These align with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting and were 
in place throughout 2017 and up to the date of signing this report. 
Guidance and policies have been issued and are continuously 
monitored to provide an interlinked and comprehensive internal 
control environment. Such topics include but are not limited to:
 – a clear system of delegated authorities from the Board to 
management with certain matters reserved by the Board
 – monthly ﬁnancial reporting against budgets and the review of 
results and forecasts by executive Directors and management, 
including particular areas of business or project risk. This is used 
to update management’s understanding of the environment in 
which the Group operates and the methods used to mitigate and 
control identiﬁed risks
 – annual review of the strategy and plans of each business and 
of the Group as a whole to identify risks to the achievement of 
objectives and, where appropriate, any relevant mitigating actions
 – speciﬁc policies set out in the Group Finance Manual covering 
the ﬁnancial management of the Group, including arrangements 
with the Group’s bankers and bond providers, controls on 
foreign exchange dealings and management of currency 
and interest rate exposures, application of accounting policies 
and ﬁnancial controls
 – risk management expectations which are embedded throughout 
the Group
 – gateway reviews requiring risk, uncertainty and control 
assessment at all stages of project development and at all levels 
of the business from business unit level to Board Committee if 
value, or perceived exposure, exceeds certain thresholds
 – reviews and tests by the internal audit function of critical business 
ﬁnancial processes and controls and speciﬁc reviews in areas of 
perceived high business risk
 – reviews and authorising of proposed investment, divestment and 
capital expenditure through the Board and Board Committees
 – regular reporting, monitoring and review of the effectiveness 
of health, safety, environment and sustainability processes. 
These processes are subject to independent audit and 
certiﬁcation to internationally recognised standards as appropriate
 – legal and regulatory compliance risks which are addressed 
through speciﬁc policies and training on such matters as ethics, 
competition and data protection laws
 – promotion of a culture of compliance with ethics and integrity 
responsibilities to help manage legal and reputational risks across 
the Group. An ethics helpline encourages staff to raise concerns, 
in conﬁdence, about possible breaches of the Code of Conduct.
There is also an independent internal audit function that executes 
a risk-based programme of audit throughout the entire Group. 
All audit reports are shared with relevant business leaders in 
addition to being reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee 
(see pages 67 to 69).
It is the expectation and requirement of the Board that business 
leaders ensure this comprehensive internal control environment 
(including internal audit) is embedded within their business units. 
The Board’s assessment of the risk management processes and 
internal controls during 2017 is based on reports it received and 
those presented to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Safety 
and Sustainability Committee, including:
 – the results of the internal audit function’s reviews of internal 
ﬁnancial controls
 – a Group-wide certiﬁcation that effective internal controls had 
been maintained or, where any signiﬁcant non-compliance or 
breakdown had occurred with or without loss, that appropriate 
remedial action has been or is being taken
 – a paper prepared by management on the nature, extent 
and mitigation of signiﬁcant risks and on the systems of 
internal controls.
Principal risks
The principal risks that could adversely impact on the Group’s 
proﬁtability and ability to achieve its strategic objectives are set out

chairman, non-executive Directors Stuart Doughty, Iain Ferguson 
(until 6 July 2017), Barbara Moorhouse (from 6 July 2017) and 
Michael Lucki (from 1 September 2017).
Main responsibilities
The terms of reference for the Committee are based on the 
Guidance on Audit Committees issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council. The main responsibilities of the Audit and Risk Committee 
are summarised below:
 – review the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements of the Group 
and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s 
ﬁnancial performance
 – review the Group’s internal controls established to identify,

function, including its work programme
 – make recommendations to the Board in relation to the 
appointment of the external auditor and approve the 
remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditor
 – assess the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of 
the external auditor and develop and implement policy on the 
engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services

being fair, balanced and understandable, as required under the 
Companies Act 2006
 – review the procedures for the Group’s helplines and other 
mechanisms used by employees to raise concerns conﬁdentially 
(including any whistleblowing facilities) and their effectiveness.
Dr Stephen Billingham, formerly group ﬁnance director (CFO) of 
British Energy Group plc and of WS Atkins plc, has been identiﬁed 
by the Board as having recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience.
Partners from the external auditor, the Group Risk and Audit 
Director, the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, the Chief 
Financial Ofﬁcer and the Group Financial Controller regularly attend 
meetings. The Committee also invites divisional leaders and 
specialists relevant to the Committee’s agenda.
Summary of activities in 2017
In 2017, the Committee’s work programme focused on a number 
of signiﬁcant issues and other accounting judgements where the 
Committee believed the highest level of judgement was required 
and with the highest potential impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial 
statements. Further information is set out on page 68. 
Financial reporting
The Committee reviews and evaluates the appropriateness 
of the interim and annual ﬁnancial statements (including the 
announcements thereof to the London Stock Exchange) with both 
management and the external auditor, including: 
 – at the Board’s request, whether the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy. The Audit and Risk Committee has assisted 
in achieving this objective by reviewing proposals for the internal 
procedures to be applied in preparing the Annual Report 
 – the clarity of disclosures and compliance with ﬁnancial 
reporting standards and relevant ﬁnancial and governance 
reporting requirements and guidelines, including the European 
Securities and Markets Authority Guidelines on Alternative 
Performance Measures
 – discussing the critical accounting policies and use of assumptions 
and estimates, as noted on pages 108 and 109 of this Annual 
Report, and concluding that the estimates, judgements and 
assumptions used were reasonable based on the information 
available and had been used appropriately in applying the 
Company’s accounting policies
 – assessing the Group’s implementation of the new revenue 
recognition standard, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers. In particular, the Committee focused on the 
robustness of the implementation project led by the Group team 
and the impact assessment of the new standard on the Group’s 
results. The Committee also reviewed, assessed and endorsed 
the Group’s proposed internal accounting policies to reﬂect the 
requirements of the new standard, which was adopted by the 
Group on 1 January 2018. Further detail on the impact of the 
adoption of IFRS 15 can be found on page 102
 – reviewing the viability of the Group over the longer term as part 
of its assessment of the Group’s risks (see page 57).
The Committee is able to question management at both Group and 
business unit levels to gain further insight into the issues addressed 
in these reports. 
The key signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting issues and other accounting 
judgements are set out in the table on page 68.  Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Accountability continued
Signiﬁcant issues and other accounting judgements
Revenue and margin 
recognition
Given the nature of the Group’s operations, these elements are central to how it values its work. Having 
reviewed detailed reports and met with management, the Committee considered contract and commercial 
issues with exposure to both revenue and margin recognition risks. As a key area of audit focus, the 
Committee also received a detailed written report from the external auditor setting out the results of its work 
in relation to key contract judgements. 
Carrying value of goodwill 
and other intangibles
The judgement largely relates to the assumptions underlying the value in use of the cash-generating units, 
primarily the achievement of the three-year strategic plan and the macroeconomic assumptions (such as 
discount rates) underpinning the valuation process. The Committee received reports from management 
outlining the impairment model and the assumptions used; in addition, the external auditor provided detailed 
written reports in this area. 
Going concern and 
viability statement
In order to satisfy itself that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operation for the 
foreseeable future and that there are no material uncertainties that could lead to signiﬁcant doubt as to the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, the Committee considered the Group’s viability statement, 
cash position (both existing and projected), bank facilities and covenants (including bonding lines) and the 
borrowing powers allowed under the Company’s Articles of Association. The Committee subsequently 
recommended to the Board the adoption of the going concern statement and the viability statement for 
inclusion in the Annual Report. More details on going concern and the viability statement are contained on 
pages 47 and 57.
Non-underlying items The key judgement is whether items relate to underlying trading or not and whether they have been 
presented in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. The Committee conducted a review of each 
of the non-underlying items, receiving written reports from management and the external auditor as to their 
quantum and nature. 
Provisions The Committee reviewed the signiﬁcant judgements relating to provisions, including litigation and other risks. 
The Committee received detailed reports, including relevant legal advice.
Retirement beneﬁts The key judgement relates to the assumptions underlying the valuation of the retirement beneﬁt obligations. 
The Committee received reports from management outlining the assumptions used, including input from 
the Group’s actuaries, in particular in relation to discount rates, inﬂation and mortality which were evaluated 
against external benchmarks and, in relation to which, the external auditor also provided reports.
Deferred tax assets The Committee reviewed the Group’s considerations on future proﬁtability to evaluate the judgement that 
it is probable the deferred tax assets are recoverable.
Directors’ valuation of the 
Investments portfolio
The Committee assessed the methodology used to value the assets in terms of the discount rates applied. 
It also critically appraised the output of the Directors’ valuation exercise.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 69 Strategic Report
FRC’s thematic review on Alternative Performance Measures
In 2016, the Group received a letter from the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC) conﬁrming that the Group’s disclosures on Alternative 
Performance Measures in its Annual Report and Accounts 2016 
would be included in the FRC’s thematic review. At the FRC’s request, 
the Committee notes that the FRC’s review only covered the speciﬁc 
disclosures relating to the thematic review and provides no assurance 
that the report and accounts were correct in all material aspects. 
As a result of this review, the Group committed to providing additional 
disclosures on how the Directors’ valuation of its Investments 
portfolio compares to the equivalent statutory measure reported 
under accounting standards. The enhanced disclosure is included 
on page 42.
Areas of focus in 2018
In 2018, the Committee will continue to address the topics described 
on pages 67 and 68 including continuing to undertake reviews of 
the risk management and assurance practices across the Group on 
a rolling programme. The Committee will also continue to receive 
any necessary training in order to broaden and refresh the skills and 
knowledge of its members. The Committee will also oversee the 
Group’s transition to the new leasing standard, IFRS 16. 
Risk management and internal control 
The risk management and internal control framework now comprises 
a number of approval and review gates that cover the business 
lifecycle from initial project pursuit through to delivery and completion. 
These processes are underpinned by common minimum standards in 
project and commercial management and are under constant review 
to ensure their effectiveness and compliance.
Internal auditor effectiveness 
The Committee reviews the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function on an ongoing basis. This is achieved, in part, by reviewing 
and discussing the reports presented to it at each meeting, setting 
out the function’s work and ﬁndings, but also through a formal annual 
assessment. An independent periodic review of the internal audit 
function, as well as a thorough self-assessment scorecard drawn 
up in accordance with best practice guidelines, also helps contribute 
to the Committee’s evaluation.
External auditor independence and effectiveness
The Committee carries out a formal review each year to assess 
the independence and effectiveness of the external auditor, KPMG. 
The Committee has satisﬁed itself as to KPMG’s independence. 
The Committee took into consideration the following matters:
Non-audit work
The objective set out in the Company’s policy is to ensure that the 
external auditor is not placed in a position where its independence is, 
or might be seen to be, compromised. Under no circumstances will 
any assignment be given to the external auditor, if it results in:
 – audits of its own work
 – making management decisions on behalf of the Group
 – acting as advocate for the Group
 – a mutuality of interest being created.
The Company’s policy identiﬁes the various types of non-audit 
services and determines the analysis to be undertaken, and level of 
authority required, before the external auditor can be considered to 
undertake such services. For any non-audit services (which are not 
excluded under the policy), the policy provides for approval by the 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer of expenditure below £250,000, and approval 
by the chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee of expenditure 
above £250,000. A report is also submitted to the Committee of any 
non-audit services carried out by the external auditor, irrespective 
of value. The aggregated spend on non-audit services with the 
external auditor will not exceed 60% of the Group audit fee, unless 
exceptional circumstances exist, with a three-year rolling average not 
exceeding 70% of the Group audit fee.
During 2017 , there were fees of £0.5 million (2016: £0.5 million) paid 
to the external auditor for non-audit services. 2017 non-audit services 
primarily related to the half-year review. Audit fees for 2017 were 
£2.7 million. Further details are included in Note 6.2 on page 1 13.
There is no inconsistency between the Financial Reporting Council’s 
ethical standards and the Company’s policy.
The Committee considers that the Company receives particular 
beneﬁts, including those relating to cost, quality and consistency, 
from the advice provided by its external auditor, given its wide and 
detailed knowledge of the Group and its international operations. 
There can also be savings in management time and accelerated 
delivery of work in situations where rapid turnaround is required.
90% by value of non-audit related work provided by international 
accounting ﬁrms in 2017 was carried out by ﬁrms other than KPMG.
Annual assessment of the audit process
In addition to receiving written reports from the auditors (both internal 
and external) and management, the Committee also conducted 
separate private meetings with the external auditors and with 
management. These provide the opportunity for open dialogue and 
feedback on the audit process, the responsiveness of management 
and the effectiveness of individual internal and external audit teams.
A detailed assessment of the external audit process and the 
effectiveness of the external auditor, together with any identiﬁed 
improvement recommendations, is prepared each year. 
External auditor rotation
The external auditors are required to rotate the lead partner every 
ﬁve years. Such changes are carefully planned to ensure business 
continuity without undue risk or inefﬁciency. KPMG’s lead partner, 
Stephen Wardell, who will complete his second year in May 2018, 
has communicated to the Committee during 2017 that he will 
be retiring in May 2018 and will be succeeded by Paul Sawdon. 
The Committee will oversee this transition.
The EU Audit Directive on audit tendering took effect from June 2016 
and its key aspects include:
 – audit ﬁrms will have a maximum tenure of 10 years, although 
the UK Government proposes to allow an extension of (i) up to 
an additional 10 years where a public tender is carried out after 
10 years; or (ii) by an additional 14 years where more than one audit 
ﬁrm is appointed to carry out the audit
 – audit ﬁrms are to be prohibited from providing certain non-audit 
services and where non-audit services are provided they will be 
subject to a fees cap
 – a restriction in any contract limiting a company’s choice of auditor 
will be prohibited.
The Group has therefore adopted a policy that no external auditor 
appointed after June 2016 can remain in post for longer than 20 years 
and there will be a tendering process every 10 years, and that KPMG, 
as the currently appointed external auditor, may remain so until the 
completion of the 2025 annual audit. However, the Committee will 
continue to consider annually the need to tender the audit for audit 
quality or independence reasons. There are no contractual obligations 
in place that restrict the Company’s choice of statutory auditor.
The disclosures provided above constitute the Company’s statement of compliance 
with the requirements of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014.  Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Safety and Sustainability Committee
Summary of activities in 2017
In July 2017, Stuart Doughty assumed responsibility as Committee 
chairman following the retirement of Maureen Kempston Darkes 
on 18 May 2017. Other members during the year included the 
Company Chairman, Phil Aiken, non-executive Directors Stephen 
Billingham (from 6 January 2017 to 6 July 2017) and Iain Ferguson 
(until 6 January 2017 and from 6 July 2017), and the Group Chief 
Executive, Leo Quinn.
The UK Health, Safety, Environment and Sustainability function 
performs a Group-wide data collection and reporting role for Balfour 
Beatty’s UK and international operations.
The Committee considered certain signiﬁcant health and safety 
related incidents, including fatalities, discussing in detail the 
themes around supervision, communications and safety by design. 
It also reviewed the Group’s sustainability performance alongside 
environmental incidents.
During the year safety performance benchmarking against industry 
peers has been extended to provide the Committee with more 
objective reporting of absolute and relative performance against 
agreed KPIs. The Committee has also overseen improvements to 
the escalation procedures so as to ensure the immediate reporting 
of any major incidents to all members of the Committee. 
Initiatives to work with equipment manufacturers have also been 
taken with a view to designing-in engineering control improvements 
for improved operational safety. 
Good progress has been made in establishing much closer 
liaison between the Committee and its equivalents within 
major customers, with a view to facilitating a greater sharing of 
safety information, the development of safer working practices 
and to improve understanding and co-operation with regard to 
sustainability objectives. 
The Committee has also overseen the greater sharing of health and 
safety best practices between the Group’s UK and US operations. 
The Group’s sustainability strategy, Our Blueprint, can be viewed at: 
  www.balfourbeatty.com/media/195840/sustainability-
blueprint-2017.pdf
The merger of the UK Health and Safety function with the 
UK Environment and Sustainability function has proven very 
successful with the beneﬁts of greater collaboration now apparent. 
This continues to be supported by training of health, safety, 
environment and sustainability practitioners as part of an ongoing 
development programme to build expertise and ﬂexibility. 
The Committee has reviewed a number of opportunities to improve 
Balfour Beatty’s sustainability performance, including opportunities 
to reduce carbon emissions by focusing on Balfour Beatty’s 
plant and ﬂeet operations. It has also reviewed Balfour Beatty’s 
engagement process with customers to drive sustainability 
performance to add value. 
Areas of focus in 2018
In 2018, the Committee will continue to seek greater collaboration 
with the Group’s major customers and maintain its focus on the key 
areas of health and safety and sustainability by design, supervision, 
subcontractor engagement and treating health like safety, 
resource efﬁciency, carbon reduction, social value and supply 
chain engagement, as well as measuring performance against 
Our Blueprint and the Zero Harm action plan. The Committee will 
also review how best practice is shared across geographies to 
continually improve performance. balfourbeatty.com/AR2017

Group Tender and Investment Committee
Summary of role
The Committee has been chaired by Leo Quinn as the Group 
Chief Executive, or in his absence, the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, 
or in his absence by any one of four senior business unit leaders. 
Those business unit leaders are not permitted to chair any meeting 
which reviews proposals from those areas of the business for 
which he/she has executive responsibility.
The main purpose of the Committee is to review all major proposed 
tenders with projected values above speciﬁed levels, with a speciﬁc 
focus on risk. The Committee also has authority to approve capital 
expenditure applications and any proposed acquisitions or disposals 
up to certain speciﬁed limits determined by the Board. For example, 
currently the Committee’s terms of reference require contracts for 
construction or services in the UK of a value exceeding £100 million 
to be submitted for review, whilst other limits vary according to 
geography and nature of the contract.
Any member may convene a meeting of the Committee to discuss 
any of the tender reviews in more detail. In addition to those 
members of the Committee most relevant for the consideration 
of each proposed tender, meetings are attended by key members 
of the bid team concerned and their strategic business unit leaders. 
Minutes of all meetings are made available to all Directors.

Nomination Committee
Summary of activities in 2017
During the year the Committee comprised Philip Aiken as chairman, 
non-executive Directors Stuart Doughty, Iain Ferguson and Stephen 
Billingham (from 6 July 2017) and the Group Chief Executive, 
Leo Quinn.
During 2017, the Committee’s programme of work included 
the recruitment of two new non-executive Directors, Barbara 
Moorhouse and Michael Lucki.
All appointments to the Board are based on merit, against objective 
criteria, having due regard for diversity, including gender.
In seeking suitable candidates for the positions, Heidrick and 
Struggles US and Ridgeway, external executive search agencies, 
were separately engaged. The Committee identiﬁed the 
competencies and experience sought.
The key determinant in the selection of the Directors was 
a background in organisations that share key dynamics with 
Balfour Beatty, including contracting, customer service, 
major capital projects, infrastructure and B2B services.
The search agencies appointed were reminded to approach a 
diverse talent pool of candidates, and neither has other connections 
with Balfour Beatty.
Areas of focus in 2018
In January 2018, the Committee received from the Group Chief 
Executive a comprehensive presentation on the succession 
and development plans for the Group’s senior leadership team 
and discussed succession plans for the Board. The implications 
of the business strategy for senior executive recruitment and the 
impact on the Group’s succession planning are also areas which 
the Committee will consider during the year. It will continue to 
monitor the appropriateness of the composition of the Board.

meetings were held at regular intervals with institutional 
shareholders (2016: approximately 75). Current and prospective 
shareholders, brokers and analysts were also given the opportunity 
to engage with Balfour Beatty during road shows in London and 
North America. 
This communication programme will be maintained and expanded 
where appropriate, subject to the constraints of regulation and 
practice. The 2018 investor relations programme will focus on 
ensuring investors and the analyst community understand the 
Group, its operations and strategy, and that institutions continue 
to be given the opportunity to meet with management. 
Care is exercised to ensure that any price sensitive information 
is released to all shareholders at the same time in accordance with 
UK Listing Authority requirements.  balfourbeatty.com/AR2017
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 73 Strategic Report
Executive Directors report regularly to the Board on meetings 
or other contact with shareholders or their representatives. 
The non-executive Directors continue to believe that, through 
their direct and ready access to, and contact with, the Chairman 
and the Senior Independent Director and through the regular 
reports to the Board, they are kept fully aware of the views of 
the larger shareholders in the Company and the investment 
community generally. 
The Board continues to retain the services of independent 
external corporate and investor relations consultants who 
provide advice on the relationship between the Company and its 
institutional investors. 
Further information on the Company’s investor relations 
programme can be found at: www.balfourbeatty.com/investors 
The Board regards the Company’s general meetings as an 
opportunity to communicate directly with private investors 
and actively encourages participative dialogue with all the 
Company’s shareholders. 
The chairs of the Board Committees attend the AGM each year 
along with the other Directors and are available to answer questions 
from shareholders. The circular setting out the Notice of the 
2018 AGM provides a detailed explanation of the business to be 
transacted and includes contact details which shareholders can use 
to make any comments or ask any questions concerning the AGM. 
The website is regarded by the Company as an important 
source of information on the Group, including ﬁnancial press 
releases, shareholder documentation, annual and half-year results 
presentations and the terms of reference of the principal Board 
Committees. The Company’s website continues to be developed 
to ensure it remains a principal source of information on the Group 
and its activities.
Political donations
At the AGM held in May 2017, shareholders gave authority for the 
Company and its UK subsidiaries to make donations to political 
organisations up to a maximum aggregate amount of £25,000 in 
the European Union. This approval is a precautionary measure in 
view of the broad deﬁnition of these terms in the Companies Act. 
No such expenditure or donations were made during the year and 
shareholder authority will be sought again at the 2018 AGM.
In the US and Canada, corporate political contributions 
totalling £19,306 were made by business units during 2017 
(2016: £195,290). Any political contributions or donations are tightly 
controlled and must be approved in advance in accordance with 
the Company’s internal procedures and must also adhere strictly to 
the Company’s policies on probity set out in its Code of Conduct.
Corporate responsibility
A full description of the Group’s approach to sustainability, including 
information on its community engagement programme, appears on 
pages 29 to 37. The Group’s published policies on health and safety, 
the environment, business conduct and ethics remain in place and 
are subject to regular reviews.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Details of emissions during the year and the actions which the 
Group is taking to reduce them are set out on pages 35 and 36 and 
form part of the Directors’ report disclosures.
Employment
The Balfour Beatty Group operates across a number of geographies 
and end markets. 
Balfour Beatty provides a Human Resources framework 
for promoting diversity, ethical behaviour and learning and 
development as well as continuing to fulﬁl its commitments in 
relation to regulation and corporate governance. The key principles 
in the design and practice of employment policy that are applicable 
across the Group are to: 
 – provide a safe, open, inclusive and challenging environment 
that attracts and retains the best people 
 – enable all employees to perform at their best and realise 
their full potential, assisted by appropriate training and 
career development 
 – communicate the strategy of the Group, the objectives of 
each respective business and the role and objectives of each 
employee within that business 
 – actively consult with all employees and engage in a participating 
environment that fosters the exchange of best practice 
and collaboration 
 – provide market competitive pay and beneﬁts that reward both 
individual and collective performance 
 – ensure that all job applicants receive fair treatment, regardless 
of age, origin, gender, disability, sexual orientation, marital status, 
religion or belief
 – ensure that all employees similarly receive fair treatment 
throughout their career 
 – provide a working environment of respect and free 
from harassment.
The Group provides fair and ﬂexible employment policies and 
practices that respond to the different needs of its people. 
Information concerning employee diversity is set out on page 33 
and forms part of the Directors’ report disclosures. 
Balfour Beatty strives to provide employment, training and 
development opportunities for disabled people wherever possible 
and is committed to supporting employees who become disabled 
during employment and helping disabled employees make the best 
use of their skills and potential, consistent with all other employees. 
The Company also operates an all employee Share Incentive 
Plan (SIP) which enables UK-based employees to acquire the 
Company’s ordinary shares on a potentially tax-favourable basis, 
in order to encourage employee share ownership and provide 
additional alignment between the interests of employees and 
shareholders. Participants in the SIP are the beneﬁcial owners of 
shares but not the registered owners, and the voting rights to such 
shares are exercised by the trustee of the SIP at the discretion of 
the participants. 
Information concerning the performance of the Group and 
the Company’s share price is provided to all employees via the 
Company’s website. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Directors’ report – other disclosures continued
Events after the reporting date 
On 15 January 2018, Carillion plc ﬁled for compulsory liquidation. 
Carillion was one of the Group’s joint operations partners in the 
Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) project on a joint 
and several basis. As a result of Carillion’s liquidation, the Group 
and its remaining joint operations partner on the project, Galliford 
Try plc, are jointly liable to deliver Carillion’s remaining obligations 
on this contract in addition to each partner’s existing 33% share. 
The Group has assessed the liquidation of Carillion plc as an 
adjusting post balance sheet event and in light of this, the Group 
has recognised a one-off non-underlying loss provision of £44m 
in 2017, which reﬂects the Group’s additional loss on the contract 
as a result of Carillion’s liquidation. The contract is expected to 
complete in the summer of 2018. Refer to Note 10 on page 114.
On 14 February 2018, the Group repurchased a further £17.7m of 
its convertible bonds, which will result in a loss on settlement of 
£0.3m. This settlement will also trigger a further £2m of reserves 
relating to the equity component of the repurchased bonds 
being transferred from other reserves into retained earnings. 
Following this settlement, the Group’s outstanding bonds on 
maturity in December 2018 amount to £213.7m. 
On 19 February 2018, the Group agreed the disposal of a further 
5% interest in Connect Plus (M25) Holdings Ltd to Equitix for a cash 
consideration of £42m, equivalent to the price of the 20% disposal 
in 2017. The expected proﬁt on disposal for this transaction is 
£21m. On 23 February 2018, the Group completed this transaction 
and received from Equitix the full cash consideration of £104m, 
inclusive of the £62m outstanding at the reporting date as detailed 
in Note 32.2.4 on page 151. The Group continues to own a 15% 
interest in Connect Plus (M25) Holdings Ltd.
On 7 March 2018, the Group repaid the ﬁrst tranche of its US 
private placement notes amounting to US$45m (£32.5m). 
US$305m remain outstanding, with the next tranche of US$46m 
being due in March 2020 and the remaining loan notes falling due 
in March 2023 and March 2025.
Change of control provisions
The Group’s bank facility agreements contain provisions that, on 
30 days’ notice being given to the Group, the lender may exercise 
its discretion to require prepayment of the loans on a change of 
control of the Company and cancel all commitments under the 
agreement concerned.
A number of signiﬁcant joint venture and contract bond agreements 
include provisions which become exercisable by a counterparty 
on a change of control of the Company. These include the right 
of a counterparty to request additional security and to terminate 
an agreement.
The Group’s US private placement arrangements require the 
Company, promptly upon becoming aware that a change of control 
of the Company has occurred (and in any event within 10 business 
days), to give written notice of such fact to all holders of the notes 
and make an offer to prepay the entire unpaid principal amount of 
the notes, together with accrued interest.
The Group’s convertible bond arrangements provide that the holder 
of bonds can require the Company to redeem its bonds following 
a change of control of the Company at their principal amount, 
together with accrued interest. The Company is required to notify 
the bond holder within 14 days of a change of control.
Some other commercial agreements, entered into in the normal 
course of business, include change of control provisions.
The Group’s share and incentive plans include usual provisions 
relating to change of control, as do the terms of the Company’s 
cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares.
There are no agreements providing for compensation for the 
Directors or employees on a change of control.
Financial instruments
The Group’s ﬁnancial risk management objectives and policies and 
its exposure to the following risks – foreign currency, interest rate, 
price and credit – are detailed in Note 38 on pages 156 to 160.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU) and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with UK accounting standards, including 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the ﬁnancial 
statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of their 
proﬁt or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Company ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, 
reliable and prudent
 – for the Group ﬁnancial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU
 – for the Company ﬁnancial statements, state whether applicable 
UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the Company 
ﬁnancial statements
 – assess the Group and the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern
 – use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that its ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are responsible for such internal control as they determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of ﬁnancial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as 
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.  balfourbeatty.com/AR2017
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 75 Strategic Report
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
The Directors conﬁrm that to the best of their knowledge:
 – the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole
 – the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.
In light of the work undertaken by the Audit and Risk Committee 
reported in greater detail on pages 67 to 69 and the internal 
veriﬁcation and approval process which has been followed this 
year, the Directors are able to state that the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position, performance, business model 
and strategy.
Statements of Directors as to disclosure of information 
to auditors
Each of the Directors at the date of approval of this report 
conﬁrms that:
 – so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware
 – the Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have 
taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

Remuneration report
Chairman of Remuneration Committee’s introduction
Dear fellow shareholders,
As chairman of the Board’s Remuneration Committee, I am 
pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration report for 2017, 
which will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2018 AGM.
At the 2017 AGM, shareholders approved the Remuneration Policy. 
The policy is not presented here, but can be found in full at  
https://balfourbeatty.com/remuneration_policy. The decisions set 
out in this report are in line with that policy.
Our remuneration policy’s primary objective is to ensure we are 
able to attract, retain and motivate key executives to deliver strong 
sustainable business performance aligned to the strategic plan and 
to the interests of shareholders.
Context
As our Chairman, Philip Aiken, explained in his introduction, the 
Group has continued to demonstrate further progress in restoring 
Balfour Beatty to proﬁtability and enhancing its ﬁnancial and 
operational resilience.
This transformation has happened as a result of strong, conﬁdent 
leadership over the last three years and the team has delivered 
considerable value for shareholders over the period.
Whilst, of course, this has been achieved through the commitment 
and dedication of our employees, substantial credit should be given 
to Group Chief Executive, Leo Quinn, and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, 
Philip Harrison.
Since joining the Company in 2015, Leo and Philip have led the 
Build to Last transformation programme and made signiﬁcant 
progress towards achieving our goals.
As you will see within the report, the decisions recognise the scale 
of change that Leo and Philip have brought and I hope that you will 
support these by voting in favour of this report at the 2018 AGM.
Reward for 2017
In respect of 2017, the annual bonus payments for the executive 
Directors reﬂect the strong performance of the Group – proﬁt and 
cash targets were met in full and the personal performance of both 
executive Directors was strong. The Group Chief Executive and the 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer received annual bonus payments of 97% 
and 96% of the maximum available respectively. 50% of this will be 
deferred in shares for three years.
The TSR performance conditions relating to the 2015 PSP 
measured performance over the three years ended 31 December 
2017 for all participants except Leo Quinn whose award had a 
measurement period for the TSR part of the three years ended 
14 October 2017. TSR performance conditions were met in part, 
EPS almost met its maximum target and the maximum cash target 
was met. As a result, 89% and 86% of these awards will vest 
for Leo Quinn and Philip Harrison respectively on 26 June 2018. 
Again this reﬂects the strong performance over the three years of 
our Build to Last transformation.
Salaries are normally reviewed on 1 July, and it was agreed that the 
executive Directors would not receive a salary increase for 2017, 
with salaries remaining at the level agreed upon their appointment 
in 2015. The next salary review date is 1 July 2018.
Areas of focus in 2018
The current remuneration policy was approved by shareholders 
at the 2017 AGM. The Committee believes that the current 
approach remains effective and aligned to the Company’s 
strategic objectives. The Committee will continue to monitor 
external corporate governance developments and best practice 
developments over the forthcoming year.
Remuneration policy for 2018
The Committee will continue to operate within the remuneration 
policy approved by shareholders in 2017. The key highlights of how 
we intend to apply this for 2018 are:
 – the annual bonus will be based on proﬁt before tax 40%, cash 
35% and strategic business and personal objectives 25%
 – the Group Chief Executive will be granted a PSP award over 
shares worth 200% of base salary and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer 
175% of base salary and
 – consistent with awards made previously, PSP awards will 
continue to be based on the achievement of three performance 
metrics split equally between relative TSR, EPS and cash.
Conclusion
The Committee will continue to engage with major shareholders 
to ensure that executive remuneration remains appropriate as the 
Board takes its responsibility to engage with investors seriously. 
We believe that our policy continues to deliver a robust link 
between reward and performance, that it is implemented rigorously 
in line with its stated objectives, and is aligned with the Group’s 
strategic goals. We hope you will support our remuneration report 
at this year’s AGM.

Base salaries
The annual base salary review date is 1 July for executive Directors. Current base salaries for the executive Directors are as follows:
1 July 2016 
£
1 July 2017 
£
 
% increase
Leo Quinn 800,000 800,000 0.0%
Philip Harrison 400,000 400,000 0.0%
The normal review date for executive Directors’ base salaries is 1 July, but it was agreed that neither would receive an increase in 2017. 
The next salary review date is 1 July 2018.
Performance targets for the AIP in 2018
For 2018, the AIP for the executive Directors will be a maximum bonus of 150% of base salary, based on the achievement of three 
performance measures:
 – proﬁt before tax (40%)
 –cash (35%)
 – strategic business and personal objectives (25%).
The three elements are measured and calculated independently of each other and 50% of any bonus earned will be deferred for three years 
in Balfour Beatty shares.
While the Committee has chosen not to disclose in advance the performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include items which 
the Committee considers commercially sensitive, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be presented in 
next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance targets for PSP awards granted in 2018
For 2018, the Group Chief Executive will be granted a PSP award over shares worth 200% of base salary and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer 
175% of base salary. Consistent with the approach adopted in 2015, 2016 and 2017, the PSP awards to be granted in 2018 will be based on 
the achievement of three performance measures:
 – relative TSR (33.3%) – the Company’s TSR measured against a comparator group of UK listed companies ranked 51–200 by market 
capitalisation in the FTSE All Share Index (excluding investment trusts) as at 1 January 2018, the start of the performance period. There is 
no vesting for ranking below median, with 25% of this part of an award vesting at median ranking, rising to 100% vesting of this part of an 
award at upper quartile or higher
 – EPS (33.3%) – the Group’s EPS over the three-year performance period
 – cash (33.3%) – cash remains critical as a long-term performance measure during the Group’s transformation. 
As at the date of publication of this Remuneration report, the Committee had not ﬁnalised the EPS and cash performance targets for the 
PSP awards to be granted in 2018. These EPS and cash targets will be set at an appropriate level of stretch and will be fully disclosed in the 
RNS announcement issued immediately following the grant of the PSP award and in the Remuneration report for 2018.
Non-executive Directors
The Company’s approach to setting non-executive Directors’ fees is by reference to fees paid at similar companies and reﬂects the time 
commitment and responsibilities of each role. At the annual review of fees for the non-executive Directors on 1 July 2017, the annual base 
fee was increased from £56,000 to £60,000 and the annual fee for chairing a Board Committee was increased from £10,000 to £12,500. 
Those fees had not been increased since the review on 1 July 2012. A summary of current fees is as follows:
1 July 2016 
£
1 July 2017 
£
 
% increase
Chairman 270,000 270,000 0%
Base fee 56,000 60,000 7%
Senior Independent Director fee 10,000 10,000 0%
Committee chair fee 10,000 12,500 25%
For non-executive Directors based outside Europe, the travel allowance for each overseas visit made on Company business 
remains at £2,500.
Where the Chairman is also the chair of a Committee, he or she receives no committee chair fee. The Senior Independent Director fee is 
only payable if he or she is not the chair of a Committee.  balfourbeatty.com/AR2017

1 Base salary and fees were those paid in respect of the period of the year during which the individuals were Directors. 
2 In practice, the base salary paid to Leo Quinn was reduced due to his participation in the Company’s Share Incentive Plan. The salary reduction in 2017 was £1,800. 
3 Taxable beneﬁts are calculated in terms of UK taxable values. Leo Quinn received private medical insurance for himself and his spouse and received a car allowance of £20,000 
per annum. Philip Harrison received private medical insurance for himself only and received a car allowance of £14,000 per annum. 
4 Philip Aiken, Michael Lucki, Maureen Kempston Darkes and Graham Roberts received taxable travel expenses and/or travel allowances which are shown in the taxable 
beneﬁts column.
5 AIP 2017: further details of these awards are set out on pages 80 and 81.
6 This relates to the 2015 PSP award for which the performance period ended in 2017 with the valuation of vesting shares calculated on the closing share price of 297p on 
31 December 2017. Under the rules of the PSP scheme, the participants may also receive an award of cash or shares in lieu of the value of dividends paid over the vesting period 
on vested shares. Further details of these awards are set out on pages 81 and 82.

performance of the executive Directors. The executive Directors have, in the opinion of the Committee, continued to make signiﬁcant 
improvements to the business through Build to Last to deliver our goals.
Vesting of PSP awards for the year under review
The PSP awards granted on 26 June 2015 were based on a performance period for the three years ended 31 December 2017, except for 
Leo Quinn’s award which has a measurement period for the TSR part of the three years to 14 October 2017. The performance conditions 
applying to one-third of each award were comparative Total Shareholder Return measured versus the FTSE 51-150 (excluding investment 
trust) ‘live’ companies, cash performance measured as Total Net Debt and Earnings Per Share. 25% of each part of the award would vest 
for threshold performance increasing to 100% of each part of the award vesting for maximum performance or above.

performance (TSR) relative to the TSR performance over the same period of a comparator group of companies comprising the constituents 
of the FTSE 51-200 (excluding investment trusts) as at the start of the measurement period. The measurement period for the TSR Part is the

straight-line basis. Were OCF for 2019 to be £164 million to £200 million or more, between 50% of and 100% of the Cash Part would vest 
on a straight-line basis.
The performance condition applying to a separate one-third of each award (the EPS Part) will measure the Group’s earnings per 
share performance.
No portion of the EPS Part will vest unless the Group’s EPS for the ﬁnancial year ending 31 December 2019 is 19p, at which point 25% 
of the EPS Part will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting for the Group’s EPS for 2019 being 29p or more.
Executive Directors’ recruitment terms
Leo Quinn
As part of his recruitment arrangements and as fully disclosed in the 2014, 2015 and 2016 Remuneration reports, the Company agreed to 
compensate Leo Quinn for incentive awards which were forfeited upon leaving his previous employer. The Company granted a conditional 
share award over 1,812,767 Balfour Beatty plc shares on 2 January 2015 to vest in two tranches:
 – After application of the performance criteria, the ﬁrst tranche vested on 16 March 2017 with 423,704 shares vesting and 180,552 shares 
lapsing. Vesting was subject to share price targets tested at the second anniversary of grant based on a 60-day average share price as 
adjusted for dividends. The targets were 25% of this part of the award vesting for an end average share price of 222p increasing pro-rata 
for full vesting of this part of the award for an end average share price of 309p with no vesting for this part of the award for an average 
share price of less than 222p.
 – Outstanding at year end is the second tranche, a conditional share award over 1,208,511 Balfour Beatty plc shares granted on 2 January 
2015 which will vest on the third anniversary of grant subject to share price targets tested at the end of the three-year period based on 
a 60-day average share price as adjusted for dividends. 25% of this part of the award will vest for an end average share price of 250p 
increasing pro-rata for full vesting of this part of the award for an end average share price of 380p. No vesting for this part of the award will 
take place for an average share price of less than 250p.
 – In addition to the dividend adjusted share price targets, an underpin will apply to the vesting whereby the Committee must be satisﬁed 
with the underlying performance of the business for this award to vest.
The outstanding share-based buyout award lapses in the event of voluntary resignation or termination for cause prior to the vesting date. 
In the event of good leaver departure, the awards will vest at employment cessation, subject to performance conditions and pro-rating at the 
time of cessation. 
In relation to the second tranche of 1,208,511 shares, on 12 March 2018 the Remuneration Committee reviewed the end average share 
price of 277.31p at 2 January 2018 against the target range, indicating vesting at 40.76% of this part of the award, and also considered the 
underlying performance of the Company over the performance period. The Committee determined that 40.76% of the award (492,589 
shares) will be permitted to vest on 14 March 2018 when the Company enters an open period.  Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Executive Directors’ recruitment terms continued

As part of his recruitment arrangements, the Company agreed to compensate Philip Harrison for share awards which were forfeited upon 
leaving his previous employer. The performance targets are consistent with the awards granted to Leo Quinn at the start of 2015.
The Company granted a conditional share award over 92,493 Balfour Beatty plc shares on 11 June 2015 to vest in two tranches:
 – After application of the performance criteria, the ﬁrst tranche vested on 16 March 2017 with 21,529 shares vesting and 9,302 shares 
lapsing. Vesting was subject to share price targets tested at 31 December 2016 based on a 60-day average share price as adjusted for 
dividends. The targets were 25% of this part of the award vesting for an end average share price of 222p increasing pro-rata for full vesting 
of this part of the award for an end average share price of 309p with no vesting for this part of the award for an average share price of less 
than 222p.
 – Outstanding at year end is the second tranche, a conditional share award over 61,662 Balfour Beatty plc shares which will vest on 
31 December 2017 subject to share price targets based on a 60-day average share price as adjusted for dividends. 25% of this part of the 
award will vest for an end average share price of 250p increasing pro-rata for full vesting of this part of the award for an end average share 
price of 380p. No vesting for this part of the award will take place for an average share price of less than 250p.
 – In addition to the dividend adjusted share price targets, an underpin will apply to the vesting whereby the Committee must be satisﬁed 
with the underlying performance of the business for this award to vest.
The outstanding share buyout award lapses in the event of voluntary resignation or termination for cause prior to the vesting date. In the 
event of good leaver departure, the awards will vest at employment cessation, subject to performance conditions and pro-rating at the time 
of cessation. 
In relation to the second tranche of 61,662 shares, on 12 March 2018 the Remuneration Committee reviewed the end average share 
price of 277.14p at 31 December 2017 against the target range, indicating vesting at 40.66% of this part of the award, and also considered 
the underlying performance of the Company over the performance period. The Committee determined that 40.66% of the award 
(25,071 shares) will be permitted to vest on 14 March 2018 when the Company enters an open period.

Performance graph
As in previous reports, the Remuneration Committee has chosen to compare the TSR on the Company’s ordinary shares against the FTSE 
250 Index (excluding investment trusts) principally because this is a broad index of which the Company is a constituent member. The values 
indicated in the graph show the share price growth plus reinvested dividends from a £100 hypothetical holding of ordinary shares in Balfour 
Beatty plc and in the index, and have been calculated using 30 trading day average values.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Balfour Beatty plc
1 Our opinion is unmodiﬁed
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Balfour Beatty plc (the Company) for the year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise 
the Group Income Statement, Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, Group Statement of Changes in Equity, Company Statement 
of Changes in Equity, Group and Company Balance Sheets, Group Statement of Cash Flows, and the related Notes, including the accounting 
policies in Note 2.
In our opinion:
 – the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 
and of the Group’s proﬁt for the year then ended;
 – the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union;
 – the parent Company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework; and
 – the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities are 
described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufﬁcient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion 
is consistent with our report to the Audit and Risk Committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the shareholders on 19 May 2016. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the two ﬁnancial 
years ended 31 December 2017. We have fulﬁlled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance 
with, UK ethical requirements, including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. No non-audit services prohibited 
by that standard were provided.

2 Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signiﬁcance in the audit of the ﬁnancial statements 
and include the most signiﬁcant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identiﬁed by us, including those 
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters (unchanged from 2016), in decreasing order of audit signiﬁcance, in arriving 
at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, 
our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, 
and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are 
incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
The risk
Contract accounting £6,103 million (2016: £6,173 million) Risk vs 2016: 
Refer to page 68 (Audit and Risk Committee report), pages 104 and 105 (Principal accounting policies – Note 2.5 Construction and service 
contracts) and pages 108 and 109 (Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty – Note 2.27a Revenue and margin recognition and 
Note 2.27f Provisions).
Subjective estimate
For the majority of its contracts, the Group recognises revenue 
and proﬁt on the stage of completion based on the proportion of 
contract costs incurred for the work performed to the balance sheet 
date, relative to the estimated total forecast costs of the contract 
at completion. 
The recognition of revenue and proﬁt/loss therefore rely on 
estimates in relation to the forecast total costs of each contract. 
Cost contingencies may also be included in these estimates to 
take account of speciﬁc uncertain risks, or disputed claims against 
the Group, arising within each contract. These contingencies are 
reviewed by the Group on a regular basis throughout the contract life 
and adjusted where appropriate. 
The revenue on contracts may also include variations and claims. 
Variations and claims are recognised on a contract-by-contract basis 
when the Group’s negotiations have reached a stage such that it is 
probable that the customer will accept the claim and the amount 
can be measured reliably. In certain circumstances recoveries from 
insurers are also included in forecasts where sufﬁcient progress has 
been made to meet accounting recognition requirements. In addition 
for certain contracts estimates are made for latent and known defect 
provisions within the warranty period. Therefore there is a high 
degree of risk and associated management judgement in estimating 
the amount of revenue and associated proﬁt to be recognised by the 
Group up to the balance sheet date and changes to these estimates 
could give rise to material variances.
Our response
Using a variety of quantitative and qualitative criteria we selected a 
sample of contracts to assess and challenge the most signiﬁcant 
and complex contract estimates. We obtained the detailed project 
review papers from the Group to support the estimates made and 
challenged the judgements underlying those papers with senior 
operational, commercial and ﬁnancial management. In this area our 
audit procedures included:
 – Historical comparisons: evaluating the ﬁnancial performance of 
contracts against budget and historical trends;
 – Site visits: completing site visits, with the involvement of our 
industry specialists, to certain higher risk or larger value contracts, 
physically inspecting the progress on site for individual projects 
and identifying areas of complexity through observation and 
discussion with site personnel;
 – Benchmarking assumptions: challenging the Group’s 
judgement in respect of forecast contract out-turn, contingencies, 
settlements and the recoverability of contract balances via 
agreement to third-party certiﬁcations and conﬁrmations and 
with reference to our own assessments, historical outcomes and 
industry norms;
 – Customer correspondence scrutiny: analysing correspondence 
with customers around variations and claims to challenge the 
estimates of claims and variations made by the Group;
 – Insurer correspondence scrutiny: analysing correspondence 
with insurers around recognised insurance claims to challenge 
management’s position taken on the contract;
 – Test of detail: analysing the end of job forecasts on contracts 
tested and challenging the estimates within the forecasts by 
considering the amounts already procured, the amounts still to 
be procured, the site and time related cost forecasts against 
programme and run rates, and any contingency held;
 – Test of detail: inspecting selected contracts for key clauses; 
identifying relevant contractual mechanisms such as pain/gain 
shares, design bonuses, liquidated damages and success fees 
and assessing whether these key clauses have been appropriately 
reﬂected in the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements;
 – Our sector experience: using our sector experience to assess 
whether the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements 
resulting from the estimates and assumptions made represent 
a balanced view of the risks and opportunities pertinent to the 
contract working capital positions;
 – Our sector experience: considering whether provisions against 
contracts sufﬁciently reﬂect the level of risk by challenging 
the Group’s judgement in this area with reference to our 
own assessments.

The risk
Recoverability of Group goodwill and of parent Company’s investment in subsidiaries
Group goodwill, excluding Balfour Beatty Communities US: £825 million (2016: £883 million); Parent Company: amount within total 
investment in subsidiaries of £1,700 million (2016: £1,698 million) 
Risk vs 2016: 
Refer to page 68 (Audit and Risk Committee report), page 106 (Principal accounting policies – Note 2.12 Intangible assets, Note 2.16 
Impairment of assets and Note 2.17 Investments) and pages 119 and 120 (Note 14 Intangible assets – goodwill) and page 129 
(Note 19.2 Investments – Company) 
Forecast-based valuation
There is a risk that the goodwill allocated to cash-generating units 
(CGUs) and parent Company’s investment in subsidiaries are not 
recoverable and should be impaired. Due to the inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting and discounting future cash ﬂows, which are 
the basis of the assessment of recoverability, this is one of the key 
judgement areas for our audit.
Our risk relates to the goodwill within the Construction Services 
and Support Services segments and to the parent Company’s 
investment in Balfour Beatty Investment Holdings Ltd.
The Group annually carries out an impairment assessment of 
goodwill and investments using a value-in-use model which is 
based on the net present value of the forecast earnings of the 
cash-generating unit. This is calculated using certain assumptions 
around discount rates, growth rates and cash ﬂow forecasts.
Our response
Our procedures included:
 – Assessing methodology: considering the consistency and 
appropriateness of the allocation of businesses and related 
goodwill balances into CGUs;
 – Sensitivity analysis: performing our own sensitivity analysis, 
including a reasonably possible reduction in assumed growth rates 
and margins to identify areas on which to focus our procedures;
 – Our sector experience: considering the underlying assumptions 
in determining the cash ﬂows and growth assumptions applied 
with reference to historical forecasting accuracy, current order 
book, and wider macro-environment conditions;
 – Our valuation experience: challenging the assumptions used 
by the Group in the calculation of the discount rates, including 
comparisons with external data sources and by involving our 
own valuation specialist to assist us in evaluating the valuation 
methodologies used by the Group, as well as the discount rate 
assumptions applied;
 – Assessing transparency: considering the adequacy of 
the Group’s disclosures including disclosure of sensitivity 
of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key 
assumptions appropriately reﬂecting the risks inherent in the 
valuation of goodwill. We also considered the adequacy of the 
disclosures in respect of the parent Company’s investment 
in subsidiaries.
Our ﬁndings:
We considered the Group’s assessment of the recoverability 
of goodwill in the Group and the parent Company’s investment 
in subsidiaries to be acceptable.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group ﬁnancial statements as a whole was set at £10.0 million (2016: £10.0 million), determined with reference to the 
benchmark of Group proﬁt before tax from continuing operations of £156 million normalised to take into account items that are considered 
one-off or exceptional in the year as disclosed in Note 10 on pages 114 to 116, but not including an adjustment for the amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets of £9 million, of which it represents 6.4% (2016: 20%). 
Due to the volatility in the Group’s results in recent ﬁnancial years, as part of our materiality assessment we also considered the scale of 
the business, the level of judgement and precision within the Group’s key accounting judgements, as well as how the level of materiality 
compares to other relevant benchmarks such as revenue, of which it represents 0.1% and total assets, of which it represents 0.2%, where 
they provide more consistent measures year on year than Group proﬁt before tax. 
We reported to the Audit and Risk Committee any corrected and uncorrected identiﬁed misstatements exceeding £0.5 million 
(2016: £0.5 million) in addition to other identiﬁed misstatements that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Materiality for the parent Company ﬁnancial statements as a whole was set at £9.0 million (2016: £9.0 million), determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Company total assets, of which it represents 0.27% (2016: 0.27%). balfourbeatty.com/AR2017

Of the Group’s 16 reporting components (2016: 16), 11 were subject to an audit for Group reporting purposes (2016: 11) and ﬁve (2016: two) 
to speciﬁed risk-focused audit procedures. For the residual three components in 2016, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level 
to re-examine our assessment that there were no signiﬁcant risks of material misstatement within these. The components for which we 
performed speciﬁed risk-focused procedures were not individually ﬁnancially signiﬁcant enough to require an audit for Group reporting 
purposes, but did present speciﬁc individual risks that needed to be addressed. The speciﬁed audit procedures were performed over ﬁxed 
assets (one component), inventory (one component), provisions (two components), contract accounting (one component) and cash (one 
component). The components within the scope of our work accounted for 100% (2016: 100%) of Group revenue, 100% (2016: 99%) of 
Group proﬁt before tax and 100% (2016: 100%) of Group total assets as illustrated above. 
The Group operates one shared service centre in Newcastle, United Kingdom, the outputs of which are included in the ﬁnancial information 
of the reporting components it services. Therefore it is not a separate reporting component. The service centre is subject to speciﬁed 
risk-focused audit procedures, predominantly the testing of transaction processing and review controls. Additional procedures are performed 
at each reporting component to address the audit risks not covered by the work performed over the shared service centre.
The Group audit team instructed components, and the auditors of the shared service centre, as to the signiﬁcant areas to be covered, 
including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the components’ materiality, 
which ranged from £0.5 million to £9.0 million, having regard to the mix of size and proﬁle of the Group across the components. 
The work on the 11 of the Group’s 16 components was performed by the component auditors. Speciﬁed risk-focused procedures 
on four components, audit of the parent Company, Group consolidation work and procedures on the items excluded from normalised 
Group proﬁt before tax were performed by the Group audit team. 
In 2017, the Group audit team visited nine components in the United Kingdom, United States and Hong Kong (2016: nine components). 
Telephone conference meetings were held with these component auditors and the majority of the others that were not physically visited. 
At these visits and meetings, the ﬁndings reported to the Group audit team were discussed in detail.
4 We have nothing to report on going concern
We are required to report to you if:
 – we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement in Note 1 on page 102 to the ﬁnancial 
statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast signiﬁcant doubt over the 
Group’s and the Company’s use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the ﬁnancial statements; 
or
 – the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 47 is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge.
We have nothing to report in these respects. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

5 We have nothing to report on the other information in the Annual Report
The Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the ﬁnancial statements. Our opinion 
on the ﬁnancial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly 
stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our ﬁnancial statements audit work, the 
information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the ﬁnancial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work 
we have not identiﬁed material misstatements in the other information.
Strategic report and Directors’ report
Based solely on our work on the other information:
 – we have not identiﬁed material misstatements in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report;
 – in our opinion the information given in those reports for the ﬁnancial year is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements; and
 – in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Directors’ remuneration report
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our ﬁnancial statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to:
 – the Directors’ conﬁrmation within the viability statement on page 57 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;
 – the principal risks disclosures describing these risks and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and
 – the Directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have 
done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualiﬁcations or assumptions.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the viability statement. We have nothing to report in this respect.
Corporate governance disclosures
We are required to report to you if:
 – we have identiﬁed material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our ﬁnancial statements audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; or
 – the section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit and Risk Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance Statement does not properly disclose a departure from the eleven provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code speciﬁed by the Listing Rules for our review.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
6 We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent Company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.

7 Respective responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on pages 74 and 75, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the ﬁnancial 
statements, including being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of ﬁnancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or other irregularities (see below), or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the ﬁnancial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
Irregularities – ability to detect
Our audit aimed to detect non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations (irregularities) that could have a material effect on the ﬁnancial 
statements. In planning and performing our audit we considered the impact of laws and regulations in core areas such as ﬁnancial reporting, 
and company and taxation legislation.
We considered the extent of compliance with those laws and regulations that directly affect the ﬁnancial statements, being ﬁnancial 
reporting, and company and taxation legislation, as part of our procedures on the related ﬁnancial statement items. For the remaining laws 
and regulations, we made enquiries of Directors and other management (as required by auditing standards).
We communicated identiﬁed laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout 
the audit. 
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.
8 The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Commentary on the Group Income Statement
*
Total pre-tax proﬁt from continuing operations for 2017 was £117m, 
which is inclusive of a non-underlying loss of £48m. The total proﬁt 
after tax including discontinued operations was £168m.
Background
The Group Income Statement includes the majority of the 
Group’s income and expenses for the year with the remainder 
being recorded within the statement of comprehensive income. 
The Group’s income statement is presented showing the Group’s 
underlying and non-underlying results separately on the face of 
the income statement to assist in understanding the underlying 
ﬁnancial performance achieved by the Group.
The income statement shows the revenue and results of continuing 
operations. The post-tax results shown within discontinued 
operations represent the Group’s share of underlying proﬁts from 
its joint venture interests in Dutco Balfour Beatty LLC and BK 
Gulf LLC up until the date of disposal on 1 March 2017 of £1m. 
Upon disposal of these interests, a non-underlying gain of £5m was 
recognised within discontinued operations. 
Revenue
Revenue from continuing operations including non-underlying 
items, joint ventures and associates decreased by 1% to £8,264m 
from £8,368m in 2016. 
Gain on disposal of investments 
The Group continued its programme of realising accumulated value 
in the Investments portfolio and generated income by disposing 
of a 20% interest in Connect Plus (M25) Holdings Ltd resulting in 
a net underlying gain of £86m after recycling gains of £85m from 
reserves to the income statement. The Group continued to hold 
a 20% interest in this asset at 31 December 2017. 
Share of results of joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures and associates are those entities over which the 
Group exercises joint control or has signiﬁcant inﬂuence and whose 
results are generally incorporated using the equity method whereby 
the Group’s share of the post-tax results of joint ventures and 
associates is included in the Group’s operating proﬁt.
The Group’s proﬁt generated from its share of joint ventures and 
associates was in line with the prior year.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 95 Strategic Report
Underlying proﬁt from continuing operations 
Underlying proﬁt from continuing operations increased to £196m 
from £69m in 2016. This was primarily driven by an improvement 
in Construction Services from a loss of £21m in 2016 to a proﬁt 
from operations of £72m in 2017 as the Group continued to be 
more selective in the work that it bids, through increased bid 
margin thresholds, improved risk frameworks and better contract 
governance. Support Services and Infrastructure Investments also 
reported improved operating results, including the beneﬁt of £86m 
of gains from investment disposals. 
Non-underlying items
Non-underlying items are items of ﬁnancial performance which 
the Group believes should be separately identiﬁed on the face of 
the income statement to assist in understanding the underlying 
ﬁnancial performance achieved by the Group.
Non-underlying items from continuing operations of £48m before 
tax were charged to the income statement. 
On 15 January 2018, Carillion plc ﬁled for compulsory liquidation. 
Carillion was one of the Group’s joint operations partners in the 
Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) project on a joint and 
several basis. As a result of Carillion’s liquidation, the Group and its 
remaining joint operations partner on the project, Galliford Try plc, 
are jointly liable to deliver Carillion’s remaining obligations on this 
contract in addition to each partner’s existing 33% share. 
In light of this, the Group has recognised a one-off non-underlying 
loss provision of £44m which reﬂects the Group’s additional loss 
on the contract as a result of Carillion’s liquidation. The contract is 
expected to complete in the summer of 2018.
The Group also disposed of its entire interest in its professional 
services business, Heery International Inc, resulting in a gain on 
disposal of £18m. In addition to Heery, the Group also disposed of 
its entire interest in Regional & City Airports (Blackpool) Holdings 
Ltd (Blackpool Airport) which resulted in a loss on disposal of £1m.
Signiﬁcant other non-underlying items included £12m of 
restructuring costs incurred relating to the Group’s Build to Last 
transformation programme which was launched in early 2015, 
and amortisation of acquired intangible assets of £9m.
Net ﬁnance cost
Net ﬁnance cost of £31m in the year represents an increase from 
£7m in 2016. The prior year comparison beneﬁted from a £19m 
gain on foreign currency deposits, with the corresponding gain in 
2017 at £1m. 
Taxation
The Group’s underlying proﬁt before tax from continuing operations 
for subsidiaries of £106m (2016: £5m) resulted in an underlying tax 
charge of £23m (2016: £12m).
Discontinued operations
On 1 March 2017, the Group disposed of its 49% interests in 
its Middle East joint ventures for total consideration of £11m, 
generating a non-underlying gain of £5m in the year. As a result of 
this disposal, the Group’s interests in its Middle East joint ventures 
have been presented as discontinued operations. The Group has 
re-presented its comparatives accordingly. 
In 2016, the Group reached a settlement with the purchaser of 
Parsons Brinckerhoff (PB), the Group’s former professional services 
business disposed in October 2014, in relation to outstanding tax 
matters and indemnities. The Group received an additional £9m as 
a result of this settlement. At the same time, provisions in relation 
to these matters have been released, resulting in an overall non-
underlying gain to the Group of £24m.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations were 
23.7p (2016: 0.2p) as a result of signiﬁcant improvements in 
Construction Services as discussed above. Including the results 
from discontinued operations, the Group generated basic earnings 
per share of 24.7p (2016: 3.5p). Underlying earnings per share from 
continuing operations were 20.9p (2016: 7.2p).

Commentary on Group Statement of Comprehensive Income*
Total comprehensive income for 2017 was £312m comprising 
a total proﬁt after tax including discontinued operations of £168m 
and other comprehensive income after tax of £144m. 
Background
The Group Statement of Comprehensive Income is presented 
on a total Group basis combining continuing and discontinued 
operations. Other comprehensive income (OCI) is categorised 
into items which will affect the proﬁt and loss of the Group in 
subsequent periods when the gain or loss is realised and those 
which will not be recycled into the income statement.
Items which will not subsequently be reclassiﬁed to the 
income statement 
Actuarial movements on retirement beneﬁt liabilities are increases 
or decreases in the present value of the pension liability because of:
 – differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and 
what has actually occurred; or
 – changes in actuarial assumptions used to value the obligations.
Actuarial gains for the Group including joint ventures and associates 
totalled £246m in 2017 compared to losses of £120m in 2016. 
Refer to Note 28.
Items which will subsequently be reclassiﬁed to the 
income statement 
Currency translation differences
The Group operates in a number of countries with different local 
currencies. Currency translation differences arise on translation 
of the balance sheet and results from the local functional currency 
into the Group’s presentational currency, sterling.
Fair value revaluations – PPP ﬁnancial assets
Assets constructed by PPP concession companies are classiﬁed 
principally as available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets. In the operational 
phase fair value is determined by discounting the future cash 
ﬂows allocated to the ﬁnancial asset using discount rates based on 
long-term gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels associated with the 
assets, with market-related fair value movements recognised in 
OCI. During the year, there was a decrease in gilt rates resulting in a 
fair value gain including joint ventures and associates of £63m being 
taken through OCI (2016: £37m).
Fair value revaluations – cash ﬂow hedges
Cash ﬂow hedges are principally interest rate swaps, to manage 
the interest rate and inﬂation rate risks in the Group’s Infrastructure 
Investments’ subsidiary, joint venture and associate companies 
which are exposed by their long-term contractual agreements. 
The fair value of derivatives changes in response to prevailing 
market conditions. During the year, LIBOR increased resulting 
in a fair value gain on the interest rate swaps including joint 
ventures and associates of £15m being recognised in OCI 
(2016: £108m loss).
Recycling of reserves to the income statement on disposal
Fair value gains and losses and currency translation differences 
recognised in OCI are transferred to the income statement upon 
disposal of the asset and therefore on disposal of Infrastructure 
Investments’ concessions and other businesses, £85m proﬁt 
including joint ventures and associates was recycled to the income 
statement through OCI and is included in the gain on disposal.
There is no associated tax on the amounts recycled to the 
income statement.

Commentary on Group Statement of Changes in Equity
*
Total equity holders’ funds of £1,066m at 31 December 
2017 increased by 40% primarily due to movements in 
comprehensive income.
Background
The Group Statement of Changes in Equity includes the total 
comprehensive income attributable to equity holders of the 
Company and non-controlling interests and also discloses 
transactions which have been recognised directly in equity 
and not through the income statement.
Dividends
Following the declaration of an interim dividend of 1.2p in 
August 2017 which was paid in December 2017, the Board is 
recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 2.4p, giving a total recommended 
dividend for the year of 3.6p. 
Joint ventures’ and associates’ dividends 
Dividends of £69m were received in the year from joint ventures 
and associates (JVA) resulting in a transfer of this amount between 
JVA reserves and Group retained proﬁts.
Other reserves
Other reserves comprise: the equity components of the preference 
shares £18m (2016: £18m) and convertible bonds £24m 
(2016: £26m); the hedging reserves £(27)m (2016: £(30)m); PPP 
ﬁnancial assets revaluation reserve £27m (2016: £25m); currency 
translation reserve £105m (2016: £135m); and other reserves £28m 
(2016: £17m).
Other reserve transfers relating to joint venture and associate 
disposals 
On disposal of JVAs, retained proﬁts relating to these 
businesses are transferred from the JVA reserves to the Group’s 
retained proﬁts.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 99 Strategic Report
Commentary on the Group Balance Sheet
*
Total assets of £4.9bn were 2% more than last year. Total liabilities 
of £3.8bn decreased by 5%, resulting in an overall increase in net 
assets of 40%. The increase is primarily driven by net actuarial 
gains on retirement beneﬁt liabilities of £246m and increased 
proﬁts generated in the year of £168m. 
Background
The Group’s Balance Sheet shows the Group’s assets and liabilities 
as at 31 December 2017. In accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of 
Financial Statements and IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale 
and Discontinued Operations, the Group does not re-present the 
prior year balance sheet for assets held for sale or disposals. 
Goodwill
The goodwill on the Group’s balance sheet at 31 December 2017 
decreased to £874m (2016: £937m). The decrease was due to 
currency translation differences of £46m and the disposal of 
goodwill relating to Heery International Inc of £17m. The Group has 
conducted impairment reviews on its goodwill balance at the year 
end and has concluded that it was fully recoverable. 
Investments in joint ventures and associates
Investments in joint ventures and associates have decreased to 
£531m in 2017 from £628m in 2016 primarily due to the disposal 
of a 20% interest in Connect Plus (M25) Holdings Ltd for total 
consideration of £165m, of which £62m was included in trade 
and other receivables as amounts due on disposals. This disposal 
triggered a £86m gain on disposal, including £85m in respect of 
revaluation reserves recycled to the income statement on disposal. 
The Group continued to hold a 20% interest in this joint venture at 
31 December 2017. 
Working capital
Net movements in working capital are discussed in the statement 
of cash ﬂows commentary on page 101.
Borrowings
Borrowings excluding non-recourse loans
The Group’s committed facility totals £400m. The purpose of this 
facility is to provide liquidity from a set of core relationship banks to 
support Balfour Beatty in its activities.
The Group completed its reﬁnancing in December 2015 with the 
£400m facility extending though to 2018. In November 2017, 
£375m of the facility was extended until 2020. At 31 December 
2017, all of this facility was undrawn. 
In December 2017, the Group repurchased £21m of its convertible 
bonds. The Group’s remaining £231m convertible bonds are due to 
mature in December 2018. Thus the liability component amounting 
to £226m has been reclassiﬁed from non-current to current on the 
Group’s balance sheet.
The Group’s borrowings include recourse borrowings to the 
Group arising from certain Infrastructure Investments projects 
in North America amounting to £13m (2016: £12m).
Non-recourse loans
In addition, the Group has non-recourse facilities in companies 
engaged in certain infrastructure concessions projects.
At 31 December 2017, the Group’s share of these non-recourse 
net borrowings amounted to £1,724m (2016: £1,755m), comprising 
£1,419m (2016: £1,522m) in relation to joint ventures and associates 
as disclosed in Note 18.2 and £305m (2016: £233m) on the Group 
balance sheet in relation to subsidiaries as disclosed in Note 26.
Retirement beneﬁt assets and liabilities
The Group’s balance sheet includes net retirement beneﬁt assets 
of £32m (2016: £231m liabilities) representing net surpluses in the 
Group’s pension schemes. This is primarily due to net actuarial 
gains of £242m in the year. The Group beneﬁted from changes 
in discount rate methodology, which resulted in a £123m gain 
which was recognised as part of the net actuarial gains for the year 
within the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income. The Group 
accounted for the discount rate change prospectively as a change in 
estimate. Refer to Note 28 for further details.
Any surplus of deﬁcit contributions would be recoverable by way 
of a refund as the Group has the unconditional right to the surplus 
and controls the run-off of the beneﬁt obligations once all other 
obligations of the schemes have been settled.
Other
In addition to the liabilities on the balance sheet, in the normal 
course of its business, the Group arranges for ﬁnancial institutions 
to provide customers with guarantees in connection with its 
contracting activities, commonly referred to as bonds. These bonds 
provide a customer with a level of ﬁnancial protection in the 
event that a contractor fails to meet its commitments under the 
terms of a contract. They are customary or mandatory in many 
of the markets in which the Group operates. In return for issuing 
the bonds, the ﬁnancial institutions receive a fee and a counter-
indemnity from the Company. As at 31 December 2017, contract 
bonds in issue by ﬁnancial institutions under uncommitted facilities 
covered £3.2bn (2016: £4.0bn) of the contract commitments of 
the Group.
Equity commitments
During 2017, the Group invested £35m (2016: £65m) in a 
combination of equity and shareholder loans to Infrastructure 
Investments’ project companies and at the end of the year had 
committed to provide a further £101m from 2018 onwards, 
inclusive of £23m expected for projects at preferred bidder stage. 
£37m of this is expected to be invested in 2018, as disclosed 
in Note 39(f).

Group Statement of Cash Flows
For the year ended 31 December 2017 balfourbeatty.com/AR2017
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 101 Strategic Report
Commentary on the Group Statement of Cash Flows*
Cash and cash equivalents increased by 26% during the year to 
£968m. The Group generated cash from operating activities in 
the year of £38m compared to cash used in operating activities 
of £136m in the prior year.
Background
The Group Statement of Cash Flows shows the cash ﬂows from 
operating, investing and ﬁnancing activities during the year.
Working capital
Working capital includes: inventories and non-construction work 
in progress; amounts due to and from construction contract 
customers; operating trade and other receivables; operating trade 
and other payables; and operating provisions. Where the net 
working capital balance is in an asset position, ie the inventories and 
receivables balances are greater than the payables and provisions, 
this is referred to as unfavourable/positive working capital. 
Where this is not the case, this is referred to as favourable/negative 
working capital.
Working capital movements
The movement of the individual working capital balances on the 
balance sheet will not be reﬂective of the underlying movement of 
working capital due to the balance sheet being affected by foreign 
currency movements and business disposals. 
Working capital movements are disclosed in Note 31.1.
Trade and other receivables and trade and other payables
Trade and other payables decreased during 2017, creating a 
working capital outﬂow of £92m (2016: £60m), offset by a working 
capital inﬂow of £95m (2016: £134m outﬂow) from trade and 
other receivables. The offsetting reduction in both balances is 
predominantly due to contract timings and associated customer 
and supplier payments compared to the prior year and the ongoing 
completion of historical non-underlying contracts.
Cash used in operations 
Underlying cash generated from continuing operations of £62m 
(2016: £132m outﬂow) comprised a proﬁt from operations 
of £196m (2016: £67m), a working capital outﬂow of £7m 
(2016: £82m) and includes the following signiﬁcant adjustment 
items: share of results of joint ventures and associates £59m 
(2016: £55m), depreciation charges of £29m (2016: £29m), pension 
deﬁcit payments of £25m (2016: £41m) and gain on disposals of 
investments in infrastructure concessions of £86m (2016: £65m).
Non-underlying cash used in continuing operations of £21m 
(2016: £15m) was impacted by a loss from operations of £48m 
(2016: £52m) and a working capital inﬂow of £34m (2016: £34m), 
after adjusting for the following principal non-cash items: a £17m 
net gain on disposal of businesses (2016: £8m), and an amortisation 
charge of £9m (2016: £9m) on acquired intangible assets.
Cash ﬂows from investing activities 
The Group received dividends of £69m (2016: £43m) from joint 
ventures and associates during the year.
During the year, the Group incurred additional spend on 
intangible assets of £81m (2016: £11m), of which £76m related 
to the construction spend on the University of Sussex student 
accommodation (2016: £6m at the University of Edinburgh) and 
£5m (2016: £5m) related to software and other intangible assets. 
The Group disposed of a 20% interest in Connect Plus (M25) 
Holdings Ltd for a total cash consideration of £165m, of which 
£103m was received in the year and the balance was received 
on 23 February 2018. The Group disposed of its 49% interests 
in Dutco Balfour Beatty LLC and BK Gulf LLC during the year 
for cash consideration of £11m, of which £5m was deferred 
and included in trade and other receivables as amounts due 
on disposals. In addition, the Group also made a payment of 
£3m in 2017 following the completion of the Balfour Beatty 
Sakti Indonesia disposal. In 2017, the Group also completed the 
disposal of its entire interest in its professional services business 
Heery International Inc, for a net cash consideration of £36m. 
Finally, the Group also received £4m of cash consideration for 
the disposal of its entire interest in Blackpool Airport. 
During the year, the Group incurred cash expenditure of £1m 
(2016: £31m) and received cash receipts of £15m (2016: £39m) 
relating to PPP ﬁnancial assets.
Cash ﬂows from ﬁnancing activities
The Group made further drawdowns on its non-recourse 
borrowings of £212m mainly to ﬁnance the construction of the 
University of Sussex student accommodation which has been 
classiﬁed as an IFRIC 12 intangible asset (2016: £65m at the 
University of Edinburgh). The Group repurchased £21m of its 
convertible bonds and also repaid £50m of its committed facility. 
The Group’s entire committed facility of £400m was undrawn 
at the year end.
Preference dividends of £12m (2016: £12m) were paid in the year.
Total interest payments amounted to £40m (2016: £65m) during 
the year of which £16m (2016: £24m) related to infrastructure 
concessions and £24m (2016: £41m) related to the US private 
placement, convertible bonds and recourse borrowings drawn 
down by the Group.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents increased from £768m to £968m.

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
1 Basis of accounting
The annual ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis as discussed on page 47 and in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS 
Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 that 
are applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Group has 
applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee as adopted by the 
European Union and effective for accounting periods beginning on 
1 January 2017.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention, except as described under Note 2.26. 
The functional and presentational currency of the Company and 
the presentational currency of the Group is sterling.
The separate ﬁnancial statements of the Company are presented 
as required by the Companies Act 2006 (the Act). The Company 
meets the deﬁnition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 (Financial 
Reporting Standard 100) issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council. Accordingly, in the year ended 31 December 2017 the 
Company reported under FRS 101 as issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council.
Except as noted below, the Company’s accounting policies are 
consistent with those described in the Group’s consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements. As permitted by FRS 101, the Company 
has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available 
under that standard in relation to share-based payments, 
ﬁnancial instruments, capital management, presentation of a 
cash ﬂow statement, related party transactions and comparative 
information. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
In addition to the application of FRS 101, the Company has 
taken advantage of Section 408 of the Act and consequently its 
statement of comprehensive income (including the proﬁt and loss 
account) is not presented as part of these accounts.
2 Principal accounting policies
2.1 Accounting standards 
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following accounting standards, interpretations and 
amendments have been adopted by the Group in the 
current period:
 – Amendments to the following standards:
 – IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative
 – IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for 
Unrealised Losses.
The above new and amended standards do not have a material 
effect on the Group. 
Accounting standards not yet adopted by the Group
The following accounting standards, interpretations and 
amendments have been issued by the IASB but had either not 
been adopted by the European Union or were not yet effective 
in the European Union at 31 December 2017:
 – IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
 – IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 – IFRS 16 Leases
 – IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
 – IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and 
Advance Consideration
 – IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
 – Amendments to the following standards:
 – IAS 28 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures
 – IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property
 – IFRS 2 Classiﬁcation and Measurement of Share-based 
Payment Transactions
 – IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 
Insurance Contracts
 – IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation
 – Clariﬁcations to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers
 – Improvements to IFRSs (2014–2016)
 – Improvements to IFRSs (2015–2017).
The Directors have completed the impact assessment of IFRS 9 
and have concluded that under the new standard, which will be 
adopted for the ﬁnancial year ending 31 December 2018, the Group 
will be able to continue to record movements in its PPP ﬁnancial 
assets through other comprehensive income (OCI) using the fair 
value through OCI category. This is because these ﬁnancial assets 
are held within a business model whose objective at Group level 
is achieved by both collecting contractual cash ﬂows and selling 
ﬁnancial assets and the contractual terms of the ﬁnancial asset 
meet the “solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
outstanding” criterion. Therefore, there will be no quantitative 
impact on the Group upon adoption of IFRS 9 at 1 January 2018. 
The Directors have also completed their assessment of the impact 
of IFRS 15 and the Group will adopt the new standard for the 
ﬁnancial year ending 31 December 2018 retrospectively using the 
cumulative effect approach. As a result, the Group will restate its 
opening equity position as at 1 January 2018 by a credit of £3m 
to reﬂect the impact of transitioning to IFRS 15. This adjustment 
primarily reﬂects the impact of unbundling of a handful of contracts 
according to what the Group has assessed to be the performance 
obligation to be delivered to the customer. Using the ﬁve-step 
model required by the new standard, the impact of the £3m credit 
to equity represents the acceleration of revenue on transition to 
IFRS 15 which was not recognised by the Group under the previous 
revenue standards. IFRS 15 would have resulted in an immaterial 
impact on the Group’s income statement for the year ended 
31 December 2017.
In addition to the impact on equity, there will be balance sheet 
reclassiﬁcations as a result of moving away from IAS 11 balance 
sheet captions to those prescribed by IFRS 15. Full IFRS 15 
disclosures will be presented in the Annual Report and Accounts 
2018. As the Group has chosen to adopt the cumulative effect 
approach, the comparative information will not be restated and the 
Group will continue to present its 2017 results under the previous 
revenue standards – IAS 11 and IAS 18. 
As a result of this new standard, the Group has also revised its 
accounting policies around revenue recognition (where applicable) 
as detailed on page 103.  balfourbeatty.com/AR2017
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 103 Strategic Report
2 Principal accounting policies continued
2.1 Accounting standards continued 
The Directors continue to assess the impact of IFRS 16. IFRS 16 
Leases was issued by the IASB in January 2016 and is effective 
for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. 
The new standard will replace IAS 17 Leases and will eliminate 
the classiﬁcation of leases as either operating leases or ﬁnance 
leases and, instead, introduce a single lessee accounting model. 
The adoption of IFRS 16 is not expected to have a signiﬁcant impact 
on the Group’s net results or net assets, although the full impact 
will be subject to further assessment. 
The Directors do not expect the other standards above to have 
a material quantitative effect. The Group has chosen not to adopt 
any of the above standards and interpretations earlier than required.
IFRS 15 revenue recognition policies applied from 1 January 2018
The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control over a 
product or service to its customer. Revenue is measured based 
on the consideration speciﬁed in a contract with a customer 
and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. 
Where consideration is not speciﬁed within the contract and 
therefore subject to variability, the Group estimates the amount of 
consideration to be received from its customer. The consideration 
recognised is the amount which is highly probable not to result in 
a signiﬁcant reversal in future periods. 
Where a modiﬁcation to an existing contract occurs, the Group 
assesses the nature of the modiﬁcation and whether it represents 
a separate performance obligation required to be satisﬁed 
by the Group or whether it is a modiﬁcation to the existing 
performance obligation. 
The Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period 
between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the 
customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a 
consequence, the Group does not adjust its transaction price for 
the time value of money.
The Group’s activities are wide-ranging, and as such, depending 
on the nature of the product or service delivered and the timing of 
when control is passed onto the customer, the Group will account 
for revenue over time and at a point in time. Where revenue is 
measured over time, the Group uses the input method to measure 
progress of delivery. 
Revenue is recognised as follows: 
 – revenue from construction and services activities is recognised 
over time and the Group uses the input method to measure 
progress of delivery 
 – revenue from manufacturing activities is recognised at a point 
in time when title has passed to the customer
 – interest income is accrued on a time basis using the effective 
interest method by reference to the principal outstanding 
and the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected 
life of the ﬁnancial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount
 – dividend income is recognised when the equity holder’s right 
to receive payment is established.
IFRS 15 policies in relation to construction and service contracts 
When the outcome of individual contracts can be estimated reliably, 
contract revenue and contract costs are recognised as revenue and 
expenses respectively by reference to the stage of completion at 
the reporting date. Costs are recognised as incurred and revenue 
is recognised on the basis of the proportion of total costs at 
the reporting date to the estimated total costs of the contract. 
Estimates of the ﬁnal out-turn on each contract may include cost 
contingencies to take account of the speciﬁc risks within each 
contract that have been identiﬁed during the early stages of 
the contract.
The cost contingencies are reviewed on a regular basis throughout 
the contract life and are adjusted where appropriate. However, the 
nature of the risks on contracts are such that they often cannot be 
resolved until the end of the project and therefore may not reverse 
until the end of the project. Management continually review the 
estimated ﬁnal out-turn on contracts, and in certain limited cases, 
assess recoveries from insurers, and make adjustments where 
necessary. No margin is recognised until the outcome of the 
contract can be estimated with reasonable certainty.
Provision is made for all known or expected losses on individual 
contracts once such losses are foreseen. Revenue in respect of 
variations to contracts and incentive payments is recognised when 
it is probable it will be agreed by the customer. Revenue in respect 
of claims is recognised only if it is highly probable not to reverse 
in future periods. Proﬁt for the year includes the beneﬁt of claims 
settled in the year on contracts completed in previous years.
2.2 Basis of consolidation
The Group ﬁnancial statements include the results of the Company 
and its subsidiaries, together with the Group’s share of the results 
of joint ventures and associates, drawn up to 31 December 
each year.
a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group 
controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability 
to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date that 
control commences until the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the 
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. On acquisition, the assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at 
their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the fair 
value of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiﬁable 
net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deﬁciency of 
the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identiﬁable net 
assets acquired (discount on acquisition) is credited to the income 
statement in the period of acquisition.
The interest of non-controlling equity holders is stated at the non-
controlling equity holders’ proportion of the fair value of the assets 
and liabilities recognised.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the proﬁt or loss on 
disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate 
of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value 
of any retained interest less direct costs of the transaction and 
(ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), 
less liabilities of the subsidiary. The fair value of any investment 
retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost 
is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent 
accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition 
of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity. 
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for in the same manner 
as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were 
disposed of (ie reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss or transferred directly 
to retained earnings).
Any acquisition or disposal which does not result in a change in 
control is accounted for as a transaction between equity holders. 
The carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling 
interests are adjusted to reﬂect the changes in their relative 
interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the fair value 
of the consideration paid or received and the amount by which the 
non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity 
and attributed to the owners of the parent. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017
104
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued
2 Principal accounting policies continued
2.2 Basis of consolidation continued 
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are adjusted where necessary 
to ensure consistency with those used by the Group. All intra-
Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated 
on consolidation.
b) Joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group 
has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of 
the entity, rather than rights to its individual assets and obligations 
for its individual liabilities.
Associates are those entities over whose ﬁnancial and operating 
policies the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but not control or 
joint control. 
The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures and associates are 
incorporated in the ﬁnancial statements using the equity method 
of accounting except when classiﬁed as held for sale. The Group 
may elect to measure some of its investments in associates at fair 
value through proﬁt or loss in accordance with IAS 39 where the 
investment is held by a Group entity which meets the classiﬁcation 
of a venture capital organisation, in which case the investment will 
be marked to market with movements being recognised in the 
income statement. The equity return from the military housing 
joint ventures of the Group is contractually limited to a maximum 
level of return, beyond which the Group does not share in any 
further return. Therefore the Group’s investment in these projects is 
recognised at initial equity investment plus the value of the Group’s 
accrued preferred return from the underlying projects.
Any excess of the fair value of the cost of acquisition over the 
Group’s share of the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets of 
the joint venture or associate entity at the date of acquisition is 
recognised as goodwill. Any deﬁciency of the fair value of the cost 
of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair values of the 
identiﬁable net assets of the joint venture or associate at the date 
of acquisition (discount on acquisition) is credited to the income 
statement in the period of acquisition.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially carried in 
the balance sheet at cost (including goodwill arising on acquisition) 
and adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of 
net assets of the joint venture or associate, less any impairment in 
the value of individual investments. Losses of joint ventures and 
associates in excess of the Group’s interest in those joint ventures 
and associates are only recognised to the extent that the Group is 
contractually liable for, or has a constructive obligation to meet, the 
obligations of the joint ventures and associates.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions with joint ventures and 
associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the 
relevant joint venture or associate.
c) Joint operations
The Group’s share of the results, assets and liabilities of contracts 
carried out in conjunction with another party are included under 
each relevant heading in the income statement and balance sheet.
2.3 Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of 
exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at 
the rates of exchange at the reporting date. Signiﬁcant exchange 
rates used in the preparation of these ﬁnancial statements are 
shown in Note 3.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated ﬁnancial statements, 
the results of foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint venture 
entities are translated at average rates of exchange for the year, 
unless the exchange rates ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly during that period, 
in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are 
used. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange 
prevailing at the reporting date. Goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets 
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the rates of 
exchange at the reporting date. Currency translation differences 
arising are transferred to the Group’s foreign currency translation 
reserve and are recognised in the income statement on disposal 
of the underlying investment.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the 
Group may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts. Refer to 
Note 2.26(c) for details of the Group’s accounting policies in respect 
of such derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
2.4 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable for goods and services provided, net of 
trade discounts, value added and similar sales based taxes, after 
eliminating revenue within the Group.
Revenue is recognised as follows:
 – revenue from construction and service activities represents the 
value of work carried out during the year, including amounts 
not invoiced
 – revenue from manufacturing activities is recognised when title 
has passed
 – interest income is accrued on a time basis using the effective 
interest method by reference to the principal outstanding and the 
effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
ﬁnancial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount
 – dividend income is recognised when the equity holder’s right 
to receive payment is established.
2.5 Construction and service contracts 
When the outcome of individual contracts can be estimated reliably, 
contract revenue and contract costs are recognised as revenue and 
expenses respectively by reference to the stage of completion at 
the reporting date.
Costs are recognised as incurred and revenue is recognised on the 
basis of the proportion of total costs at the reporting date to the 
estimated total costs of the contract. Estimates of the ﬁnal out-turn 
on each contract may include cost contingencies to take account 
of the speciﬁc risks within each contract that have been identiﬁed 
during the early stages of the contract. The cost contingencies are 
reviewed on a regular basis throughout the contract life and are 
adjusted where appropriate. However, the nature of the risks on 
contracts are such that they often cannot be resolved until the end 
of the project and therefore may not reverse until the end of the 
project. Management continually review the estimated ﬁnal out-turn 
on contracts, and in certain limited cases, assess recoveries from 
insurers, and make adjustments where necessary. 
No margin is recognised until the outcome of the contract can be 
estimated with reasonable certainty.
Provision is made for all known or expected losses on individual 
contracts once such losses are foreseen. balfourbeatty.com/AR2017
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 105 Strategic Report
2 Principal accounting policies continued
2.5 Construction and service contracts continued 
Revenue in respect of variations to contracts and incentive 
payments is recognised when it is probable it will be agreed by 
the customer. Revenue in respect of claims is recognised when 
negotiations have reached an advanced stage such that it is 
probable that the customer will accept the claim and the probable 
amount can be measured reliably.
Proﬁt for the year includes the beneﬁt of claims settled in the year 
on contracts completed in previous years.
2.6 Segmental reporting
The Group considers its Board of Directors to be the chief operating 
decision maker and therefore the segmental disclosures provided 
in Note 5 are aligned with the monthly reports provided to the 
Board of Directors. The Group’s reporting segments are based 
on the types of services provided. Operating segments with 
similar economic characteristics have been aggregated into three 
reportable segments which reﬂect the nature of the services 
provided by the Group. A description of each reportable segment is 
provided in Note 5. Further information on the business activities of 
each reportable segment is set out on pages 16 to 25.
Working capital is the balance sheet measure reported to the chief 
operating decision maker. The proﬁtability measure used to assess 
the performance of the Group is underlying proﬁt from operations.
Segment results represent the contribution of the different 
segments after the allocation of attributable corporate overheads. 
Transactions between segments are conducted at arm’s-length 
market prices. Segment assets and liabilities comprise those assets 
and liabilities directly attributable to the segments. Corporate assets 
and liabilities include cash balances, bank borrowings, tax balances 
and dividends payable. Non-recourse net borrowings are directly 
attributable to Infrastructure Investments and therefore not included 
within Corporate activities.
Major customers are deﬁned as customers contributing more than 
10% of the Group’s external revenue.
2.7 Pre-contract bid costs and recoveries
Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until it is virtually 
certain that a contract will be awarded, from which time further 
pre-contract costs are recognised as an asset and charged as 
an expense over the period of the contract. Amounts recovered 
in respect of pre-contract costs that have been written off are 
deferred and amortised over the life of the contract.
For construction and services projects, the relevant contract is 
the construction or services contract respectively. With respect 
to PPP projects, an assessment is made as to which contractual 
element the pre-contract costs relate to, in order to determine 
the relevant period for amortisation. The relevant contract is that 
which gives rise to a ﬁnancial or intangible asset, which is either the 
construction contract or the contract which transferred the asset to 
the project.
2.8 Proﬁt from operations
Proﬁt from operations is stated after the Group’s share of the post-
tax results of equity accounted joint venture entities and associates, 
but before investment income and ﬁnance costs.
2.9 Finance costs
Finance costs of debt, including premiums payable on settlement 
and direct issue costs, are charged to the income statement on an 
accruals basis over the term of the instrument, using the effective 
interest method.
2.10 Non-underlying items
Non-underlying items are items of ﬁnancial performance which 
the Group believes should be separately identiﬁed on the face of 
the income statement to assist in understanding the underlying 
ﬁnancial performance achieved by the Group. Such items will 
not affect the absolute amount of the results for the period and 
the trend of results. Underlying items are items before non-
underlying items.
Non-underlying items include:
 – gains and losses on the disposal of businesses and investments, 
unless this is part of a programme of releasing value from 
the disposal of similar businesses or investments such as 
infrastructure concessions
 – costs of major restructuring and reorganisation of 
existing businesses
 – costs of integrating newly acquired businesses
 – acquisition and similar costs related to business combinations 
such as transaction costs
 – impairment and amortisation charges on intangible assets 
arising on business combinations (amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets)
 – impairment of goodwill.
These are examples, however, from time to time it may be 
appropriate to disclose further items as non-underlying items in 
order to highlight the underlying performance of the Group.
The results of Rail Germany and certain legacy ES contracts have 
been included as non-underlying. Refer to Note 5. 
2.11 Taxation
The tax charge comprises current tax and deferred tax, calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the reporting date. Current tax and deferred tax are charged or 
credited to the income statement, except when they relate to items 
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the relevant tax 
is also accounted for within equity. Current tax is based on the proﬁt 
for the year.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the ﬁnancial statements. Deferred tax 
on such assets and liabilities is not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
proﬁt nor the accounting proﬁt.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of 
deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can 
be controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to 
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group 
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2.12 Intangible assets
a) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and other 
businesses, joint ventures and associates and represents the 
excess of the fair value of consideration over the fair value of the 
identiﬁable assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill on acquisitions 
of subsidiaries and other businesses is included in non-current 
assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates 
is included in investments in joint ventures and associates.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and is carried at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is included 
when determining the proﬁt or loss on subsequent disposal of 
the business to which it relates.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to 
IFRS (1 January 2004) has been retained at the previous UK GAAP 
amounts subject to being tested for impairment. Goodwill written 
off or discount arising on acquisition credited to reserves under UK 
GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in 
determining any subsequent proﬁt or loss on disposal.
b) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation charges in 
respect of software and Infrastructure Investments intangibles 
are included in underlying items.
c) Research and development
Internally generated intangible assets developed by the Group are 
recognised only if all the following conditions are met:
 – an asset is created that can be identiﬁed
 – it is probable that the asset created will generate future 
economic beneﬁts
 – the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Other research expenditure is written off in the period in which 
it is incurred.
2.13 Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure 
associated with bringing the asset to its operating location 
and condition.
2.14 Investment properties
The Group classiﬁes land and buildings which it holds to generate 
capital appreciation and/or to earn rental income as investment 
property. The Group has chosen to state its investment properties 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
The Group depreciates its investment properties over 25 years. 
Land is not depreciated. 
2.15 Leasing
Leases which transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases. All other 
leases are classiﬁed as operating leases.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are recognised as assets of the 
Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, determined at the inception of the 
lease, and depreciation is provided accordingly. The liability to the 
lessor is included in the balance sheet as a ﬁnance lease obligation. 
Lease payments are apportioned between ﬁnance charges and 
reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant 
effective rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Beneﬁts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an 
operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
2.16 Impairment of assets
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life (such as goodwill arising 
on acquisitions) are reviewed at least annually for impairment. 
Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed for impairment whenever there is any indication that the 
carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying 
amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. Value in use is assessed by discounting the 
estimated future cash ﬂows that the asset is expected to generate. 
For this purpose assets, including goodwill, are grouped into cash-
generating units representing the level at which they are monitored 
by the Board of Directors for internal management purposes. 
Goodwill impairment losses are not reversed in subsequent 
periods. Reversals of other impairment losses are recognised 
in income when they arise.
2.17 Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on the trade date 
where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the investment within the 
timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially 
measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value. 
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-
for-sale investments are recognised in equity, until the investment 
is disposed or is determined to be impaired, at which time 
the cumulative gain or loss is included in the net proﬁt or loss 
for the period. Held to maturity investments are measured at 
amortised cost.
2.18 Assets held for sale and discontinued operations
Non-current assets and groups of assets to be disposed of are 
classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered 
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. 
Held for sale assets are measured at the lower of their carrying 
amount on classiﬁcation as held for sale or fair value less costs 
to sell.
A component of the Group is presented as a discontinued operation 
if it has either been disposed of or is classiﬁed as held for sale and 
it is a separate major line of business or geographic operation or 
the proposed sale is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of 
a single separate major line of business or geographical operation. 
When classiﬁed as a discontinued operation, income statement 
performance is reported in summary form outside continuing 
operations and comparative ﬁgures are restated.
2.19 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes an appropriate proportion of manufacturing 
overheads incurred in bringing inventories to their present location 
and condition and is determined using the ﬁrst-in ﬁrst-out method. 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less 
all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in 
marketing, selling and distribution. balfourbeatty.com/AR2017
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 107 Strategic Report
2 Principal accounting policies continued
2.20 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recorded at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost as reduced by 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
2.21 Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at cost.
2.22 Provisions
Provisions for insurance liabilities retained in the Group’s captive 
insurance arrangements, legal claims, defects and warranties, 
environmental restoration, onerous leases, and other onerous 
commitments are recognised at the best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the Group’s liability.
Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that 
an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and 
the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
2.23 Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Premiums payable on 
settlement or redemption and direct issue costs are included in the 
carrying amount of the instrument and are charged to the income 
statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method 
together with the interest payable.
2.24 Retirement beneﬁt costs
The Group, through trustees, operates a number of deﬁned beneﬁt 
and deﬁned contribution retirement and other long-term employee 
beneﬁt schemes, the majority of which are of the deﬁned beneﬁt 
type and are funded. Deﬁned beneﬁt contributions are determined 
in consultation with the trustees, after taking actuarial advice.
For deﬁned beneﬁt retirement beneﬁt schemes, the cost of 
providing beneﬁts recognised in the income statement and the 
deﬁned beneﬁt obligations are determined at the reporting date 
by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. 
The liability recognised in the balance sheet comprises the present 
value of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension obligation, determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash ﬂows using the market yield 
on a high-quality corporate bond, less the fair value of the scheme 
assets. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period in 
which they occur in the statement of comprehensive income.
Contributions to deﬁned contribution pension schemes are charged 
to the income statement as they fall due.
Any surplus of deﬁcit contributions to the Balfour Beatty Pension 
Fund (BBPF) and the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS) would be 
recoverable by way of a refund as the Group has the unconditional 
right to the surplus and controls the run-off of the beneﬁt 
obligations once all other obligations of the BBPF and RPS have 
been settled. 
2.25 Share-based payments 
Employee services received in exchange for the grant of equity- 
settled awards are charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the fair values of the 
awards at the date of grant. 
The credits in respect of the amounts charged are included within 
separate reserves in equity until such time as the awards are 
exercised, when the shares are transferred to employees. 
2.26 Financial instruments 
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
a) Classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁed according 
to the substance of the contractual arrangements. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest 
in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
b) Cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares and 
convertible bonds
The Company’s cumulative convertible redeemable preference 
shares and the Group’s convertible bonds are compound 
instruments, comprising a liability component and an equity 
component. The fair value of the liability components was 
estimated using the prevailing market interest rates at the dates 
of issue for similar non-convertible instruments. The difference 
between the proceeds of issue of the preference shares and 
convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the respective 
liability components, representing the embedded option to convert 
the liability components into the Company’s ordinary shares, 
is included in equity.
The interest expense on the liability components is calculated by 
applying applicable market interest rates for similar non-convertible 
debt prevailing at the dates of issue to the liability components 
of the instruments. The difference between this amount and the 
dividend/interest payable is included in the carrying amount of the 
liability component and is charged to the income statement on an 
accrual basis together with the dividend/interest payable.
c) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage 
interest rate risk and to hedge exposures to ﬂuctuations in 
foreign currencies in accordance with its risk management policy. 
The Group does not use derivative ﬁnancial instruments for 
speculative purposes. A description of the Group’s objectives, 
policies and strategies with regard to derivatives and other ﬁnancial 
instruments is set out in Note 38.
Derivatives are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair 
value on the date the derivative transaction is entered into and 
are subsequently re-measured at their fair values.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and 
qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement 
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that 
are attributable to the hedged risk.
Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivatives that 
are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges are recognised 
in other comprehensive income (OCI). Changes in the fair value 
of the ineffective portion of cash ﬂow hedges are recognised 
in the income statement. Amounts originally recognised in OCI 
are transferred to the income statement when the underlying 
transaction occurs or, if the transaction results in a non-ﬁnancial 
asset or liability, are included in the initial cost of that asset 
or liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that 
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income 
statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁes 
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument recognised in OCI is retained in equity until 
the hedged transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in 
OCI is transferred to the income statement for the period.  Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017
108
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued
2 Principal accounting policies continued
2.26 Financial instruments continued
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments or other host 
contracts are treated as separate derivatives and recorded in the 
balance sheet at fair value when their risks and characteristics are 
not closely related to those of the host contract. Changes in the 
fair value of those embedded derivatives recognised in the balance 
sheet are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
d) PPP concession companies
Assets constructed by PPP concession companies are classiﬁed 
principally as available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets.
In the construction phase, income is recognised by applying an 
attributable proﬁt margin to the construction costs representing 
the fair value of construction services performed. In the operational 
phase, income is recognised by allocating a proportion of total cash 
receivable over the life of the project to service costs by means of 
a deemed rate of return on those costs. The residual element of 
projected cash is allocated to the ﬁnancial asset using the effective 
interest rate method, giving rise to interest income.
Due to the nature of the contractual arrangements, the projected 
cash ﬂows can be estimated with a high degree of certainty.
In the construction phase, the fair value of the Group’s PPP 
ﬁnancial assets is determined by applying an attributable proﬁt 
margin to the construction costs representing the fair value of 
construction services performed. In the operational phase, fair 
value is determined by discounting the future cash ﬂows allocated 
to the ﬁnancial asset using discount rates based on long-term 
gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels associated with the assets, 
with market-related movements in fair value recognised in OCI. 
Amounts originally recognised in OCI are transferred to the 
income statement upon disposal of the asset.
2.27 Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements under 
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect amounts recognised for assets and 
liabilities at the reporting date and the amounts of revenue and 
expenses incurred during the reporting period. Actual outcomes 
may differ from these judgements, estimates and assumptions.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have the most 
signiﬁcant effect on the carrying value of assets and liabilities of the 
Group as at 31 December 2017 are discussed below.
All of the below are both judgements and estimates made by the 
Group apart from the classiﬁcation of non-underlying items which 
is an item that requires judgement only.
a) Revenue and margin recognition
The Group’s revenue recognition and margin recognition policies, 
which are set out in Notes 2.4 and 2.5, are central to how the Group 
values the work it has carried out in each ﬁnancial year.
These policies require forecasts to be made of the outcomes of 
long-term construction services and support services contracts, 
which require assessments and judgements to be made on 
recovery of pre-contract costs, changes in the scope of work, 
contract programmes, maintenance and defects liabilities and 
changes in costs.
In the construction portfolio there are a small number of long-
term and complex projects where the Group has incorporated 
judgements over contractual entitlements. The range of potential 
outcomes as a result of uncertain future events could result in 
a materially positive or negative swing to proﬁtability and cash 
ﬂow. These contracts are primarily within the Group’s major 
infrastructure business units in the UK, US and Far East.
b) Taxation
The Group is subject to tax in a number of jurisdictions and 
judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for 
income taxes. The Group provides for future liabilities in respect of 
uncertain tax positions where additional tax may become payable 
in future periods and such provisions are based on management’s 
assessment of exposures. This may involve a signiﬁcant amount of 
judgement as tax legislation can be complex and open to different 
interpretation in particular in relation to the basis of taxation on 
one-off or unusual transactions. Management uses both in-house 
and external tax experts and previous experience when assessing 
tax risks. These judgements are prone to changes in future periods. 
Each potential liability or contingency is revisited annually, and 
where actual expected tax liabilities differ from the provisions, 
adjustments are made which can have a material impact on the 
Group’s proﬁt for the year.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally provided for in full and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable proﬁt will arise against which the temporary differences will 
be utilised. Management judgement is required to determine the 
amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised based on the 
likely timing and level of future taxable proﬁts. Refer to Note 27.
c) Non-underlying items
Non-underlying items are items of ﬁnancial performance which 
the Group believes should be separately identiﬁed on the face of 
the income statement to assist in understanding the underlying 
ﬁnancial performance achieved by the Group. Determining whether 
an item is part of underlying items or non-underlying items requires 
judgement. A total non-underlying loss after tax of £25m was 
credited (2016: £24m charged) to the income statement for the 
year ended 31 December 2017. Refer to Note 10.
d) Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of 
the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill 
has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an 
estimate to be made of the timing and amount of future cash ﬂows 
expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and the application 
of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. 
A nominal growth rate, based on real GDP growth plus CPI inﬂation, 
is used to calculate a terminal growth multiple in accordance with 
the Gordon Growth Model. The discount rates used are based on 
the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reﬂect 
the speciﬁc economic environment of the relevant cash-generating 
unit. The carrying value of goodwill at 31 December 2017 was 
£874m (2016: £937m). Refer to Note 14.
e) Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets
At 31 December 2017, £2,006m (2016: £2,292m) of PPP ﬁnancial 
assets constructed by the Group’s subsidiary, joint venture and 
associate companies were classiﬁed as available-for-sale ﬁnancial 
assets. In the operational phase the fair value of these ﬁnancial 
assets is measured at each reporting date by discounting the future 
value of the cash ﬂows allocated to the ﬁnancial asset. A range of 
discount rates is used from 2.2% to 7.7% (2016: 2.3% to 8.3%), 
which reﬂects the prevailing risk-free interest rates and the different 
risk proﬁles of the various concessions. Refer to Note 38.
A £63m gain was taken to other comprehensive income in 2017 
(2016: £37m gain) and a cumulative fair value gain of £269m 
had arisen on these ﬁnancial assets as a result of market-
related movements in the fair value of these ﬁnancial assets 
at 31 December 2017 (2016: £349m gain). balfourbeatty.com/AR2017

f) Provisions
Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and therefore 
in making a reliable estimate of the quantum and timing of liabilities 
judgement is applied and re-evaluated at each reporting date. 
More speciﬁcally on the Group’s provisions set aside for any 
liabilities arising due to defects, there is a 12-month latent defect 
period for which the provision is held, but where there are known 
identiﬁed issues then the provision may be required to cover 
rectiﬁcation work over a more extended period. 
The Group recognised provisions at 31 December 2017 of £292m 
(2016: £273m). Refer to Note 25.
g) Retirement beneﬁt obligations 
Details of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes are set out 
in Note 28, including tables showing the sensitivity of the pension 
scheme obligations and assets to different actuarial assumptions.
At 31 December 2017, the net retirement beneﬁt assets recognised 
on the Group’s balance sheet were £32m (2016: £231m liabilities). 
The effects of changes in the actuarial assumptions underlying 
the schemes’ obligations and discount rates and the differences 
between expected and actual returns on the schemes’ assets are 
classiﬁed as actuarial gains and losses. During 2017, the Group 
recognised net actuarial gains of £246m in equity (2015: £120m 
losses), including its share of the actuarial gains and losses arising 
in joint ventures and associates.
In 2017, the Group beneﬁted from changes in discount rate 
methodology, which resulted in a £123m gain which was 
recognised as part of the actuarial gains for the year within the 
statement of comprehensive income. The Group accounted for 
the discount rate change prospectively as a change in estimate.

10 Non-underlying items continued
Continuing operations
10.1.1 Rail Germany was reclassiﬁed from discontinued operations in 2014 and has continued to be presented as part of the Group’s 
non-underlying items within continuing operations. In 2017, the remaining parts of Rail Germany generated a £nil proﬁt or loss before tax 
(2016: £1m proﬁt before tax). 
10.1.2 The Group has continued to present the results of certain external legacy Engineering Services (ES) contracts in non-underlying 
items. These contracts were classiﬁed as non-underlying items in 2014 as the performance of these contracts was linked to poor legacy 
management and in regions where ES has withdrawn from tendering for third-party work. Construction on these contracts has now 
completed. These contracts resulted in a £nil proﬁt or loss to the Group in 2017 (2016: £6m loss). 
10.1.3 The amortisation of acquired intangible assets from continuing operations comprises: customer contracts £6m (2016: £6m) and 
customer relationships £3m (2016: £3m). These have been included as non-underlying items as they relate to costs arising on acquisition 
of businesses. 
The charge was recognised in the following segments: Construction Services £4m (2016: £3m) and Infrastructure Investments £5m 
(2016: £6m).
10.1.4.1 The Group launched its Build to Last transformation programme in February 2015. The transformation programme is aimed to drive 
continual improvement across all of the Group’s businesses and realise operational efﬁciencies. As a result of this programme, restructuring 
costs of £12m were incurred in 2017 relating to: Construction Services £6m; Support Services £2m; and Corporate £4m. These restructuring 
costs comprise: redundancy costs £8m; property-related costs £3m; and other restructuring costs £1m.
In 2016, the Group incurred restructuring costs of £14m relating to: Construction Services £12m; Support Services £1m; and Corporate £1m. 
These restructuring costs comprise: redundancy costs £9m; external advisers £2m; property-related costs £1m; and other restructuring 
costs £2m.
10.1.4.2 On 15 January 2018, Carillion plc ﬁled for compulsory liquidation. Carillion was one of the Group’s joint operations partners in the 
Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) project on a joint and several basis. As a result of Carillion’s liquidation, the Group and its 
remaining joint operations partner on the project, Galliford Try plc, are jointly liable to deliver Carillion’s remaining obligations on this contract 
in addition to each partner’s existing 33% share. 
In light of this, the Group has recognised a one-off non-underlying loss provision of £44m which reﬂects the Group’s additional loss on 
the contract as a result of Carillion’s liquidation. The contract is expected to complete in the summer of 2018. This loss has been recognised 
in the Construction Services segment. 
10.1.4.3 On 12 September 2017, the Group disposed of its entire interest in Regional & City Airports (Blackpool) Holdings Ltd for a 
cash consideration of £4m. The disposal resulted in a £1m loss being recognised as a non-underlying item. Refer to Note 32.2.2. 
In 2016, an impairment of £3m was recognised on land held at Blackpool Airport. These losses have been included in the Infrastructure 
Investments segment. 
10.1.4.4 On 27 October 2017, the Group disposed of its 100% interest in Heery International Inc for a cash consideration of £43m. 
The disposal resulted in a net gain of £18m being recognised as a non-underlying item. Refer to Note 32.2.3. This gain on disposal has been 
included in the Construction Services segment.
10.1.4.5 In 2016, £1m was recognised in relation to pension liability settlements by certain members of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund. 
This has been reported within Corporate activities.
10.1.4.6 In 2016, potential liabilities on historical health and safety breaches were reassessed following new sentencing guidelines 
introduced and the settlement of other historical claims previously treated as non-underlying items. As a result of this, the Group revised its 
legal provisioning levels relating to these items, recognising an expense of £25m. This was presented as non-underlying because its size 
would otherwise distort the underlying ﬁnancial performance achieved by the Group and the events giving rise to these expenses occurred 
in prior years. 
The charge was recognised in the following segments: Construction Services £13m and Support Services £12m.
10.1.4.7 In 2016, the Group released all remaining provisions relating to Trans4m Ltd (Trans4m) amounting to £9m, £1m of which was 
recognised at the joint venture level. Trans4m was an equal joint operation between Balfour Beatty and three other partner shareholders 
and was contracted to Metronet as part of the London Underground PPP . The provisions were originally recorded in non-underlying items 
in 2007. Trans4m went into creditors’ voluntary liquidation on 27 June 2016.
The credit was recognised in the following segments: Construction Services £8m and Support Services £1m. 
10.1.4.8 In 2016, the Group commissioned a revised independent actuarial report on its exposure to industrial disease related liabilities. 
These are mostly for asbestos-related claims in relation to events pre-1972 which are not insured by the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme. As a result of the ﬁndings within this report, the Group had increased its provision held with respect to industrial disease related 
liabilities, resulting in a £14m charge to the income statement. This was presented as non-underlying because its size would otherwise 
distort the underlying ﬁnancial performance achieved by the Group and the events giving rise to these liabilities occurred in prior years. 
The entire charge was recognised within Construction Services. 
10.1.4.9 In 2016, the Group disposed of its interest in Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Partners, comprising its 17.8% interest in the 
Infrastructure Fund and 100% interest in the fund’s advisor. Initial consideration of £48m was received, resulting in a gain of £3m 
to the Group. Refer to Notes 32.3.4 and 32.3.5. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Continuing operations continued
10.1.4.10 In 2016, additional consideration relating to the Group’s disposal of its 50% interest in Signalling Solutions Ltd (SSL) in 2015 
resulted in a further gain of £2m being reported. In addition to this, a £1m pension settlement gain arose as a result of transferring pension 
liabilities relating to the employees of SSL to the new employer. This gain was recognised within Construction Services.
10.1.4.1 1 In September 2016, the Group completed the disposal of parts of Rail Germany to Tianjin Keyvia Electric Co Ltd for a cash 
consideration of £15m. This sale resulted in a £2m gain as a result of recycling of foreign currency reserves. Refer to Note 32.3.7. 
10.1.5 Refer to Note 10.1.4.7.
10.1.6.1 The US Government has reduced the Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% with effect from 1 January 2018. 
The net impacts of this change in 2017 were a non-underlying £32m tax credit to the income statement and a £1m credit to equity.
10.1.6.2 During the year signiﬁcant actuarial gains in the Group’s main pension fund, Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (BBPF), led to the 
recognition of a deferred tax liability. Refer to Note 27.1. This in turn lead to the recognition of additional UK deferred tax assets of £34m. 
Given the size and nature of the credit resulting from the increase to actuarial gains in the BBPF, the credit has been included as a 
non-underlying item. 
10.1.6.3 The non-underlying items charged against Group operating proﬁt from continuing operations gave rise to a tax credit of £2m 
comprising: £3m tax credit on amortisation of acquired intangible assets; and £1m charge on the gain on disposal of Heery (2016: £3m 
tax credit on amortisation of acquired intangible assets; £3m charge on the results of Rail Germany; and £4m credit on other 
non-underlying items).
Discontinued operations
10.2.1.1 On 1 March 2017, the Group disposed of its 49% interests in Dutco Balfour Beatty LLC and BK Gulf LLC to its joint venture partner 
for a total cash consideration of £11m, resulting in a gain on disposal of £5m. Refer to Note 32.2.1.
10.2.1.2 Following the Group’s disposal of Parsons Brinckerhoff (PB) in 2015, the Group reached a settlement with the purchaser of PB in 
relation to outstanding tax matters and indemnities in 2016. The Group received an additional £9m as a result of this settlement. At the same 
time, provisions in relation to these matters were released, resulting in an overall gain to the Group of £24m. Refer to Note 32.3.10.

The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value-in-use, a key input of which is forecast cash ﬂows. The Group’s cash ﬂow forecasts 
are based on the expected workload of each cash-generating unit (CGU), giving consideration to the current level of conﬁrmed and 
anticipated orders. Cash ﬂow forecasts for the next three years are based on the Group’s Three Year Plan, which covers the period from 
2018 to 2020 and includes the stabilisation and recovery of the Construction Services UK business to more normal levels of performance. 
The cash ﬂow forecasts for each CGU were compiled from each of its constituent business units as part of the Group’s annual ﬁnancial 
planning process.
Whilst it is anticipated that growth will remain stable in the UK buildings sector, tender margins will improve as there will be an increased 
selectivity to drive a higher quality project portfolio. The Group is well positioned in the UK infrastructure market for major schemes and 
regulatory spending uplift. It is anticipated that the US construction market will continue to improve, as will tender margins which will also 
be driven by increased selectivity of projects. In the Support Services segment, market conditions are anticipated to be stable in the UK. 
The Support Services business has a portfolio of long-term contracts and has secured the majority of its workload for the forecast period.
The other key inputs in assessing each CGU are its long-term growth rate and discount rate. The discount rates have been calculated 
using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) method, which takes account of the Group’s capital structure (ﬁnancial risk) as well 
as the nature of each CGU’s business (operational risk). Long-term growth rates are assumed to be the estimated future GDP growth rates 
based on published independent forecasts for the country or countries in which each CGU operates, less 1.0% to reﬂect current economic 
uncertainties and their consequent estimated effect on public sector spending on infrastructure.
In the derivation of each CGU’s value-in-use, a terminal value is assumed based on a multiple of earnings before interest and tax. 
The multiple is applied to a terminal cash ﬂow, which is the normalised cash ﬂow in the last year of the forecast period. The EBIT multiple 
is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model and is a factor of the discount rate and growth rate for each CGU. The nominal terminal value 
is discounted to present value. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Sensitivities
The Group’s impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used. The major assumptions that result in signiﬁcant 
sensitivities are the discount rate and the long-term growth rate, and for certain CGUs, changes to underlying cash projections. In particular, 
a reduction of 150 basis points in margin within the Gas & Water CGU would reduce its headroom to £nil. 
Except as noted above, a reasonable possible change in key assumptions would not give rise to an impairment in any of the Group’s CGUs. 
The Group continues to consider whether a reasonable possible change in assumptions within the construction business in light of its 
historical losses would lead to an impairment of the goodwill in the related CGUs and concluded that it is not the case. The Group maintains 
that the stabilisation and recovery of the Group’s UK Construction business to more normal levels of performance is still a key assumption 
underpinning the cash ﬂow forecasts used to assess the recoverable amount of the related goodwill.  balfourbeatty.com/AR2017

The Group recognises intangible assets as Infrastructure Investments intangible for assets where the Group bears demand risk under IFRIC 
12 Service Concession Arrangements. At 31 December 2017, there are two student accommodation projects which have been classiﬁed 
as intangible assets. These projects are to design, build and maintain postgraduate accommodation. In 2017, the construction phase at the 
University of Edinburgh was completed with additional spend of £nil (2016: £6m) incurred in the year. In 2017, the Group also commenced 
the construction phase at the University of Sussex, incurring a spend of £82m (2016: £nil) in the year (including interest capitalised of £6m 
(2016: £nil)). Construction on this project is anticipated to complete in 2020. 
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, which are one to four years for customer contracts, 
three to 10 years for customer relationships, three to seven years for software, and up to ﬁve years for brand names, except for customer 
contracts and relationships relating to Balfour Beatty Investments North America which are amortised on a basis matching the returns 
earned over the life of the underlying contracts and relationships. These contracts have a duration of up to 50 years for customer contracts 
relating to Balfour Beatty Investments North America.
The Infrastructure Investments intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the projects, which is 50 years. 
Software assets recognised in the UK are amortised on a basis matching their usage proﬁle over their seven-year life. The Group’s remaining 
knowledge sharing and collaboration software is amortised on a basis matching its usage proﬁle over its ﬁve-year life. Other intangible 
assets are amortised over periods up to 10 years. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Infrastructure leasehold improvements comprise student accommodation projects in Iowa and Reno. All buildings are held under short 
leaseholds and are depreciated over 40 years.
The carrying amount of the Group’s plant and equipment held under ﬁnance leases was £nil (2016: £1m). The Company has no property, 
plant and equipment held under ﬁnance leases.
Except for land and assets in the course of construction, the costs of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over their expected useful lives. Buildings are depreciated at 2.5% per annum or over the term of the lease, and plant and equipment is 
depreciated at 4% to 33% per annum.

Investment properties are held by the Group to generate rental income and capital appreciation. The Group has chosen to account for its 
investment property assets under the cost method. For one of its investment properties, the Group has secured non-recourse project 
speciﬁc ﬁnancing amounting to £26m (2016: £18m), which is secured through a ﬂoating charge over the property. As a result, £1m of 
interest cost was capitalised on the asset in 2017 whilst the property was under construction. 
Construction commenced on one property in 2016 and this was completed in 2017. Once the property was ready for use, the Group ceased 
capitalisation of interest cost and commenced depreciation on the property, on a straight-line basis over 25 years. 
The remaining investment properties within the Group consist of one other fully constructed property and £4m of land. The fair value of 
the Group’s investment properties at 31 December 2017 approximates the carrying value. The Group generated £1m (2016: £nil) of rental 
income from its investment properties.  Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

# Represents the combined results of BK Gulf LLC and Dutco Balfour Beatty LLC as both joint ventures have common ownership and report under the same management structure.
^ Includes £3m of subordinated debt interest expense which has been capitalised into the carrying amount of the loan. 
The principal joint ventures and associates are shown in Note 39. 
The amount of the Group’s share of borrowings of joint ventures and associates which was supported by the Group and the Company was 
£nil (2016: £17m), relating to the Group’s share of guaranteed borrowings. 
The non-recourse borrowings of joint venture and associate entities relating to infrastructure concessions projects are repayable over 
periods extending up to 2044. The non-recourse borrowings arise under facilities taken out by project-speciﬁc joint venture and associate 
concession companies. The borrowings of each concession company are secured by a combination of ﬁxed and ﬂoating charges over that 
concession company’s interests in its project’s assets and revenues and the shares in the concession company held by its immediate parent 
company. A signiﬁcant part of these loans has been swapped into ﬁxed rate debt by the use of interest rate swaps.
As disclosed in Note 39(f), the Group has committed to provide its share of further equity funding of joint ventures and associates in 
Infrastructure Investments’ projects and military housing concessions. Further, in respect of a number of these investments the Group has 
committed not to dispose of its equity interest until construction is complete. As is customary in such projects, banking covenants restrict 
the payment of dividends and other distributions.
In 2016 and up until the Group disposed of its 49% interests in Dutco
#
, the Group recognised losses in relation to Dutco
 
in excess of the 
carrying value of its investment as the Group had constructive obligations to provide further funding to make good these losses. As at the 
date of disposal, these losses amounted to £11m and had been classiﬁed as other provisions (2016: £12m). Refer to Notes 18.4 and 25. 
The Group disposed of its 49% interests in BK Gulf LLC and Dutco Balfour Beatty LLC on 1 March 2017. Refer to Note 32.2.1. balfourbeatty.com/AR2017

The Group’s investment in military housing joint ventures’ and associates’ projects is recognised at its remaining equity investment plus the 
value of the Group’s accrued returns from the underlying projects. The military housing joint ventures and associates have total non-recourse 
net borrowings of £2,340m (2016: £2,710m). Note 39(e) details the Group’s military housing projects.
On certain Infrastructure Investments concessions where net fair value revaluations of PPP ﬁnancial assets and cash ﬂow hedges resulted 
in the Group’s carrying value of these investments being negative, the Group has not recognised losses beyond the carrying value of its 
investments. This is because the Group has not committed to provide any further funding to these investments and the borrowings within 
these concessions are non-recourse to the Group. At 31 December 2017, the unrecognised cumulative net fair value charges to other 
comprehensive income amounted to £9m (2016: £19m).  Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

^ Represents the combined results of BK Gulf LLC and Dutco Balfour Beatty LLC as both joint ventures have common ownership and report under the same management structure. 
The Group disposed of its 49% interests in Dutco on 1 March 2017. Refer to Note 32.2.1.
Contract provisions include construction insurance liabilities, principally in the Group’s captive insurance arrangements, and defect and 
warranty provisions on contracts, primarily construction contracts, that have reached practical completion. There is a 12 month latent defect 
period for which the provision is held, but where there are known identiﬁed issues then the provision may be required to cover rectiﬁcation 
work over a more extended period.
Employee provisions are principally liabilities relating to employers’ liability insurance retained in the Group’s captive insurance arrangements 
and provisions for employee termination liabilities arising from the Group’s restructuring programmes.
Other provisions principally comprise: motor and other insurance liabilities in the Group’s captive insurance arrangements; legal claims 
and costs, where provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of known legal claims, investigations and legal actions in progress; 
property-related provisions, mainly onerous lease commitments, some of which arise from the Group’s restructuring programmes; and 
environmental provisions.
The Group takes actuarial advice when establishing the level of provisions in the Group’s captive insurance arrangements and certain other 
categories of provision.
Insurance-related provisions within these categories were £62m (2016: £82m) as follows: Contract provisions £32m (2016: £42m); 
Employee provisions £26m (2016: £31m); and Other, mainly motor, provisions £4m (2016: £9m).
Restructuring provisions within these categories were £6m (2016: £10m) as follows: Employee provisions £1m (2016: £10m); and Other, 
mainly property-related, provisions £5m (2016: £nil).
In 2016 and up until the Group disposed of its 49% interests in Dutco
^
, the Group recognised losses in relation to Dutco
^ 
in excess 
of its carrying value of its investment as the Group had constructive obligations to provide further funding to make good these losses 
and these were classiﬁed as other provisions. Refer to Note 18. The Group disposed of its 49% interests in Dutco

The loans relating to project ﬁnance arise under non-recourse facilities taken out by project-speciﬁc subsidiary companies. The loans of each 
company are secured by a combination of ﬁxed and ﬂoating charges over that company’s interests in its project’s assets and revenues and 
the shares in the company held by its immediate parent company. A signiﬁcant part of these loans has been swapped into ﬁxed rate debt by 
the use of interest rate swaps. 
Included in cash and cash equivalents is restricted cash of: £25m (2016: £23m) held by the Group’s captive insurance company, Delphian 
Insurance Company Ltd, which is subject to Isle of Man insurance solvency regulations; £12m (2016: £31m) held within construction project 
bank accounts; £nil (2016: £nil) relating to cash collateral held against an issued letter of credit; and £135m (2016: £7m) relating to the 
maintenance and other reserve accounts in the Infrastructure Investments subsidiaries.
Cash, deposits and term deposits include the Group’s share of amounts held by joint operations of £261m (2016: £282m).

26.2 US private placement
In March 2013, the Group raised US$350m (£231m) of borrowings through a US private placement of a series of notes with an average 
coupon of 4.94% per annum and an average maturity of 9.3 years. At 31 December 2017, as a result of movements in exchange rates, 
the balance outstanding was £259m (2016: £285m).
26.3 Convertible bonds
On 3 December 2013, the Group issued convertible bonds of £100,000 each maturing on 3 December 2018 at a total issue price of 
£252.7m and incurred transaction costs of £6.7m resulting in net proceeds of £246m. The bonds have a coupon of 1.875% per annum 
payable semi-annually in arrears and the initial conversion price has been set at £3.6692 per share. On 23 April 2014, the conversion price 
was revised to £3.6212.
From 14 January 2014 until 14 days prior to ﬁnal maturity, one bond is convertible at the option of the holder into one preference share 
in Balfour Beatty Finance No 2 Ltd which is immediately transferred to the Company in exchange for the issue of ordinary shares in 
the Company. 
The bonds are compound instruments, comprising equity and liability components. The fair value of the liability component at the date of 
issue, included under non-current liabilities, was £220m estimated using the prevailing market interest rate of 4.29% per annum for a similar 
non-convertible instrument. The difference between the net proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds after the transaction costs and the 
fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the value of the equity conversion component, was included in equity holders’ 
funds. Refer to Note 29.3.
In December 2017, the Group repurchased £21.3m of the convertible bonds, resulting in a loss on settlement of £0.4m. As a result of this 
settlement, £2m of reserves previously held in other reserves which related to the equity conversion component of the bonds that were 
repurchased was transferred to retained earnings. Refer to Note 30.1.

At the reporting date the Group had unrecognised tax losses from operations (excluding capital losses) that arose over a numbers of years 
of approximately £922m (2016: £1,064m) which are available for offset against future proﬁts. £8m (2016: £6m) will expire between ﬁve and 
20 years after the year in which they arose, using losses incurred in earlier years before those incurred in later years, with the ﬁrst expiry in 
2018. The remaining losses may be carried forward indeﬁnitely. 
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets for UK corporation tax trading losses of £245m (2016: £4m). The Group has UK corporation 
tax trading losses of £612m (2016: £768m) which are not recognised as deferred tax assets. The Group also had temporary differences 
relating to retirement beneﬁts on which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised of £62m (2016: £108m).
At the reporting date the undistributed reserves for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised were £nil (2016: £1m) in respect 
of subsidiaries and £nil (2016: £nil) in respect of joint ventures and associates. No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences 
because either no temporary difference arises or the timing of any distribution is under the Group’s control and no distribution which gives 
rise to taxation is contemplated.

28 Retirement beneﬁt assets and liabilities
28.1 Introduction
The Group, through trustees, operates a number of deﬁned contribution and deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes.
Deﬁned contribution schemes are those where the Group’s obligation is limited to the amount that it contributes to the scheme and the 
scheme members bear the investment and actuarial risks.
Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are schemes other than deﬁned contribution schemes where the Group’s obligation is to provide speciﬁed 
beneﬁts on retirement.
IAS 19 Employee Beneﬁts (IAS 19) prescribes the accounting for deﬁned beneﬁt schemes in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements. 
Obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method and discounted to a net present value using the market yield on high-quality 
corporate bonds. The pension expense relating to current service cost is charged to contracts or overheads based on the function of scheme 
members and is included in cost of sales and net operating expenses. The net ﬁnance cost arising from the expected interest income on 
plan assets and interest cost on scheme obligations is included in ﬁnance costs. Actuarial gains and losses are reported in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income. The IAS 19 accounting valuations are set out in Note 28.2.
A different calculation is used for the formal triennial funding valuations undertaken by the scheme trustees to determine the future company 
contribution level necessary so that over time the scheme assets will meet the scheme obligations. The principal difference between the 
two methods is that under the funding basis the obligations are discounted using a rate of return reﬂecting the composition of the assets in 
the scheme, rather than the rate of return on high-quality corporate bonds as required by IAS 19 for the ﬁnancial statements. Details of the 
latest formal triennial funding valuations are set out in Note 28.3.
The assets of the schemes do not include any direct holdings of the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other 
assets of, the Group.
Principal schemes
The Group’s principal schemes are the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (BBPF), which includes deﬁned contribution and deﬁned beneﬁt 
sections, and the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS). The deﬁned beneﬁt sections of both schemes 
are funded and closed to new members with the exception of employees where employment has transferred to the Group under certain 
agreed arrangements. Pension beneﬁts are based on employees’ pensionable service and their pensionable salary.
The schemes operate under trust law and are managed and administered by trustees on behalf of the members in accordance with the 
terms of the trust deed and rules and relevant legislation. Deﬁned beneﬁt contributions are determined in consultation with the trustees, 
after taking actuarial advice. The trustees are responsible for establishing the investment strategy and ensuring that there are sufﬁcient 
assets to meet the cost of current and future beneﬁts.
These schemes expose the Group to investment and actuarial risks where additional contributions may be required if assets are not 
sufﬁcient to pay future pension beneﬁts:
 – investment risk: equity returns are a key determinant of investment return but the investment portfolio is also subject to a range of other 
risks typical of the investments held, for example, credit risk on corporate bond holdings.
 – actuarial risk: the ultimate cost of providing pension beneﬁts is affected by inﬂation rates and members’ life expectancy. The net present 
value of the obligations is affected by the market yield on high-quality corporate bonds used to discount the obligations.
Changes in the principal actuarial assumptions based on market data, such as inﬂation and the discount rate, and experience, such as life 
expectancy, expose the Group to ﬂuctuations in the net IAS 19 liability and the net ﬁnance cost. balfourbeatty.com/AR2017

28.1 Introduction continued
Balfour Beatty Pension Fund
The investment strategy of the BBPF is to hold assets of appropriate liquidity and marketability to generate income and capital growth. 
The BBPF invests partly in a diversiﬁed range of assets including equities and hedge funds in anticipation that, over the longer term, they will 
grow in value faster than the obligations. The equities are in the form of pooled funds and are a combination of UK, other developed market 
and emerging market equities. The remaining BBPF assets are principally ﬁxed and index-linked bonds and derivatives, providing protection 
against movements in inﬂation and interest rates and hence enhancing the resilience of the funding level of the scheme. The performance 
of the assets is measured against market indices.
On 1 July 2015, the Group established a Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP) structure into which its investment in Consort Healthcare 
(Birmingham) Holdings Ltd (Consort Birmingham), which owns the Group’s 40% interest in the Birmingham Hospital PFI investment, was 
transferred. The BBPF is a partner in the SLP and is entitled to a share of the income of the SLP . In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated 
Financial Statements, the SLP is deemed to be controlled by the Group, which retains the ability to substitute the investment in Consort 
Birmingham for other investments from time to time. On 29 December 2016 the Group transferred into the SLP its investment in Holyrood 
Student Accommodation Holdings Ltd, which owns the Group’s 100% interest in the Edinburgh student accommodation project.
Under IAS 19, the investment held by the BBPF in the SLP does not constitute a plan asset and therefore the pension surplus presented 
in these ﬁnancial statements does not reﬂect the BBPF’s interest in the SLP . Distributions from the SLP to the BBPF will be reﬂected in 
the Group’s ﬁnancial statements as pension contributions on a cash basis. In 2017, the BBPF received distributions of £1m from the SLP 
(2016: £1m). 
Alongside the establishment of the SLP , agreement was reached to make a series of deﬁcit payments to the BBPF with the ﬁrst payment 
of £4m paid in 2016 and a further £5m in 2017. Following this, £7m will be due in 2018; £9m due in 2019; £13m due in 2020; £17m due in 
2021; £22m due in 2022; and £25m due in 2023.
A formal triennial funding valuation of the BBPF was carried out as at 31 March 2016. As a result, the Group made ongoing deﬁcit payments 
in addition to those set out above of £22m in 2017. The Group will make further contributions of £18m per annum from January 2018, 
£19m per annum from January 2019 and £11m in 2020.
If the dividend cover ratio is below an agreed trigger level then the contributions set out above may need to be accelerated.
This agreement constitutes a minimum funding requirement (MFR) under IFRIC 14 IAS 19: The Limit on a Deﬁned Beneﬁt Asset, Minimum 
Funding Requirements and their Interaction. The Group has not recognised any liabilities in relation to this MFR as any surplus of deﬁcit 
contributions to the BBPF would be recoverable by way of a refund and the Group has the unconditional right to the surplus and controls 
the run-off of the beneﬁt obligations once all other obligations of the BBPF have been settled.  Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Railways Pension Scheme
The RPS is a shared cost scheme. The legal responsibility of the Group in the RPS is approximately 60% of the scheme’s assets and 
liabilities based on the relevant provisions of the trust deed and rules and trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and 
deﬁcit ﬁnancing.
In 2013 and previous years, the assumed cost of providing beneﬁts was split between the Group and the members in the ratio 60:40. 
This had been a reasonable assumption to make of how costs might have been shared over the long term. This assumption has been 
retained in relation to the cost of providing future service beneﬁts.
Since 2014, because of a declining population of active members, it became less likely that the Group’s costs of meeting any deﬁcits 
would be capped in line with its strict legal obligation of 60%. It was anticipated that members might only be able to afford to fund a small 
proportion of the scheme deﬁcit. In the accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, the long-term cost of 
providing past service beneﬁts was assumed to be split between the Group and the members in the ratio 95:5. From 1 January 2016 it has 
been assumed that the Group will be responsible for 100% of any deﬁcit and the balance sheet assets and obligations disclosed, therefore, 
are equal to 100% of the total scheme assets and obligations. 
The RPS invests in a range of pooled investment funds intended to generate a combination of capital growth and income and, as determined 
by the trustee, taking account of the characteristics of the obligations and the trustee’s attitude to risk. The majority of the RPS’ assets 
that are intended to generate additional returns, over the rate at which the obligations are expected to grow, are invested in a single pooled 
growth fund. This fund is invested in a wide range of asset classes and the fund manager RPMI has the discretion to vary the asset 
allocation to reﬂect its views on the relative attractiveness of different asset classes at any time. The remaining assets in the RPS are 
principally ﬁxed and index-linked bonds.
Following the formal triennial funding valuation carried out as at 31 December 2016, the Group agreed to make ongoing ﬁxed deﬁcit 
contributions of £6m per annum which should reduce the deﬁcit to zero by 2027. This agreement constitutes a MFR under IFRIC 14 IAS 19: 
The Limit on a Deﬁned Beneﬁt Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction. The Group has not recognised any liabilities 
in relation to this MFR as any surplus of deﬁcit contributions to the RPS would be recoverable by way of a refund and the Group has the 
unconditional right to the surplus and controls the run-off of the beneﬁt obligations once all other obligations of the RPS have been settled. 
Other schemes
Other schemes comprise unfunded post-retirement beneﬁt obligations in Europe, the majority of which are closed to new entrants,  
and deferred compensation schemes in North America, where an element of employees’ compensation is deferred and invested in  
available-for-sale assets (as disclosed in Note 19.1) in a trust, the assets of which are for the ultimate beneﬁt of the employees but are  
available to the Group’s creditors in the event of insolvency.

28.2 IAS 19 accounting valuations continued
In December 2017, the Group changed two elements of the discount rate methodology which resulted in a discount rate of 2.55% in the 
current year compared to 2.35% under the previous methodology. The ﬁrst change was to exclude certain bonds issued by Universities 
and entities with a UK Government guarantee, which the Group did not consider to meet the high-quality corporate bond requirement of 
IAS 19. The second change, and noting IAS 19 does not specify the approach that should be adopted where there are no corporate bonds 
of a suitable duration, was to change from extrapolating the discount rate yield curve with reference to UK Government gilts to using the 
forward rates observable from relevant corporate bonds. In the Group’s view, these changes resulted in a high-quality corporate bond based 
discount rate yield curve which is more appropriate for the proﬁle of the Group’s UK pension obligations. The impact of these changes in 
discount rate methodology is a £123m gain which was recognised as part of the actuarial gains/(losses) for the year within the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. The Group accounted for the discount rate change prospectively as a change in estimate. 
At the same time, following independent advice from the Group’s actuaries, the Group reassessed the difference between RPI and CPI 
measures of price inﬂation from 1.2% at December 2016 to 1.1% at December 2017. This resulted in an actuarial loss of £25m, which was 
recognised as part of the actuarial gains/(losses) for the year within the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The BBPF actuary undertakes regular mortality investigations based on the experience exhibited by pensioners of the BBPF and due to 
the size of the membership of the BBPF (43,483 members at 31 December 2017) is able to make comparisons of this experience with the 
mortality rates set out in the various published mortality tables. The actuary is also able to monitor changes in the exhibited mortality over 
time. This research is taken into account in the Group’s mortality assumptions across its various deﬁned beneﬁt schemes. The mortality 
assumptions as at 31 December 2017 have been updated to reﬂect the experience of Balfour Beatty pensioners for the period 1 April 
2016 to 31 March 2017. The mortality tables adopted for the 2017 IAS 19 valuations are the Self-Administered Pension Scheme (SAPS) 
S2 tables (2016: SAPS S2 tables) with a multiplier of 102% for all male and female members (2016: 102%) and 106% for female widows 
and dependants (2016: 106%); all with future improvements in line with the CMI 2016 core projection model (2016: CMI 2015 core 
projection model), with long-term improvement rates of 1.25% per annum and 1.00% per annum for males and females respectively 
(2016: 1.25% per annum and 1.00% per annum).

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes in assumptions occurring at the end of the 
reporting period. In each case the relevant change in assumption occurs in isolation from potential changes in other assumptions. In practice 
more than one variable is likely to change at the same time. The sensitivities have been calculated using the projected unit credit method.

29.1 Ordinary shares of 50p each
Issued
Million £m
At 31 December 2016 and 2017 690 345
All issued ordinary shares are fully paid. Ordinary shares carry no right to ﬁxed income but each share carries the right to one vote at general 
meetings of the Company. No ordinary shares were issued during the current year. 
29.2 Cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares of 1p each
Issued
Million £m
At 31 December 2016 and 2017 112 1
All issued preference shares are fully paid. During the current and prior year, no preference shares were repurchased for cancellation by 
the Company.
Holders of preference shares are entitled to a preferential dividend equivalent to a gross payment of 10.75p per preference share per annum, 
payable half-yearly. A preference dividend of 5.375p per cumulative convertible redeemable preference share of 1p was paid on 1 July 2017 
in respect of the six months ended 30 June 2017. A preference dividend of 5.375p per cumulative convertible redeemable preference share 
of 1p was paid on 1 January 2018 in respect of the six months ended 31 December 2017. 
On 1 July 2020, any preference shares still outstanding are redeemable at £1 each, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, unless 
the holder exercises any option granted by the Company to extend the redemption date. The maximum redemption value of all of the issued 
and outstanding preference shares, excluding any arrears or accruals of dividend, was £112m at 31 December 2017 (2016: £112m).
At the option of the holder, preference shares are convertible on the ﬁrst day of the next calendar month following receipt of the conversion 
notice into new Balfour Beatty plc ordinary shares effectively on the basis of 24.69136 ordinary shares for every 100 preference shares, 
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The Company is entitled to convert all outstanding preference shares into ordinary shares 
if there are fewer than 44,281,239 preference shares in issue or if the average of the closing mid-market price for a Balfour Beatty plc 
ordinary share during a 30-day period exceeds 810p, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The preference shares carry no voting rights at a general meeting of the Company, except where the dividend is six months or more in 
arrears, or where the business of the meeting includes a resolution which directly affects the rights and privileges attached to the preference 
shares or a resolution for the winding up of the Company. On winding up the Company, holders are entitled to receive the sum of £1 per 
preference share, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, in priority to any payment on any other class of shares.
The preference shares are a compound instrument, comprising equity and liability components. The fair value of the liability component at 
the date of issue, included under non-current liabilities, was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate of 13.5% per annum for a 
similar non-convertible instrument. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the preference shares and the fair value assigned to 
the liability component, at the date of issue, representing the equity conversion component at £18m, was included in equity holders’ equity, 
net of deferred tax.

The fair value of the liability component of the preference shares at 31 December 2017 amounted to £126m (2016: £135m). The fair value is 
determined by using the market price of the preference shares at the reporting date and attributing a fair value to the equity component.
Interest expense on the preference shares is calculated using the effective interest method.
29.3 Convertible bonds
On 3 December 2013, the Group issued convertible bonds for net proceeds of £246m. The convertible bonds are compound instruments 
comprising equity and liability components. The fair value of the liability component was estimated as £220m using the prevailing market 
rate at the date of issue for a similar non-convertible instrument. The difference between the net proceeds and the fair value of the liability 
represented the embedded option to convert the liability into the Company’s ordinary shares being the equity component of £26m. 
At 31 December 2017, £2m of this equity component was transferred to retained earnings on the repurchase of £21m worth of convertible 
bonds. Refer to Note 26.3. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

As permitted under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its Statement of Comprehensive 
Income (including the proﬁt and loss account) for the year. Balfour Beatty plc reported a loss for the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2017 
of £54m (2016: £10m loss).
The retained proﬁts of Balfour Beatty plc are wholly distributable. By special resolution on 13 May 2004, conﬁrmed by the court on 
16 June 2004, the share premium account was reduced by £181m and the £4m capital redemption reserve was cancelled, effective on 
25 June 2004, and a special reserve of £185m was created. This reserve becomes distributable to the extent of future increases in share 
capital and share premium account, of which £nil occurred in 2017 (2016: £nil).
30.3 Balfour Beatty Employee Share Ownership Trust 
The retained proﬁts in the Group and the retained proﬁts of the Company are stated net of investments in Balfour Beatty plc ordinary 
shares acquired by the Group’s employee discretionary trust, the Balfour Beatty Employee Share Ownership Trust, to satisfy awards 
under the Performance Share Plan, the Executive Buyout Scheme, the Deferred Bonus Plan and the Restricted Share Plan. In 2017, 0.6m 
(2016: 1.6m) shares were purchased at a cost of £1.7m (2016: £3.9m). The market value of the 9.7m (2016: 10.3m) shares held by the Trust 
at 31 December 2017 was £26.2m (2016: £27.8m). The carrying value of these shares is £24.1m (2016: £25.6m). 
Following conﬁrmation of the performance criteria at the end of the performance period in the case of the Performance Share Plan and 
the Executive Buyout Scheme, and at the end of the vesting period in the case of the Deferred Bonus Plan and the Restricted Share Plan, 
the appropriate number of shares will be unconditionally transferred to participants. In 2017, 0.5m shares were transferred to participants 
in relation to the March 2014 awards under the Performance Share Plan (2016: nil shares were transferred to participants in relation to the 
April 2013 awards under the Performance Share Plan), 0.4m shares were transferred to participants in relation to the January 2015 awards 
under the Executive Buyout Scheme (2016: nil), and 0.3m shares were transferred to participants in relation to awards under the Deferred 
Bonus Plan (2016: 0.3m shares).
The Trustees have waived the rights to dividends on shares held by the trust. Participants in the schemes receive an award of shares 
to represent the dividends which would have been payable on the shares since the date of grant. 
Other reserves in the Group and Company include £10.1m (2016: £5.8m) relating to unvested Performance Share Plan awards, £3.1m 
(2016: £1.5m) relating to unvested Restricted Share Plan awards, £1.2m (2016: £1.5m) relating to unvested Executive Buyout Scheme 
awards and £2.4m (2016: £1.9m) relating to unvested Deferred Bonus Plan awards.  balfourbeatty.com/AR2017

32.2.3 On 27 October 2017, the Group disposed of its 100% interest in Heery International Inc for a cash consideration of £43m.

consideration of £62m. On this date, the Group ceased to jointly control this 7.5% interest as Equitix had the right to acquire this stake for a 
cash consideration of £62m which was exercisable up until 13 March 2018. At the same time, the Group had an unconditional right to sell 
the stake to Dalmore for an identical price if Equitix failed to exercise its right to acquire. The completion of this portion of the disposal was 
ongoing at the balance sheet date and therefore the consideration of £62m has been included in trade and other receivables as amounts due 
on disposals. Refer to Note 23. This consideration was subsequently received on 23 February 2018 following completion of the disposal to 
Equitix. Refer to Note 37.

of £85m in respect of revaluation reserves recycled to the income statement on disposal.

joint venture partner for a payment by the Group of £3m reﬂecting the Group’s share of the net liabilities of the joint venture. This was 
recognised as a disposal in 2016 as completion of the sale was not subject to any substantive terms at 31 December 2016. The Group 
subsequently completed the disposal in March 2017. A payment of £3m was made by the Group to the purchaser following the completion 
of this disposal.

35 Contingent liabilities
The Company and certain subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and entered into counter-
indemnities in respect of bonds relating to the Group’s own contracts and given guarantees in respect of their share of certain contractual 
obligations of joint ventures and associates and certain retirement beneﬁt liabilities of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund and the Railways 
Pension Scheme. Guarantees are treated as contingent liabilities until such time as it becomes probable payment will be required under 
the terms of the guarantee.
Provision has been made for the Directors’ best estimate of known legal claims, investigations and legal actions in progress. The Group 
takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on 
that advice, that the action is unlikely to succeed, or that the Group cannot make a sufﬁciently reliable estimate of the potential obligation.
36 Related party transactions
Joint ventures and associates
The Group has contracted with, provided services to, and received management fees from, certain joint ventures and associates amounting

37 Events after the reporting date
On 15 January 2018, Carillion plc ﬁled for compulsory liquidation. Carillion was one of the Group’s joint operations partners in the Aberdeen 
Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) project on a joint and several basis. As a result of Carillion’s liquidation, the Group and its remaining joint 
operations partner on the project, Galliford Try plc, are jointly liable to deliver Carillion’s remaining obligations on this contract in addition to 
each partner’s existing 33% share. The Group has assessed the liquidation of Carillion plc as an adjusting post balance sheet event and in 
light of this, the Group has recognised a one-off non-underlying loss provision of £44m in 2017, which reﬂects the Group’s additional loss 
on the contract as a result of Carillion’s liquidation. The contract is expected to complete in the summer of 2018. Refer to Note 10.
On 14 February 2018, the Group repurchased a further £17.7m of its convertible bonds, which will result in a loss on settlement of £0.3m. 
This settlement will also trigger a further £2m of reserves relating to the equity component of the repurchased bonds being transferred 
from other reserves into retained earnings. Following this settlement, the Group’s outstanding bonds on maturity in December 2018 amount 
to £213.7m. 
On 19 February 2018, the Group agreed the disposal of a further 5% interest in Connect Plus (M25) Holdings Ltd to Equitix for a cash 
consideration of £42m, equivalent to the price of the 20% disposal in 2017. The expected proﬁt on disposal for this transaction is £21m. 
On 23 February 2018, the Group completed this transaction and received from Equitix the full cash consideration of £104m, inclusive of 
the £62m outstanding at the reporting date as detailed in Note 32.2.4. The Group continues to own a 15% interest in Connect Plus (M25) 
Holdings Ltd.
On 7 March 2018, the Group repaid the ﬁrst tranche of its US private placement notes amounting to US$45m (£32.5m). US$305m remain 
outstanding, with the next tranche of US$46m being due in March 2020 and the remaining loan notes falling due in March 2023 and 
March 2025.

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure its ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 
cost of capital. The components of capital are as follows: equity attributable to equity holders of the Company comprising issued ordinary 
share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 29.1 and 30; preference shares as disclosed in Note 29.2; US private 
placement as disclosed in Note 26; convertible bonds as disclosed in Note 26; and cash and cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed 
in Note 26.
The Group maintains or adjusts its capital structure through the payment of dividends to equity holders, issue of new shares and buyback of 
existing shares, and drawdown of new borrowings and repayment of existing borrowings. The policy of the Group is to ensure an appropriate 
balance between cash, borrowings (other than the non-recourse borrowings of companies engaged in Infrastructure Investments projects), 
working capital and the value in the Infrastructure Investments investment portfolio.
The overall capital risk management strategy of the Group remains unchanged from 2016.

Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks: market risk; credit risk; and liquidity risk. The Group’s ﬁnancial risk management 
strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effect of these risks on the Group’s ﬁnancial performance.
Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board. Group Treasury liaises with 
the Group’s operating companies to identify, evaluate and hedge ﬁnancial risks. The Board provides written principles for overall ﬁnancial 
risk management, as well as written policies covering speciﬁc areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of 
derivative ﬁnancial instruments and non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. Compliance with policies 
and exposure limits is monitored through the Group’s internal audit and risk management procedures. The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The Group does not trade in ﬁnancial instruments, including derivative ﬁnancial instruments, 
for speculative purposes.
(a) Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the ﬁnancial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group 
enters into a variety of derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including:
 – forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities transacted in a currency that is not 
the functional currency of the operating company
 – interest rate swaps to mitigate the cash ﬂow variability in non-recourse project ﬁnance loans arising from variable interest rates 
on borrowings.
There has been no material change to the Group’s exposure to market risks and there has been no change in how the Group manages 
those risks since 2016.
(i) Foreign currency risk management
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from exposure to various currencies, primarily to 
US dollars, euros and Hong Kong dollars. Foreign exchange risk arises from future trading transactions, assets and liabilities and net 
investments in foreign operations.
Group policy requires operating companies to manage their transactional foreign exchange risk against their functional currency. 
Whenever a current or future foreign currency exposure is identiﬁed with sufﬁcient reliability Group Treasury enters into forward contracts 
on behalf of operating companies to cover 100% of foreign exchange risk above materiality levels determined by the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer.
Refer to page 157 for details of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the reporting date in respect of foreign currency 
transactional exposures.
As at 31 December 2017, the notional principal amounts of foreign exchange contracts in respect of foreign currency transactions where 
hedge accounting is not applied was £13m (2016: £70m) receivable and £12m (2016: £71m) payable with related cash ﬂows expected to 
occur within one year (2016: two years). The foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from fair valuing these unhedged foreign exchange 
contracts will affect the income statement throughout the same periods.
The Group has designated forward exchange contracts with a notional principal amount of £8m (2016: £10m) receivable and £9m 
(2016: £11m) payable as cash ﬂow hedges against highly probable cash ﬂows which are expected to occur in up to four (2016: ﬁve) years. 
Fair value gains on these contracts of £1m (2016: £2m) have been taken to hedging reserves through other comprehensive income. 
No signiﬁcant amounts in relation to hedge ineffectiveness have been charged or credited to the Income Statement in relation to any foreign 
exchange cash ﬂow hedges.
The Group’s investments in foreign operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risks. The Group does not enter into forward 
foreign exchange or other derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated net assets.
In March 2013, the Group raised US$350m through a US private placement which has been designated as a net investment hedge against 
changes in the value of the Group’s US net assets due to exchange movements. The Group has reassessed this hedge and has concluded 
that the hedge continues to be effective. Exchange movements in the year totalled £26m (2016: £49m). A 5% increase/decrease in the 
US dollar to sterling exchange rate would lead to a £12m decrease (2016: £14m)/£14m increase (2016: £15m) in the carrying amount of the 
liability on the Group’s balance sheet, with the movement recognised in other comprehensive income. 
The hedging policy is reviewed periodically. At the reporting date there had been no change to the hedging policies since 2016. balfourbeatty.com/AR2017
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 159 Strategic Report
38 Financial instruments continued
(ii) Interest rate risk management
Interest rate risk arises in the Group’s non-recourse project companies which borrow funds at both ﬂoating and ﬁxed interest rates and hold 
available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets. Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash ﬂow interest rate risk. The Group’s policy to manage 
this risk is to swap ﬂoating rate interest to ﬁxed rate, using interest rate swap contracts.
In an interest rate swap, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed 
notional principal amounts. The net effect of a movement in interest rates on income would be immaterial. The fair value of interest rate 
swaps is determined by discounting the future cash ﬂows using the yield curve at the reporting date.
During 2017 and 2016, the Group’s non-recourse project subsidiaries’ borrowings at variable rates of interest were denominated in sterling 
and US dollars.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding subsidiaries’ interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2017 totalled £113m 
(2016: £117m) with maturities that match the maturity of the underlying borrowings ranging from one year to 22 years.
At 31 December 2017, the ﬁxed interest rates range from 3.5% to 5.1% (2016: 3.5% to 5.1%) and the principal ﬂoating rates are LIBOR plus 
a ﬁxed margin.
A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the interest rate in which ﬁnancial instruments are held would lead to a £6m increase (2016: £7m)/£8m 
decrease (2016: £9m) in amounts taken directly to other comprehensive income by the Group in relation to the Group’s exposure to interest 
rates on the available-for-sale PPP ﬁnancial assets and cash ﬂow hedges of its Infrastructure Investments subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk also arises on the Group’s cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and other borrowings. The majority of the debt of 
the Group is held at ﬁxed interest rates. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which these ﬁnancial 
instruments are held would lead to a £2.8m decrease (2016: £nil)/£1.4m increase (2016: £nil) in the Group’s net ﬁnance cost.
(iii) Price risk management
The Group’s principal price risk exposure arises in its Infrastructure Investments concessions. At the commencement of the concession, an 
element of the unitary payment by the customer is indexed to offset the effect of inﬂation on the concession’s costs. The Group is exposed 
to price risk to the extent that inﬂation differs from the index used.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in ﬁnancial loss. Credit risk arises from cash and 
deposits, derivative ﬁnancial instruments and credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. 
The Group has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of potential customers before entering into transactions.
For cash and deposits and derivative ﬁnancial instruments, the Group has a policy of only using counterparties that are independently rated 
with a minimum long-term credit rating of BBB+. At 31 December 2017, £1m (2016: £1m) did not meet this criterion due to the operational 
and relationship difﬁculties in transferring certain balances, however no losses are anticipated from these counterparties. The credit rating of 
a ﬁnancial institution will determine the amount and duration for which funds may be deposited under individual risk limits set by the Board 
of Directors for the Group and subsidiary companies. Management monitors the utilisation of these credit limits regularly.
For trade and other receivables, credit evaluation is performed on the ﬁnancial condition of accounts receivable using independent ratings 
where available or by assessment of the customer’s credit quality based on its ﬁnancial position, past experience and other factors. 
The Group’s most signiﬁcant customers are public or regulated industry entities which generally have high credit ratings or are of a high 
credit quality due to the nature of the customer.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of the above at the reporting date is the carrying value of ﬁnancial assets recorded in the 
ﬁnancial statements, net of any allowance for losses.
(c) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual 
cash ﬂows and matching the maturity proﬁles of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities. Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities are set out 
in Note 26.1. The maturity proﬁle of the Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities is set out on page 134. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Fair value estimation
The Group holds certain ﬁnancial instruments on the balance sheet at their fair values. The following hierarchy classiﬁes each class 
of ﬁnancial asset or liability in accordance with the valuation technique applied in determining its fair value.
There have been no transfers between these categories in the current or preceding year.
Level 1 – The fair value is calculated based on quoted prices traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
The Group holds available-for-sale investments in mutual funds which are traded in active markets and valued at the closing market price 
at the reporting date.
Level 2 – The fair value is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly or indirectly.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ﬂows utilising yield curves at the reporting 
date and taking into account own credit risk. Own credit risk for Infrastructure Investments’ swaps is not material and is calculated using the 
following credit valuation adjustment (CVA) calculation: loss given default multiplied by exposure multiplied by probability of default.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and yield 
curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts. Own credit risk for the other derivative 
liabilities is not material and is calculated by applying a relevant credit default swap (CDS) rate obtained from a third party.
Level 3 – The fair value is based on unobservable inputs.
The fair value of the Group’s PPP ﬁnancial assets is determined in the construction phase by applying an attributable proﬁt margin by 
reference to the construction margin on non-PPP projects reﬂecting the construction risks retained by the construction contractor, and fair 
value of construction services performed. In the operational phase it is determined by discounting the future cash ﬂows allocated to the 
ﬁnancial asset at a discount rate which is based on long-term gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels associated with the assets, with market-
related movements in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and other movements recognised in the Income Statement.

Military housing
Summary Balfour Beatty through its subsidiary Balfour Beatty Communities LLC is a manager, developer, and investor in a number of 
US military privatisation projects associated with a total of 55 US government military bases which includes 55 military family housing 
communities and one unaccompanied personnel housing community that are expected to contain approximately 42,800 housing units once 
development, construction and renovation are complete.
The projects comprise 11 military family housing privatisation projects with the United States Department of the Army (Army), seven 
projects with the United States Department of the Air Force (Air Force) and two projects with the United States Department of the Navy 
(Navy). In addition, there is one unaccompanied personnel housing (UPH) project with the Army at Fort Stewart.
Contractual arrangements The ﬁrst phase of the project, known as the initial development period, covers the period of initial construction 
or renovation of military housing on a base, typically lasting three to eight years. With respect to Army and Navy projects, the government 
becomes a member or partner of the project entity (Project LLC); the Air Force is not a named partner or member in Balfour Beatty 
Communities’ Project LLCs, however it contributes a commitment to provide a government direct loan to the Project LLC and has similar 
rights to share in distributions and cash ﬂows of the Project LLC. On each project, the Project LLC enters into a ground lease with the 
government, which provides the Project LLC with a leasehold interest in the land and title to the improvements on the land for a period of 
50 years. Each of these military housing privatisation projects includes agreements covering the management, renovation, and development 
of existing housing units, as well as the development, construction, renovation and management of new units during the term of the 
project, which, in the case of the Army, could potentially extend for up to an additional 25 years. The 50-year duration of each project 
calls for continuous renovation, rehabilitation, demolition and reconstruction of housing units. At the end of the ground lease term the 
Project LLC’s leasehold interest terminates and all project improvements on the land generally transfer to the government.
Preferred returns The projects will typically receive, to the extent that adequate funds are available, an annual minimum preferred rate of 
return. On most existing projects, this annual minimum preferred rate of return ranges from 9% to 12% of Balfour Beatty Communities’ 
initial equity contribution to the project. During the initial development period, the project is precluded from distributing funds to pay the 
minimum preferred rate of return. The unpaid amounts will generally accrue and accumulate, and can be used to fund renovation and 
construction costs, if necessary. If the accumulated funds are not needed to fund renovation and construction costs, at the end of the initial 
development period they are distributed to pay accrued preferred returns to Balfour Beatty Communities and the government in accordance 
with the terms of the project agreements. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Allocation of remaining operating cash ﬂows Subsequent to the initial development period, any operating cash ﬂow remaining after the 
annual minimum preferred rate of return is paid is shared between Balfour Beatty Communities and the reinvestment account held by the 
project for the beneﬁt of the government. On most of the existing projects, the total amount that Balfour Beatty Communities is entitled to 
receive (inclusive of the preferred return) is generally capped at an annual modiﬁed rate of return, or cash-on-cash return, on its initial equity 
contribution to the project. Historically, these caps have ranged between approximately 9% to 18% depending on the particular project and 
the type of return (annual modiﬁed rates of return or cash-on-cash). However, in some of the more recent projects, there are either no annual 
caps or lower projected annual rates of return. The total capped return generally will include the annual minimum preferred return discussed 
above. The reinvestment account is an account established for the beneﬁt of the military, but funds may be withdrawn for construction, 
development and renovation costs during the remaining life of a privatisation project upon approval by the applicable military service.
Return of equity Generally, at the end of a project term, any monies remaining in the reinvestment account are distributed to Balfour 
Beatty Communities and the Army, Navy or Air Force, in a predetermined order of priority. Typically these distributions will have the effect 
of providing the parties with sufﬁcient funds to provide a minimum annual return over the life of the project and a complete return of the 
initial capital contribution. After payment of the minimum annual return and the return of a party’s initial contribution, all remaining funds 
will typically be distributed to the applicable military service.

Notes
(i) Registered in the US and the principal operations of each project are conducted in the US.
(ii) The share of results of the military housing joint ventures of Balfour Beatty Communities is limited to a pre-agreed preferred return on funds invested.
The Group evaluated each of its interests in the military housing projects to determine if the entities should be consolidated. This analysis 
included, but was not limited to, identifying the activities that most signiﬁcantly impact an entity’s economic performance, which party or 
parties control those activities and the risks associated with these entities. Decision-making power over key facets of the contracts was 
evaluated when determining which party or parties had control over the activities that most signiﬁcantly impacted a project’s economics. 
Based on this review, the Directors consider that the Group does not have the power to direct these activities and does not have control 
and therefore the Group does not consolidate the military housing projects. balfourbeatty.com/AR2017

Notes:
(i) The Group evaluated each of its interests in 
the military housing projects to determine if 
the associated entities should be consolidated. 
This analysis included, but was not limited to, 
identifying the activities that most signiﬁcantly 
impact an entity’s economic performance, which 
party or parties control those activities and the 
risks associated with these entities. Decision-
making power over key facets of the contracts 
were evaluated when determining which party 
or parties had control over the activities that 
most signiﬁcantly impact a project’s economics. 
Based on this review, the Directors consider that 
the Group does not have the power to direct 
these activities and does not control or jointly 
control them and therefore the entities have 
been accounted for as associated undertakings.

reinvestment plan (DRIP) is offered which allows holders of ordinary 
shares to reinvest their cash dividends in the Company’s shares 
through a specially arranged share dealing service. Full details of the 
DRIP and its charges, together with mandate forms, are available 
at www.balfourbeatty-shares.com.

Unsolicited telephone calls
In the past, some of our shareholders have received unsolicited 
telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters 
from organisations or persons claiming or implying that they have 
some connection with the Company. These are typically from 
overseas-based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders offering to 
sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high-risk shares in 
UK or overseas investments. Shareholders are advised to be very 
wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount 
or offers of free reports on the Company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
 – always ensure the ﬁrm is on the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) Register and is allowed to give ﬁnancial advice before 
handing over your money. You can check via www.fsa.gov.uk/
register/home.do
 – double-check the caller is from the ﬁrm they say they are – ask 
for their name and telephone number and say you will call them 
back. Check their identity by calling the ﬁrm using the contact 
number listed on the FCA Register. If there are no contact details 
on the FCA Register or you are told that they are out of date, or 
if you have any other doubts, call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 
0800 111 6768
 – if you are approached about a share scam, please visit the FCA’s 
ScamSmart website at www.fca.org.uk/scamsmart where 
you can access information about the various types of scam, 
including share and boiler room fraud, see the FCA’s Warning List 
and reports on ﬁrms about whom consumers have expressed 
concerns. Alternatively, you can call the FCA Consumer Helpline 
(see above). If you use an unauthorised ﬁrm to buy or sell shares 
or other investments, you will not have access to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service or be eligible to receive payment under the 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme if things go wrong
 – you should also report any approach to Action Fraud, 
who are the UK’s national fraud reporting centre at 
www.actionfraud.police.uk, or by calling 0300 123 2040.

Gifting shares to your family or to charity
To transfer shares to another member of your family as a gift, 
please ask the Registrars for a Balfour Beatty gift transfer form. 
Alternatively, if you only have a small number of shares whose 
value makes it uneconomic to sell them, you may wish to consider 
donating them to the share donation charity ShareGift (registered 
charity no. 1052686), whose work Balfour Beatty supports.
Any shares you donate to ShareGift will be aggregated, sold when 
possible, and the proceeds will be donated to a wide range of other 
UK charities. Since ShareGift was launched, over £27m has been 
given to more than 2,600 charities.
The relevant share transfer form may be obtained from the 
Registrars. For more information visit www.sharegift.org.
