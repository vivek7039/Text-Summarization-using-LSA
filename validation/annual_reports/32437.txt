OVERVIEW
The Directors recognize the value and importance of the highest standards of Corporate Governance. We strive to comply with the
principles and provisions of Corporate Governance as far as practicable for a Group of its size and structure, even though as the Group
is listed on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange, it is not required to comply fully with the principles of Corporate Governance
as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). This report sets out the Governance approach.
ROLEANDCOMPOSITION OFTHEBOARD
The Board’s role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership to the Company. The Board is focused on ensuring that the risk register and
management of those risks remain pertinent in the face of a continually evolving business. The principal risks and uncertainties are
reviewed regularly, and are set out on pages 14 to 15. Whilst it is recognized that the Group is subject to a number of risks greater than
this list, we include those that are of most concern and relevance to the business at this point in time. The Board is also responsible for
articulating the Company’s strategic aims and ensuring that the business has the resources necessary to enable the Company to meet
its objectives. It also determines the Company’s values and standards, and ensures that its obligations to shareholders are met.
The Board is comprised of Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors. Corporate governance guidelines require that boards should
be “balanced between Executive and Non-Executive Directors, and should have at least two independent, Non-Executive Directors.” At
the year-end date, RhythmOne plc exceeds this requirement, with five of the seven Board Directors being independent, Non-Executive
Directors.
The beneficial interests of the Non-Executive Directors in the share capital of the Company are set out on page 31. In the opinion of the
Board, these interests do not detract from the Directors’ independence. In the event of a conflict of interest, the relevant Director is
required to declare the conflict and, where appropriate, abstain from voting on any resolutions connected to it.
DIVISION OFRESPONSIBILITIES
There is a clear division of responsibility at the head of the Company between the running of the Board, which is delegated to the
Chairman, Mr. Raj Chellaraj, and the executive responsibility for the running of the Company’s business, which is delegated to the Chief
Executive Officer, Mr. Subhransu (“Brian”) Mukherjee. As Chairman, Mr. Chellaraj is responsible for leadership of the Board, setting the
Board’s agenda, and ensuring that there is sufficient time available for discussion of all agenda items. The Non-Executive Directors do
not have any day-to-day involvement in the running of the business. They work together to constructively challenge and assist in the
development of strategic proposals and to fulfill the Board committee roles.
The Board convenes at regular scheduled intervals and follows a formal agenda of matters specifically reserved for discussion, including
such matters as:
  determining the Group’s strategy;
  ensuring open and informative communication with shareholders;
  reviewing and managing risks;
  evaluating major capital expenditures;
  evaluating material contracts to be entered into;
  shaping key operational policies;
  reviewing and approving the Group’s business plan and forecasts;
  measuring performance; and
  approving the annual and interim financial statements.
It also meets outside of the formal schedule of meetings as and when required. The number of formal meetings of the Board during the
year ended 31 March 2017, and attendance at each are summarized below:
DIRECTOR
NUMBER OF MEETINGS
DURING APPOINTMENT
NUMBER OF MEETINGS
ATTENDED
Raj Chellaraj 15 14
Subhransu (“Brian”) Mukherjee 15 15
Suranga Chandratillake 15 14
Mark Opzoomer 15 14
Ujjal Kohli 15 14
Andrea Lee (“Andy”) Cunningham 15 14
Edward (“Ted”) Hastings (appointed 10 February 2017) 1 1
In the event that any Director is unable to attend a meeting, they have the opportunity to relay their comments through the Chairman.
If the Chairman is absent, another Non-Executive Director is appointed Chairman for that meeting. At certain times, where there may
be a perceived conflict due to the subject matter of a meeting, a Director is recused from that meeting. The size and composition of the
Board is regularly reviewed to ensure that it is of an appropriate size and structure. The Directors may take independent professional
advice at the Group’s expense and all are covered by Directors and Officers insurance.
25 BOARDCOMMITTEES
The Board has established an Audit Committee, Nomination Committee and a Remuneration Committee. These committees each
comprise a small sub-committee of the main Board and are entirely made up of Non-Executive Directors. Each has its own terms of
reference and responsibilities. The reports of each Board Committee are set out later in this document.
EFFECTIVENESS
We have considered the overall balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors and believe that the structure of the Board,
coupled with the integrity and commitment of the individuals who make up the Board, ensures that no one individual has a greater
proportion of decision-making power. The Board has a good balance between financial, industry-specific and general business
knowledge experience, with a highly experienced executive management team. All Directors are considered able to dedicate sufficient
time to their role to ensure that they can discharge their responsibilities effectively.
On joining the Board, all new Directors receive a comprehensive induction to introduce them to the business, enhance their knowledge
of the industry and to meet the key personnel across the Group. The Board is committed to a culture of continued personal
development, and all members of the Board are encouraged to undertake any training which will enhance their understanding or ability
to serve the Board and refresh their knowledge. Regular updates on Corporate Governance are also provided.
Board effectiveness is reviewed regularly. The most recent review, shortly before the year end, concluded that the Board and its
individual members continue to perform effectively. The review is considered a general overview as to the operation of the Board,
opinions on shareholder relationships, views on the Board’s inputs into strategy, governance and compliance, risk management and
succession planning.
INFORMATIONANDSUPPORT
The Board is supplied with information in a form that enables it to discharge its responsibilities effectively. Board papers are supplied on
a timely basis, with sufficient time for the Board to review and raise questions ahead of the formal meeting to which they relate. The
culture of the Board is to encourage participation and active debate in a constructive and supportive manner.
RELATIONSHIPSWITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board believes in open and regular dialogue with shareholders to ensure that the objectives and overall business strategy of the
Group are effectively communicated. As such, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the Chairman, working in
consultation with the Group’s corporate brokers and advisors, make themselves available to meet shareholders at least once a year at
the Annual General Meeting. There are also a series of meetings with analysts and institutional investors in relation to the Company’s
annual and interim financial statements.
The Non-Executive Directors make themselves available to meet shareholders on an ad hoc basis as necessary, and consider the Annual
General Meeting a good opportunity to canvas opinion and hold discussions with individual shareholders. The Board makes constructive
use of the Annual General Meeting to communicate with investors and encourages full participation.
Trading updates and press releases are issued as appropriate and the Company’s brokers provide information on shareholder opinion
and compile independent feedback from investor meetings.
INTERNAL CONTROLANDRISKMANAGEMENT
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a sound system of internal control to provide them with
reasonable assurance that the assets of the Group are safeguarded and that the shareholders’ investments are protected. It has
established a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and monitoring the significant risks to which the Group is exposed.
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring the Group maintains an adequate system of internal control and risk management,
while the Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of those systems on behalf of the Board. This review is performed at least
annually. The implementation of internal control systems is the responsibility of executive management. The organizational structure of
the Group has clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of accountability and authority.
The Board’s review of the significant risks in the year covered financial, operational, commercial, regulatory, fraud and R&D risks. The
risk review is an ongoing process with at least annual input and review from the Board. The primary purpose of this review is to ensure
that, having considered the controls that are in place to mitigate risks, the Board is satisfied with the residual level of risk being taken in
pursuit of the Company’s strategy.
26 Our risk review comprised:
  the review of the risk register, considering the ongoing pertinence of each risk, and whether changes in the business meant that
additional risks had been identified which should be added to the register. All risks were recorded in a centrally maintained register;
  risk assessment, which is performed in terms of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential impact on the Group; and
  identification of appropriate mitigating actions for each risk, with responsible parties and a timetable for completion assigned.
Any system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risks inherent in a fast-moving industry, and can
therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against the possibility of material misstatement or loss. However, during
the course of its reviews of the system of internal control during the year, the Board has not identified, nor been informed of any
instances of control failings or significant weaknesses.
The Board also operates a whistleblowing policy which provides for all employees to raise concerns to the Audit Committee, in strict
confidence about any unethical behaviors, suspected fraud, misconduct or wrongdoing without fear of recrimination. There were no
whistleblowing reports throughout financial year 2017, and to the date of this report.
FINANCIALREPORTING
The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving the annual and half year financial statements, and for ensuring that they present a
fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and performance. The Strategic Report, on pages 4 to 7 sets out
the information necessary to enable readers to understand the business model and strategy.
Drafts of the annual report are reviewed by the Board prior to approval with a formal process for addressing comments from the Board.

PAY PHILOSOPHY
The remuneration policy continues to be designed to ensure that senior managers and Executive Directors are appropriately incentivized
and rewarded for their performance, responsibility and experience. The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that the policy aligns
the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the shareholders.
The Company’s pay policy is designed to ensure salaries and bonus amounts are paid at or around market levels. Equity awards are
linked to performance conditions which more closely align with long-term value creation for shareholders.
PAY POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Remuneration at the Company for Executive Directors is comprised of three elements: base salary, annual bonus and long-term equity
incentives. Details of the CEO’s remuneration are indicated below.
BASE SALARY AND ANNUAL BONUS
The Chief Executive’s base salary and bonus opportunity was adjusted in FY2016 to bring in line with market levels when compared to
both US and UK competitors. The bonus opportunity for FY2017 was based on achievement of FY2017 Revenue, adjusted EBITDA
targets and Management Business Objectives (‘MBOs’).
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
During FY2017, equity awards were made in MVSOs that vest quarterly and have been in use within the Company since the IPO, but
with an additional performance component where the equity awards require a minimum stock price threshold for options to vest and an
accelerated vesting schedule upon the stock price reaching certain predetermined thresholds above the stock price at grant. The
Committee believes that along with the performance criteria for bonus eligibility that addresses operational excellence, the quantum and
performance criteria for the equity grants fully aligns the interests of the shareholders and management team to drive long-term value.
The table below sets out the beneficial interests in shares and vested share options of the Directors holding office at year end (audited).
No equity awards were made to Executive or Non-executive Directors during FY2017.

31 PAY POLICY FOR NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Fees for Non-Executive Directors are set with reference to time commitment, the number of committees chaired and relevant external
market benchmarks. Other than covering travel expenses, no additional fees or equity compensation is provided to Non-Executive
Directors for ad hoc services, such as Committee memberships, Board meetings, etc.
PAY AND CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP
No element of remuneration is operated exclusively for Executive Directors and the philosophy of using variable remuneration to drive
the Company’s performance is applied to all roles throughout the Group. All employees are eligible for an annual bonus and some senior
roles are eligible to receive share options. When setting the quantum of remuneration for Executive Directors, the Committee considers
the pay differential between Executive Directors and other roles.
SERVICE AGREEMENTS
The Chief Executive’s Service Agreement provides that his employment with the Company is on an “at will” basis which means that
either the Executive or the Company shall be entitled to terminate employment at any time, and for any reason, with or without cause.
In line with typical US practice, the Service Agreement includes a number of protections for the Chief Executive in the event of a
termination of his employment in certain circumstances.

The Audit Committee (hereafter referred to as “the Committee” in this report) is appointed by the Board, and is formed of
Non-Executive Directors, chaired by Mark Opzoomer. Other members of the Committee are Suranga Chandratillake and Raj Chellaraj.
Its principal responsibilities are:
  monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial
performance;
  overseeing the involvement of the Group’s external auditors, in planning and reviewing the audit of the financial statements;
  recommending the appointment and fees of the external auditor, including maintaining an appropriate policy on the level of
non-audit fees;
  reviewing and monitoring the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, and the effectiveness of the external audit
process;
  reviewing, at least annually, the need for an internal audit function;
  reviewing the risk management process, and the effectiveness of internal controls, including identifying and implementing
improvements; and
  reviewing the arrangements through which staff may raise concerns about possible improprieties in confidence.
The Committee met three times during the year, and details of the attendance at the meetings of the Committee are as shown below.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available for public inspection on the Company’s website—https://investor.rhythmone.com.

Mark Opzoomer, Chairman ✓✓✓
Suranga Chandratillake ✓✓✓
Raj Chellaraj ✓✓✓
The Committee promotes the highest standards of integrity, financial reporting, risk management and internal control. In addition to the
members of the Committee, meetings are typically also attended by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The
Committee meets the external auditors at least three times a year, including at least one meeting each year without members of
executive management present. The Committee should include at least one financially qualified individual with recent and relevant
experience, and currently Mark Opzoomer, a qualified chartered accountant who trained with Coopers & Lybrand, and Raj Chellaraj, who
has an M.B.A. in Finance from New York University, fulfill these criteria.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk register, including the identification and
evaluation of any newly recognized risks and implementing mitigating actions on a timely basis. The Committee assists the Board in its
oversight and monitoring of financial reporting, risk management and internal controls.
The Committee has considered the recent FRC guidance on audit committees, and has expanded its report to include more information
on significant matters considered by the Committee.
There has been a particular focus throughout the year on ensuring that the Group’s risk management and internal controls are
adequately evolving and developing in line with changes in the Group and best practices in the industry. During the year, the
Committee engaged Moss Adams LLP to continue a review of its controls over the key financial reporting areas, to ensure that controls
remained robust and enabled executive management to be satisfied as to the reliability of the Group’s internal systems and processes.
ASSESSMENT OFTHEEXTERNALAUDITOR
Each year the Committee assesses the expertise, independence and quality of the external auditor, and the objectivity and effectiveness
of the audit process. This assessment was carried out on the basis of the Committee’s own appraisal of the performance of the auditor
and the views of its senior management team as well as consideration of materials provided by the auditor.
The criteria used for this assessment remained unchanged from last year and were as follows:
  delivery of a thorough and efficient audit in compliance with agreed plan and timescales;
  provision of accurate, robust and perceptive advice on key accounting and audit judgments, technical issues and best practices;
  a high level of professionalism and technical expertise consistently demonstrated by all audit staff;
  plans for ensuring the maintenance of continuity within the core audit team; and
  strict adherence to independence policies and other regulatory requirements.
Independence and objectivity are regularly considered by the Committee, taking into consideration, the relevant UK professional and
regulatory requirements and the audit firm’s own policies to maintain auditor independence, which include rotation of the Senior
Statutory Auditor every five years.
Our policy on non-audit services is to appoint the adviser who we believe is in the best position to advise the Company on the matter in
question, and, where we believe we are best served by our audit firm, auditor objectivity and independence is carefully considered and
safeguarded via the monitoring of fees paid in respect of audit and non-audit work and approving all additional work performed by the
external auditor. The fees paid to the auditor for audit and non-audit services are set out in note 9.
The Committee has confirmed it is satisfied with the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and has
recommended to the Board that the auditors be reappointed, and there will be a resolution to this effect at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting.
34 REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTSANDAUDIT FINDINGS
The Committee reviews the full and half-year financial statements, and the reports from the auditor on these statements. It takes the
opportunity to discuss key accounting matters with the auditor and the range of approaches to each.
Significant matters which were specifically considered by the Committee in the year were as follows:
ISSUE SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets In accordance with IAS 36, management prepared an impairment review on a CGU
basis.
The Committee discussed the calculations, including the assumptions within, the
methodology applied and the anticipated forecasts. It also reviewed the auditor’s
report detailing the results and conclusion of the audit testing.
Revenue recognition The Committee keeps under close review the revenue recognition policies of the
Group, with particular reference to the appropriateness of the revenue recognition
policies of acquired businesses, and the continued pertinence of the policies in the
legacy RhythmOne plc business.
Acquisition accounting for Perk Acquired intangibles must be fair valued in accordance with IFRS 3. The Committee
reviewed the valuation reports related to the Perk acquisition, prepared by the
external valuator, to ensure that the assumptions inherent in the valuation model
were reasonable and appropriate, and that the disclosures in the financial statements
were prepared in accordance with IFRS 3.
Disposal of non-core business units In accordance with IFRS 5, the Committee reviewed the facts surrounding the
disposal of the non-core business units by the Company and determined that they
met the criteria to present the income statement of the discontinued operations
separately from that of the continuing operations.
INTERNALAUDIT
The Committee considers the need for an internal audit function at least annually. Given the size of the Group and the organization of
the finance team into centers of excellence, which are overseen by an experienced CFO, and considering the robustness and integrity of
the internal controls of the Group which are overseen centrally, the Committee is of the opinion that no internal audit function is
required at this time, but will keep this matter under close scrutiny.
The Committee has however, engaged Moss Adams to document the Group’s key controls, and initiate a rolling testing strategy of those
controls, similar to the controls oversight that would be exercised by an internal audit function.
35 NOMINATION COMMITTEEREPORT
The Nomination Committee is appointed by the Board and is responsible for:
  the structure, size and composition of the Board;
  the diversity on the Board, and across the Group;
  advising the Board on areas where further recruitment may be appropriate;
  the overall leadership needs of the organization;
  consideration of succession planning for Directors; and
  the search for and selection of suitable candidates for the appointment or replacement of additional Directors.
The Nomination Committee (hereafter “the Committee” throughout this report) was chaired by Raj Chellaraj. Ujjal Kohil and Andy
Cunningham are also members of the Committee.
The Committee met once during the year, and details of the attendance at the meetings of the Committee are as shown below. The
Committee meets as required to initiate the selection process of, and make recommendations to the Board with regard to the
appointment of new Directors. The Committee’s terms of reference are available for public inspection on the Company’s website—

and Ujjal Kohli retire by rotation and will stand for reappointment while Ted Hastings will stand for appointment at the AGM on June 27,

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European
Union and parent company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by
the European Union. Under Company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of the profit or loss of the Group and parent
company for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the Group financial statements and IFRSs
as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the Company financial statements, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
  make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and parent
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and parent
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and parent company and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and parent company and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the parent company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and parent company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Board of Directors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
  the parent company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Company;
  the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a true
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Group; and
  the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and
parent company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

OUR OPINION
In our opinion:
  RhythmOne plc’s group financial statements and company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair view
of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the group’s loss and the group’s and the
company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
  the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”)
as adopted by the European Union;
  the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
WHAT WE HAVE AUDITED
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise:
  the Consolidated and company balance sheets as at 31 March 2017;
  the Consolidated income statement and the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
  the Consolidated and company cash flow statements for the year then ended;
  the Consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
  the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements.
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union and, as regards the company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act
2006, and applicable law.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of
significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future events.

In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group, the company and their environment obtained in the course of the

OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND THOSE OF THE DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 39, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
41 This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed
by our prior consent in writing.
WHAT AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INVOLVES
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
  whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied
and adequately disclosed;
  the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
  the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive
procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we consider
whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.

3SIGNIFICANTACCOUNTINGPOLICIES
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical
convention as modified.
48 RhythmOne plc
AnnualReport
andAccounts FY2017
As a result of the discontinued operations in FY2017, certain comparative figures in the primary financial statements have been
adjusted to conform to the current year presentation of the financial statements. Certain comparative notes have been adjusted to
reflect the change to continuing operations, which are clearly labelled.
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also
requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a
higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial
statements are disclosed in note 4.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for marketable securities which are carried at fair
value. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. They continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ Report on page 38.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company
(its subsidiaries) prepared up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial
and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the
effectivedateofacquisitionoruptotheeffectivedateofdisposal,asappropriate.Wherenecessary,adjustmentsaremadetothe
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
GOODWILL
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognized as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognized as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognized immediately in
profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the
recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill.
An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Group earns its revenue from providing online advertising services.
The Group’s business is based on the principle of facilitating free access to technology and content via an advertising-supported
distribution model and its revenues are derived from advertising on the Internet. The Group applies its technology across a set of
standard and inter-related products to connect its audience with contextually relevant advertising in a variety of formats.
Advertisers select from these formats which are priced on different pricing schemes that include both impression-based, Cost per
Mille (CPM), and performance-based, Cost per Click (CPC) and Cost per Action (CPA) options.
Contracts containing multiple deliverables are split into their constituent parts and each deliverable’s fair value is separately
determined and recognized accordingly.
The policies for each of the Group’s key revenue streams in relation to services are set out below:
ADVERTISING REVENUE
When sales values are based on the volume of impressions (Cost per Mille), revenue is based on an agreed amount per impression
and the number of impressions displayed. This revenue is recognized as the volumes are reported either by the Group’s customers,
the Group’s internal reporting system or an authoritative third party, based on the contractual terms. When sales values are based
on volume of clicks (pay per click), revenue is based upon an agreed amount per click that the end user makes after viewing the
advertisement and the number of clicks made by the users, in the period in which the clicks occur.
SHARE OF ADVERTISING REVENUES
Where customers use the RhythmOne technology to retrieve their own content, contractual arrangements may provide for the
Group to receive a share of the customer’s advertising revenues. The amount of revenue is dependent upon the amount paid per
click or per advertisement shown. This revenue is recognized as reported by the Group’s customers, in the period to which it
relates.

services. Professional services are principally comprised of outside legal, audit, information technology consulting, and outsourcing
services.
ACQUISITION AND EXCEPTIONAL COSTS
In line with the way the Board and chief operating decision-maker review the business, large one-off acquisition and exceptional
costs are separately identified and shown in the financial statements. The types of costs included within acquisition costs are those
which are directly attributable to an acquisition, for example legal and accounting expenses, integration costs, severance and
retention remuneration. An example of the type of cost considered exceptional is severance costs, impairment losses and other
significant assets write-downs.
LEASING
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognized as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the
balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognized immediately in profit or loss, unless they are
directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalized in accordance with the Group’s general policy on
borrowing costs.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except
where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset
are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are
incurred.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognized as a liability. The
aggregate benefit of incentives is recognized as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity concerned are recorded at the rates of exchange
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in
foreign currencies are retranslated into the presentational currency, US Dollars, at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
The Group has selected US Dollars as its presentational currency as that is the currency of the principal economic environment in
which the Group operates.
50 RhythmOne plc
AnnualReport
andAccounts FY2017
Exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for exchange differences on monetary
items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore
forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognized initially in other comprehensive income and
reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the net investment.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign denominated operations are translated at exchange rates
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the Period unless
exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s
translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognized as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is
disposed of.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
A discontinued operation is a component of the Company’s business; the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly
distinguished from the rest of the Company and which:
  Represents a separate major line of business or geographic area;
  Is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations; or
  Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified
as held-for-sale. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the income statement and comprehensive loss is
represented as if the operation has been discontinued from the start of the comparative year. During the year ended March 31,
2017, the Company has classified its non-core operations as discontinued operations as further described in note 6.
The 2016 income statement has been restated to remove the results of discontinued operations.
TAXATION
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable or receivable is based on taxable loss/profit for the year. Taxable loss/profit differs from net loss/profit
as reported in the income statement because it will exclude items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using
the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent
that it is probable that taxable profits are available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such assets and
liabilities will not be recognized if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a
business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits are available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is
realized. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly
to equity, in which case the deferred tax will also be dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognized impairment loss. Cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on
the following bases:
Fixtures, fittings, office and computer equipment Over 3–5 years
Leasehold improvements Over shorter of economic life or lease term
51 RhythmOne plc
AnnualReport
andAccounts FY2017
The gain or loss arising from the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in income.
INTERNALLY-GENERATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS—RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE
Expenditure on research activities is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s product development is recognized only if all of the following
conditions are met:
  the product from which the asset arises meets the Group’s criteria for technical feasibility, so it will be available for use;
  the asset is intended to be completed, and will be used or sold;
  the asset created is expected to generate demonstrable future economic benefits;
  the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably; and
  adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete development of the asset.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life, which is considered to be three
years starting when the associated technology is available for use. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be
recognized, development expenditure is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL
Other intangible assets excluding goodwill are measured initially at purchase cost or at fair value if acquired as part of a business
combination, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases:
Tradenames, patents and trademarks 3–10 years
Software licenses 3 years
Purchased technology 3–5 years
Relationships with publishers and customers 3–12 years
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL
At each balance sheet date, the Group will review the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which
the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognized as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which
case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A
reversal of an impairment loss is recognized as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in
which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Any increase in the recoverable amount of previously impaired goodwill is not subsequently reversed.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be
required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at
the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account risks
and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present
obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
A restructuring provision is recognized when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a
valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main
features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from
the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the
ongoing activities of the entity.
52 RhythmOne plc
AnnualReport
andAccounts FY2017
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognized and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered
to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed
the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group applies IFRS 2 Share-based Payments in accounting for its Share-based Compensation plans.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured
at fair value at the date of grant by use of an appropriate valuation model. The fair value determined at the grant date of the
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of
shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models. The expected life used in the model has been
adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioral
considerations.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the
effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognized in profit
and loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
When the options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable costs are
credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Payments to a defined contribution scheme are charged as an expense as they fall due.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market
are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method,
less any impairment. Interest income is recognized by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when
the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
RESTRICTED CASH
Where required, the Group keeps amounts on deposit with financial institutions as a condition of certain property leases and
purchase card facility requirements. This cash may not be used by the Group and is held as security against the lease or credit
facility. At the cessation of the lease or credit facility, the cash restrictions cease, and the cash will be immediately accessible. Until
this time, the cash is classified as “Restricted cash” in non-current assets.
IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are
subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could
include the Group’s past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past
the average credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on
receivables.
For financial assets carried at amortized cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount
and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of
trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is
considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off
are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognized in profit or
loss.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Marketable securities represent the Group’s investments in corporate bonds, commercial papers, government bonds, collateralized
securities and certificates of deposit. These are recognized either as current or non-current assets, in accordance with their
maturity. Marketable securities are carried at fair value with the change in its fair value recognized directly in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income. Interest income and dividends on marketable securities is recognized in the Income Statement, as well as
any foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses.
53 RhythmOne plc
AnnualReport
andAccounts FY2017
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
All financial liabilities are classified as ‘other financial liabilities.’
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognized on an
effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability and of
allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future
cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying
amount on initial recognition.
The Group derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, canceled or they expire.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition
is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and
equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognized in profit or
loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of
acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent
consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes in the fair value of
contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognized.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity are re-measured
to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e., the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in
profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognized in
other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were
disposed of.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (Revised
2008) are recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
  deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognized and measured
in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
  liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are
measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment; and
  assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are
adjusted during the measurement period or additional assets or liabilities are recognized, to reflect new information obtained about
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized as of
that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts
and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
4CRITICAL JUDGMENTSANDKEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATIONUNCERTAINTY
CRITICAL JUDGMENTS IN APPLYING THE GROUP’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following are the critical judgments apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the
Directors have made in the process of applying the Group accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the
amounts recognized in the financial statements.
54 RhythmOne plc
AnnualReport
andAccounts FY2017
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
In making their judgments with regards to the fair value and useful life of assets and liabilities for acquired businesses, the
Directors have considered the classification criteria for accounting for business combinations set out in IFRS 3 ‘Business
Combinations’, including the identification and valuation of acquired intangible assets.
IDENTIFICATION AND VALUATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES
In making judgments in relation to the identification, valuation and useful economic life of acquired intangibles, the Directors base
their assessment on valuation reports prepared by an expert third party at the time of an acquisition.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
When assessing whether to account for a business segment as a discontinued operation the Directors have considered the detailed
criteria set out in IFRS 5 ‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’ in particular whether a business unit
qualifies for disclosure as a discontinued operation. The Directors consider the non-core operations to represent a major line of
business and part of a single disposal plan.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
In making their judgment with regard to revenue recognition, the Directors have considered the detailed criteria for the recognition
of revenue for the provision of services set out in IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and the policy in note 3, in particular regarding whether the
debt is collectible.
There is a policy in relation to the sales and doubtful debt allowance and the Directors have exercised judgment in relation to this.
DETERMINATION OF FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY
Determining the appropriate functional currency requires management judgment and consideration of the economic factors in
which the entity operates, such as the currency that mainly influences revenue, labour, material and other costs.
KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period,
are discussed below.
IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which
goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows of the CGU and a
suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was $48.5m
(2016: $37.2m).
SUBSIDIARY INVESTMENTS
The Company’s initial valuation of its’ investments in its subsidiary undertakings are based on cost and subsequent capital
contributions. The Directors have considered the criteria in IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, in assessing the carrying value.
DEFERRED TAX ASSET
In determining the level of recognition of the deferred tax assets, the Directors have considered the level of future taxable profits
that are expected to be received in the foreseeable future.
SHARE OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARE UNITS
In calculating the fair value of the share options, the Directors have considered the expected life of the option, the volatility of the
Company’s share price, the risk free rate and forfeiture rates. In calculating the fair value of the restricted share units the
Company uses the share price at the date of grant.
5SEGMENTALANALYSIS
RhythmOne plc is organized internally along function lines with each line reporting to the Group’s chief operating decision-maker,
the Chief Executive Officer. The primary function lines include: finance, human resources, operations, marketing, sales, business
development, technology and product development. Each of these functions supports the overall business activities; however, they
do not engage in activities from which they earn revenues or incur expenditure in their operations with each other. No discrete
financial information is produced for these functional lines. The Group’s chief operating decision-maker is ultimately responsible for
entity-wide resource allocation decisions and evaluates the performance of the Group on a Group-wide basis. The Company
integrates acquired businesses and products into the RhythmOne business model such that separate management financial data on
these entities is not generally maintained post-acquisition. Acquired businesses immediately benefit from the primary function lines
noted above and their products and services are enhanced by the inclusion of RhythmOne technology, functionality and the
Group’s wider sales channels to the market.
55 RhythmOne plc
AnnualReport
andAccounts FY2017
The Group operates a global Internet business and its commercial activity is not generated from distinguishable geographic origins.
Although the Group has operations in several geographic locations, no discrete financial performance information is maintained on
a regional basis because of the globally distributed nature of the revenues and high degree of functional integration among the
different geographic locations. Consequently, decisions around the allocation of resources are not determined on a regional basis
and the chief operating decision-maker does not assess the Group’s performance on a geographic basis. Consequently, the Group’s
chief operating decision maker reviews financial information for the Group as a whole, determining where to allocate resources and
drive business forward by examining consolidated results showing underlying results adjusted for acquisition and exceptional
charges and amortization of purchased intangibles.
The Group’s business is based on the principle of facilitating free access to content via an advertising-supported distribution model
and its revenues are derived from online advertising. The Group applies its technology across a set of standard and inter-related
products to connect its audience with contextually relevant advertising. Advertisers select from several product types which are
priced on different pricing schemes. Each of the products generates revenues from a mix of the various pricing methodologies.
There is considerable overlap among the products and advertisers and it is not meaningful to separate the revenues by primary
pricing scheme or product. Consequently, separate financial information is not reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker for
the various products to assess their performance or for the purpose of resource allocation decisions.
As a consequence of the above factors the Group has one operating and reportable segment in accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating
Segments.”
IFRS 8 also requires information on any customer who accounts for 10% or more of the combined revenue. There is one customer
who accounts for 23.62% of the combined current year revenue (2016: one customer accounted for 12.56% of combined revenue).
Geographical analysis of the Group’s revenues, including analysis between the Group’s country of domicile and other countries, is
not disclosed under IFRS 8 as materially all the customers are US-based.
As required in accordance with IAS 18 “Revenue” an analysis of the Group’s revenue is as follows:

7 BUSINESSCOMBINATION
On January 19, 2017, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Perk Inc. (“Perk”), a Waterloo, Ontario,
Canada based innovator in rewarded video for mobile devices for consideration of $43.7m. The acquisition accelerates the
Company’s strategy to build a unified programmatic platform with unique audiences of uniform quality at scale. Through Perk,
RhythmOne plc gains access to a number of premium consumer mobile apps and web properties, adding exclusive inventory to the
Company’s supply side portfolio, as well as strategic demand relationships. The Company issued 88,235,410 of its common shares
with a value of $43.7m in consideration for the acquisition.
The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, with the results
of operations consolidated with those of the Company effective January 19, 2017. Transaction costs of $0.9m were recorded in
transaction costs within net loss.
The acquisition incrementally added $13.1m of revenue to the Group in the current fiscal year and generated a loss before tax of
$0.5m. If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the period would have been
$234m and loss before tax would have been $21.5m.

goodwill of $17.4m arising from the acquisition was primarily attributable to the assembled workforce of the acquired business and
synergies expected to arise post acquisition and integration of the business. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes. The Group engaged an independent valuator to assess and determine the acquired intangibles and
goodwill balances.

Bill 2016 (on 7 September 2016). These include reductions to the main rate to reduce the rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to
17% from 1 April 2020. Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected
in these financial statements.

In accordance with IAS 33 “Earnings per share” as the Group generated a loss for the year. The inclusion of potentially dilutive
options and shares to be issued would have an antidilutive effect on the loss per share for the Period. The impact of these has
therefore been excluded from the calculation for the year ended 31 March 2017 and 2016.
14 GOODWILL
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or more often if there are indications that it may be impaired. The carrying

During the period, RhythmOne plc consolidated certain products, infrastructure, sales and marketing efforts under its trade name,
RhythmOne. The AdKarma CGU was consolidated with RhythmOne resulting in the goodwill associated with AdKarma being
reclassified to the RhythmOne CGU.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, revenue growth rates and terminal
growth rate. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for
the next five years and extrapolates cash flows into perpetuity using a terminal growth rate. The cash flow forecasts were prepared
using an average revenue growth rate of 6% per year for RhythmOne and 4.7% per year for Perk. The cash flows beyond the five
year period are extrapolated into perpetuity using a terminal growth rate of 2% (2016: 2%). This rate is based on an estimated
long-term growth rate for the industry and countries in which RhythmOne operates, and does not exceed the average long-term
growth rate for the relevant markets based on the historical Consumer Price Index in the United States. The assumptions for
growth rates are based on past experience of each CGUs trading performance and are consistent with industry analyst
expectations. The assumptions used differ between CGUs, reflecting the differences in products, customers and suppliers between
each CGU.
60 RhythmOne plc
AnnualReport
andAccounts FY2017
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 21.6% (2016: 19%) for all CGUs. Management estimates discount
rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
No reasonable changes in assumptions would lead to an impairment of the goodwill.

20 DEFERREDTAX
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using the substantively enacted tax rates of
the jurisdictions in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
(i) Recognized Deferred Tax Assets / Liabilities
Deferred tax assets have been recognized in respect of tax losses and other deductible temporary differences where it is probable
that these assets will be recovered.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities (including offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted
under IAS 12) during the period is shown below. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally
enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

26SHARE-BASEDPAYMENTSANDEQUITY SETTLED SHAREOPTION SCHEMES
On the demerger from Autonomy Corporation plc the Company has established the following share options schemes:
  The blinkx 2007 Enterprise Management Incentive Plan (the ‘RhythmOne EMI Scheme’)
  The blinkx US Share Option Plan (the ‘RhythmOne US Plan’)
  The blinkx Autonomy Employee Discretionary Share Option Scheme 2007 (the ‘Autonomy Discretionary Scheme’)
  The blinkx Autonomy Employee US Share Option Plan (the ‘Autonomy US Plan’)
The RhythmOne EMI Scheme and the RhythmOne US Plan allow for the grant of options over ordinary shares to employees of the
Company and its subsidiaries. At the time of demerger two special grants were made under these plans. The first allowed a fully
vested grant at nominal value and the second was a grant at nominal value but with a three-year vesting period. Since then grants
have been made at market value and with a three or four-year vesting period with options vesting in varying sized tranches over
that period. No option may be granted for a term in excess of 10 years. Vested options are exercisable following termination of
employment for a period ranging from 40 to 90 days. Vesting criteria are based on continued employment with the Company.
On 16 September 2013, the Board of Directors approved the amendment of RhythmOne Plc US Share Option Plan to allow the
grant of Restricted Stock Units to be made under its terms.
On 3 July 2015 the Board of Directors approved the Executive Plan for Market Value Share Options (MVSOs) that vest quarterly
with an additional performance component. The equity awards require a minimum stock price threshold for options to vest and
have a further accelerated vesting schedule when the stock price reaches a certain predetermined threshold above the stock price
at grant.
The Autonomy Discretionary Scheme and the Autonomy US Plan allowed a one-time grant of RhythmOne plc options to certain
Autonomy employees who at the time of the demerger had vested Autonomy options. Options granted under this plan were
granted at market price and vest over a period of three years.
Share-based compensation charges have been charged in the income statement within the following line:

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue operating as a going concern while
maximizing shareholder returns. The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities,
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. The Group’s
overall strategy remains unchanged from the prior year. The Group finances its operations through a combination of retained
profits and interest received on bank accounts. Management maintains its capital structure and makes adjustments as necessary in
light of changes in the economic environment and strategic objectives of the Group, ensuring that there are sufficient liquid
resources available to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
The Group’s capital risk management policies are unchanged from prior year. The Group is not subject to externally imposed
capital requirements.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Management is responsible for monitoring and managing the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group, which include
credit risk, market risk arising from interest rate risk and currency risk, and liquidity risk. The Board of Directors and the Audit
Committee review and approve the internal policies for managing each of these risks as summarized below. The Group is not
subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group’s financial function provides services to the business, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the
operations of the Group. These risks (together with the related risk management policy) include:
CREDIT RISK
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily with cash and cash equivalents and amounts owing from customers. The Group’s principal
financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables.
One customer represents 23.62% of revenue in the year (2016: one customer represented 12.56% of revenue). This is not
considered indicative of a high credit risk as the customer in question has a history with the Company and a positive credit rating.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having
similar characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.
Concentration of credit risk did not exceed 16% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year (2016: 13%). Before
accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit rating system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality. All
customers have credit limits set by credit managers and are subject to standard terms of payment. The Group has adopted a policy
of only dealing with counterparties that are considered to be creditworthy by management, having completed various credit
checks.
The risk of default from a financial institution is considered limited because counterparties are a number of different banks with
high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies, which range from A to AA.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
MARKET RISK (INCLUDING INTEREST RATE RISK AND CURRENCY RISK)
Interest rate risk
The Group has no loans and borrowings outside finance leases and as such, the Directors are satisfied that interest rate risk is
negligible.
70 RhythmOne plc
AnnualReport
andAccounts FY2017
Currency risk
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for any purpose. The Group
maintains the majority of its cash in US Dollars as a natural hedge, in line with our revenue and costs which are predominantly
US-based.
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as it undertakes
certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Group’s presentational currency is US Dollars and the Company’s
functional currency is Sterling. The Group operates subsidiaries in the US, UK and Canada and as a result cash is held
predominantly in Sterling, Canadian Dollars and US Dollars. The Group holds its funds in several different financial institutions.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date
are as follows:

Sterling 617 634 292 222
Canadian Dollars 2,766 - 1,802 -
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 20% increase and decrease in the functional currency of the entity against
the relevant foreign currencies. 20% is the sensitivity rate used (2016: 20%) when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key
management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity includes outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year-end for
a 20% change (2016: 20%) in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes loans to foreign operations within the Group
where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower. A negative number
indicates a decrease in profit and other equity where the Sterling and Canadian Dollar weakens 20% against the US Dollar. For a
20% strengthening of the Sterling and Canadian Dollar against the US Dollar there would be an equal and opposite impact on the
profit and other equity and the negative balances below would be positive.

2016

Cash and cash equivalents (308) (44)
Trade and other receivables (111) -
Trade and other payables 676 127
No sensitivity has been performed on a change in interest rates, as the impact of interest rate risk is so low.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash
safely and profitably by maintaining adequate reserves and cash on hand by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash
flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Group reviews its cash flow requirements on a
monthly basis, to ensure that it maintains adequate cash reserves, diversifying its cash accounts across several banking
institutions and constantly monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
The fair value of all of the Group’s financial instruments is derived from inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities
recorded at amortized cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values. Therefore there is no difference between the
carrying value and fair value of the above financial assets and liabilities.
FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
The Group has assets and liabilities that have been fair valued, on a non-recurring basis, which have arisen through the
acquisitions in the previous years.
The only asset carried at fair value is marketable securities which represent the Group’s investments in corporate bonds,
commercial papers, government bonds, collateralized securities and certificates of deposit. These are valued using both level 1 and
level 2 inputs.
Level 1 financial assets are valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 financial assets are valued by
an external specialist based upon net asset value per unit of the collective assets in the pooled fund.

The following table details the Company’s sensitivity to a 20% increase and decrease (2016: 20%) in the functional currency of the
entity against the relevant foreign currencies. 20% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to
key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange
rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation
at the year-end for a 20% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes loans to foreign operations where the
denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower. A negative number indicates a
decrease in profit and other equity where the US Dollar weakens 20% against the Sterling. For a 20% strengthening of the US
Dollar against the Sterling there would be an equal and opposite impact on profit and other equity and the negative balances below
would be positive.

carrying value and fair value of the above financial assets and liabilities.
