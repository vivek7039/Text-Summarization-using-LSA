Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement
2017 Overview
After a very challenging few years, I believe 
that Rolls-Royce is building real and 
sustainable momentum. Progress will not  
be smooth, given the nature of the industry 
and the number of new products we are in 
the process of introducing into the market, 
and I do not want to underestimate the  
risks. But, the medium-term prospects  
look increasingly bright and the long-term 
opportunities for us remain significant.  
Our near to medium-term priorities are:  
to improve operational performance, with 
the focus on product reliability for our 
customers and on cost competitiveness;  
and cash flow generation for our long-term 
prosperity. Growth opportunities for us in 
our core industries are excellent. We have  
to build customer satisfaction and cash flow 
and, as a consequence, strengthen investor 
confidence, to enable us to capitalise on 
these. That is what we are determined to do. 
Warren East, our Chief Executive, gives  
in his report a full explanation of major 
milestones and achievements in 2017. I would 
like to highlight a few key developments. 
There has been great progress in building 
the executive leadership team. We have 
refreshed our strategy and long-term vision. 
We have refined our capital allocation 
process. We have delivered financial  
results ahead of budget and expectations 
and we have ramped up production in our 
Civil Aerospace business. We have initiated  
a simplification of the Group into three 
businesses and are embarking upon a 
fundamental restructuring. This will make  
for a simplified and more focused business. 
At the same time, we have had to deal with 
some significant operational challenges, 
most notably with some in-service fleet 
issues on two of our Civil Aerospace large 
engine programmes. We are acutely aware 
of the challenge this has created for some  
of our customers. Our absolute priority  
is to overcome these. Customer trust and 
confidence – the bedrock of any business 
– is, and must be, our number one goal. 
We are continually looking to inject pace 
and simplicity into our business operations, 
even as we expand production to meet the 
growth in demand for our products. We are 
well advanced in the complex process of 
overhauling our management information 
systems. Our intent is to provide the data  
we need, not only to manage the business 
effectively, but to provide greater clarity  
on outcomes and progress – progress in  
real economic, not just accounting, terms. 
We are a long-term business with long 
investment cycles. We have continued

Chairman’s Statement
Our focus on improving operational and financial 
performance has been demonstrated in this year’s 
results. Our new vision and refreshed strategy  
lays a firm foundation for creating long-term 
shareholder value.

Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement
STRATEGIC REPORT
our commitment to, and investment in, next 
generation technologies and facilities that 
will be crucial to competitiveness and value 
creation. We have met our key technology 
milestones. I would draw attention to the fact 
that we have sustained investment in capital 
expenditure and R&D notwithstanding 
short-term financial pressures. 
We are putting increased emphasis on 
strategic partnerships and collaborations. 
These collaborations range across 
electronics, composite materials, gearbox 
technology, digital technologies and 
services. We are determined to be at the 
forefront of the ‘next technology revolution’ 
built around artificial intelligence, data 
analytics, machine learning and digital.  
This will be crucial to our future 
competitiveness as well as to our ability  
to attract and retain exceptional talent. 
I would also like to draw attention to the 
progress we have made on the management 
of environmental impacts and the increased 
emphasis we are giving to safety. These are 
foundational goals and responsibilities that  
I, and the Board, monitor carefully. 
Governance and culture
In January 2017, the Group entered into  
deferred prosecution agreements with  
the UK Serious Fraud Office and other 
authorities. This has been a sobering 
experience for all concerned. The Board 
and executive team remain totally 
committed to always acting with integrity 
and to ensuring that the appropriate values 
and behaviours are embedded throughout 
the Group. This is an ongoing and relentless 
task and it is an absolute priority for the 
Board and management.
Culture, as always, is key. There is much  
to cherish and to protect in the Rolls-Royce 
culture. But we also have to develop and 
adapt. We need to be more transparent  
and open, and to engage more externally. 
Performance management, cost 
competitiveness and operational delivery 
against commitments are as fundamental  
to our longer-term aspirations and goals  
as are product innovation and technology. 
As a Board, we are determined to role  
model these cultural ambitions. We have,  
for example, introduced a Meet the Board 
initiative where employees have the 
opportunity to meet with and question the 
Board at an ‘employee AGM’ style event.  
In addition – as part of our focus on a  
more open, inclusive culture – I asked  
Irene Dorner, one of our Non-Executive 
Directors, to take on an employee champion 
role on the Board. 
An additional cultural priority is to build  
a more diverse organisation. This is a 
daunting challenge for us, and indeed  
for the whole sector. Progress to date has 
been disappointing. We have to do more 
and this remains high on my agenda and  
on my list of frustrations. Rolls-Royce has  
an extraordinary brand and we are 
exceptionally well-placed to defy the 
traditional engineering industry norms. I am 
hugely encouraged by the great work that 
so many colleagues from Rolls-Royce across 
the world do to inspire the next generation 
in science, technology, engineering and 
maths (STEM) careers. I continue to be 
inspired by the work done by our support 
networks and employee resource groups  
to stimulate and reinforce diversity. I am also 
very pleased that the proportion of women 
we recruit as apprentices and graduates 
increased again in 2017. But there still 
remains much to be done to improve 
diversity and inclusion and to accelerate,  
in particular, the advancement of talented 
women and high potential younger 
executives into senior management roles. 
This is a huge talent opportunity for us.
As part of this focus on diversity in 2017,  
I introduced a new Board apprentice 
programme designed to give prospective 
leaders within the business insights and 
experience into the working of the Board. 
Investor trust and confidence
I am acutely aware that in recent years our 
credibility with investors has been damaged. 
We are determined to restore it and we  
know that it is results, not words, that will  
be the catalyst. This is a long-term business 
that needs shareholders with a long-term 
perspective. That perspective must be  
based on a long-term confidence in the 
growth prospects of the industry, in the  
value creation potential of the Company  
and in the strength of the management team. 
Risk assessment is an important part of  
the Board’s work. This has been important 
input into our viability statement, which we 
see as a lot more than a short-term liquidity 
assessment. There are significant risks –  
most notably product reliability failure,  
a disorderly Brexit or an external global 
shock that would disrupt travel. We have 
contingency plans to address these risks.  
We understand the importance of dividends 
to many of our shareholders, and also the 
importance of rebuilding a strong balance 
sheet and credit rating. I do not believe that, 
in the long term, these are incompatible  
with our growth aspirations. We will  
talk more during 2018 about our capital 
allocation plans and priorities. For the short 
term, our focus is on generating cash to 
meet the investment needs of the business 
and to strengthen our balance sheet and  
credit rating. 
Delivering on our financial commitments  
is fundamental to investor confidence and 
trust. In addition, we are striving to reinforce 
this with more open engagement with 
investors. In addition to our regular 
interactions with investors, we have held  
a series of governance events, including  
a seminar in the spring of 2017. We plan  
to continue this level of engagement. 
Improved transparency of financial results 
plays an important role in investor 
confidence. We are working hard to make 
our accounts and, more importantly, our 
business economics, more intelligible and 
accessible. The implications of IFRS 15 and 
IFRS 16 may complicate matters in the short 
term and we will work to clarify the impact  
of these new accounting regulations. The 
accounting regulation changes will, I believe, 
be beneficial. It is in everyone’s interest to 
better align the recognition of profit and 
cash. Profitability, and return on capital in 
particular, are crucial strategic measures but 
for the short term, cash flow is our dominant 
financial metric. 
Conclusion
I hope the preceding words have been 
helpful in clarifying where we stand.  
We are, I believe, building real momentum. 
Our short-term focus over the next two to 
three years is on meeting customer 
commitments and requirements whilst 
generating substantial increases in cash flow. 
Longer term, our goal is to build and grow 
our business so that, in time, we are a 
world-leading industrial technology 
company focused on pioneering the power 
that matters. This is not an industry sector 
short of growth options. Our long-term  
aim is to capitalise on them, effectively  
and responsibly. 
I would like to conclude this statement  
with a big thanks to all my colleagues in 
Rolls-Royce. It has been another demanding 
year, but one marked by real progress.  
The drive, dedication and ingenuity of  
our people (and, indeed, of our former 
employees) across the globe is extraordinary 
and, I believe, the Company’s single biggest 
asset. I continue to be inspired by the 
dedication and sheer decency of our  
people and their passion for Rolls-Royce.

Review of 2017
Overview
Rolls-Royce made good progress in 2017, 
achieving a number of important operational 
and technological milestones. Results were 
ahead of our expectations as we delivered 
growth in underlying revenue, underlying 
operating profit and free cash flow. This was 
achieved while focusing on managing the 
well-publicised in-service fleet issues on 
the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 engines that 
led to increased costs as efforts were made 
to minimise the disruptive impact on our 
customers and to develop longer-term 
solutions. There was better understanding 
across the business of the need for cultural 
change and tangible progress in our efforts 
to increase openness and transparency with 
investors. We strengthened the executive 
leadership team (ELT) as we continued to 
drive cultural change across the Group.  
We completed our strategic update and  
are ready to move forward in our drive  
for pace and simplicity, restructuring from 
five to three businesses, with a review  
of strategic options for our commercial  
marine operation. 
Civil Aerospace had some notable successes 
in 2017 with record levels of large engine 
deliveries, further expanding the installed 
fleet and generating service revenue 
growth. We made good progress with our 
new large engine programmes, achieving 
the first flight of three new engine designs 
within a 12-month period. Power Systems 
delivered a strong performance  
in its first year with new leadership, 
streamlining the product portfolio and 
Rolls-Royce made good progress in 2017, achieving  
a number of important operational and technological 
milestones, while focusing on managing significant 
in-service engine issues in Civil Aerospace. Looking 
forward, sustaining this improvement and delivering 
increasing cash flow generation will strengthen our 
position as one of the world’s leading industrial 
technology companies.

STRATEGIC REPORT
making new inroads into the Chinese market. 
Defence Aerospace had another solid  
year as we renewed a number of core US 
contracts and further developed our service 
delivery capability. We delivered operational 
improvements in Nuclear, while in Marine we 
established leadership in ship intelligence 
and autonomous shipping. We also received 
regulatory approval for the acquisition of ITP 
Aero which was completed on 19 December 
2017 – see page 9. 
The Group faced several challenges in the 
year. These are not unusual given the nature 
of the industries in which we operate. In Civil 
Aerospace, production milestones were 
achieved against a backdrop of capacity 
constraints, primarily blade manufacturing 
and test bed availability, driven by the 
in-service fleet issues on the Trent 1000  
and Trent 900. As these emerged during  
the year, we increased our estimates of 
additional maintenance activity required  
to mitigate problems, to develop longer-term 
solutions and to support customers through 
a proactive engine management programme 
to minimise any disruption. In Marine, with 
the average Brent crude oil price remaining 
below US$55 per barrel for the third 
consecutive year, our commercial marine 
operation continued to see substantially 
reduced activity levels in its historically 
important offshore market. 
Efficiencies from the 2015 transformation 
programme have achieved run-rate cost 
savings at the top end of our initial 
expectations of £200m by the end of 2017. 
However, costs and complexity within  
the Group remain too high. The further 
simplification announced in January 2018  
to move from five to three operating 
businesses will enable us to act with greater 
pace, to innovate in core technologies  
and to better take advantage of future 
opportunities in areas such as electrification 
and digitalisation. It will help us to undertake 
a more fundamental restructuring to 
remove duplicated support and 
management functions. 
Within the Group, we appreciate our talk  
of simplification must translate into greater 
enablement for our people if we are to 
succeed in bringing about lasting change. 
These efforts must begin with our leaders 
and during the year I brought in additional 
talent and experience to the ELT with the 
appointment of Stephen Daintith as Chief 
Financial Officer, Paul Stein as Chief 
Technology Officer and Simon Kirby as  
Chief Operating Officer. In early 2018, we 
announced Chris Cholerton would be taking 
up the post of President – Civil Aerospace, 
Tom Bell would be returning to Rolls-Royce 
as President – Defence and Harry Holt took 
up the post of Group HR Director.
2017 priorities
At the beginning of the year we set out  
four key priorities:
Priority 1: Strengthen our focus  
on engineering, operational and 
aftermarket excellence 
Engineering excellence – our central 
engineering function was restructured to 
integrate engineering into the businesses 
closer to our customers. At the same time, 
we have created a new technology team  
led by the Chief Technology Officer to 
heighten the importance of technology  
in driving future growth – see pages  
42 and 43. We invested over £1bn in  
self-funded R&D in 2017, part of which 
supported the installation of digital 
engineering tools, producing our first 
all-digital engine design. 
Operational excellence – a new operating 
strategy was developed and we invested  
a further £764m in capital expenditure  
in 2017. Capitalising on the rapidly 
advancing digital techniques, our aim is  
to create an agile, highly productive and  
cost-competitive manufacturing footprint.  
Our new plants have already undergone  
a digital transformation generating an 
unprecedented insight into our value  
chain capability. We are also developing  
industry-leading capabilities in digital 
manufacturing, through innovative 
collaboration and partnerships, which will 
lead to double-digit benefits in productivity 
and efficiency. All our businesses had 
significant execution targets and product 
delivery milestones to achieve. Civil 
Aerospace delivered a 35% increase in  
large engine deliveries. In Defence 
Aerospace, the modernisation programme  
at the Indianapolis facility progressed well 
and is on track with its cost saving targets.  
In Power Systems, the new leadership 
focused the business on simplifying the 
product portfolio, achieving around a 20% 
year-on-year reduction in product variants. 
Aftermarket excellence – service focus is 
driven by customer demand for reliability 
and availability. This has seen aftermarket 
support transition from the sale of spare 
products to a partnership with customers 
based on predictive maintenance and 
proactive management of in-service issues. 
In 2017, the Civil Aerospace team worked 
hard to minimise customer disruption from 
in-service fleet issues with our Trent 1000 
and Trent 900 engines and to develop 
longer-term solutions. Concurrently, the 
Trent XWB-84 achieved over 1.2 million 
flying hours with unprecedented levels  
of reliability. In Defence Aerospace, we 
opened a further two dedicated service 
delivery centres (SDCs) to support the  
RAF and the Indian Air Force, accelerating 
decision-making on engine issues to 
maximise availability. Power Systems also 
opened customer care centres in key time 
zones, replicating the TotalCare service 
developed in Civil and Defence Aerospace. 
Power Systems’ first availability contract 
commenced in 2017 with Hitachi Rail to run 
In Civil Aerospace, while we worked to 
minimise the impact of in-service issues,  
key milestones were achieved towards  
entry into service for the new  
Trent 1000 TEN, Trent XWB-97 and  
Trent 7000. Testing of our new power 
gearbox design, a vital component in our 
new UltraFan demonstrator programme,  
has proceeded well and the Advance3 
demonstrator achieved its first successful 
ground test. Electrification will play an 
increasingly important role in all areas of  
the Group over the coming years and during 
the year we established a new electrical unit.  
In November 2017, we announced that  
we will develop the E-Fan X hybrid electric 
aircraft demonstrator in collaboration  
with Airbus and Siemens; reflecting the 
growing importance of electrification  
to the long-term future of the  
aerospace industry.

for over 20 years, covering support for the 
UK’s intercity programme. Looking forward, 
a focus on lifecycle costs coupled with the 
delivery of more digitally enabled engines 
and systems should support further growth 
in proactive service management offerings 
at Power Systems. 
Priority 2: Sustain the strong start 
to our transformation programme 
On-target delivery of transformation 
benefits – since November 2015, we have 
been pursuing a transformation programme 
focused on simplifying the organisation, 
streamlining management, reducing  
fixed costs and adding greater pace  
and accountability to decision-making.  
The benefits are on-target, having achieved 
run-rate cost savings at the top end of  
our initial expectations of £200m by the 
end of 2017. 
Priority 3: Rebuild trust and 
confidence in our long-term 
growth prospects 
Greater financial transparency through 
further clarity on cash drivers and  
revenue – as outlined at our half-year 2017 
results, our focus is on sustaining stronger 
cash generation. A stronger finance team, 
led by Stephen Daintith, is bringing greater 
financial transparency and clarity both 
internally and for our investors. In 2018,  
we plan to introduce new KPIs to align  
with our refined long-term performance 
objectives and reflect our focus on free 
cash flow as a fundamental indicator of 
performance. See page 17 for more details. 
On adopting the new revenue reporting 
standard IFRS 15, introduced from 1 January 
2018, we have selected accounting policies 
that provide clarity and transparency of  
our revenue and profit – see page 55.  
On page 170 we have taken the opportunity 
to proactively present our 2017 financial 
results as they would look under the new 
reporting standard. 
Priority 4: Develop our  
long-term vision and strategy
Refreshed vision and strategy for  
Rolls-Royce – we completed our strategic 
update in the year and in early January 
2018 we announced a simplification from 
five to three businesses and a review  
of strategic options for our commercial 
marine operation. This simplification  
aligns our business more closely with our 
customers and with our strategic vision  
to pioneer cutting-edge technologies  
that deliver the cleanest, safest and most 
competitive solutions to meet our planet’s 
vital power needs. 
Our ambition is to be the world’s leading

STRATEGIC REPORT
2018 priorities and outlook 
Our people worked hard in 2017 but more 
remains to be done. Our goal is to make 
2018 a breakthrough year in terms of 
strategic, operational and financial goals. 
The simplification of our operating 
businesses into three focused units will 
enable the Group to operate at greater 
pace. We must also address the cost  
and complexity of the Group in order to 
improve the service we offer customers  
and our financial returns. I am confident 
that with the right management team now 
in place, a simplified business structure  
and steps being taken to improve our 
processes, we will make further meaningful 
progress in meeting our strategic, 
operational and financial goals in 2018.  
Our largest business, Civil Aerospace,  
will continue to focus on increasing engine 
deliveries and working with customers  
to minimise the impact of in-service engine 
issues. Across the Group there will be new 
product introductions and continued R&D 
investment and capital expenditure to 
revitalise current products and innovate 
new technologies. We will also look to 
report progress on the strategic review  
of our commercial marine operation.  
This fundamental restructuring, combined 
with improving cash flow, will strengthen 
our balance sheet and we will communicate 
the KPIs that underpin a more disciplined 
approach to capital allocation. While Group 
underlying revenue and profit before 
financing will be impacted by the adoption 
of IFRS 15, free cash flow is unaffected  
by accounting changes and is expected  
to increase significantly from 2017 levels. 
Longer-term outlook 
Our longer-term outlook remains strong 
and we believe in the transformative 
potential of our technology. The 
progressive roll-out of our original 
equipment into markets with long-term 
underlying growth will increase our 
installed base over the next ten years.  
This, in turn, will drive significant free cash 
flow as we increase penetration of our 
service products. The fundamental 
restructuring announced in January 2018 
shows our willingness to take decisive 
action now in order to secure and enhance 
the long-term benefit of the cash flows that 
will be generated over the years to come. 
We must become a more agile and 
adaptable organisation. 
Our aim is for our people to have a shared 
vision while being empowered to act 
responsively. This will support us as we  
look to develop innovative power expertise, 
new digital solutions and advances in 
electrification that will enable Rolls-Royce 
technology to lead the world into a low 
carbon future. 
ITP AERO BECOMES A ROLLS-ROYCE COMPANY 
In late 2017, Rolls-Royce received approval from the Spanish 
Government for the acquisition of the 53.1% stake in ITP Aero 
owned by our partner in the business, SENER. Having taken 
full ownership of the company, ITP Aero is now a separate 
business unit within Rolls-Royce. ITP Aero will retain 
organisational autonomy allowing it to continue serving 
other original equipment manufacturers (OEM) as customers, 
while meeting our governance and compliance standards. 
Based in Bilbao, Spain, ITP Aero is an aero-engine component 
designer and manufacturer that offers products and services 
across the widebody, single-aisle, regional, corporate and 
defence aviation markets. It has worked with Rolls-Royce  
as a risk and revenue sharing partner on all members of  
the Trent engine family, manufacturing low pressure  
turbines, and is an important partner on the UltraFan engine 
development programme. ITP Aero also provides essential 
aerospace products and services to a number of important 
customers outside of Rolls-Royce. ITP Aero is a partner in the 
main European Defence aviation consortia and is the Spanish 
Defence aeronautical engine reference company, supporting 
existing and future programmes as well as providing in-service 
support to the Spanish fleet.

The Trends Shaping our Markets
As pioneers, we must continuously innovate to provide the best solutions 
in the markets we serve. This requires us to anticipate the opportunities 
and challenges that our customers will face. In the coming years, we 
believe that three key trends will define the world’s future power needs.
The Trends Shaping our Markets
Growing demand for cleaner ,  
safer and more competitive power
Global economic power and rising prosperity will lead to 
increased demand for travel, trade and energy. The growing 
understanding of the science of climate change is also 
shaping demand for power. 
To provide superior power for our customers, we will 
continuously develop and apply cutting-edge technologies.
Electrification
As we move to a low carbon global economy, our engines will 
become part of broader, hybrid systems with lower emissions 
and lower environmental impact. 
To provide solutions for our customers, we will act as a 
systems integrator, combining our traditional mechanical 
technology with electrical technology.
Digitalisation
Advances in sensors, communication, data storage,  
processing power, machine learning, artificial intelligence, 
robotics and additive layer manufacturing are all combining  
to create new insights, processes and opportunities. 
To provide lifelong performance for our customers, we will use 
the huge power of digitalisation to transform our activities. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

Champion electrification 
We will invest in new power solutions  
for our long-term success.
We are building on our strong heritage  
in thermo-mechanical engineering  
to produce state-of-the-art  
electro-mechanical and hybrid power 
systems. Today, we already combine  
our engines in hybrid systems for trains, 
ships and micro-grids.
Reinvent with digital 
We will be Digital First in everything we  
do to generate new insights, new solutions 
and new opportunities.
We are renowned as a pioneer in the use  
of digital solutions for our customer care. 
We are continuously enhancing the digital 
twin of our physical activities and seeking 
new data innovations.
Vitalise existing capabilities 
We will develop next generation 
technologies to sustain and grow  
our current competitiveness.
We are investing in our existing  
thermo-mechanical products to ensure  
that they provide the cleanest, safest  
and most competitive solutions for our 
customers. For example, the UltraFan 
represents a fundamental upgrade of  
our gas turbines, incorporating  
11 breakthrough technologies.
Transform our business 
We will fundamentally change the way  
we do business to generate substantial 
value for our stakeholders.
We are implementing and improving the 
Rolls-Royce operating system. Digitalisation 
allows us to create entirely new ways of 
engineering, manufacturing and serving  
our customers across the Group.
Build a balanced portfolio 
We will seek new markets and products that 
bring new technologies and capabilities, 
and generate scale and synergies. 
We are investing to manage the transition 
towards electrification and digitalisation.  
We mitigate the risk of long-term investment 
by increasing our preparedness. For 
example, by developing activities where 
electrification is relevant today, such as 
micro-grids, we will be better placed to 
benefit in activities where electrification is 
still some years away, such as aero engines.
We are committed to creating  
an environment where all our  
people are able to be at their best.

Notes
1
  We measure our order book at our long-term planning exchange rate (LTPR) and list prices and include both firm and announced orders. In Civil Aerospace, it is common for a 
customer to take options for future orders in addition to firm orders placed. Such options are excluded from the order book. In Defence Aerospace, long-term programmes are often 
ordered for only one year at a time. In such circumstances, even though there may be no alternative engine choice available to the customer, only the contracted business is included 
in the order book. We only include the first seven years’ revenue from long-term aftermarket contracts.
2
  Any orders which were recorded in previous periods and which are subsequently cancelled, reducing the order book, are included as a reduction to intake. We measure order intake  
at constant exchange rates and list prices and, consistent with the order book policy of recording the first seven years’ revenue from long-term aftermarket contracts, include the 
addition of the following year of revenue on long-term aftermarket contracts.
3
  Underlying revenue is used as it reflects the impact of our foreign exchange (FX) hedging policy by valuing foreign currency revenue at the actual exchange rates achieved as a result 
of settling FX contracts in the year. This provides a clearer measure of the year-on-year performance.
4
  We measure R&D as the self-funded expenditure before both amounts capitalised in the year and amortisation of previously capitalised balances. We expect to spend approximately 
5% of underlying revenue on R&D although this proportion will fluctuate depending on the stage of development of current programmes. We expect this proportion will reduce 
modestly over the medium-term.
5
  All proposed investments are subject to rigorous review to ensure that they are consistent with forecast activity and will provide value for money. We measure annual capital 
expenditure as the cost of property, plant and equipment acquired during the period and, over the medium-term, expect a proportion of around 4%. (Capital expenditure excludes 
additions arising from TotalCare Flex arrangements).
6
  In particular: (a) revenue and costs denominated in US dollars and euros are presented on the basis of the exchange rates achieved during the year based on our FX hedge book;  
(b) similar adjustments are made in respect of commodity derivatives; and (c) consequential adjustments are made to reflect the impact of exchange rates on trading assets and 
liabilities, and long-term contracts, on a consistent basis.
7
 We measure free cash flow as the movement in net debt/funds during the year, before movements arising from payments to shareholders, acquisitions and disposals, and FX.
8
 Organic change is at constant translational currency, excluding M&A. 16
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report
Financial Review
Financial Review
Stephen Daintith
Chief Financial Officer
Overview 2017 
I believe I have joined Rolls-Royce as Chief 
Financial Officer at a significant point in  
its history. Over the past five years, we have 
made substantial investments of almost 
£8bn in new products and operations, with 
cumulative tangible capital expenditure  
of £3.2bn and self-funded R&D investment 
of £4.4bn. This has allowed Rolls-Royce  
to develop and bring to market a number  
of the world’s most powerful aero engines. 
Over a period of 12 months, three new 
widebody engines achieved first flights. 
Our active Civil Aerospace in-service 
engine base stands at 12,966, including 
4,409 large engines, an increase of 16% 
since 2012 and an increase in our large 
engine installed base of 7% in 2017 alone. 
The growth of the installed base highlighted 
above helped drive a 12% increase in 
widebody engine flying hours in 2017, 
delivering 12% growth in Civil Aerospace 
service revenue. Another solid year in our 
Defence Aerospace business, together with  
a strong performance at Power Systems  
and ongoing cost benefits from our 
transformation programme, helped us deliver 
an improved financial performance in the 
year. Underlying operating profit and free 
cash flow were both above our expectations.
Overall Group underlying revenue  
grew organically 6% to £15.1bn. Original 
equipment (OE) revenue of £7.7bn grew  
6%, reflecting increased delivery volumes 
in Civil Aerospace and Defence Aerospace 
plus improved end markets for Power 
Systems. Marine OE revenue fell 15%  
due to challenging end markets. Nuclear 
revenue rose by 4%. Service revenue,  
which accounts for 49% of Group revenue, 
rose 7% to £7.4bn in 2017, led by growth  
in Civil Aerospace.
Underlying operating profit grew 22% 
organically to £1,175m (reported operating 
profit of £1,287m) in 2017 which was driven 
by revenue improvement, our focus on 
fixed costs and higher capitalised R&D.  
It was delivered despite higher costs 
incurred from Civil Aerospace’s in-service 
engine issues with the Trent 1000 and  
Trent 900 which had a negative £227m 
impact on profit in the year (2016: £98m). 
Transformation programme benefits have 
now reached the top end of our targeted 
£200m run-rate reduction in fixed costs.
Cash generation was better than expected 
in 2017, notably in Power Systems, with 
£273m of Group free cash flow (2016: 
£100m), driven by improved profitability 
and strong working capital performance 
which saw a £546m working capital inflow 
in the year. These were more than offset by 
higher capex, R&D and the £170m cash 
costs incurred on Trent 1000 and Trent 900 
in-service issues (2016: £90m). Looking 
ahead, I believe we are now poised to 
significantly improve our free cash flow as 
the business starts to reap the benefits of 
its previous investment cycle and growing 
installed engine base.
Our primary objective is to generate strong 
and growing free cash flow. Several key 
levers are central to delivering this: 
improving OE economics within Civil 
Aerospace; continuing to drive growth  
in Power Systems; delivering ongoing 
growth in service revenue; and continuing  
to reduce our costs. We have considerable 
visibility of the service revenue streams 
which form a vital part of the resilience and 
longevity of our business model. We will also 
drive working capital efficiencies throughout 
the business, seek to reduce overhead costs 
further through our recently announced 
restructuring programme, increase utilisation 
of our facilities and become more disciplined 
in our spending and investment decisions. 
With more financial flexibility and a more 
disciplined capital allocation approach,  
our aim is for Rolls-Royce to regain  
A-grade investment status, putting  
us in a position to restore shareholder 
payments to an appropriate level balanced 
against a disciplined investment programme 
to capture carefully selected growth 
opportunities. We have progressed our 
portfolio strategy, with the decision to 
review our commercial marine operation. 
We will continue to review our portfolio 
and, where appropriate, pursue tactical 
disposals of non-core assets to further 
improve our balance sheet. 
I am also determined to provide greater 
financial transparency, both internally  
and externally. There has been good 
progress here in 2017, with further significant 
steps to be made going forward. In 2018,  
we aim to introduce some new KPIs to align 
with our focus on cash flow and improved 
discipline on capital allocation. We are 
setting ambitious but achievable targets, 
reflecting our confidence that the business 
can deliver significantly improved financial 
performance over the next few years. 
2018 outlook 
We are confident 2018 will be a year of 
good progress. Organic revenue should 
grow mid-single digit, with underlying 
operating profit of around £400m 
excluding ITP Aero (around £450m 
including ITP Aero). Free cash flow should 
improve to around £450m excluding ITP 
Aero, (around £400m including ITP Aero). 
We are making solid progress with 
longer-term solutions for Trent 1000 and 
Trent 900 in-service issues, largely through 
re-designing affected parts, and we expect 
these to be fully embodied on the Trent 
1000 fleet by 2022. On the Trent 900,  
an extended life turbine blade is already 
being rolled-out with further re-designs 
available from 2020. Based on our current 
estimates, in 2018 the anticipated annual 
cash impact is expected to broadly double 
and reach a peak. It is then expected to fall 
by around £100m in 2019. The majority of 
this work will be undertaken in 2018 and 
2019 and is not expected to complete until 
2022. All of these costs are included in our 
cash flow guidance for 2018 and beyond. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

STRATEGIC REPORT
Financial priorities 
To build a business that can generate long-term, sustainable value for stakeholders, I have 
established five financial priorities, focused on better understanding and improving free cash flow. 
Action has already started and will continue in 2018 and beyond.
3 
  
 Disciplined  
capital allocation
A disciplined approach to capital 
allocation and sustaining a healthy 
balance sheet will play a major part  
in driving our long-term growth. 
Through improved free cash flow 
generation, we aim to maintain a strong 
investment grade rating and ultimately 
return to A-grade status. Restoring  
our shareholder payments to an 
appropriate level will be a key element 
of our capital allocation framework. 
Growing free cash flow will also  
help sustain our investment in R&D 
programmes across existing core  
areas as well as develop new 
opportunities, notably in pursuing  
our electrification strategy. 
1 Improve cash flow generation  
 
Cash is a fundamental indicator of economic performance. 
Our primary financial objective is to grow free cash flow. 
Key drivers of this will be: 
 — improved OE economics, principally by reducing the 
deficit per engine sold, with the Trent XWB engine a key 
indicator of progress; we aim to move the Trent XWB 
engine to break-even by 2020;
 — growth in service cash inflows through growth in the 
installed engine base and flying hours;
 — a focus on improved working capital management;
 — reducing our cost base; and
 — improved operational performance in Defence Aerospace 
and Power Systems.
4 
  
 Provide greater  
financial transparency
There will be a continuing focus  
to improve the understanding and 
explanation of the financial drivers  
of our business, both from an  
internal and external perspective.  
The introduction of IFRS 15 (see  
page 55 for more detail) will help 
provide greater transparency on the 
performance and financial dynamics  
of our business, especially around OE. 
Looking at and presenting our Civil 
Aerospace business on a cash flow 
driver basis should also help increase 
understanding. Finally, moving more of 
our internal and external performance 
metrics to be based around free cash 
flow will help clarity and focus.
2 Continue cost reduction
 
Our transformation programme which began in 2015 continued 
to deliver significant benefits in 2017. For 2018 we have 
launched a new restructuring plan to further improve 
efficiency around overhead costs. 
Key drivers going forward will be:
 — reducing product lifecycle costs through targeted 
re-engineering;
 — removal of duplicated support and management functions 
as we move from five to three businesses;
 — reduction in manufacturing footprint and increasing  
plant productivity;
 — improving efficiency and reducing cost and headcount  
in commercial and administrative (C&A) functions; and
 — disciplined R&D investment.
5 
  
 
 
Strengthen the  
finance function
We are taking steps to strengthen the 
finance function, focusing our resources 
on improving insight and analysis to  
help drive results and change across 
Rolls-Royce. With several new 
appointments already made, we are 
bringing on board different experiences 
to support the continued transformation 
of Rolls-Royce into the world's leading 
industrial technology company. 
Four key initiatives have been launched  
as part of a change programme within  
the Rolls-Royce finance function to 
deliver on our financial priorities.  
These include the re-engineering of our 
finance operating model (our finance 
systems and reporting), establishing 
value-based modelling (the use of rolling 
forecasts) and embedding a strong 
cash-focused culture to improve working 
capital management. Finally, a Finance 
Academy is being established to develop 
and grow our finance professionals across 
the organisation.

Group trading summary 
Underlying revenue up 6%
Group revenue rose 6% to £15,090m, 
reflecting 6% growth in OE and 7% in 
services. Civil Aerospace led the progress, 
with revenue up 12% reflecting strong 
growth in OE engine delivery volumes  
(up 5% in total and up 35% for widebody). 
Service revenue in Civil Aerospace rose 12%, 
benefiting from the growing installed base  
of in-service large engines, which rose 7%  
to 4,409. Power Systems revenue grew 3% 
driven by growth in commodity-related 
markets, construction & agriculture and 
power generation business. Marine revenue  
was weak, down 9%, reflecting ongoing 
weakness in the offshore oil & gas markets. 
Nuclear revenue rose 4%.
Gross profit up 1%
Gross profit rose 1% to £2,973m, with  
gross margins of 19.7%, down 100bps  
in the year. This decline was driven by  
both Civil and Defence Aerospace. Civil 
Aerospace margins reflected the impact  
of higher volumes of unlinked OE engines, 
which carry an OE deficit, allied to lower 
long-term service agreement (LTSA) margins 
and other related costs driven by additional 
maintenance costs on Trent 1000 and  
Trent 900 engines. Defence Aerospace 
gross margins were impacted by lower 
spares volumes and lower LTSA contract 
margin improvements. Power Systems saw a 
strong gross margin improvement of 240bps, 
principally reflecting improved product  
mix and pricing discipline.
R&D costs down 18%
Gross R&D expenditure grew 1% to £1,392m. 
After funding from customers and other 
third parties, self-funded R&D rose 7% to 
£1,035m. This was primarily driven by 
increased investment in Civil Aerospace  
with the development of a number of new 
engines plus ongoing investment in existing 
product improvement, including fuel burn 
efficiency enhancements. Capitalisation of 
R&D rose from £99m to £342m due to the 
stage of development programmes and 
included £83m from a policy application 
change. Contributions from risk & revenue 
sharing partners declined £24m. Overall the 
underlying expensed R&D charge fell 18%  
to £737m.
C&A costs down 3%
C&A costs were £1,168m, 3% down on the 
prior year, reflecting the beneficial effects 
of transformation actions to reduce 
overhead costs. Looking ahead to 2018  
and beyond, we expect to realise additional 
benefits from further restructuring of our 
support and management functions.
Exceptional restructuring charges
£104m of exceptional restructuring  
charges were taken in 2017 (2016: £129m) 
primarily due to restructuring in Power 
Systems and Defence Aerospace,  
reflecting actions to remove cost and 
improve operational efficiency.
Underlying operating profit  
up £260m
Underlying operating profit of £1,175m 
(2016: £915m) was up 22% reflecting  
a number of factors:
 — Civil Aerospace profit increased to 
£520m, up 34% with positive margin 
contribution from higher linked  
Trent 700 OE sales, increased service 
revenue and higher sales of spare parts. 
This was offset by higher costs relating  
to the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 
in-service engine issues, with £227m  
of costs charged for these. Expensed 
R&D fell £156m to £412m reflecting 
increased capitalisation.
 — Defence Aerospace profit of £374m  
was down 7% due to lower demand for 
engine spares, higher restructuring costs 
and a £14m reduction in LTSA contract 
margin improvements taken in 2016. 
These more than offset the non-repeat  
of the TP400 charge of £31m in 2016.
 — Power Systems made excellent progress 
in 2017, with profit of £330m up 61%, 
reflecting 3% revenue growth, a 240bps 
expansion in gross margin, due to better 
mix and pricing discipline, and benefits 
of overhead cost reduction actions  
which saw C&A costs fall 7%.
 — Despite the 9% decline in Marine 
revenue, restructuring drove a material 
reduction in overhead costs with C&A 
costs 13% lower, helping to reduce 
underlying operating losses to £25m  
(a £2m improvement versus 2016).
 — Nuclear operating profit of £38m  
was 18% lower versus 2016, primarily 
reflecting a higher R&D charge of  
£23m compared with the £6m incurred  
in 2016 which had benefited from  
a one-off positive of £7m due to the 
change in treatment of R&D credits.
Payment to shareholders held flat
For 2017, the final payment to shareholders  
is held at 7.1 pence giving a full year 
payment of 11.7 pence (2016 full year:  
11.7 pence), a cash cost of £216m. Restoring 
our shareholder payments to an appropriate 
level over time as free cash flow grows will 
be a key capital allocation priority. Underlying profit before tax

STRATEGIC REPORT
Reported results
Reported profit before tax was £4.9bn,  
a material increase over the 2016 loss  
of £4.6bn. This included £798m of gains 
resulting from the acquisition of ITP Aero,  
a positive FX mark-to-market adjustment  
of our hedge book of £2.6bn (£4.4bn 
negative in 2016), a charge of £671m for 
financial penalties from agreements with 
investigating bodies in 2016, a charge 
(principally relating to the Vickers Group 
Pension Scheme) of £306m for the 
restructuring of the UK pension schemes  
in 2016 and goodwill/other impairments  
of £24m versus £219m in 2016. This also 
includes improvements in other operational 
performances as highlighted above.
Free cash flow improving
Free cash inflow in the year was better  
than expected at £273m (2016: £100m), 
excluding the £14m post-acquisition cash 
outflow of ITP Aero. The strong cash  
flow performance was driven by higher 
profitability in Civil Aerospace, Defence 
Aerospace and Power Systems and good 
working capital performance, again 
principally in receivables, across the Group. 
This was achieved despite £98m of higher 
R&D cash spend in 2017, a £188m increase 
in capital expenditure and the reversal of 
the £180m working capital management 
benefit generated in the first half. Trading 
cash flow in Civil Aerospace of £38m was 
unchanged year-on-year. This reflected 
increased flying hour receipts and higher 
spare parts sales, offset by an increased 
outflow from higher deliveries of OE 
widebody engines and the higher Trent 
1000 accelerated maintenance activity. 
Total cash costs incurred in the year on 
Trent 1000 and Trent 900 in-service issues 
were £170m (2016: £90m).
Looking ahead, improved Civil Aerospace 
engine OE economics and increased  
engine flying hours will drive a further 
improvement in free cash flow in 2018  
and beyond. More details on the movement  
in trading and free cash flow are included 
in the funds flow section of the Additional 
Financial Review – see page 51.
IFRS 15
As highlighted in 2016, the introduction  
of the new revenue reporting standard,  
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers, will change fundamentally  
how Rolls-Royce measures its revenue  
and profit, Civil Aerospace having by far  
the largest impact. There are three  
broad implications:
 — linked accounting will cease to exist  
so all OE sales will be treated on the 
same basis;
 — OE engine cash deficits will no longer be 
capitalised and recorded as contractual 
aftermarket rights, they will instead be 
recognised on delivery; and
 — revenue and profit for aftermarket 
services will be recognised on an activity 
basis as costs are incurred.
Further information on the 2017 results 
under IFRS 15 can be found on page 55.
Net debt
In 2017, the Group’s net debt position rose 
from £225m to £520m (excluding ITP Aero) 
largely reflecting the £273m free cash 
generation offset by shareholder payments 
of £214m and £286m covering payments 
due in 2017 for the financial penalties  
from agreements with investigating bodies.  
A further £378m of regulatory fines remain 
due to the SFO, with a payment schedule 
extending to 2021.
Following the acquisition of ITP Aero,  
its operating cash outflow of £14m and  
the consolidation of the net funds of  
£215m result in Group net debt rising 
somewhat less to £305m.
Credit rating
The Group is committed to maintaining  
a robust balance sheet with an investment-
grade credit rating. We believe that this  
is important for our customers given that 
we deliver high-performance products  
and support for equipment which will be  
in operation for decades. Standard & Poor’s 
updated its rating in January 2017 to BBB+ 
from A-/negative outlook, while Moody’s 
lowered its rating in February 2017 from  
A3/stable to A3/negative.
Foreign exchange
The Group hedges transactional foreign 
exchange exposures to reduce volatility  
of revenue and costs. The most significant 
exposure is net US dollar income which is 
converted into GBP (currently approximately 
$5bn per year and forecast to increase 
significantly by 2021). The Group has a 
hedge book of $38.5bn (at an average rate 
of USD:GBP 1.55) covering this exposure.  
We expect the achieved £/$ hedge rate  
to remain unchanged at around  
USD:GBP 1.54 for the coming three years.
Interest
Interest and other financing costs remained 
broadly flat year-on-year, up £2m to £104m. 
Net interest payable reduced by £10m to 
£53m. Other underlying financing costs 
increased by £12m to £51m.
Taxation
Underlying taxation was £328m (2016: 
£261m), an underlying rate of 30.6% 
compared with 32.1% in 2016. The underlying 
tax rate remains high due to the continued 
non-recognition of deferred tax assets on 
losses in Norway and the mix of profits 
arising in higher tax rate countries, 
predominantly the US and Germany. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

POWERING GLOBAL AVIATION 
At the same time as delivering a significant 
increase in Civil Aerospace engine production, 
Rolls-Royce marked the entry into service of the 
Trent 1000 TEN on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner  
in November 2017. That milestone followed the 
first test flight of the Airbus A330neo, powered 
by the new Trent 7000, in October and the first 
test flight of the Airbus A350-1000, powered by 
the new Trent XWB-97 in late 2016. That means 
Rolls-Royce successfully flew three new civil 
widebody engines in a period of just 12 months 
– an unprecedented achievement in the 
aerospace industry. Each programme has 
brought together more than 20,000 parts to 
create engines that have undergone rigorous 
testing at facilities around the world. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

Overview 2017
2017 marked some notable successes for  
Civil Aerospace, with record levels of 
widebody engine deliveries, expanding the 
installed fleet and generating positive service 
revenue growth. The Trent XWB-97 and the 
Trent 7000 achieved full flight certification 
during the year and the Trent 1000 TEN 
entered into service. The Trent XWB-84  
saw much improved OE economics and  
has achieved over 1.2 million flying hours  
in service with unprecedented levels of 
reliability. These milestones have been 
achieved against a backdrop of capacity 
constraints, primarily for blade manufacture 
and test beds, which have been exacerbated 
by a number of in-service engine issues 
relating to the serviceable life of a small 
number of parts on the Trent 1000, which 
have led to significant customer disruption, 
and on the Trent 900. Investments have been 
made in facilities and people to minimise  
the disruption caused to our customers  
and to develop longer-term solutions.
Financial overview 
Total underlying revenue
Total underlying revenue rose 12% to 
£8,023m, with both OE revenue of £3,818m 
(2016: £3,357m) and service revenue of 
£4,205m (2016: £3,710m) up 12%. The rise  
in OE revenue reflected record levels of 
widebody engine deliveries, with growth  
in Trent XWB-84 engine sales, to support  
the Airbus A350 programme ramp-up,  
a significant contributor.
Higher service revenue was driven by both 
increased engine flying hours and higher 
time and material activity. Overall large 
engine flying hours increased by 12% to  
12.6 million. This reflects a 22% increase in 
flying hours from the in-production Trent 
engine fleet partially offset by a decrease  
of 12% from the legacy fleet of engines,  
the Trent 500 and Trent 800 and RB211s, 
which are no longer in production.
For business aviation, while OE sales were 
26% lower, reflecting a 32% reduction in 
engine sales as airframe production 
transitioned to competitor-powered 
programmes, there was a 10% increase  
in service revenue from continued fleet 
growth and consistently high CorporateCare 
coverage. Overall, V2500 revenue increased 
6% driven by higher maintenance, repair 
and overhaul activity. Service revenue  
from V2500 increased 13% led by higher 
maintenance activity. V2500 OE module 
sales continued to reduce but revenue from 
flying hours remained stable.
Underlying operating profit
Underlying operating profit increased to 
£520m, up 34% (2016: £367m). Increased 
gross margin contributions were generated 
by higher deliveries of link-accounted  
Trent 700 engines, increased flying hours  
in growing widebody and business aviation 
fleets and increased sales of spare parts.  
This was partially offset by the decline in 
business jet engine OE sales.
Given the performance of our in-service 
fleets continued to evolve, as we do every 
year, we have updated our forward estimates 
of revenue and costs across our long-term 
contracts. While this included some 
favourable effects, such as increased 
utilisation and reduced servicing costs 
across our business aviation fleet, it also 
required the inclusion of higher costs for 
additional maintenance activity for the  
Trent 1000 and Trent 900 fleets and 
increased customer support to alleviate  
the impact of limited engine availability.  
In total, the contract accounting adjustments 
created an £18m headwind (2016: £90m 
benefit) which included a £148m charge 
(2016: £98m charge) for technical cost 
(including certain costs relating to the Trent 
1000 and Trent 900 in-service issues), a 
£113m (2016: £217m) benefit from lifecycle 
cost improvements and a £77m benefit from 
a customer credit rating change, offset by 
other charges of £60m (2016: £64m charge) 
ON TIME, EVERY TIME 
In June, Rolls-Royce opened its  
Airline Aircraft Availability Centre  
(the Centre), in Derby, UK, combining 
the latest in digital data management 
and technology innovation. Using 
industry-leading data analytics, the 
Centre plans engine operations and 
maintenance, driving efficiency in  
an industry where one per cent fuel 
savings can be worth $250,000 per 
aircraft per year. With a Rolls-Royce 
powered aircraft taking off or landing 
every 16 seconds, the business can use 
data from thousands of aircraft across 
the world to ensure they are available 
for service 24/7. The Centre will also 
be a hub for the introduction of new 
technologies including real-time 
collaboration systems which allow 
engineers working around the world  
to share live pictures from inside an 
engine with the team at the Centre  
and receive advice on what action  
to take. In addition, ‘remote surgery’ 
techniques will enable experts at  
the Centre to carry out complex 
engineering tasks by remote control. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

largely relating to operational changes. 
Profit was also impacted by the non-repeat 
of the £53m release in 2016, following 
accounting and legal review, of an accrual 
relating to the termination in prior years of 
intermediary services. Gross margin from 
spare engine sales to joint ventures 
contributed £67m (2016: £97m).
Investment in self-funded R&D rose by  
£50m largely reflecting increased 
investment in the development of a number 
of new engine types which we successfully 
progressed, plus ongoing investment in 
product improvements to our existing 
portfolio. In 2017, this focused on further 
enhancing in-service durability, with a 
notable focus on the longer-term solutions 
to the Trent 900 in-service engine issues, 
and fuel burn efficiency as we look to deliver 
on our customer commitments. This was 
more than offset by an increase in R&D 
capitalisation which rose to £328m (2016: 
£85m), largely reflecting the stage of 
capitalisation of a number of development 
programmes. It also reflects a change we 
have made to better align with European 
peers and best practice, to the point at 
which we start capitalising development 
costs to reflect current engine programmes 
reaching technical maturity earlier in the 
development cycle than has been the case 
historically. This resulted in additional 
development costs of £83m being 
capitalised. Contributions from risk and 
revenue partners decreased to £39m  
(2016: £63m). Overall the expensed R&D 
charge fell to £412m in 2017 from £568m  
in 2016. Higher restructuring provisions 
contributed to the 5% increase in C&A costs.
Trading cash flow
Trading cash flow in Civil Aerospace of £38m 
was unchanged year-on-year. This reflected 
increased flying hour receipts from the 
growing widebody fleet and higher spare 
parts sales, offset by an increased outflow 
from higher deliveries of OE widebody 
engines and the higher Trent 1000 
accelerated maintenance activity. The 
average cash deficit on widebody engines 
remained flat at £1.6m per engine, reflecting 
greater volumes of discounted Trent 700 
and some temporary pricing headwind on 
Trent 900, offsetting strong improvement  
on Trent XWB-84, where the cash deficit  
per engine reduced by 37%, underpinning 
our confidence of further cost reduction 
and economic improvement. Total cash costs 
incurred in the year for in-service engine 
issues on the Trent 1000 were £119m  
(2016: £45m) and £51m (2016: £45m) on  
the Trent 900.
The increase in self-funded R&D investment 
mentioned above, together with higher 
capital expenditure for additional production 
capacity and for engines to support the 
growing fleet, were offset by good working 
capital performance on cash collections from 
a number of key customers at the end of the 
year. This benefit helped offset the growth  
in inventory to support the continuing 
widebody engine ramp-up in 2018.

Order book
Order intake in 2017 was £10.5bn  
(2016: £14.1bn including a £2.1bn uplift from 
a change in the long-term USD planning  
rate) with orders placed for 185 widebody 
engines. The closing order book was 
£70.2bn (2016: £72.0bn) and includes  
orders for over 2,500 widebody engines. 
Orders placed during the year included  
119 engines for Airbus platforms including 
the A350 XWB and A330neo as well as  
66 engines for Boeing 787 Dreamliners.
Operational and  
strategic review
The business has made significant progress 
in the year, despite capacity constraints on 
parts and test beds, achieving a record level 
of large engine production and deliveries 
while also focusing on minimising the impact 
on customers from in-service issues on the 
Trent 1000 and Trent 900 fleets.
Engineering and R&D
Significant milestones have been achieved  
in each of the three new large engine 
programmes on their progression towards 
entry into service. Two new engines 
achieved certification: the Trent 1000 TEN 
and the Trent XWB-97. The Trent 1000 TEN 
entered service on the Boeing 787-9 in 
THE TRENT XWB – ONE IN A MILLION 
In late 2017, the Trent XWB-84 passed an important milestone:  
one million flying hours. The engine, which powers the Airbus 
A350 XWB and is the most efficient large aero engine flying  
in the world today, achieved the milestone while delivering  
the best ever widebody entry into service performance, with 
despatch reliability reaching 99.94% in October and zero 
in-flight disruption. The engine continues to set new standards 
of performance and popularity in our industry. Not only is it  
the most efficient large aero engine flying in the world today,  
it is also the fastest-selling widebody engine ever, with more 
than 1,600 already sold or on order. 
The engine, assembled in Derby, UK, and Dahlewitz, Germany, 
has a front fan that is just under ten feet across, which draws  
in up to 1.3 tonnes of air every second at take-off. The high-
pressure turbine blades inside the engine rotate at 12,500rpm, 
with their tips reaching 1,200rpm – twice the speed of sound.  
At take off, each of the engine’s 68 high-pressure turbine blades 
generates around 900 horsepower per blade – similar to a 
Formula One racing car – and at full power, air leaves the nozzle 
at the back of the engine travelling at almost 1,000mph. 24

Business Review
November and the Trent XWB-97 powering 
the Airbus A350-1000 entered into service 
in early 2018. In October, Trent 7000 engines 
powered the first test flight of the Airbus 
A330neo and the programme remains on 
schedule for entry into service in mid-2018.
The business continues to invest in 
developing future technologies which will be 
key to winning positions on next generation 
platforms for both large engines and for 
future business jet programmes. Good 
progress has been made on new engine 
architecture demonstrator programmes  
in 2017. The Advance3 demonstrator 
successfully completed initial ground test 
runs and the UltraFan power gearbox 
successfully completed a high power  
test run to a record 70,000hp.
In November, the business announced  
that it will be developing the E-Fan X hybrid 
electric demonstrator in collaboration with 
Airbus and Siemens. This development 
reflects the growing importance of 
electrification to the long-term future  
of the industry.
Operational progress
Civil Aerospace has invested in both  
its facilities and in building the skilled 
workforce necessary to support the 
continuing ramp-up in widebody engine 
production. These actions enabled the 
business to deliver a record 483 widebody 
engines in 2017 (2016: 357), up 35%, despite 
challenges caused by in-service issues.
In June, a £150m investment in facilities was 
announced with the majority going to new 
testing facilities for large engines in Derby. 
We also opened a new Trent XWB assembly 
line in Dahlewitz to complement the existing 
one in Derby. Together these two facilities 
will enable us to deliver seven Trent XWB 
engines a week by mid-2018.
The new fleet support facility in Tyne and 
Wear, UK, became operational, allowing the 
early closure of an older facility to take place 
in 2018. In addition, legacy supply chain 
facilities in Ansty and Sunderland, UK, were 
exited during 2017.
In-service fleet performance
Our large engine fleet has continued to 
grow, with over 4,400 engines in active 
service at the end of 2017, up 7% on 2016. 
Invoiced flying hours from in-production 
Trent engines rose 22% and total invoiced 
flying hours from service agreements across 
all our widebody, business aviation and 
regional jet engines were 16.7 million, an  
8% increase on 2016. The Trent 700, which 
constitutes 36% of our installed widebody 
engine fleet, continued to perform  
well in service, achieving a dispatch  
reliability of 99.9%.
We celebrated a number of milestones  
in the year, including the Trent XWB-84 
achieving over 1.2 million flying hours with 
unprecedented levels of reliability (99.9% 
dispatch reliability).
We have, however, experienced an 
increased level of activity managing 
in-service issues on two engine programmes 
in 2017, the Trent 1000 and Trent 900, 
caused by the lower than expected 
durability of a small number of parts.  
In the first half of the year, we took £59m  
of charges related to technical issues with 
the in-service fleet, the largest component 
of which related to the Trent 1000. Since 
then we have continued to progress our 
understanding of the technical issues 
impacting compressor rotor blades, 
intermediate and high-pressure turbine 
blades for the Trent 1000 and also  
high-pressure turbine blades for the  
Trent 900, together with the consequential 
operational impact on our customers.  
This has been a dynamic situation and  
we are managing these issues through  
a proactive engine maintenance programme. 
This has required increased short-term 
support including both on-wing and shop 
visit intervention, which has resulted in 
disruption for some of our customers.
We have grown our Trent 1000 maintenance, 
repair and overhaul capacity since an issue 
with the intermediate pressure turbine blade 
was first identified, including doubling the 
number of lines available in the UK, 
developing a dedicated shop in our SAESL 
facility in Singapore and using lean methods 
to reduce turn-around times. We continue  
to make solid progress with longer-term 
solutions, largely through the re-design of 
affected parts, and we expect these to be 
fully embodied in the Trent 1000 fleet by 
2022. Reducing disruption to our customers 
remains our top priority. The Trent 1000 TEN 
engine, the latest variant of the Trent 1000, 
includes a variety of improvements that help 
deliver greater capability, durability and 
efficiency. It is, however, possible that a 
population of early Trent 1000 TEN engines 
may benefit from proactive maintenance  
to embody re-designed parts that weren’t 
available at the point of production. On the 
Trent 900, an extended life turbine blade  
is being rolled out into the current fleet. 
Further re-designs are underway and will  
be available in 2020.
Total charges of £227m (2016: £98m) were 
recognised in the income statement in 
relation to accelerated maintenance activity 
for the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 in 2017  
and £170m (2016: £90m) in our cash flow. 
Based on our current estimates, in 2018 the 
anticipated annual cash impact in respect  
of both the Trent 1000 and the Trent 900  
is expected to broadly double from the total 
cash cost in 2017 of £170m and reach a peak 
in 2018, as maintenance activity intensifies.  
It is then expected to fall by around £100m  
in 2019. The majority of the work will be 
undertaken in 2018 and 2019 although  
it is expected to be fully complete by 2022.  
All of these costs are included in our cash 
flow guidance for 2018 and beyond.
Developing the service offerings
As the engine base matures and flying  
hours continue to grow, the business has 
broadened its range of long-term service 
packages to meet the needs of an 
increasingly diverse customer base.
In June, the Airline Aircraft Availability 
Centre was opened in Derby. The Centre 
uses industry-leading data analytics to 
proactively plan engine operations and 
maintenance, and complements the existing 
global network of customer service centres 
working to provide in-depth expertise in 
their local markets.
The service network has continued to  
evolve with Air France/KLM joining the 
CareNetwork for Trent XWB engines.  
The global network of Authorised Service 
Centres for business aviation aircraft  
now totals 74.
We have sought to develop both physical 
and digital infrastructure for aftermarket 
services through a number of initiatives.  
We introduced the CareStore as a customer 
gateway to the full range of digitally-enabled 
services, supporting more informed 
decisions. Online apps were launched for 
both commercial and business aviation 
customers to provide better insight into  
their engines to help optimise performance 
and provide real-time service information.
We continued to develop our services for 
our lessor customers and in January 2018  
we launched LessorCare, a pioneering  
new service tailored to their needs, and 
successfully signed three customers up  
in the first wave. Total service revenue  
of £4.2bn in 2017 now represents 52% of  
Civil Aerospace revenue and 28% of Group 
revenue. Over the next few years we expect 
continued aftermarket revenue growth as  
we build towards a 50% plus share of the 
installed widebody passenger market and 
service revenue from Civil Aerospace 
become a greater proportion of our  
Civil Aerospace and Group revenue.

Rolls-Royce key differentiators
Our continued development of advanced world-leading 
technology, culture of partnership with customers and innovation 
in services are attributes that Civil Aerospace customers really 
value and are difficult to imitate. These differentiators will 
maintain the business’ position at the forefront of the civil 
aerospace industry.
Market dynamics 
 — The slow-down in new aircraft orders highlighted in 2016  
has continued through 2017 across all regions. These market 
conditions were to be expected after the high levels of order 
placement over the past few years, as airlines absorb the 
increased capacity. It does not imply a slow-down in the 
growth of air travel, which remains robust.
 — Demand growth for air travel in all regions has remained 
resilient to recent geopolitical uncertainties, and historically 
growth has recovered quickly following major economic 
shocks. A broad consensus forecasts that air traffic  
(revenue passenger kilometres) will grow by approximately  
5% compound annual growth rate over the next 20 years. 
 — The business jet market is recovering slowly in the US  
(the largest market) and there are tentative signs of  
growing demand elsewhere. 
Opportunities
 — The business has a strong and growing market position on 
widebody aircraft produced by the world’s two major aircraft 
manufacturers: Airbus and Boeing. The current share of the 
widebody engine market is at 35% of the installed passenger 
fleet and is expected to exceed 50% early in the next decade. 
 — The increasing size of the installed base delivers significant 
service growth opportunities. 90% of the current Rolls-Royce 
widebody fleet is covered by TotalCare service agreements.
 — The business continues to invest in technologies to enhance 
the existing and near-future product portfolio. In parallel,  
a number of engine demonstrators with embedded electrical 
generators have been successfully run; and work on  
innovative hybrid aircraft demonstrator projects is ongoing.
 — Boeing sees an opportunity for a new aircraft sized between 
the 737 and 787 families, dubbed the ‘New Mid-market 
Airplane’. Rolls-Royce is engaged in discussions with Boeing  
to explore this potential prospect. 
 — China’s COMAC and Russia’s UAC announced a joint venture  
in May; the China Russia Commercial Aircraft International 
Corporation (CRAIC). CRAIC recently unveiled plans to 
develop the CR929, a long-haul widebody aircraft. Rolls-Royce 
is actively exploring this opportunity.
Business risks
 — If a major product failure in service is experienced, then  
this could result in loss of life and significant financial and 
reputational damage.
 — If the technical performance of a product falls significantly 
below customer expectation (e.g. Trent 1000 and Trent 900 
time on-wing is less than planned) or fails to deliver the 
planned business benefits, then this would cause significant 
financial and reputational damage.
 — If an external event or severe economic downturn significantly 
reduces air travel and thereby reduces engine flying hours  
and demand for aircraft, then financial performance may  
be impacted.
 — If aircraft manufacturer customers significantly delay their 
production rates or if the business suffers a major disruption  
in its supply chain then delivery schedules would be delayed, 
damaging financial performance and reputation.
 — If the business experiences significant pricing pressure from 
increased competitor challenge in key markets, then financial 
performance may be impacted.
 — If there are significant changes to the regulatory environment 
for the airline industry, then the market position of the Civil 
Aerospace business may be impacted.
CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE FOR POWER  
GEARBOX TECHNOLOGY 
In November, Rolls-Royce officially opened its state-of-the-art 
power gearbox (PGB) test facility in Dahlewitz, Germany.  
The facility is part of the new centre of excellence for power 
gearbox technology, one of the key enabling technologies for 
the UltraFan engine. Development and testing is already well 
underway. The facility has already set a new world record for  
the running of the world’s most powerful aerospace gearbox 
– with the PGB successfully reaching 70,000hp. But it won’t 
stop there: our PGB is designed to run at up to 100,000hp. 
When running at maximum power, each pair of teeth on the 
gearbox transmit more power than the whole starting grid  
of a Formula 1 race. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report

Business Review
Overview 2017
The Defence Aerospace business had 
another solid year. Original equipment (OE) 
production focused on executing under 
long-term contracts in transport & patrol  
as well as delivering technology to improve 
fuel efficiency for legacy fleets. In combat, 
as well as increasing production for the 
LiftSystem, the joint venture announced 
with Kale in Turkey positioned us well to 
offer an indigenous engine solution for  
the TF-X fighter jet. 
A number of core US service contracts  
were renewed, covering over 3,000 engines, 
and an agreement with Aviall, a Boeing 
company, significantly improved the spares 
distribution channel for AE defence engines. 
There were also additions in the UK and 
India to further enhance our SDC network. 
The facility modernisation programme in 
Indianapolis, US, met all of its 2017 milestones 
with targeted cost reductions also on track. 
Finally, we continued to make progress  
on the development of next generation 
technologies across our portfolio to ensure 
we can continue to offer our customers 
increased performance and capability  
for their operations. 
Financial overview
Underlying revenue
Underlying revenue of £2,275m was broadly 
flat on the prior year on a constant currency 
basis. OE revenues increased 4% through 
higher transport and patrol volumes, 
partially offset by lower combat sales 
following the completion of Middle Eastern 
delivery contracts in early 2017. Service 
revenue was down 4%, reflecting slightly 
lower LTSA revenue related to the 2016 
retirement of the UK MoD Gnome-powered 
Sea King fleet and reduced demand for 
spare parts in India in particular. We did, 
however, see increased overhaul activity  
in the US for the F-35B fleet and for the 
Typhoon fleet in Saudi Arabia. 
Underlying operating profit
Gross profit of £575m was 2% lower than 
prior year reflecting lower LTSA margin 
improvements of £68m (2016: £82m), largely 
due to lower cost savings compared with 
2016 on the Eurofighter Typhoon contract, 
and lower spare parts volumes. These were 
mostly offset by the non-repeat of £31m of 
one-off costs for the TP400 programme.
Overall the R&D charge of £78m (2016: £71m) 
was slightly higher and included ongoing 
future programme development across  
our portfolio focused on the combat and 
transport markets. Restructuring costs 
included within C&A were £14m higher  
due to the non-repeat of the one-off benefit 
in 2016 following the closure of the Defence 
Aerospace facility at Ansty. As a result of 
these changes, underlying operating profit 
of £374m was 7% lower than the prior year. 
During the year, the Defence Aerospace 
order book was restated by £(441)m to 
reflect a number of assumption changes 
relating to certain historical orders and 
long-term contracts including revised 
scope and lower expectations of price 
escalation and delivery volumes. After 
order intake of £1.8bn, the order book 
closed at £3.4bn. 
Operational and  
strategic review
Activity with key customers included major 
contract renewals with the US Department of 
Defense supporting engine fleets on aircraft 
such as the C-130 Hercules, V-22 Osprey and 
T-45 Goshawk. Together these cover around 
3,000 engines and the orders taken in 2017 
for over $1.4bn provide good visibility on a 
substantial portion of aftermarket revenues 
for the next five years. Internationally the 
business signed its first OE export order with 
the Japanese Self-Defense Force to power 
its new V-22 Osprey fleet and also secured 
additional Multi Role Tanker Transport 
engine contracts. 
Operationally, the Defence Aerospace 
business focused on delivering on its 
long-term contracts for core transport 
programmes. In combat, LiftSystem 
production for the F-35B Lightning II 
increased, with the current in-service fleet 
performing well. The aircraft made its first 
international operational deployment  
with the US Marine Corps to Japan, and  
its first UK-based deployment for the MoD  
is planned for 2018. EJ200 production was 
lower following completion of the Saudi 
Typhoon contract in 2016, although there  
is the expectation of incremental orders 
from the State of Qatar following the 
signing of a contract to purchase 24  
aircraft in December. 
Technology inserts for the C-130 Hercules 
legacy fleet met operational performance 
expectations and demonstrated excellent 
reliability and fuel efficiency in extended 
hurricane operations during major US 
storms in 2017. This helped generate good 
international interest with a potential first 
export order currently being evaluated. 
Defence Aerospace continued with its 
strategy of moving into adjacent products 
to deepen relationships with existing 
customers, identifying an additional 
platform opportunity for infrared 
suppressors installed on the MH-47 
helicopter to be fitted onto C-130 gunships. 
The business continued with the 
modernisation programme of its 
manufacturing and technology research 
plant in Indianapolis with all key 2017 
milestones achieved on time. The plant’s 
first turbine production cell came on  
stream in March and a second is nearing 
completion. The modernisation will help 
drive meaningful productivity benefits  
and reduce operational overheads by  
2020. We also announced further 
rationalisation of our operational footprint 
with the closure of our repair and overhaul 
facility in Oakland, California by 2020. 
A joint venture agreement with Turkish 
industrial firm Kale Group positions us well 
to develop an indigenous combat engine  
for Turkey targeting the TF-X fighter jet. 
Development work has also continued on 
the Anglo-French Future Combat Air System 
(FCAS) feasibility programme, together with 
investment in future technologies to position 
us for new programme opportunities over 
the next decade.
Strategic aftermarket initiatives looked  
to deepen customer relationships and 
distribution capability, including an 
enhanced spares supply contract with 
Aviall, a Boeing company, covering all 
defence variants of the AE engine fleet. 
This multi-year contract is expected to 
significantly improve availability and 
logistics, while broadening international 
opportunities. In addition, two further SDCs 
were opened in Lossiemouth and Bangalore 
as we continue to find ways to enhance  
our offering with core customers, helping  
with preventative maintenance and 
maximising on-wing availability.

Operating environment 
Rolls-Royce key differentiators
Advanced technology and Defence Aerospace’s collaboration 
and innovation, in conjunction with partners and customers,  
are its unique hallmarks. These differentiators ensure successful 
delivery of products and services tailored to customers’  
evolving needs.
Market dynamics 
 — As threat levels around the globe increase and economies 
grow, many customers are considering increasing their 
defence budgets, therefore the business expects to see 
modest growth across the globe in the coming years.
 — Revenue has historically been broadly balanced between  
OE sales and aftermarket services.
 — In Europe, the political environment has resulted in a tendency 
for large defence programmes to be addressed by consortia  
of two or more companies. For example, Defence Aerospace 
has partnered with ITP Aero, MTU and Safran on the TP400 
engine programme for the Airbus A400M. 
 — Barriers to entry are high, the competitive landscape is not 
envisaged to change significantly in the near future.
Opportunities
 — Combat propulsion remains the largest market segment, with 
opportunities for current products (LiftSystem and EJ200) as 
well as new international and next generation programmes 
(Turkey TF-X and Anglo French FCAS).
 — In transport, Defence Aerospace is vitalising existing capability 
with new products (T56 Series 3.5 kit and infrared suppressors) 
and is well positioned for next generation opportunities.
 — There is strong service growth potential via technology 
insertion and emerging service opportunities using digital 
technology and data analytics to generate new solutions.
 — There is strong interest in electrification and the business  
is exploring more electric and hybrid electric propulsion 
technologies and power generation for high energy systems.
Business risks 
 — If a major product failure in service is experienced, then  
this may result in loss of life and significant financial and 
reputational damage.
 — If global defence spending experiences a further downturn, 
then financial performance would be impacted.
 — If we do not continue to invest to improve the performance 
and cost of Rolls-Royce products, then market share  
may be lost.
 — If the business suffers a major disruption in it supply chain, 
then delivery schedules would be delayed, damaging financial 
performance and reputation.
 — If new applications are not secured, then the business may 
have to increase investment or accept erosion in capabilities.
ROLLS-ROYCE INNOVATES IN THE ENGINE 
EQUIPMENT MARKET WITH INFRARED 
SUPPRESSORS
Rolls-Royce continues to demonstrate its engineering 
excellence and innovation with expansion into adjacent  
engine equipment markets in Defence Aerospace. Building

Business Review
Overview 2017 
Power Systems’ core business is the design, 
manufacture and servicing of reciprocating 
engines including diesel, gas and  
hybrid/electrical solutions, propulsion 
systems and distributed power generation 
plants. It has a significant installed engine 
base across a diverse range of end markets. 
In 2017, strengthening demand in key end 
markets combined with a clear focus on 
operational improvements through the 
RRPS 2018 transformation programme.  
This enabled the business to deliver a 
strong performance achieved against  
the background of greater operational 
efficiencies and a more balanced annual 
production cycle. Revenue grew slightly 
and helped deliver significant profit and 
cash flow growth. 
Under new leadership the business was 
able to achieve a material reduction in 
product variants and greater R&D discipline 
while targeting low-emission technologies. 
There has also been a move to develop 
more comprehensive and connected  
power solutions leveraging digitalisation  
as an enabler of service penetration and  
a growing competitive advantage.  
Power Systems also sought to expand  
its geographic reach with manufacturing 
and assembly partnerships in India and  
in the core growth market of China. 
Financial overview 
Underlying revenue
Underlying revenue of £2,923m increased 
by 3%. OE revenue grew 1% while service 
revenues increased 6%. Commodity-related 
markets, such as mining and oil & gas saw  
a strong recovery, as did construction and 
agriculture. Power generation products 
enjoyed good demand from China and for 
US data centres, but was more subdued 
elsewhere, as was the yacht market for 
much of the year. The service business 
broadened its market reach with good 
interest in our reconditioning service 
offering and from US customers. 
Underlying operating profit
Overall, gross margins increased 240bps  
to 28.8% reflecting improved product  
mix, including from service revenue and 
programme applications, operational 
gearing and from higher volumes. An 
improved balance of production between 
the first and second half of the year also 
helped to achieve better factory utilisation. 
The actions taken as part of the RRPS 2018 
programme on direct material costs also 
contributed to the improved gross margin.
A more focused approach to R&D drove  
a 6% reduction to £177m. C&A costs 
reduced 7% to £331m reflecting cost 
reduction activities in the year. Overall 
underlying operating profit which increased 
strongly to £330m (2016: £191m).
Operational and  
strategic review
Power Systems’ customers span a range of 
end markets providing significant diversity. 
The strong performance in 2017 reflected 
growing demand in a number of key end 
markets as the overall environment 
improved. Engine production increased 
principally due to demand for the core 
Series 4000 products, large engines and  
rail Power Packs. The business was also 
successful in greater smoothing of the  
sales and production cycle over the year, 
reducing the proportion of sales and 
production activity in the fourth quarter, 
which has historically been abnormally high. 
There was growing order interest through 
the year, particularly from naval and 
government customers with a stronger order 
book in the second half. The medium-speed 
business announced two notable power 
station orders from Bangladesh. 
Manufacturers active in the construction 
and agriculture market increased orders  
in advance of new EU emissions regulations 
due to come into force at the start of 2019. 
The first delivery of the new S4000 marine 
natural gas engine which is IMO Tier III 
compliant, was made to the Dutch ferry 
operator Doeksen. Gas systems sales in 
marine and power generation now make up 
over 14% of revenue from the S4000 range.
The business entered into new segments 
such as excavators with products meeting 
the latest emissions standards driven by 
orders from market leaders KATO and JCB. 
A project agreement was signed with 
agricultural machinery manufacturer Claas 
for the annual supply of around 5,000 
Series 1000-1500 engines.
Power Systems also sought to grow its 
share of its engine service opportunity.  
This included the Reman product, where 
engines are reconditioned and restored  
to the latest MTU specification and come 
with an as-new warranty package, and 
which generated strong interest. Customer 
Care Centres were established in key time 
zones to greatly enhance technical support 
responsiveness to customers’ critical 
requirements and applications were 
launched to deepen customer service and 
dialogue. Over time, the business will look 
to develop more comprehensive power 
solutions which will offer higher-value and 
digitally connected products which will 
deepen the customer experience. An initial 
step was the business’s first long-term 
availability contract signed with Hitachi Rail 
for their UK Intercity programme, covering 
the period to the early 2040s; and Power 
Systems sees significant opportunity to 
develop similar long-term service offerings 
for other customers. 
A reinvigorated leadership team under  
the new CEO, Andreas Schell, helped drive 
the RRPS 2018 restructuring programme. 
This was a key contributor to the strong 
performance in 2017, delivering significant 
operational improvements as the business 
pursued greater efficiencies and focus 
across both R&D and production. This 
delivered a 20% reduction in product 
variants and was combined with actions  
to improve material costs, quality control, 
inventory levels and a footprint reduction. 
Greater digitalisation within the development 
programmes helped to reduce the time  
to product launch, including the online 
monitoring of the ramp-up fleet and greater 
collaborative working.
Agreements made in India and China  
are intended to broaden the production 
capability in lower-cost locations closer  
to core end markets. These included the 
official registration of a 50/50 joint venture 
with Guangxi Yuchai Machinery in China. 
The agreement will enable localised 
production of the MTU Series 4000  
diesel engines under license, which comes 
on-stream in early 2018, and is part of the 
China growth strategy. An agreement was 
also signed with Garden Reach Shipbuilders  
& Engineers Ltd for final assembly in India  
of Series 4000 naval engines, and we are 
looking to secure additional partnerships 
for end markets such as power generation.
R&D programmes have focused on  
the strategic priorities addressing new 
technologies, alternative fuels and  
system-based solutions, reflecting the 
structural shift away from traditional diesel 
engines expected over the next decade.  
This included strengthening the gas engine 
portfolio, reflecting greater demand from 
better infrastructure and availability within 
power generation, industrial and marine 
segments. This complements the investment 
in electrification to expand our hybrid 
capabilities and further development  
of micro-grid solutions. A co-operation 
agreement with G+L innotec GmbH for 
electrical-assisted turbo charging 
technology is part of a programme to  
build a range of advanced electrical 
capabilities as a basis for development of 
future hybrid and electrical drive solutions.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Operating environment 
Rolls-Royce key differentiators
Technology leadership and a reputation for market-leading 
performance and system approach, new product innovation,  
full lifecycle service solutions and high levels of customisation  
in collaboration with customers will maintain a strong market 
position for Power Systems.
Market dynamics
 — Most OE markets started to recover in 2017, with the exception 
of the offshore marine markets. There is strong demand in 
onshore oil & gas markets.
 — Increased utilisation in resource industries, especially oil & gas 
and mining, is driving aftermarket service demand after several 
years of challenging market conditions.
 — There continues to be increasingly stringent government 
regulation in most markets with regards to emissions from 
diesel engines.
 — The industry is increasingly focused on service solutions, 
electric and hybrid power solutions and digital capabilities;  
this is stimulating investments in acquisitions, partnerships  
and in-house digital organisations. 
 — Power Systems is experiencing increasing competition  
in its core power range as existing competitors launch  
new engine series and new players emerge with new 
technologies, e.g. Tesla.
Opportunities
 — Rising energy demand in developing countries in combination 
with expansion of renewable energy sources will increase  
the demand for flexible generating sets and products beyond 
combustion engines (e.g. hybridisation, electrification  
and gasification).
 — There is continued growth forecast in emerging markets,  
e.g. China and India, where domestic partnerships including 
local value creation will continue to be important.
 — Tightening emission regulations in several regions will  
require clean diesel solutions where the business is well 
positioned (e.g. S4000 engine).
 — Exponentially growing data usage requires rapid  
expansion of data centres and infrastructure and therefore 
corresponding back-up power solutions, Rolls-Royce 
generators are in particular demand due to their reliability.
 — Increased utilisation in recovering resource markets due  
to wear and tear of existing fleets is leading to emerging 
services opportunities.
Business risks
 — If we fail to develop more innovative products than our 
competitors, then market share would be lost in our core 
power ranges and markets.
 — If electrical-storage technologies develop faster than 
anticipated, then these may substitute Rolls-Royce products 
and/or affect margins.
 — If other players in the industry consolidate, then they may 
generate synergies or capabilities that outpace the ability  
of the business to get new products and services to market.
 — If new disruptive service models, e.g. 3D printing of spare parts 
or new digital service models are offered by competitors, then 
we may lose attractiveness and competitive edge. 
MTU SERIES 4000 ENGINES –  
STILL LEADING THE PACK
When it was introduced more than two decades ago, the  
Series 4000 engine was ahead of its time. It was the first 
fast-running, high performance large diesel engine with 
common rail fuel injectors, technology that was only just 
debuting in the automotive industry. Today, it still leads the 
pack. From ships and locomotives, to mining vehicles and 
electricity generators, it is the all-rounder in the MTU engine 
range with sales of over 37,000 units. During 2017, the Series 
4000 story opened a new chapter with the establishment  
of MTU Yuchai Power Co, a joint venture with China’s Guangxi 
Yuchai Machinery Company. From spring 2018, it will 
manufacture up to 1,500 engines a year for the oil & gas  
and power generation industries. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report

Business Review
Overview 2017 
With the average Brent crude oil price 
remaining below US$55/barrel for the third 
consecutive year, our commercial marine 
business continued to see substantially 
reduced activity levels in its historically 
important offshore market, but saw 
opportunities within the merchant sector. 
The naval business had a successful year 
with new projects from existing core clients 
such as the UK and US navies and from  
new geographies. 
As a result of the weak market environment, 
the business focused on executing its 
restructuring programmes, reducing  
its fixed cost base, including significant 
headcount reduction, and closing non-core 
facilities. At the same time it is repositioning 
itself with product development such as 
permanent magnet thrusters, investing in 
future technologies as the industry moves 
to greater electrification and exploring the 
growing potential for remote vessel 
operations and autonomous shipping.
It was announced after the year end that 
our commercial marine operations would 
be subject to a strategic review in 2018, 
including the potential for sale, while the 
naval operations would be integrated into 
an enlarged Defence business unit. 
Financial overview
Underlying revenues
Underlying revenue was down 9% at  
£1,077m, reflecting declining OE activity,  
with weakness in both offshore and 
cargo-related merchant markets. Service 
revenue was stable, though off a low base in 
2016, and there was a notable improvement 
in naval revenue, particularly in the second 
half. The 15% decline in OE revenue resulted 
in service revenue rising to 47% of the total 
(2016: 43%). By segment, commercial marine 
was down 14% to £805m (2016: £875m) and 
naval was up 10% to £272m (2016: £239m). 
Underlying operating loss
Despite the 9% decline in underlying 
revenue there was a £2m reduction in  
the underlying operating loss for the  
year to £25m (2016: £27m), helped by the 
greater proportion of higher margin service 
revenue and reflecting the positive impact 
of cost-cutting programmes. R&D spend 
was broadly flat at £46m, with the focus  
on developing ship intelligence capabilities 
as well as on new product development. 
C&A costs of £204m were 13% lower, 
demonstrating the progress made in 
reducing both headcount and fixed costs, 
together with a significant reduction in 
inventory which helped mitigate the scale 
of cash outflows. 
Operational and  
strategic review
Lower activity within commercial marine 
reflected the weak market environment as 
deep water exploration activities remained 
at depressed levels. While OE activity 
continued to decline, the business was 
encouraged by the signing of the first 
offshore service contract since 2015 and  
a long-term service agreement reached for 
azimuth thrusters. There was also activity 
across the merchant sector including 
Norwegian ferry operator contracts for  
new gas engines and thrusters along with 
further auto-crossing system product sales.
Within the naval business a landmark 
contract was signed to supply the US 
coastguard’s largest shipbuilding 
programme, initially covering up to 11 
vessels with a range of propulsion and 
related technologies. In addition, the MT30 
gas turbine continued to demonstrate its 
attractiveness as a naval engine choice  
with its selection by the Republic of  
Korea for three Daegu type frigates. 
Work continued with a number of 
customers who had previously selected  
the MT30 including factory acceptance 
testing with the Italian Navy’s landing 
helicopter dock vessel and in the UK  
both on the Royal Navy’s Type 26 frigate 
programme and the two new aircraft 
carriers. HMS Queen Elizabeth completed 
successful sea trials and preparation for  
the first run of the HMS Prince of Wales 
power plants is scheduled for 2018.  
The team also announced a concept 
autonomous defence vessel capable  
of a range of single role naval missions, 
drawing on the expertise across power  
and propulsion and autonomous tools.
The main operational focus across the 
Marine business was the continued effort  
to reduce fixed costs to help mitigate the 
impact of the weaker offshore market.  
The restructuring programme announced 
in November 2016 achieved its target  
of £45-50m of annualised cost savings.  
This was helped during the year through 
further rationalisation of back office 
functions, together with the closure  
of the Shanghai assembly facility. 
Investment of around £20m in the year  
was made in a state-of-the-art production 
and test facility in Rauma, Finland, which 
will deliver significant capabilities for what  
is a growing market opportunity. 
The Marine business has also sought  
to capitalise on the broader shift from 
mechanical to electrical and digital 
technologies, both within its existing product 
range and also through investment in 
opportunities for integrated ship systems 
and remote or autonomous vessels. The 
launch of a new energy management 
solution and the first ever Marine availability-
based contract reflects the growing potential 
in this area. Third-party funding was secured 
to support R&D for land-based control 
centres and a fleet management centre  
was established for remote optimisation  
of ship operations. Rolls-Royce successfully 
demonstrated this new technology by 
partnering with global towage operator, 
Svitzer, including the first trial of a remotely 
operated commercial vessel that took place 
in Copenhagen harbour.

Operating environment 
Rolls-Royce key differentiators
Marine is a leading provider of mission-critical solutions for  
the commercial and naval maritime markets, a position built  
on unique domain knowledge, continuous leadership in maritime 
innovation and digital solutions that allow close partnership with 
our customers globally across a broad range of ship types.
Market dynamics
 — Marine operates in three key markets: merchant, offshore  
and naval. Growth within these markets is fundamentally  
driven by GDP, trade, oil price and defence spending.
 — Naval budgets and naval shipbuilding are growing across 
target countries. The US market is stable and remains the 
largest market, although Asian markets are growing strongly.
 — The offshore market broadly continues to be challenging 
linked to significant oversupply in several vessel segments  
and financial constraints within the customer base.
 — Opportunities continue to be exploited in stable markets 
including naval, passenger, and tugs where we have also  
seen growth in interest in autonomous solutions.
 — Key competitors continue to seek internal cost savings,  
whilst developing electrical and digital offerings. 
Opportunities
 — Historically cyclical marine markets are expected to recover 
across the range of merchant and offshore segments,  
but with a new focus on efficiency and cost.
 — Continued trend towards hybrid/full-electric propulsion  
and integrated electric systems with increased adoption  
of energy storage solutions.
 — Increasing interest from vessel owners in remote and 
autonomous solutions, which Rolls-Royce is pioneering,  
to improve performance, reduce cost and increase safety.
 — Increasing evidence of suppliers partnering with vessel 
operators to deliver digital solutions to create greater 
availability and reduce operational risks.
 Business risks
 — If offshore exploration and production expenditure remains 
low, then there will be sustained pressure and further delay  
in market recovery for both new build and aftermarket.
 — If competitors react to a depressed market by pricing 
aggressively on new equipment to protect future aftermarket 
revenue, then Marine could experience further pressure  
on near-term margins.
 — If continuing market downturn leaves key customers, suppliers 
and competitors exposed to strain, then there could be further 
consolidation impacting the competitive landscape. 
 — If market shifts in technology (e.g. electrification and 
digitalisation) proceed at a faster rate than expected, then the 
business may not be positioned to take full advantage of this 
potential growth.

Business Review
Overview 2017 
Nuclear plays a key role in the UK’s 
submarine programme, acting as the 
technical authority, sole supplier and 
provider of through-life support for all 
submarine nuclear propulsion systems 
(representing over 75% of sales). This year, 
work principally focused on the Astute  
and Dreadnought classes, with significant 
progress made in operational and  
delivery performance as part of a  
multi-year improvement programme  
and increased investment in the Derby 
manufacturing facilities.
The civil nuclear business achieved key 
milestones on large retrofit contracts for 
safety-critical control systems in Finland 
and France. Service contracts were signed 
with nuclear utility customers across 
Europe, Canada and China while additional 
investment was made into the small modular 
reactor (SMR) programme where the UK 
Government announced a viability study 
covering a number of technologies.
Financial overview 
Underlying revenue 
Underlying revenue rose by 4% driven 
mainly by increased production activity  
in support of the Dreadnought class build 
programme, together with greater activity 
in civil nuclear new build contracts and 
field services. Submarine revenue grew  
3% to £633m, while civil nuclear revenue  
grew 9% to £185m. There was a strong 
second half performance, reflecting 
phasing within the submarine programmes.
Underlying operating profit 
Gross margin was broadly flat, reflecting  
a combination of increased activity offset 
by additional costs incurred to ensure 
higher levels of delivery performance for 
the key submarine programmes. The R&D 
charge was £17m higher than 2016 as the 
SMR programme moved to concept design 
activity and did not benefit from the one-off 
change in treatment of R&D credits  
(2016: £7m credit). As a result, underlying 
operating profit was £38m, £7m lower than 
the previous year.
Operational and  
strategic review
The Nuclear business focused on improving 
cost-control, sustainable quality and on-time 
delivery for the key submarine programmes. 
As part of an overall regeneration of the 
submarine business capability, a significant 
number of new manufacturing technologies 
and systems were introduced. These have 
helped to drive significant improvements  
in delivery of reactor plant components  
into the Astute programme.
Investment was made into new 
manufacturing facilities, people and 
infrastructure at Derby. This includes  
a planned expansion of the primary 
component operations factory, principally  
in support of the new Dreadnought 
programme, where production work is 
increasing in support of the build 
programme. The expanded facilities will  
help develop and manufacture the new 
generation PWR3 reactor plant as well  
as support the current submarine fleet.
In addition, the contract to deliver the 
nuclear propulsion system for HMS 
Agamemnon, the sixth of the new Astute 
class submarines was signed during the year. 
Steady progress was also made towards  
the establishment of a delivery alliance  
for the Dreadnought class which should 
provide greater programme and cost control 
benefits to help meet the affordability 
challenges for our MoD customer.
The civil nuclear business saw good growth 
during the year and is well positioned  
on new build projects. In the UK, activity  
was centred on Hinkley Point C, with a 
number of projects underway including  
the successful completion of the early 
contractor involvement (ECI) phase for the 
design of heat exchangers. We also signed 
the main contract to complete detailed 
design work and begin manufacturing and 
equipment delivery. There was progress  
on the supply and delivery of both waste 
treatments systems and ultimate diesel 
generators under similar ECI arrangements. 
Internationally, the civil nuclear business 
achieved key milestones on schedule, as 
part of its long-term contracts to retrofit 
and upgrade safety-critical control systems 
at Loviisa, Finland and for EDF’s fleet of 
nuclear reactors in France. The business 
renewed a contract with EDF to provide 
long-term support and secured a contract 
for the partial modernisation of safety-
critical control systems on all 34 units of  
its 900MW French fleet. 
At Fennovoima’s new build plant at 
Hanhikivi, Finland, due for completion  
in 2024, the business was selected as 
preferred bidder to supply instrumentation 
and controls. The business strengthened  
its position in China with new commercial 
agreements signed with CTEC (CGN) and 
secured orders for the current new build 
programme at Tianwan 5 and 6. In Canada, 
the contract with Bruce Power to help 
improve through-life operational efficiency 
will utilise cutting-edge digital analytical  
tools developed from innovations in the  
business and based on capability within  
Civil Aerospace.
Rolls-Royce welcomed the UK Government’s 
decision to set up an expert finance panel to 
assess the viability of technology options 
including short-term deployable SMRs  
and will participate in this review in 2018.  
The announcement in November of a 
technical feasibility study with state-owned 
Jordan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) 
for the construction of a Rolls-Royce  
SMR highlights the international potential, 
including growing interest from major 
markets in the Commonwealth and  
Middle East.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Operating environment 
Rolls-Royce key differentiators
Over a 50-year period, Rolls-Royce has developed unique, leading 
technology capabilities in the defence nuclear market, and is the 
only company to provide the nuclear propulsion for the UK 
submarines programme. In the civil nuclear market, Nuclear 
deploys its offerings globally in partnership with customers across 
the nuclear lifecycle.
Market dynamics
 — Population growth and improved living standards in emerging 
markets are driving a rise in demand for electricity; within the 
future energy mix, low-carbon energy is expected to increase, 
with nuclear energy accounting for a significant share.
 — The competitive landscape has been changing in the last  
12 months with some OE manufacturers facing significant 
financial difficulty along with programme delays and predicted 
overspends; aspirations for SMRs places the business in direct 
competition with large reactor vendors. 
 — Internationally, the Chinese and Russian reactor vendors are 
leading the export market, in part due to their ability to 
provide full or partial funding to the operating nation.
 — Rolls-Royce is the sole custodian of a unique strategic national 
capability providing nuclear propulsion for UK submarines – 
Nuclear is therefore restricted from any other defence market.
 — The UK submarine market expands and contracts in line  
with the MoD’s acquisition programme. The business operates 
in a partnership model with Babcock and BAE Systems.
Opportunities
 — For large civil nuclear reactor new build in the UK, Nuclear  
is well positioned with opportunities for engineering and 
supply chain offerings.
 — SMRs provide a complementary alternative to large  
nuclear power installations for the global market.
 — Capturing a higher share of the nuclear services market 
through extension of services to a larger geographic reach.
 — Exploiting digital technology to optimise reactor plant 
operation and maintenance, thereby maximising the  
business’ ability to access commercial incentives.
 — Strengthening the position Nuclear has in the rapidly  
growing importance of the Chinese and Russian domestic  
and export markets.
Business risks
 — If we experience a major product failure in service, then  
this could result in loss of life and significant damage to  
our reputation.
 — If the pool of suitably qualified and experienced personnel  
is insufficient to support all elements of future programmes, 
then we may not have the ability to deliver to customer 
requirements.
 — If public sentiment turns against further reliance on nuclear 
power, then there will be less support for the development  
of new and existing capabilities and markets would be  
greatly reduced. 
 — If political tensions prevent trade or co-operation with  
state-owned potential partner organisations, then access  
to anticipated nuclear opportunities in the UK and overseas  
may not be available.
 — If the products which we offer are not affordable to customers 
or are not delivering the required effect, then demand for  
the products on offer may be greatly reduced.
 — If there is a continued lack of clarity regarding governments’ 
long-term energy strategies, then continued investment in 
technology such as SMRs may be questioned.
ROLLS-ROYCE PARTNERS TO DELIVER SMRs
In 2017, Rolls-Royce announced it had teamed up with leading 
UK industrial engineering organisations with a track record  
of delivery – including Arup, Laing O’Rourke and Nuvia –  
to champion the potential of SMRs to meet the UK’s energy 
needs. Together the partners in this consortium believe that 
SMRs represent a unique opportunity for the UK to become  
a global leader in innovative nuclear technologies, creating  
up to 40,000 highly skilled jobs, opening up valuable export 
markets and producing energy for as low as £60/MWh – 
competitive against wind and solar. 42

STRATEGIC REPORT
TECHNOLOGY IN ACTION TODA Y – ADV ANCE3 AND ULTRAFAN
Advance3 is the first major new civil aero-engine architecture for Rolls-Royce 
in decades and sets new benchmarks in efficiency, environmental 
performance and precision engineering. The new architecture and advanced 
technologies within Advance3 are required to meet the pace of change within 
the industry and remain on track to meet ACARE’s FlightPath 2050 goals. 
Innovations include lean-burn combustion and new manufacturing and 
material technologies, including 3D printing and ceramic matrix composites. 
Advance3 is central to the UltraFan demonstrator programme, which will add 
power gearbox, composite fan and high-speed turbine technology elements. 
Advance3 will be 20% more fuel efficient than the original Trent 700 engine. 
When combined with UltraFan from 2025, that efficiency saving will extend  
to 25%.
FLEXIBLE POWER – MICRO-GRIDS
Rolls-Royce reciprocating engines are increasingly being integrated with 
multiple power generation assets and storage into micro-grids, able to 
dynamically manage the supply of power and react to fluctuations in 
demand. The rapid start-up, fast increase in output and quick shutdown 
characteristics of MTU engines make them an ideal component of next 
generation micro-grids. Applications include power provision for large 
industrial sites and very remote or rural areas. Micro-grids are increasingly 
being seen as the perfect solution for the problem of providing reliable  
and optimal power.
Advances in manufacturing technologies  
are also helping to improve our operational 
efficiency across the Group through the use 
of 3D printing technologies including 
additive layer manufacturing (ALM); virtual 
design and manufacturing; and robotics. 
Advanced materials remain vital to improving 
weight and performance.
We believe that nuclear technology will  
play a pivotal role in meeting future energy 
demands. Our innovative small modular 
reactor (SMR) design is an economic 
solution for low carbon power. We are 
working in cross-industry collaboration, 
using our extensive experience in the 
nuclear industry, combined with learning 
from the broader Group in digital and 
robotics technologies, to develop this 
solution (see case study on page 41).
Ship intelligence is an important theme in 
our Marine business, developing market-
shifting system solutions, and improving 
safety and efficiency in the industry (see 
case study on page 34).
Our refreshed strategy places much  
greater emphasis on digitalisation and 
electrification as our business gradually 
moves from being a thermo-mechanical  
to a electro-mechanical company. 
Electrification is already core to our Marine 
business where permanent magnet electric 
thrusters, hybrid ships and battery powered 
ferries are indicative of this change. In 
Power Systems, micro-grids are being  
used for peak load balancing or off-grid 
power generation, and hybrid technology  
is also revolutionising the performance  
of regional trains. 
We are now designing, for the first time, 
electrical propulsion systems for aviation 
with civil and defence experimental aircraft 
which can exploit the flexibility in aircraft 
design brought about by the electrification 
of aviation. Our recent announcement on 
the development of a full-scale hybrid 
electric demonstrator, jointly with Airbus 
and Siemens, cements our position  
as a pioneer of this next generation  
of aviation propulsion.
Digital technology impacts everything  
we do. Using data analytics and artificial 
intelligence across design, manufacture  
and services, we are driving production  
in our business, efficiency for customers 
and generating new innovations.
We are at a point of exciting change. 
Technology is driving core products to  
ever higher levels of performance while 
electrification and digitalisation are 
opening market-shifting new opportunities. 44

Sustainability – Environment
Environment 
As a leading industrial technology company, our activities  
have a profound effect on society and the environment. 
We have an irrefutable role in addressing the risks and 
opportunities associated with climate change. 
Our approach
We have a long-standing commitment to reducing the environmental impact of our products, services and manufacturing  
activities. This commitment is embedded within our governance framework, including our operating system and production  
system, and therefore is not a standalone environmental policy. During the year we strengthened our approach to governance  
and risk management in this area by introducing an executive-level environment & sustainability committee. Our environmental 
strategy focuses on three core areas: 
1
Further reducing the 
environmental impact of our 
products and services
2
Developing new technologies 
and capabilities for low emission 
products and services
3
Continually reducing the  
impact of our business 
operations and facilities
1. Products and services
In 2017, over two-thirds of R&D investment  
at Rolls-Royce went into improving the 
environmental performance of our products. 
Together with our supply chain and research 
partnerships, we have delivered products 
that are industry-leading in terms of fuel 
efficiency, emissions and noise. 
Our service capabilities contribute  
to reducing environmental impact by 
maintaining our products to the highest 
standards. Increasingly we are able to repair 
individual engine components, reducing 
the manufacture of new parts and 
minimising customer disruption. 
We are also frequently retro-fitting 
improvements throughout the life of our 
engines. Our global network of service 
provider partners is crucial to this.
TRENT XWB
Our Trent XWB engine is the sixth generation of the Trent engine family  
and is now the most efficient large aero-engine flying today. It delivers  
15% better fuel efficiency than the original Trent engine. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

The transition to a low carbon global 
economy is dependent on the development 
of new technologies and capabilities.  
We are building on our strong engineering 
heritage to produce state-of-the-art 
electro-mechanical and hybrid power 
systems, combined with digital solutions. 
This means building on our existing 
thermo-mechanical products to deliver  
step changes in emissions performance.  
In partnership with our global network  
of University Technology Centres and 
Advanced Manufacturing Research 
Centres, Rolls-Royce is able to apply 
innovations across the product portfolio.

Health and safety
It is with deep regret we report two 
fatalities, in separate incidents, during the 
year. One work-related incident resulted  
in a fatal accident at a customer’s site.  
The other incident was road-traffic related 
and occurred while commuting to work –  
a reportable incident in Germany where  
it occurred.
These tragic incidents reinforce the 
importance of health and safety across all 
that we do and led us to strengthen the 
governance that underpins our HSE policy. 
We conduct thorough investigations into 
actual and potential high-consequence 
incidents and apply lessons learnt across 
our global operations through risk-based 
improvement programmes. 
Our total reportable injury (TRI) rate for  
2017 was 0.55 per 100 employees 
2
. This 
represents a 14% improvement since 2014.  
In 2017, we initiated focused improvement 
plans on areas of the Group with the 
greatest safety challenges. In 2018, we will 
launch a Group-wide programme focusing 
on sites considered to have higher HSE risk 
profiles, to provide a detailed understanding 
of potential HSE risk and required controls. 
Our 2017 headcount
Our global employee distribution continued 
to evolve as we increased production in

STRATEGIC REPORT
During 2017, we invested £31.2m in employee 
learning and development, delivering over  
a million hours of employee training in 
subjects ranging from HSE, quality, product 
safety, export control and ethics.
We provide a variety of channels to 
communicate with and listen to employees 
and their representatives and encourage 
participation and engagement throughout 
the organisation. 
Our annual employee opinion survey helps 
measure the success of these engagement 
activities. More than 30,000 employees  
took part in the survey this year which gave 
a snap-shot of progress against our key 
engagement drivers. We maintained our 
employee engagement score of 75 in 2017, 
the same as in 2016. The survey highlighted 
strengths in company values, ethical 
behaviours, and employee accountability,  
as well as fairness and inclusiveness. Areas 
for improvement identified included prompt 
decision making and establishing priorities.
For more on the Board’s employee 
engagement activities see page 73.
Diversity and inclusion
We believe that having a culture of inclusion 
is the foundation for driving diversity. During 
2017, we made significant progress, however 
diversity continues to be a challenge for 
Rolls-Royce and the engineering sector  
as a whole. 
We have launched a new diversity and 
inclusion strategy and reviewed our  
global diversity and inclusion and  
anti-discrimination policies to ensure all 
employees, regardless of gender, race, 
religion or physical ability are treated  
with respect and are empowered to work 
without fear of bullying or harassment. 
We give full and fair consideration to  
all employment applications from people 
with disabilities and support disabled 
employees, helping them to make the best 
use of their skills, expertise and potential. 
We are recruiting from groups  
under-represented in the engineering 
sector, particularly women, those from 
disadvantaged backgrounds and minority 
ethnic groups. 
We believe it is important to increase  
the number of women at all levels, as well  
as attracting more women and people  
from diverse backgrounds into science, 
technology, engineering and maths (STEM) 
careers. Our work with organisations such 
as Women in Science and Engineering 
seeks to boost our visibility amongst 
potential female employees, and we  
support initiatives such as the Institution  
of Engineering and Technology’s 
‘#9percentisnotenough’ campaign. 
We published our gender pay 
report for the UK in November 
2017. Further details can be  
found on page 94.
Our diversity and inclusion targets
During 2017, we launched a new diversity 
and inclusion strategy with global targets 
to increase female participation at all levels 
of our organisation by 2020. Our employee 
population is currently 15% female. 
Our global targets are supported  
by local targets in key regions where  
there are specific diversity challenges 
associated with ethnicity, nationality  
and age.
We have also introduced a global  
target around inclusiveness, measured  
by a subset of our employee opinion  
survey. We have agreed to improve  
our performance year-on-year for 
questions related to fairness and 
inclusiveness.

SUPPORTING OUR LGBT COLLEAGUES 
We are committed to building an inclusive culture and diverse workforce. PRISM is 
our UK employee resource group (ERG) for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT+) 
people. The PRISM vision is to connect, encourage and develop diverse people to 
drive innovation, attract and promote talent and to support global growth. We have 
14 ERGs globally with a variety of focuses and more planned.
*  In 2016 we reclassified certain joint ventures as joint operations. As a result, 900 employees are listed in our overall headcount, however we do not currently collect diversity 
information for these joint operations, therefore they are omitted from this data. 48

Sustainability – STEM
STEM
A strong pipeline  
of diverse talent and 
experience is critical  
to the future success  
of our business. We are 
committed to inspiring 
the next generation into 
science, technology, 
engineering and maths 
(STEM) careers. 
We recognise the need to engage young 
people in STEM at an early age, enabling 
them to make informed education and  
early career choices. Our education 
outreach and community investment 
programmes particularly focus on activities 
that demonstrate the lifelong opportunities 
that careers in STEM can offer. We are 
actively targeting groups under-represented 
in STEM sectors to attract more people  
from diverse backgrounds. 
Globally we aim to reach six million  
people through our STEM activities and 
programmes by 2020. 1,400 Rolls-Royce 
employees volunteer their time as STEM 
ambassadors, helping us to reach 3.8 
million 
1
 people since 2014. This includes 
one million people in 2017, 48% of whom 
were actively engaged in our programmes. 
We continue to attract high numbers of 
applicants to our graduate and apprentice 
development programmes. These provide  
a pipeline of talent into engineering and 
other functions. 
During 2017, we recruited 313 graduates  
and 339 apprentices worldwide. 74%  
of these graduates joined engineering 
development programmes. 
The proportion of women recruited as 
apprentices in our 2017 intake increased to 
21%, and the proportion of female graduates 
increased to 22%. 
We have agreed a global target to increase 
our female graduate population to 30%  
by 2020 as part of our diversity and 
inclusion strategy. 
MUSKAAN PROJECT, INDIA
The Rolls-Royce Muskaan project aims to increase young peoples’ interest 
in STEM subjects by demonstrating how fun science and maths can be. 
Muskaan, which means ‘smile’ in Hindi, is designed to supplement the 
school’s regular curriculum through guided interactive learning and 
classroom kits dedicated to STEM topics. The project reached more than 
2,100 school children across India in 2017.

SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES 
We are committed to having a positive impact 
in the global and local communities where  
we operate. We focus our engagement 
activities on four key areas: 
 — education and skills, primarily STEM; 
 — arts, culture and heritage; 
 — environment; and 
 — social investment. 
Our activities vary from national programmes, 
such as the Rolls-Royce Science Prize, to local 
activities with schools and community partners 
close to our operations. We encourage our 
people to volunteer their time as part of  
our employee engagement and development 
programmes. 
We believe there is greater impact in lasting 
engagement than one-off cash contributions, 
but do make charitable donations aligned  
to our strategy. During 2017, this included 
one-off donations to the Women in Tech 
Foundation and the Campaign for Science  
& Engineering. 
In total, we invested £7.7m in supporting 
communities in 2017. This includes £4.3m  
in cash contributions and 93,900 hours  
in employee time.

Sustainability – Ethics
STRATEGIC REPORT
Ethics
Who we are and how  
we behave matters  
to our people and our 
stakeholders. We have 
made fundamental 
changes in recent years  
to place ethics and 
compliance at the heart  
of everything we do. 
We have a Global Code of Conduct  
(the Global Code) that applies to all 
employees of Rolls-Royce, its subsidiaries 
and controlled joint ventures, wherever 
they are located. Breaches of the Global 
Code are not acceptable and will result  
in the Company taking action. This may 
include disciplinary action up to and 
including dismissal. In 2017, there were  
65 employees (2016: 38 employees) whose 
employment ended for reasons related  
to breaches of the Global Code.
The Global Code sets out principles that 
underpin our values and the way we do 
business. It also provides guidance on how 
to apply these in everything we do. 100%  
of managers completed a certification 
exercise during the year, confirming their 
commitment to the Global Code. We 
encourage all employees and stakeholders 
to raise ethical questions or concerns, 
without fear of retaliation. For employees, 
we provide four main channels for them to 
speak up, including a 24hr Ethics Line and 
network of 84 local ethics advisers around 
the world.
Anti-bribery and corruption
The Global Code includes clear statements 
regarding our zero-tolerance approach  
to bribery and corruption. 
This year we revised our anti-bribery and 
corruption related policies, standards and 
guidance and brought them together into 
one comprehensive Global Anti-Bribery  
and Corruption Manual. This provides  
a framework for our anti-bribery and 
corruption programme and clearly sets  
out the responsibilities that apply to all 
employees, including requirements to 
conduct due diligence on customers, 
suppliers and other business partners. 
Our anti-bribery due diligence includes 
screenings, interviews and obtaining 
in-depth due diligence reports from 
specialist providers, depending on the level 
of risk that a particular third party presents.
In addition to our all-employee ethics 
training, we have introduced training 
workshops for senior managers and any 
other roles that are likely to be exposed  
to situations where there is a risk of 
attempted bribery and corruption.
Human rights
We remain committed to protecting  
and preserving the human rights of our 
employees, those working in our global 
supply chain, and those who may be 
impacted by our business operations. 
Our commitment to human rights, including 
our position on forced labour, involuntary 
labour, child labour, and human trafficking,  
is outlined in the Global Code, as well as our 
Global Supplier Code of Conduct and Global 
Human Rights policy. We have taken an 
integrated approach to minimising the risk  
of slavery and human trafficking taking  
place in our supply chain or any part of  
our business. Adherence and due diligence 
associated with these policies is embedded 
within our operating system and processes 
across our global functions, including 
human resources, ethics and procurement.
More information on our approach can  
be found in our anti-slavey and human 
trafficking statement, available at  
www.rolls-royce.com. 
Ethics in our supply chain
We spent over £8.7bn in our external supply 
chain in 2017. Our suppliers and partners  
are vital to our success, so we are committed 
to working collaboratively with them to 
maintain the highest ethical standards. 
At the end of 2017, all our suppliers had 
agreed to adhere to our Global Supplier 
Code of Conduct, or a mutually agreed 
alternative. This sets out the minimum 
behaviours and practices we expect our 
suppliers to demonstrate based on our  
own Global Code and related policies, 
including our Global Human Rights  
policy and Global Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption Manual. 
This year, we have introduced further 
monitoring and assessments prioritised  
by the potential level of risk the supplier  
may present. To date, 67% of prioritised 
suppliers have completed a self-assessment 
questionnaire which aims to understand  
how suppliers are adhering to the principles 
set out in the Global Supplier Code of 
Conduct within their own operations.  
We are now working with these suppliers  
to collaboratively agree plans to address any 
gaps that may have been identified as part 
of our supplier management frameworks. 
For more information see  
Safety & Ethics Committee Report, 
pages 104 to 109.
ALL-EMPLOYEE ETHICS TRAINING
Our ethics training programme is designed to bring our Global Code of Conduct  
to life. This year’s all-employee training focused on having conversations about  
its application and its relevance to individual roles. 98% of employees completed  
this activity.  50

Additional Financial Review
7. In 2016, the UK pension schemes were 
restructured resulting in costs of £306m, 
principally a settlement charge on the 
transfer of the Vickers Group Pension 
Scheme to an insurance company.
Financing and taxation
8. The mark-to-market gain on the Group’s 
hedge book of £2,648m (2016: loss of 
£4,420m). These reflect: the large hedge 
book held by the Group (circa USD 
$38.5bn); and the strengthening of 
sterling, particularly against the US  
dollar offset by the weakening of  
sterling against the euro, as noted above. 
At each year end, our foreign exchange 
hedge book is included in the balance 
sheet at fair value (mark-to-market) and 
the movement in the year included in 
reported financing costs. 
Appropriate tax rates are applied to these 
additional items included in the reported 
results, leading to an additional tax charge  
of £361m (2016: credit £865m), largely as  
a result of the mark-to-market adjustments 
£(463)m and £792m in 2017 and 2016 
respectively. In addition, £163m of advance 
corporation tax credits has been recognised 
as a result of changes to UK tax laws in 2017.
2. The effects of acquisition accounting 
£129m (2016: £115m) principally relate  
to the amortisation of intangible assets 
arising on the acquisition of Power 
Systems in 2013.
3. The impairment of goodwill, investments, 
PPE and inventory of £24m (2016: £219m). 
In 2017, this includes £12m as a result of 
consolidating a previously unconsolidated 
subsidiary and £12m relating to the Marine 
business. The impairments in 2016 largely 
related to the Marine business as a result 
of the weakness in the oil & gas market.
4. Exceptional restructuring costs of £104m 
(2016: £129m). These are costs associated 
with the substantial closure or exit of  
a site, facility or activity related to the 
significant transformation project that 
the business is currently undertaking.  
A number of the projects within the 
transformation programme are spread 
over several years.
5. The acquisition of ITP Aero resulted in  
a gain of £553m from the revaluation  
of the previous joint venture investment 
and recognition of a bargain purchase  
of £245m. 
6. In 2016, £671m of penalties from 
agreements with investigating bodies 
were recognised. 
The changes in 2017 resulting from 
underlying trading are described on page 18.
Consistent with past practice and IFRS,  
we provide both reported and underlying 
figures. As the Group does not hedge 
account in accordance with IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments, we believe underlying figures 
are more representative of the trading 
performance by excluding the impact  
of year-end mark-to-market adjustments.  
In particular, the USD:GBP hedge book has  
had a significant impact on the reported 
results in 2017 as the USD:GBP rate has risen 
from 1.23 to 1.35 and the EUR:GBP has fallen 
from 1.17 to 1.13. The adjustments between 
the underlying income statement and the 
reported income statement are set out  
in note 2 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. This basis of presentation has 
been applied consistently. 
The most significant items included in  
the reported income statement, but not  
in underlying are summarised below. 
Profit before financing
1. The impact of measuring revenue  
and costs at spot rates rather than  
rates achieved on hedging transactions 
increased revenue by £1,217m  
(2016: £1,172m) and increased profit 
before financing by £345m  
(2016: increased £570m).

Strategic Report
Additional Financial Review
STRATEGIC REPORT
net funds outflow in ITP Aero was £14m; 
excluding the impact of ITP Aero, free cash 
flow would have been £273m. 
In addition, the consolidation of MTU Brazil 
for the first time resulted in the recognition 
of net debt of £17m.
Payment of financial penalties
Following the agreements reached with 
investigating authorities in January 2017, 
£286m of penalties were paid in the UK, US 
and Brazil. Further UK payments of £378m 
(plus interest) will be made in 2019-2021.
Pensions
Cash contributions reduced by £22m to 
£249m, split evenly between the UK and 
overseas. The UK contributions are net  
of a refund of £5m from a wound-up 
scheme. The UK pension cost increased  
by £21m in 2017, largely due to changes  
in discount rates which determine the 
accounting charge.
Shareholder payments
The change in shareholder payments 
reflects the difference between the 2015 
and 2016 payments, which are paid in the 
following year.
Acquisitions and disposals
The consideration for ITP Aero is payable  
in eight quarterly instalments from January 
2018, no payments were made in 2017.  
The deferred consideration can be settled 
in cash or Rolls-Royce Holdings plc shares, 
at the discretion of Rolls-Royce with a 3% 
premium to be applied if the consideration 
is in shares. The net funds of ITP Aero on 
acquisition were £229m. From the date  
of acquisition to 31 December 2017, the  
Movement in working capital
The main drivers of the £546m cash inflow 
from a fall in working capital were increased 
receipts from airframers in advance of 
discounts payable to the operator (£460m) 
in Civil Aerospace together with an 
increase in payables (£120m) but partly 
offset by increased inventory (£330m),  
all linked with the ramp-up of our newer 
programmes. Other significant contributors 
to the working capital reduction were 
improved receivables and deposits (£90m) 
in Power Systems and the Aviall distribution 
agreement in Defence Aerospace (£120m) 
and associated reduced inventory.
Expenditure on property, plant  
and equipment and intangibles
The major increases are due to: investment 
in Civil Aerospace operations and 
manufacturing assembly and test facilities  
as well as increases to the aero-engine fleet 
to support the growing installed fleet; and 
increased capitalisation of development 
costs in the Civil Aerospace business, 
reflecting the stage of the new programmes.

The acquisition of ITP Aero has had a 
significant impact on the shape of our 
balance sheet which is described below. 
Other key changes are as follows:
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets (page 142) increased by 
£566m. Additions of £973m (including 
£160m of certification and participation 
fees, £342m of development costs,  
£286m of contractual aftermarket rights 
and software of £135m) were offset by 
amortisation of £430m. 
The carrying values of the intangible  
assets are assessed for impairment against 
the present value of forecast cash flows 
generated by the intangible asset.  
The principal risks remain: reductions in 
assumed market share; programme timings; 
increases in unit cost assumptions; and 
adverse movements in discount rates.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment (page 144) 
increased by £242m. Additions of £764m 
were offset by depreciation of £444m. 
Additions included an increase to the size 
of the Civil Aerospace engine pool (£136m) 
driven by fleet support for new 
programmes, investment in industrial 
footprint consolidation (£109m) and in 
manufacturing assembly and test (£68m). 
Investments in joint ventures  
and associates 
Investments in joint ventures and associates 
increased by £48m. The main movements 
were: additions of £48m, including £28m of 
investment in joint ventures that finance some 
of the Civil Aerospace spare engine pool; the 
Group’s share of retained profit of £52m; 
offset by £44m of exchange differences.
Net funds
Movements in net funds are shown on  
page 51.
Net working capital
Net working capital reduced by £321m. As 
well as the cash impact of £546m described 
above, the movement reflects the payment 
of penalties of £286m. The remaining 
movements are primarily driven by 
movements in foreign exchange rates.
Provisions 
Provisions largely relate to warranties and 
guarantees provided to secure the sale  
of OE and services. The increase of £56m 
includes a provision for tax interest and 
penalties that was previously included in 
current tax liabilities but reclassified due  
to guidance issued by the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC).
Net post-retirement  
scheme surpluses 
Net post-retirement scheme surpluses 
(page 159) have increased by £767m. 
In the UK (increase in surplus of £772m), 
changes in actuarial estimates reduced the 
value of the obligations £515m, principally 
due to: (i) inclusion of the latest mortality 
tables; and (ii) the reflection of actual 
experience as part of the 2017 funding 
valuation. In addition, there were returns  
(in excess of those assumed) on the scheme 
assets of £265m. 
The position overseas has remained broadly 
stable, with in the impact of reduced 
discount rates in Germany and the US being 
offset by other actuarial gains in the US.
Net financial assets and liabilities 
Net financial assets and liabilities principally 
relate to the fair value of foreign exchange, 
commodity and interest rate contracts,  
set out in detail on page 150. All contracts 
continue to be held for hedging purposes. 
The fair value of foreign exchange 
derivatives is a net financial liability of 
£2.3bn, a reduction of £3.2bn in the year, 
mainly a result of the strengthening of 
sterling against the US dollar. 
US$ hedge book
The US$ hedge book increased by 2% to 
US$38.5bn. This represents around six years 
of net exposure and has an average book 
rate of £1 to US$1.55.
Net TotalCare assets
Net TotalCare assets relate to long-term 
service agreement (LTSA) contracts in the 
Civil Aerospace business, including the 
flagship services product TotalCare. These 
assets represent the timing difference 
between the recognition of income and 
costs in the income statement and cash 
receipts and payments.
Impact of the acquisition  
of ITP Aero
The acquired net assets of ITP Aero are 
shown on page 167. The most significant 
intangible assets acquired relate to 
customer relationships, to technology, 
patents and licences and to in-process 
development. In addition, working capital 
includes an accrual of £648m for the 
deferred consideration to be paid in 2018 
and 2019. The deferred consideration can 
be settled in cash or Rolls-Royce Holdings 
plc shares, at the discretion of Rolls-Royce 
with a 3% premium to be applied if the 
consideration is in shares.  Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

Strategic Report
Additional Financial Review
STRATEGIC REPORT
Service revenue from our regional jet 
engines declined 5%, reflecting further 
retirements and reduced utilisation of  
our fleets by North American operators  
in particular.
On the V2500 programme, which powers 
aircraft including the Airbus A320,  
revenue from OE modules declined 13% as 
production slowed down further as Airbus 
transitions to the A320neo, powered by  
a competitor engine provider. However, 
V2500 service revenues of £709m increased 
by 13% driven by an increased number  
of overhauls with increased workscope.  
The contractual payment from International 
Aero Engines based on flying hours was 
broadly stable, with a reduction in flying 
hours flowing from retirements of some 
older aircraft being mitigated by  
price escalation.
The 15% growth in large engine service 
revenue reflected a 22% increase in invoiced 
TotalCare flying hours from the growing 
in-production engine fleet which more than 
offset the 12% flying hour reduction from 
mature engine types as older aircraft retired 
or where customers selected alternative 
service offerings on transitions. Higher 
volumes of spare part sales for RB211-535 
and Trent 700 engines for time and material 
overhauls and for TotalCare engines, where 
not covered by the flying hour payments, 
also contributed to the revenue increase. 
Revenue from business aviation OE engine 
sales declined for a second year, with a fall  
in unit volumes of 32%, mostly BR710’s, 
reflecting continued weakness at the higher 
end of the market coupled with the effect  
of the transition to newer non Rolls-Royce 
powered platforms. Volumes of the newer 
BR725 engine, which powers the Gulfstream 
G650 and G650ER, remained broadly stable. 
Overall, although business aviation OE 
revenues declined 26%, service revenue 
increased by 10% reflecting continued fleet 
expansion, increased CorporateCare 
penetration and price escalation.
Revenue
Overall, underlying revenue for Civil 
Aerospace rose 12% to £8.0bn, with OE 
revenue of £3.8bn (2016: £3.4bn) up 12% and 
services revenue of £4.2bn (2016: £3.7bn)  
also up 12%. The rise in OE revenue reflected 
record levels of widebody engine deliveries, 
with growth in Trent XWB-84 engine sales,  
to support the Airbus A350 XWB programme 
ramp-up, a significant contributor.
OE revenue from large engine: linked and 
other was up 18% reflecting increased 
volumes of Trent 700 engines following a 
relatively low year in 2016 in which a higher 
proportion of A330s built were powered by 
competitor engines, combined with higher 
deliveries of Trent 900 engines for A380s  
for Emirates. Sales of spare engines to joint 
ventures, included in large engine: linked 
and other, generated revenue of £362m 
(2016: £288m).
OE revenue from large engine: unlinked 
installed increased 49%, driven by 
improved pricing and higher volumes  
of Trent XWB-84 engines.

£114m (2016: £55m) of the total £148m impact 
(2016: £98m).
The overall benefit in 2017 from other 
operational changes was £17m (2016: £64m 
charge). This comprised a £60m charge 
driven by changes in the utilisation pattern 
of several customers’ Trent 700, Trent 800 
and RB211 fleets, offset by a £77m benefit 
taken in the first half arising from a change 
to a customer credit rating risk assessment.

The CARs balance increased by £230m

and engine unit cost improvements.

in-service fleet has evolved over the year,  
we have increased our estimates for future 
costs associated with part life limitations, 
particularly in relation to compressor  
rotor blades within the Trent 1000 and  
high-pressure turbine blades within the 
Trent 900. The resulting contract accounting

STRATEGIC REPORT
IFRS 15 overview
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers (effective from 1 January 2018) 
replaces the separate models for goods, 
services and construction contracts 
currently included in IAS 11 Construction 
Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue. The Group 
will present its 2018 results, including 2017 
comparatives, on an IFRS 15 basis.
IFRS 15 impact
The impact of IFRS 15 on the 2017 underlying 
results is shown in the tables on this page 
with further information provided in notes 1 
and 27 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The cumulative impact on net 
assets as at 31 December 2017 is £(5.2)bn.
As processes and procedures are further 
embedded during 2018, it is possible that 
some changes to the impact may result. The 
adoption of IFRS 15 has had a significant 
impact on the measurement and the timing 
of recognition of revenue, most particularly 
in the Civil Aerospace business. It has no 
impact on the timing or measurement of  
the reported cash flows. 
The key impacts of adopting IFRS 15 on  
our Civil Aerospace business are:
 — generally, our contracts with airframers  
for OE and with operators for aftermarket 
services will not be linked;
 — revenue for OE will be recorded at the 
net amount of consideration receivable 
with any profit or loss on sale, after 
recognition of the costs of producing  
the OE, recorded on delivery; and
 — revenue on LTSAs will be recognised  
as services are performed rather than  
as the equipment is used as is frequently 
the case under the current accounting 
policy. The stage of completion will be 
measured using the actual costs incurred 
to date compared to the estimated costs 
to complete the performance obligation. 
As we are generally paid on a monthly 
basis as engine flying hours occur, whilst 
overhaul and repair activities happen 
periodically over the term of the LTSA, 
the recognition of revenue and profit  
will generally be deferred compared  
to the current accounting policy and  
to cash receipts.
In addition, the overall net impact on 
operating profit of the adoption of IFRS 15 
within the Defence Aerospace business was 
£4m. This comprised a £34m LTSA margin 
impact which is broadly expected to recur 
in the short term, but was offset by a £30m 
favourable timing benefit from a spares 
distribution contract, which is not expected 
to repeat in 2018.

The following tables provide more detail  
on the impact of adopting IFRS 15 in Civil 
Aerospace. We have provided additional 
information about this business here as  
it is most significantly impacted by IFRS 15. 
A more detailed analysis of the impact of 
adopting IFRS 15 on the other segments  
are set out in note 27 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
The adoption of IFRS 15 reduces Civil 
Aerospace underlying revenue and 
underlying operating profit by £1,410m  
and £850m respectively.
Underlying OE revenue reduces by  
£913m, primarily from de-linking the OE  
and service contracts and no longer 
capitalising cash deficits. In addition, 
participation fees paid to airframers are 
treated as a reduction to revenue where 
previously presented as a cost.

accounting service revenue is recognised 
on an engine flying hour basis, i.e. as  
the engines are being used by the airline 
operators. The move to recognising 
revenue on an activity basis (i.e. when  
Civil Aerospace performs the repairs, 
maintenance and overhauls) changes  
the point at which revenue is recognised.  
This change will typically delay the point  
at which revenue is recognised under  
IFRS 15 when compared with the treatment 
under current accounting and as a result 
lowers service revenues due to the 
relatively young age of the fleet with many 
engines yet to reach their first overhaul.
The nature of the change is the same  
for CorporateCare service packages in 
business aviation. For business jet engines 
the timing impact may be more pronounced 
than for large engines as business jet 
engines are often on wing for many years 
before requiring an initial overhaul.
Underlying service revenue reduces by 
£497m. This reduction is driven by: a timing 
change to revenue recognition on TotalCare 
and CorporateCare long-term contracts 
where stage of completion has been 
amended from a flying hours basis to a cost 
incurred or ‘input’ basis; the de-linking of OE 
and services contracts; and classification of 
operator guarantee payments as a reduction 
to revenue under IFRS 15 where classified as 
costs under current accounting. 
Underlying revenue by market 
segmentation under IFRS 15
The most significant changes to Civil 
Aerospace revenue from the adoption  
of IFRS 15 relate to large engine OE and 
long-term service contract revenue for 
both large and business aviation engines.

lower under IFRS 15. Under current  Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

STRATEGIC REPORT
On the other hand, the contract margin 
adjustment associated with technical costs 
will be £50m lower under IFRS 15. 
The benefit from other operational changes 
totalled £17m in 2017 under current 
accounting. This included a £77m benefit 
arising from a change to a customer credit 
rating risk assessment on a linked contract 
where under IFRS 15, with no linkage, there 
is no benefit in the year.
as to the number of units over which the 
receipts will be allocated.
The most significant change is to the  
net contract balance. Other than the 
reclassification of participation fees and  
the transition from revenue recognition on 
an engine flying hours to a cost input basis, 
the adjustment also represents £(3.2)bn of 
reversal of profit from contract linkage.  
The majority of service contracts are on 
monthly payment terms based on engine 
flying hours. As a result, in many cases we 
will receive cash in advance of incurring 
costs to support the contract including for 
overhauls. Under IFRS 15 we will recognise 
the revenue as costs are incurred, changing 
the net contract debtor under current  
GAAP to a net deferred revenue creditor 
under IFRS 15. 
between the completion percentage  
under IFRS 15 and current accounting will 
be greater. This is because the linked OE 
revenue is no longer included in assessing 
the stage of completion. This change in  
the way the percentage of completion is 
calculated will impact the level of contract 
accounting benefit recognised under 
current accounting in respect of beneficial 
lifecycle cost margin adjustments by £(96)m 
from £113m under current accounting  
to £17m under IFRS 15.
Under IFRS 15 we regard participation  
fees as payments to customers that are  
offset against future revenue from those 
customers. Therefore, they are recognised  
as contract assets rather than as intangible 
assets under current accounting.
In assessing the accounting for the 
participation fee payments we make to  
our OE customers, we have also assessed 
the accounting for up-front payments  
we sometimes receive from the Group’s 
suppliers under RRSAs to allow them to 
participate in an engine programme.  
We have concluded that, consistent  
with changes to how we will account for 
participation fees noted above, these 
receipts should be deferred and recognised 
against cost of sales over the period of 
supply. This will also require judgement  
Contract accounting adjustments 
under IFRS 15 
Under current accounting, the stage of 
completion of long-term service contracts is 
assessed based on flying hours. As set out 
on page 55, this means that the percentage 
of completion will usually be lower under 
IFRS 15 than under current accounting.  
For linked OE and service contracts, the 
stage of completion takes into account  
both OE and flying hour revenue. The 
consequence of this linkage with the 
services contract means that the difference

The transition to IFRS 15 requires  
de-recognition of the contractual aftermarket 
rights recorded as intangible assets under 
current accounting. As this cost will now  
be recorded at the point of sale of OE the 
amortisation previously recorded will cease 
benefiting the gross profit reported on 
underlying services revenue.

(around £450m including ITP Aero). Free cash flow should improve to around £450m 
excluding ITP Aero, (around £400m including ITP Aero). We are making solid progress  
with longer-term solutions for Trent 1000 and Trent 900 in-service issues, largely through 
re-designing affected parts, and we expect these to be fully embodied on the Trent 1000 
fleet by 2022. On the Trent 900, an extended life turbine blade is already being rolled-out 
with further re-designs available from 2020. Based on our current estimates, in 2018 the 
anticipated annual cash impact is expected to broadly double and reach a peak. It is then 
expected to fall by around £100m in 2019. The majority of this work will be undertaken in 
2018 and 2019 and is not expected to complete until 2022. All of these costs are included 
in our cash flow guidance for 2018 and beyond.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Principal Risks
Risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
risk management system (RMS) and internal 
control systems. 
Our RMS is designed to identify and 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk  
of failure to achieve business objectives 
and to provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
We continue to build risk management  
into the way we work to help us to make 
better decisions. It is implemented through 
a mandated Group-wide risk management 
policy, including our process, software tools 
and governance structures. Our risk policy 
is supported by training and a team of 
experts. Businesses and functions are 
accountable for identifying and managing 
risks in line with this policy. 
Business continuity plans are in place  
to mitigate continuity risks and there  
has continued to be regular testing of  
the adequacy of these plans through 
exercises at every level of our incident 
management framework. 
Joint ventures constitute a large part of  
the Group’s activities. Responsibility for risk 
and internal controls in joint ventures lies 
with the managers of those operations.  
We seek to exert influence over such joint 
ventures through board representation. 
Management and internal audit regularly 
review the activities of these joint ventures. 
Improving our RMS
We have continued to enhance our RMS  
in 2017, including:
 — updating our risk policy and actively 
communicating it to our employees; 
 — embedding risk assessment as part of key 
decision-making activities e.g. allocating 
capital investment;
 — focusing on analysing root causes of risks 
or incidents and developing standard 
approaches for managing common risks;
 — improving our risk appetite framework;
 — conducting progressively more 
challenging crisis management team 
exercises based on our principal risks;
 — strengthening our risk assurance 
capability to improve alignment of risk, 
control and assurance activities; and
 — rolling out our risk visualisation tool into 
the businesses and functions to bring risk 
discussions to life and help management 
to focus on the most important risks.
In 2018, we will look to build on these 
improvements and continue to integrate 
risk management into the culture change 
and transformation programmes and key 
decision-making activities.
Principal risks
Our RMS is designed so that principal risks 
can be identified from multiple sources. Key 
bottom-up risks are identified by businesses 
and functions and the detail of risks that 
meet the Group threshold are subject to 
review and challenge by the ELT and the 
Board during their risk reviews.
The Board, assisted by the ELT, has carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including undertaking a 
deep dive into each risk. Deep dives allow 
the Board to assess the effectiveness of 
management and mitigation of the risk, 
including consideration of the effectiveness 
of material internal controls. These reviews 
are supported by the ELT risk committee 
conducting in-depth reviews of related 
bottom-up key risks and the actions and 
controls in place to manage them. 
Changes in principal risks
These ongoing reviews of risks and 
understanding of potential root causes  
has resulted in changes to the following 
principal risks compared to last year.
Major product programme delivery 
Since last year, the level of risk for the major 
product programme delivery principal risk 
has increased. This is due to in-service issues 
that we have experienced with our Trent 
1000 and Trent 900 engines (see page 24) 
and the resources required to mitigate the 
impact of these issues on our customers.  
The change in risk level also reflects the 
importance that successful delivery of major 
programmes has in generating cash to fund 
our refreshed strategy.
Product safety
As the Group continues to transform,  
the product failure principal risk has been 
re-defined and focuses specifically on  
the product safety aspects to ensure that 
ownership of this risk is clearly aligned  
to the changes in our engineering and 
technology functions – see page 42.
Political risk
Our Brexit steering group has continued  
to assess potential impacts of leaving the 
EU, including uncertainties related to our 
principal risks. We have briefed the UK 
Government and other governments on  
our Brexit-related issues and have made 
representations through our trade 
association memberships. 
While we wait for political certainty from  
the Brexit negotiations and details of the 
final Brexit deal, we have assessed potential 
additional operational impacts to understand 
what action Rolls-Royce might need to take 
before Brexit occurs in 2019. 
We could be impacted through a number 
of routes. For example: our regulatory 
relationship with the EU (European  
Aviation Safety Agency; REACH chemical 
certification programme); our operational 
relationship (customs union and movement 
of people); our tax and treasury strategy; 
our EU R&T funding relationship and other 
interfaces. We are managing these risks 
through our operational assessment and 
applying our business continuity risk 
management process to Brexit.

Failure to deliver a major 
programme on time, within 
budget, to specification, or 
technical performance falling 
significantly short of customer 
expectations, or not delivering  
the planned business benefits, 
would have potentially  
significant adverse financial  
and reputational consequences, 
including the risk of impairment 
of the carrying value of the 
Group’s intangible assets and  
the impact of potential litigation.

Market and financial shock
The Group is exposed to a 
number of market risks, some of 
which are of a macro-economic 
nature (e.g. foreign currency, oil 
price, rates) and some of which 
are more specific to the Group 
(e.g. liquidity and credit risks, 
reduction in air travel or 
disruption to other customer 
operations). Significant 
extraneous market events  
could also materially damage  
the Group’s competitiveness  
and/or creditworthiness.
This would affect operational 
results or the outcomes of  
financial transactions.
 — Maintaining a strong balance sheet, through managing cash 
balances and debt levels – see page 19.
 — Providing financial flexibility by maintaining high levels of 
liquidity and an investment grade credit rating.
 — Sustaining a balanced portfolio through earning revenue both 
from the sale of original equipment and aftermarket services, 
providing a broad product range and addressing diverse 
markets that have differing business cycles – see page 11.
 — Deciding where and what currencies to source in, and where 
and how much credit risk is extended or taken. The Group  
has a number of treasury policies that are designed to hedge 
residual risks using financial derivatives (foreign exchange, 
interest rates and commodity price risk).

Strategic Report
Going Concern and Viability Statements
STRATEGIC REPORT
Going Concern and Viability Statements
Introduction
Rolls-Royce operates an annual planning 
process. Our plans and risks to their 
achievement are reviewed by the Board and 
once approved are cascaded throughout  
the Group and are used as the basis for 
monitoring our performance, incentivising 
employees and providing external guidance 
to our shareholders.
The processes for identifying and managing 
the principal risks are described on pages 
59 and 60. As also described there, the  
risk management process, and the going 
concern and viability statements, are 
designed to provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance.
Going concern
The going concern assessment considers 
whether it is appropriate to prepare  
the financial statements on a going  
concern basis.
As described on page 197, the Group meets 
its funding requirements through a mixture 
of shareholders’ funds, bank borrowings, 
bonds and notes. At 31 December 2017, the 
Group had borrowing facilities of £5.4bn and 
total liquidity of £5.1bn, including cash and 
cash equivalents of £3.0bn and undrawn 
facilities of £2.1bn. £82m of the facilities 
mature in 2018.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking 
into account reasonably possible changes  
in trading performance, show that the  
Group has sufficient financial resources.  
The Directors have reasonable expectations 
that the Company and the Group are well 
placed to manage business risks and to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future (which accounting 
standards require to be at least a year  
from the date of this report) and have not 
identified any material uncertainties to the 
Company’s and the Group’s ability to do so.
On the basis described above, the Directors 
consider it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Consolidated 
Financial Statements (in accordance with  
the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting published by the FRC in 
September 2014).
Viability
The viability assessment considers solvency 
and liquidity over a longer period than  
the going concern assessment. Consistent 
with previous years, we have assessed our 
viability over a five-year period. Inevitably, 
the degree of certainty reduces over this 
longer period.
In making the assessment, severe but 
plausible scenarios have been considered 
that estimate the potential impact of the 
principal risks arising over the assessment 
period, for example: the loss of a key 
element of the supply chain; the impact  
on aircraft travel of a global pandemic; 
worsening or new in-service issues on new 
Civil Aerospace programmes (the base cash 
flow forecasts include the estimated future 
costs resulting from Trent 900 and Trent 
1000 in-service issues described on page 
24); or, the impact of a political risk such  
as Brexit on the Group (see page 59  
for further information on the process  
we are taking to manage the risks  
related to Brexit). 
The scenarios assume an appropriate 
management response to the specific event, 
but not broader mitigating actions which 
could be undertaken, which have been 
considered separately. The cash flow impacts 
of these scenarios were overlaid on the 
five-year forecast to assess how the Group’s 
liquidity and solvency would be affected.
The assessment took account of the Group’s 
current funding, forecast requirements  
and existing committed borrowing facilities. 
It assumed that existing facilities could be 
refinanced as they mature. 
On the basis described above, the Board 
confirms that it has a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will be able to continue  
in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the next five years.
In making this statement, the Directors  
have made the following key assumptions:
 — that maturing facilities will be refinanced. 
The Group currently has access to global 
debt markets and expects to be able to 
refinance these facilities on commercially 
acceptable terms. The Group’s medium 
and long-term financing plans are 
designed to allow for periods of adverse 
conditions in world capital markets but 
not a prolonged (e.g. 12 month) period 
where debt markets were effectively 
closed to the Group; 
 — that in the event of one or more risks 
occurring, which has a particularly 
severe effect on the Group, all potential 
actions, such as constraining capital 
spending and reducing or suspending 
payments to shareholders, would be 
taken on a timely basis. The Group 
believes it has the early warning 
mechanisms to identify the need for  
such actions and the ability to implement 
them on a timely basis if necessary; and
 — that implausible scenarios, whether 
involving multiple risks occurring at the 
same time or the impact of individual 
risks occurring that cannot be mitigated 
by management actions to the degree 
assumed, do not occur.

Introduction
As I consider our approach to governance 
at Rolls-Royce, and reflect on the activities 
of the Board during 2017, I am pleased with 
the progress we are making. We have been 
undertaking some interesting and, at times, 
experimental initiatives designed to ensure 
the Board maintains an awareness and 
appreciation of the perspectives of our key 
stakeholder groups as we help to shape  
the Group’s direction and strategy. 
The Board and I were deeply saddened by 
the death of two colleagues in separate 
work-related incidents during the year. 
These tragic events reinforce the importance 
of health and safety across all that we do. 
We were also extremely sad to learn of the 
death of Dame Helen Alexander, a former 
Non-Executive Director of the Company  
and close colleague. Helen will be greatly 
missed by many, and she leaves behind a 
legacy and contribution to the advancement 
of corporate governance, notably in her 
work on the promotion of gender diversity.
In light of the operational challenges  
faced by the Civil Aerospace business,  
the Board remained regularly informed on  
the management of these issues including: 
conflicting demands on resource; the 
handling of impacted customers’ interests; 
and the management of the resultant 
programme risks. As well as briefings from 
the Chief Executive, the Board also heard 
from the President – Civil Aerospace and 
members of his team throughout the year 
with updates on the latest developments. 
Employee engagement
Employees and the Board were deeply 
disappointed by the business conduct that 
led to the announcement in January 2017 
that the Group had entered into deferred 
prosecution agreements (DPAs) with the UK 
Serious Fraud Office and other authorities. 
We have continued to strengthen and 
embed ethics and compliance procedures 
across the Group. Our continuing ethics 
training and Code of Conduct clarify  
the responsibilities which apply to all 
Rolls-Royce employees. The Board remains 
committed to this programme as we believe 
that the right behaviours and culture will 
deliver enhanced long-term performance. 
We encourage an honest, open and direct 
dialogue with our employees and their 
representatives. This led us to introduce 
two new initiatives to strengthen our 
employee engagement programme.  
The Meet the Board event in May was 
tremendously engaging and positively 
received. We also selected Irene Dorner  
as our Board employee champion. Irene  
has taken the lead in strengthening links 
between the Board and our employees,  
who are key stakeholders in the Group’s 
future success. You can read more about 
these initiatives on page 73 and in Irene’s 
introduction opposite.
For more information on employee 
engagement see People on page 46.
Sustainability
Investment in our people and communities 
remains a key priority for the Board. During 
2017, we maintained active graduate and 
apprenticeship development programmes 
and are proactively working to increase  
the number of women at all levels within 
Rolls-Royce. We are engaging with 
communities on an international basis 
through our research partnerships and 
STEM (science, technology, engineering 
and mathematics) programmes. As one of 
the world’s leading industrial technology 
companies, we recognise we have an 
important role in addressing the risks  
and opportunities associated with climate 
change through our engineering expertise 
and operational strategy. See pages 44  
and 45 for further information and pages 
104 to 109 for the Safety & Ethics 
Committee Report.
Board apprentice programme
I am particularly proud that in 2017  
we launched a new Board apprentice 
programme that provides coaching and 
board experience to a diverse group of 
emerging leaders selected from the Group’s 
talent pool, each assigned to a Board or 
executive committee. This direct involvement 
in nurturing leadership talent is proving  
to be very rewarding for all participants,  
as well as serving to support diversity  
and our succession pipeline. See more  
on page 81.
Board developments
We welcomed two new Directors during 
2017, as mentioned in the Nominations  
& Governance Committee Report on  
page 81. Beverly Goulet was appointed  
to the Board in July 2017 and joined the 
Nominations & Governance and Audit 
Committees. Beverly has 24 years’ 
experience in the US airline industry and 
will enhance our customer perspective  
on the Board. To ensure strong executive 
leadership was in place at an important 
juncture for the Group as we refreshed  
our vision and strategy, Stephen Daintith 
joined the Board as Chief Financial Officer 
in April 2017 as previously announced. 
In February 2018 it was announced that 
Nick Luff had been appointed to join the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director with 
effect from the conclusion of the AGM in 
May 2018, subject to shareholder approval.  Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

Directors’ Report
Chairman’s Introduction
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
During the year we renewed the terms of 
appointment for Ruth Cairnie, Lewis Booth 
and Sir Frank Chapman each for a further 
three-year term. In February 2018, we also 
agreed to extend Brad Singer’s initial 
two-year appointment for a further three 
years. All Directors will stand for re-election 
at the AGM in May 2018. The Company and 
Brad Singer are party to a relationship 
agreement with ValueAct (a summary of 
which can be found at www.rolls-royce.com). 
The agreement will expire on 3 May 2018  
but will be replaced with a new agreement 
covering treatment of confidential 
information and conflicts of interest only. 
The Board has a diverse membership with 
varied and balanced experience and skills 
that are highly relevant to the Group’s 
needs and challenges. We recognise that 
the Directors need to remain mindful  
of their duties to consider the interests  
of key stakeholders. We received training 
from the Company Secretary on our  
duties under the Companies Act 2006,  
of particular importance for those Board 
members who do not hold directorships at 
other UK companies, and a useful refresher 
for the other Directors. The Board also 
resolved in December to adopt our Board 
diversity policy which sets a target of a 
minimum of one third of women on the 
Board. See page 82 to read more.
More detail on the changes to the Board  
is set out in the Nominations & Governance 
Committee Report on page 81.
Stakeholder engagement
We set out to actively capture our 
stakeholders’ views in a number of ways this 
year. As well as our employee engagement 
activities, we invited some of our Civil 
Aerospace customers to present to the 
Board and provide their views on what it is 
like to work with Rolls-Royce. The direct and 
open feedback was appreciated and helped 
our understanding of what is working well 
and which areas need more focus. 
We benefit from having Brad Singer on  
the Board. He is able to provide an investor 
perspective drawing on his experience  
as chief operating officer of ValueAct, the 
Group’s largest shareholder. To remain alert 
to the views of our wider shareholder base, 
in March 2017 we held the second of our 
governance events for fund managers and 
governance analysts. We also undertook  
an open and meaningful shareholder 
consultation exercise on our remuneration 
policy, approved with a majority of over 
95% at the AGM in May 2017. 
You can read about our stakeholder 
engagement activities on page 73.
Looking forward
The Board remains strongly committed to 
continuous improvement in governance. 
We actively reviewed and responded to  
the FRC’s consultation to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
Areas we intend to focus on in 2018 include 
Brexit, health and safety, cyber security  
and sustainability. We will be monitoring 
developments in best practice and I look 
forward to continuing a progressive and 
innovative approach to governance in the 
year ahead.

Chairman
meetings and piggy-backed on other events. 
I hosted an online discussion with employees 
that was particularly rewarding because it 
allowed for a free flow of conversation 
across many sites on many subjects.
What has marked all of these events has 
been the openness of our people and their 
willingness to raise issues. Often there  
is simply a real curiosity to understand  
what the Board does, but equally we have 
had open discussions about: connecting  
the Rolls-Royce vision more closely to  
our employees; diversity and inclusion;  
working methods; career development;  
the effectiveness of the employee  
opinion survey; the role of employee 
representatives; transformation; and  
culture and communications.
I have been ably assisted by the formation  
of an employee stakeholder engagement 
group where we can discuss what we have 
learnt and plan our next moves.
I have reported back to the Board and  
continue to have open dialogues with 
various employees around Rolls-Royce  
IRENE DORNER,  
EMPLOYEE CHAMPION 
Experiments are almost always by their very 
nature exciting and kicking off the employee 
champion activities has been no exception.  
I think it is important to get around the 
Group and see as many different cohorts  
of people in order to get a broad range  
of views. This presents challenges in itself 
and we have experimented with a variety  
of events, some more formal than others.  
I have attended dedicated sessions in 
theatre style, gatecrashed already existing 
who have attended a session and have  
been motivated to take action on an issue 
which has particularly engaged them.
Future plans will include visiting our 
overseas sites. Recognising that the 
engagement in 2017 was primarily  
UK-focused, we will find ways to reach  
a wider audience and to bring their views  
in an organised manner to the Board and  
the heart of the organisation.
2017 was a foundational year on which we 
can build and learn how to do this better.  
I have no doubt that this initiative will evolve 
and offer opportunities for change for 
individuals and Rolls-Royce.

The Board
The role of the Board
The Board is ultimately responsible to shareholders for  
the direction, management, performance and long-term 
success of the Company. It sets the Group’s strategy and 
objectives and oversees and monitors internal controls,  
risk management, principal risks, governance and viability 
of the Company. In doing so, the Directors comply with  
their duties under section 172 Companies Act 2006.
The Board has established certain principal committees  
to assist it in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, providing 
dedicated focus on particular areas, as set out below.  
Each committee chairman reports to the Board on the 
committee’s activities after each committee meeting.
In addition to the Board’s principal committees, it has 
established a sub-committee of Directors who each  
hold an appropriate level of UK national security clearance 
for the purpose of receiving and considering, on behalf  
of the Board, any UK classified information relating to  
the Group’s programmes and activities. Beverly Goulet,  
a US national and independent Non-Executive Director, also 
sits on the board of Rolls-Royce North America Holdings, 
Inc. to create a link between the Board and the Group’s 
North American governance structure.

Matters that are not reserved to shareholders, the Board or one of the Board committees are the responsibility of the Chief Executive  
who has established and maintains a schedule of delegations of authority to members of the ELT and other management.
The ELT is an executive-level forum of the Group’s most senior leaders, chaired by the Chief Executive. It comes together to communicate, 
review and agree on issues and actions of Group-wide significance. It helps to develop, implement and monitor strategic and operational 
plans, considers the continuing applicability, appropriateness and impact of risks, leads the Group’s culture and aids the decision-making 
of the Chief Executive in managing the business in the performance of his duties. See rolls-royce.com for details of the ELT members. 70

and strategy
The Board approved the refreshed vision and strategy for the 
Group, rolled out internally and externally from early 2018.
The Board held an all-day meeting with the ELT focused on 
the Group’s overarching strategy, including discussions on all 
areas of the business and people capability. The Board provided 
reflections on the day at the subsequent Board meeting. 
Feedback and content of discussions were shared with the  
ELT and businesses.
Review of principal risks, including  
‘deep dives’ on:
 — political risk;
 — competitive position; and
 — major product programme delivery
The ongoing review of risks resulted in changes to principal risks in 
the year. The product failure risk was redefined as product safety. 
The description of the disruptive technologies and business models 
and business continuity principal risks were updated to reflect the 
TCFD recommendations (see page 60). 
The Board confirmed that the management of risks remained 
effective. Lord Powell, after obtaining input from other members  
of the international advisory board (IAB) ¹, presented on political 
risk in March 2017, including: the implications of Brexit; potential 
military conflicts; and current geo-political factors for the Group. 
The Board considered the Group's competitive position as part  
of its strategy sessions in September, and separately reviewed  
the competitive positions of Power Systems and Marine. 
The Board reviewed the risks to delivery of Civil Aerospace 
widebody engine programmes periodically throughout the year 
with a detailed review of Trent 900 and Trent XWB business plan 
performance in December, leading into a detailed review of Trent 
1000 business plan in 2018. 
Ongoing cooperation with regulators 
following deferred prosecution  
agreements (DPAs)
The Board kept oversight of compliance with the DPAs.
Lord Gold provided an update on his continuing areas  
of focus to the Board in March 2017.

and leadership
Diversity and inclusion There is a continuing focus to increase diversity throughout the 
Group. The Board diversity policy was presented in November 
and approved in December 2017. The Board confirmed its support 
for the Group’s updated diversity and inclusion policies and the 
introduction of Group targets to increase the percentage of  
roles held by women and other under-represented groups across 
the Group.
During 2017, a number of significant projects were completed  
and key milestones reached. See page 47 for more details.

and discussed the reports with the Chief Financial Officer at each

Group to publish its tax strategy on the website during 2017.  
The Board approved and endorsed the approach.

set up to make decisions on the settlement of consideration  
for ITP Aero.

issues, including steps to minimise customer disruption, and 
received briefings from the Chief Executive and President – Civil 
Aerospace on the latest developments and status of programmes.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Stakeholder engagement 
Stakeholder engagement remains vital to building a sustainable 
business. This year, the Company took a significant step towards 
increasing stakeholder engagement with our two key employee 
engagement initiatives. The Board wanted to continue an honest  
and direct dialogue with our employees following the DPAs.  
The creation of the role of employee champion and our first  
Meet the Board event, detailed below, helped to strengthen the  
link between employees and the Board and ensure employee views 
can be taken into account as part of the Board’s decision-making. 
As part of training provided by the Company Secretary, the  
Board discussed the Company’s key stakeholders, reviewed how  
we currently discharge the duty to promote the success of the 
Company and discussed what more could be done to help foster 
stakeholder relationships. The Board will continue to focus on 
stakeholder engagement more widely over the next year, with  
a focus on starting to build a comprehensive stakeholder 
engagement programme.
Employees
Employee champion
In early 2017, one of our Non-Executive Directors Irene Dorner 
became our first Board champion for employee engagement,  
our employee champion, taking the lead in looking at how the 
Company could strengthen the links between the Board and 
employees and bring those insights back to the boardroom.
In April 2017, she was introduced to all employees by a Group-wide 
communication and personally introduced at our Meet the Board 
event in May. 
Irene has attended many events so far, including a European Works 
Council meeting in London, hosted a diversity and inclusion event 
in Bristol, met graduates and apprentices at Barnoldswick and 
Derby, and has participated in a live online interactive session  
with employees. 
At the end of 2017, a communication video from Irene was made 
available to all employees updating them on her role and insights 
so far. We will continue communications in 2018 to ensure 
employees are aware of the activities Irene is taking part in.
As part of her role, Irene updated the Nominations & Governance 
Committee and the Board on her views and insights and she will 
continue to do so regularly. This was always an experimental year, 
however, the new initiative has proved to be of great interest to  
all involved and we intend to continue this interaction.
You can read more about Irene’s view on her new role in her 
introduction on page 65.
MEET THE BOARD EVENT
In May 2017, following our AGM in Derby, we held our first  
Meet the Board event for employees. Our entire UK workforce, 
as well as visiting employees from overseas, were invited to apply 
for one of the 350 places available and participants were 
selected on a ballot. All Group employees were invited to submit 
questions in advance of the event. The meeting was recorded  
so it could be watched after the event had taken place by those 
employees unable to attend in person.
The meeting started with a welcome from the Chairman. Irene 
Dorner then spoke about her role as employee champion and 
Warren East provided a brief business update on 2016. The 
main focus of the meeting was a question and answer session. 
The quality of questions was excellent and generated a lively 
debate that covered a broad range of topics including 
diversity, behaviour, our strategy, future focus for the Group 
and each Board member’s top priority. After the meeting, the 
Board joined attendees in the main reception area and this  
was another great opportunity for interaction.
The objective was for employees to gain a better understanding 
of the Board’s role and to start a conversation that will lead to  
a stronger, more open and collaborative culture. The event was  
a huge success and based on some helpful feedback, we have 
already identified changes that will make future meetings  
even better. 
One employee, interviewed immediately after the meeting  
said, “It was really helpful to have the apparent barriers broken 
down that can sometimes exist between the Board and the 
people that work in the organisation. I particularly enjoyed  
the openness, honesty and transparency”. 
In March 2018, we plan to hold a similar event in Friedrichshafen, 
Germany, and in May after the AGM in Derby, UK. 74

Corporate Governance
Shareholders 
The Board continues to value the importance of building strong 
investor relations, delivered through an active shareholder 
communication programme. Since 2016, we have significantly 
enhanced disclosure and transparency through improved 
reporting, allied to proactive engagement and publications  
such as our periodic Investor Update newsletter. This was one  
of the Group’s strategic priorities as set out on page 7.
In 2017, our engagement programme has focused on addressing 
key elements of the investment case, and identifying both risks  
and opportunities to the business. In particular, we have set out  
our focus on helping investors better understand the key drivers  
of cash across the businesses, together with the implementation  
of IFRS 15, which will see a material change in the way the business 
reports its financial results. 
During the year, an extensive investor engagement programme  
has been undertaken involving formal events, site visits, smaller 
group and one-to-one investor meetings. Many of these provide 
the chance for institutional investors and equity analysts to meet 
senior executive management and ask more detailed questions  
that can improve individual knowledge or clarify areas of 
misunderstanding. We regularly monitor the Group’s shareholder 
base and ensure management’s time is allocated appropriately  
with regard to current and potential shareholder interests. 
As well as attending numerous investor conferences and roadshows 
in the UK, Europe and the US, we were also active at trade-related 
events such as the Paris Airshow and the defence trade show DSEI, 
allowing investors to hear from key business managers. In total, 
over 400 one-to-one and group meetings took place in 2017, led by 
the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, the director of investor 
relations or members of the investor relations team and supported 
by other management. 
On governance-related matters there was a very significant 
consultation programme in advance of the remuneration policy 
vote at the AGM in May. In addition, another well-attended 
governance event was held in May, hosted by the Chairman.  
Fund managers and governance analysts heard from the Chief 
Executive on his strategic agenda and from the Board committee 
chairmen and had the opportunity to engage directly with them  
in small groups. The lead audit partner from KPMG also attended 
this event and answered questions. Topics covered at the event 
included board composition, skillset and 2017 priorities, financial 
reporting, IFRS 15 and risk management, and the context and 
design of the new remuneration policy. Materials from this event 
are available at www.rolls-royce.com.
The Chairman, Senior Independent Director and other members  
of the Board make themselves available to meet with institutional 
investors when requested. In 2018, the Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director have already attended governance meetings 
with some of our largest institutional shareholders in London  
and Edinburgh.
We also published quarterly Investor Update newsletters 
throughout the year, which include commentary on the investor 
relations calendar, key news flow and a Q&A section which 
addresses investor issues that have been raised in recent 
discussions. Feedback on this newsletter has been very positive.
Annual general meeting (AGM)
All holders of ordinary shares may attend the Company’s AGM  
at which the Chairman and Chief Executive present a review of  
the key business developments during the year.

Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Board induction and development
The Chairman and Company Secretary arrange a comprehensive 
tailored induction programme for newly-appointed Non-Executive 
Directors, which includes dedicated time with Group executives and 
scheduled trips to business operations. The programme is tailored 
based on experience and background and the requirements of  
the role. All Directors visit the Group’s main operating sites as part  
of their induction and are encouraged to make at least one visit  
to other sites each year throughout their tenure. In 2017, Board 
members visited locations including: Barnoldswick, Bristol and  
Derby, UK; Friedrichshafen, Germany; and Reston, US. We regard 
these site visits as an important part of continuing education as well 
as an essential part of the induction process. They help Directors 
understand the Group’s activities through direct experience of 
seeing processes in operation and by having discussions with  
a range of employees.
Beverly Goulet was appointed to the Board in July 2017 and  
joined the Nominations & Governance and Audit Committees.  
Since her appointment she has undertaken a thorough induction 
and met with members of the ELT. She was also briefed by the 
Company Secretary on UK listed company requirements, the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and other key governance areas. 
Beverly has attended a number of site visits, including Bristol,  
UK and Reston, US. 
It is important that the Directors continue to develop and refresh 
their understanding of the Group’s activities. To facilitate this,  
the Board met local management and external stakeholders at  
its meetings in Derby and Bristol, UK and they are encouraged  
to visit the Group’s facilities around the world. 
It is also important that the Directors regularly refresh and  
update their skills and knowledge and receive relevant training 
when necessary. Members of the Board also attend relevant 
seminars, conferences and training events to keep up-to-date  
on developments in key areas.

Board effectiveness
Board evaluation
This year Independent Audit Limited (IAL) was invited back to 
undertake another externally-facilitated effectiveness review, 
following on from its yearly reviews since 2014. IAL has not 
provided any other services to the Company during the year.  
The evaluation was consciously ‘light touch’ compared to previous 
reviews and it was undertaken through a questionnaire-based 
survey. This was complemented by confidential one-to-one 
discussions between IAL and several members of the Board  
and management to help bring focus to the questions. The review 
covered four specific areas which had been identified as requiring 
further development during last year’s review and the scope was 
agreed with the Company Secretary after consultation with the 
Chairman. The four specific areas of focus were: Board dynamics; 
focus; information; and culture.
A review of the effectiveness of Board committees was undertaken 
separately at the end of the year internally with the use of an 
effectiveness questionnaire. A thorough review of the committees 
will form part of next year’s evaluation. To provide a renewed 
perspective, next year’s evaluation will be undertaken by a new 
external provider and this will take place in the second half of 2018.
Good progress had been made since the last effectiveness review 
and the Board feels that it is working more effectively. The Board 
discussed the findings of the report in December. 
At a private meeting of the Non-Executive Directors, Sir Kevin 
Smith, Senior Independent Director, led a review of the Chairman’s 
performance without the Chairman present. 
The Nominations & Governance Committee also met without  
any management present to discuss the performance of the  
Chief Executive. The meetings concluded that both the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive continued to be effective and constructive 
feedback was shared with each of them.
Progress on four key areas 
Areas of focus IAL’s findings in 2017 Focus for 2018
Board  
dynamics
The dynamics of the Board have improved, with 
good all-round commitment from Board members, 
a good mix of styles, a constructive approach and 
wide participation in meetings. Cross-membership 
and active collaboration has meant liaison across 
committees is working well.
Maintaining an open tone between the  
Non-Executive Directors and management  
to encourage constructive discussions on  
the challenges ahead.
Responsibility: Chairman
Focus
Considerable progress has been made in setting a 
clear strategic direction and getting the right senior 
executives in place. The changes resulted in better 
discussions on the most relevant topics. There was  
a better balance of time during meetings, with more 
time spent on key discussion items.
Continue to oversee the execution of the Group’s 
strategic priorities and how management are 
addressing the near-term operational challenges.
Ensure agendas continue to allow enough time  
for the Board to focus on the most relevant topics 
and allow the appropriate amount of time for  
high-quality discussion.
Responsibility: Chairman/Company Secretary
Information
There has been some progress in improving the 
information provided to the Board. However more 
work is needed to ensure papers focus on the relevant 
data and avoid excessive and unnecessary detail.
Improving information will continue to be a 
priority. In particular, management will focus on 
providing all the relevant information to allow 
informed debate without over-burdening the 
Board with excessive operational detail. 
Responsibility: Chief Executive/ 
Chief Financial Officer/Company Secretary
Culture
The Board is confident with its approach to oversight 
of culture and takes a robust approach to assessing 
ethical standards: issues are well understood and  
are tracked. 
The Board will remain focused on culture in 
2018 and will be kept well-informed on progress 
with the latest restructuring plans, including 
monitoring of management’s approach to 
embedding behaviours.

Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (the Code)
The Company is subject to the principles and provisions of  
the Code, a copy of which is available in full at www.frc.org.uk.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Board considers  
that it has complied in full with the provisions of the Code. 
Below is a statement of compliance that explains how the 
Company has applied the principles and complied with the 
provisions in the Code.
A – LEADERSHIP
A1 The role of the Board
The Board is ultimately responsible for the management, direction 
and performance of the Company and its businesses. It sets the 
Group’s strategy and objectives and oversees and monitors internal 
controls, risk management, principal risks, governance and viability 
of the Company. 
The Board Governance document (available at www.rolls-royce.com) 
includes a clear schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s 
approval, which is reviewed at least annually.
A2 Clear division of responsibilities
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are clearly defined 
and the Board supports the separation of the two roles. The key 
responsibilities are clearly documented in our Board Governance 
document. The Chairman is responsible for the leadership and 
effectiveness of the Board. The Chief Executive is responsible  
for the running of the Company’s business.
A3 Role of the Chairman
The Chairman ensures effective running of the Board and its 
committees in accordance with the highest standards of corporate 
governance. He sets the agenda for Board meetings making sure 
consideration is given to the main challenges and opportunities 
facing the Company and facilitates open and constructive dialogue  
during meetings.
A4 Role of the Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are independent of management  
and bring a diverse set of skills and experience to meetings.  
The Non-Executive Directors support the Chairman and  
provide objective and constructive challenge to management.  
Their views are actively sought when developing proposals  
on strategy, including during discussions in meetings, in  
post-meeting conversations, or as part of the annual Board  
and ELT strategy day. All of the Board committees consist 
exclusively of Non-Executive Directors.
The Senior Independent Director provides a sounding board  
for the Chairman and serves as an intermediary for the Chief 
Executive, other Directors, and shareholders when required. 
At the end of most scheduled Board meetings, the Chairman holds 
meetings with the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive 
Directors or management present. 
B – EFFECTIVENESS
B1 The composition of the Board
The Board believes it operates effectively with the appropriate 
balance of independent Non-Executive and Executive Directors 
who have the right mix of skills, experience and knowledge  
of the Company. The Nominations & Govenance Committee is 
responsible for regularly reviewing the composition of the Board.
Details of the Board, their biographies and committee membership 
are set out on pages 66 to 68.
The Board conducts a review of the independence of the  
Non-Executive Directors every year, based on the criteria  
in the Code and following consideration by the Nominations  
& Governance Committee as detailed on page 82. The review  
in November 2017 concluded that all the Non-Executive Directors, 
with the exception of Brad Singer, remained independent in 
character and judgement. 
Brad Singer is a partner and the chief operating officer of  
ValueAct Capital, a major shareholder, and therefore was not 
considered independent under the provisions set out in the  
Code. A relationship agreement between the Company, ValueAct 
and Brad Singer, was in place throughout 2017 to manage any 
conflicts of interest that arise from his connection to ValueAct.
The Code does not consider the test of independence to be 
appropriate to the chairman of the company. However, Ian Davis 
did meet the Code’s independence criteria upon his appointment 
as a Non-Executive Director in March 2013 and as Chairman in  
May 2013.
B2 Appointments to the Board
Appointments of new Directors are led by the Nominations  
& Governance Committee, which are recommended to the Board. 
Details of the appointment process, and changes made during  
the year, are set out in the Nominations & Governance Committee 
report on pages 79 to 82.
MWM Consulting provided external search consultancy services  
in relation to the appointments of Beverly Goulet and Nick Luff. 
They had no other connection to the Company during the year.
B3 Time commitment
Non-Executive Directors are advised of the time commitment 
expected from them on appointment. External appointments,  
which may affect existing time commitments for the Board’s 
business, must be agreed with the Chairman. Full details of these  
are set out at www.rolls-royce.com.
B4 Induction, training and development
All new Directors receive a full induction programme when they  
are appointed to the Board, more details of which are on page 75. 
The Board received additional training throughout the year on  
key topics, as appropriate. 
B5 Information and support
The Company Secretary makes sure that appropriate and timely 
information is provided to the Board and its committees and  
is responsible for advising and supporting the Chairman and  
Board on all governance matters. All Directors have access to  
the Company Secretary and may take independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense in conducting their duties. 78

Corporate Governance
C3 Audit Committee and auditors
The Audit Committee Report on pages 97 to 103 sets out details of 
how the Committee has discharged its duties and its areas of focus 
during the year.
In accordance with the Code and DTR 7.1 the Board is satisfied  
that Lewis Booth, Beverly Goulet and Irene Dorner, all members  
of the Audit Committee, have recent and relevant financial 
experience, and when considered as a whole, the Committee has 
competence relevant to the sector in which the Company operates 
to ensure the right balance of skills, experience, professional 
qualifications and knowledge.
D – REMUNERATION
D1 The level and components of remuneration
The Directors’ remuneration report is set out on pages 83 to 96 
which outlines the areas of focus during the year and a summary  
of the remuneration policy, as approved by shareholders at the 
2017 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee sets levels of remuneration which  
are designed to promote the long-term success of the Group, 
aligning this with the Group’s strategy and business objectives  
and ensuring it reflects our stakeholders’ interests. It is responsible  
for recommending to the Board the remuneration policy for 
Executive Directors, other members of the ELT and for the 
Chairman, and for implementing the policy.
In November 2017 we decided to publish our data on gender pay 
earlier than required. More information is available on page 94  
and at www.rolls-royce.com.
D2 Procedure
For more information on the work of the Remuneration Committee 
and Directors’ remuneration see the report on pages 83 to 96. 
Ruth Cairnie, the chairman of the Remuneration Committee,  
meets with institutional shareholders regularly, as appropriate.
E – RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
E1 Dialogue with shareholders
The Board considers that effective channels of communication with 
the Company’s institutional investors and individual shareholders  
are very important. You can read more about engagement with 
shareholders on page 74. 
E2 Constructive use of General Meetings
The AGM provides a key opportunity for the Board to meet and 
communicate with shareholders. Shareholders can ask questions  
of the Board on matters put to the meeting, including the Annual 
Report and the running of the Company generally. Company 
representatives and the Company’s Registrar are also available  
for any questions shareholders might have.
Terms of reference of the Board committees  
and shareholder information are available at  
www.rolls-royce.com
B6 Evaluation
The Board evaluation for 2017 was externally facilitated and more 
details can be found on page 76. The Chairman also met each 
Director individually to discuss their contribution, performance 
over the year and any development needs. Following the meetings, 
the Chairman confirmed that each Director was committed to their 
role and they were effective. 
At a private meeting of the Non-Executive Directors, Sir Kevin 
Smith, Senior Independent Director, led a review of the Chairman’s 
performance without the Chairman present. The Nominations  
& Governance Committee also met without management present  
to discuss the performance of the Chief Executive. The meetings 
concluded that both the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
continued to be effective and constructive feedback was shared 
with them.
B7 Election/re-election
All Directors are subject to election or re-election at the AGM. 
Following recommendations from the Nominations & Governance 
Committee the Board considers that all Directors continue to be 
effective, committed to their roles and have sufficient time available 
to perform their duties. In accordance with the Code, Beverly 
Goulet and Nick Luff will seek election and all other Directors  
will seek re-election at the 2018 AGM.
C – ACCOUNTABLITY
C1 Financial and business reporting
The requirement for the Annual Report, taken as a whole, to be fair, 
balanced and understandable is taken into consideration in the 
drafting and reviewing process. See page 99 for the process to 
review the form and content. The Strategic Report, set out on pages 
1 to 63, provides information about the Group’s business model, 
performance, strategy and principal risks.
C2 Risk management and internal control
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal  
risks facing the Company including those that would threaten  
its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.  
See pages 59 to 62 for more details on the Group’s principal risks 
and a description of changes during the year. 
In developing the internal governance framework (see page 82)  
the Group looked at how the risk management and internal  
control systems work together. You can read more about the  
risk management system on page 59 and details of the internal 
control system on page 101. The Board, with the advice of the Audit 
Committee, has reviewed the effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal control systems, including controls in relation to the 
financial reporting process, for the year under review and up to the 
date of this report. The Board confirms that the Group continues  
to be compliant with the Code, Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR) in this regard. 
The activities of the Audit Committee, which assists the Board with 
its responsibilities in relation to risk and assurance, are set out on

Succession  
planning
Progress on succession planning 
Two updates on diversity and inclusion
There has been a continued focus on succession 
planning this year, with a number of changes to the ELT. 
The discussions focused on the executive pipeline.
The Committee approved the Board diversity policy 
in December 2017. It was agreed to maintain focus on 
diversity and inclusion in 2018. 
Evaluation of  
Chairman,  
Chief Executive  
and Non-Executive  
Directors
Annual review of the effectiveness of the Chairman and 
the Chief Executive, led by the Senior Independent 
Director and the Chairman respectively
Annual review of whether the Non-Executive Directors

independence criteria set out in the Code
The Chairman and Chief Executive continue to be 
effective. Feedback was shared directly with them.
The review concluded that all Non-Executive 
Directors, with the exception of Brad Singer,  
remained independent.
Corporate 
governance
A review of our global governance framework
Periodic governance updates from the Company 
Secretary
A refreshed governance framework was published 
internally in June 2017.
The Committee has been kept informed about the 
changes to the governance landscape and the various 
proposals on UK corporate governance.
Oversight  
of principal risk – 
talent and capability
The principal risk is considered when discussing  
talent and capability
It was agreed that continuing focus was required, 
particularly on the high-potential and emerging 
talent pools. The Board apprentice programme was 
introduced as a pilot initiative.
Board and committee composition
The Committee regularly reviews the balance and composition  
of the Board, its committees and the executive team, as well as 
Non-Executive Director independence, skills and tenure.  
When reviewing the Non-Executive Directors appointments  
the Committee considers the current skills and experience of the 
Board and assesses future needs against longer-term succession 
planning in light of the Group’s strategy. 
The Committee also takes into account the need to make sure  
there is appropriate diversity on the Board. During the year, the 
Committee considered the external reviews on diversity, namely  
the Parker Review and the Hampton-Alexander Review, published 
in November 2016. Further details on our approach to diversity are 
set out on pages 81 to 82. The Committee is satisfied with the 
current composition of the Board committees and believes that 
undue reliance is not placed on particular individuals. The Board 
committee membership is set out on page 68. This will be regularly 
reviewed and refreshed by the Board.
Board inductions, training and development
The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring that new 
Directors have a thorough and appropriate induction. Each newly 
appointed Director has a structured induction programme and 
receives a comprehensive data pack providing detailed information 
on the Group. You can read more about inductions and continuing 
development on page 75. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

Directors’ Report
Nominations & Governance Committee Report
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Board nominations
In April 2017, Stephen Daintith was appointed to the Board as  
Chief Financial Officer. In July 2017, the Committee recommended to 
the Board the approval of Beverly Goulet as Non-Executive Director. 
During the year, we considered and recommended to the Board  
the terms of appointment for Ruth Cairnie for a second three-year 
term and Lewis Booth and Sir Frank Chapman both for a third 
three-year term subject to annual shareholder re-election. For each 
re-appointment we consider the effectiveness and commitment of 
the Director and undertake a more thorough review of those 
Directors who are being re-appointed for their third three-year term. 
The Committee was satisfied with the Directors’ continued 
commitment and effectiveness.
Beverly was identified as a candidate for the Board through our 
external search for a director with experience in the airline or 
aerospace sectors, with a particular focus on the US. Prior to her 
appointment, Beverly met with seven members of the Board and  
we collected references from chairmen of companies where she had 
previously worked. The Committee agreed that Beverly had strong 
functional expertise in finance, strategy and legal matters as well  
as a wealth of knowledge of the airline industry.
In February 2018, it was announced that Nick Luff, currently  
chief financial officer of RELX Group, would be appointed as 
Non-Executive Director with effect from close of the AGM in May 
2018, subject to shareholder approval. Nick will join the Audit 
Committee and Nominations & Governance Committee. Nick was 
identified as a candidate that would bring significant expertise in 
finance and accounting to the Board. Prior to his appointment,  
Nick met with eight members of the Board including the Chairman, 
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer. 
For Beverly’s and Nick’s appointments, the Committee appointed 
MWM Consulting. Prior to the new appointments, the Chairman 
agreed a Non-Executive Director profile and the Committee 
provided input into a shortlist of candidates for the roles. You can 
read their full biographies at www.rolls-royce.com.
Succession planning
The Committee is committed to regularly reviewing succession 
planning and it plays a vital role in promoting effective board 
succession, making sure that this is aligned to the Group’s strategy.  
A principal risk to the business is the inability to attract, retain  
and incentivise talented individuals to deliver our strategy; the 
Committee is responsible for reviewing talent, capability and 
succession at the most senior levels of the business. There has 
been a continued focus on succession planning in the year and  
we have taken significant steps to strengthen our management  
and ELT.
In September, the Chief Executive and Group Human Resources 
Director led discussions on succession planning with the Board  
and the Committee. The review focused on the executive pipeline 
from which the future leaders of the Company were likely to 
emerge, both at ELT level and other key management areas.  
Strong successors have been identified for most ELT roles and 
future considerations have been taken into account in identifying 
successors both immediately below ELT level and those that would 
be ready to take up an ELT position in one or two moves. A diverse 
pipeline of ‘ready later’ emerging talent has been identified, and  
a plan would be put in place to accelerate their path to succession 
where possible. It was also identified that there was a need for more 
rigour, challenge and calibration around talent and succession and 
we would review progress again in 2018.
As we reported last year, we recognise that succession planning 
includes nurturing our own talent pool and giving opportunities  
to those who are capable of growing into more senior roles. 
Throughout the year, Directors took opportunities to meet with 
senior management throughout the Company, including in Bristol 
where they met the Defence Aerospace leadership team and at  
the senior leadership conference where they met key managers.  
At the beginning of 2018, we were also pleased to announce the 
appointments of Chris Cholerton, former President – Defence 
Aerospace, as the new President – Civil Aerospace, and Tom Bell,  
a former employee, as the new President – Defence. These 
appointments come at a crucial time for our business as the 
Company seeks to make 2018 a breakthrough year.
Board apprentice programme
In 2017, we created a new Board apprentice programme. This is a 
nine-month programme that will provide leadership development 
experience to demonstrate our commitment to the participants’ 
career progression and development as leaders in the organisation. 
The opportunity provides the participants with exposure to the 
Board and personal career development through observing and 
learning from boardroom experience.
The first high-potential candidates to participate in a trial of the 
programme brought diversity of thought, gender, nationality and 
ethnicity. The key elements of the programme include: early career 
conversations with the Group Human Resources Director or 
members of the senior leadership team; an orientation meeting 
providing an overview from Directors of what it means to be on  
a board; an opportunity to network with other candidates on the 
programme; attendance at Board/committee meetings; and 
networking with our ELT.
Diversity and inclusion
Diversity and inclusion continues to be an area of focus for the 
Committee. As mentioned on page 47, during 2017 we launched  
a new strategy with global targets to increase female participation 
at all levels of our organisation by 2020. The Committee was 
updated on progress against these and activities to drive diversity 
and inclusion across the Company including: establishing a Global 
Diversity and Inclusion Council; a number of senior female 
appointments; launching an online series of digital communications 
on diversity and inclusion focusing on key issues such as flexible 
working and mental health; launching the Board apprentice 
programme; and trialling female-only assessment centres for  
STEM roles.
Rolls-Royce is also a founding patron of the FTSE-100  
Cross-Company Mentoring Programme which aims to widen the 
pool of eligible female board candidates. At the date of this report 
the percentage of women currently on our Board is 33% (2016: 
23%). The Committee will instruct search consultants to identify,  
as a priority, female candidates who meet the skills and experience 
brief. As with all previous appointments, we will consider candidates 
from the widest possible pool and will only engage search firms 
that have signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for

Nominations & Governance Committee Report
In the year, the Board approved the Board diversity policy which 
adopts a target that one third of Board members should be female. 
It is recognised that there will be periods of change on the Board 
and that this number may be smaller for periods of time while the 
Board is refreshed. It is our longer-term intention, however, to at 
least maintain this balance. 
Our policy will continue to promote an inclusive and diverse 
culture and will reaffirm our aspiration to meet and exceed the 
recommended voluntary target of 33% of Board positions being 
held by women in 2020. The objectives in the policy remain 
relevant targets against which to measure our progress. We will 
continue to progress our Board diversity policy. During the year  
we are committed to set and publish a target for ELT and senior 
leadership gender balance. You can find the full policy at  
www.rolls-royce.com.

Governance
We strive to take an innovative approach in all that we do and that 
includes our approach to governance. In 2017, we have carried  
out a number of initiatives such as our Meet the Board event,  
the Board apprentice programme and the appointment of Irene 
Dorner as our Non-Executive Director employee champion and we 
continue to look to be ‘best in class’ and to ensure our governance 
is appropriate for the Group and all our stakeholders.
The Group’s governance framework continues to be effective. 
Following its launch in 2016, an updated version was issued in June 
2017, containing a new section on strategy, planning and in-year 
appraisal. We continue to work on developing and maturing the 
framework, with the current focus on building on the considerable 
work done to date on our Group policies, to bring further 
improvements and ensure the Group policies are understood and 
embedded across the organisation. The outcome of this work will 
provide a condensed and more succinct set of Group policies.
In September, we established a new executive level group 
governance committee, chaired by the General Counsel. This new 
committee will help to keep the governance framework and the 
development of the Group policies under review. It will oversee the 
effectiveness of the framework across the organisation and ensure 
that the Group’s corporate governance and corporate compliance 
arrangements, practices and procedures (below Board level) are 
consistent with appropriate best practice principles and standards 
for a group of the size and complexity of Rolls-Royce.
The Nominations & Governance Committee is provided with regular 
updates on key developments to corporate governance. This year, 
the Committee has been kept informed about the changes to the 
governance landscape and the proposals from the government’s 
green paper on UK corporate governance and the FRC’s 
consultation on the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Conflicts of interest and independence
The Board continues to monitor and note potential conflicts of 
interest that each Director may have and recommends to the Board 
whether these should be authorised and whether any conditions 
should be attached to any authorisation. The Directors are regularly 
reminded of their continuing obligations in relation to conflicts, and 
are required annually to review and confirm their external interests, 
which helps to determine whether each of them continue to be 
considered independent. 
Brad Singer, as a representative of a significant shareholder, is not 
considered to be independent. As noted on page 77, the conflict  
of interest was managed throughout the year by a relationship 
agreement between the Company, ValueAct and Brad Singer.
During the year, following an annual review, no additional conflicts  
of interest were identified which required approval by the Board.  
The Committee advised the Board that it considered that each of the 
remaining Non-Executive Directors continued to be independent. 
Looking forward
I am pleased to report we have made good progress against our 
priorities for 2017 in relation to succession planning. However, we still 
have work to do in this area and in relation to diversity and inclusion.
During the course of 2018, the Committee will continue to keep 
under review any future UK corporate governance reforms as they 
are finalised and also review progress of our initiatives including 
the Board apprentice and employee engagement programmes.
Ian Davis 
Chairman of the Nominations & Governance Committee 
Board diversity policy
Objective Progress
All Board appointments will be made in the context of the skills  
and experience that are needed for the Board to be effective. 
The Committee regularly reviews the composition of the Board.
Maintain a balance so that, as a minimum, one third of the 
Directors are women.
The chart below highlights that the percentage of women  
on the Board is 33%, which is higher than last year.
Support and monitor Group activities to increase the  
percentage of senior management roles held by women  
and other under-represented groups. 
The Committee focused on strengthening the pipeline of 
executive talent in the Company. Group activities include the 
external hiring of diverse senior managers and internal promotion 
activity and continued emphasis on diverse pipeline, graduate  
and apprentice recruitment. You can find out more on page 47.
Monitor, challenge and support internally set targets for diversity 
and inclusion at all levels across the organisation.
This is ongoing and will be kept under review. The charts on  
page 66 provide a clearer picture of our Board diversity and  
our diversity & inclusion targets are on page 47. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Remuneration Committee Report
Introduction
I am pleased to present my second report as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, outlining the areas of focus for  
the Committee during the year.
New remuneration policy
In 2017, we revised our remuneration policy to strengthen the 
connection to our strategy. The changes addressed the themes  
of transformation, competitiveness, alignment with shareholders 
and simplicity and included: 
 — simplifying the design of both short and long-term incentives; 
 — increasing the maximum level of long-term incentive plan (LTIP)
award; 
 — reducing the vesting level for threshold performance in the  
LTIP and adding a two-year holding period.
In developing the new policy we engaged extensively with our 
major shareholders to understand their perspectives and address 
any concerns, and we secured strong support for the policy at the 
2017 AGM (96%). 
Based on the first year of implementation, the new policy is working 
well for us. The additional potential for performance-based awards 
has supported our talent agenda, enabling us to bring experience 
from other sectors into senior positions; an example is the 
appointment of Stephen Daintith as Chief Financial Officer. The 
structure of the performance-based incentives is much simpler and 
we have been able to communicate progress towards our targets 
more clearly to employees. The alignment of shareholder interests 
and our remuneration targets is evident: to pay out, our incentives 
require the continued ramp-up of new engine delivery, increase in 
flying hours, improvements in operational performance, strong cash 
management and a shift in our culture towards pace and simplicity.  
I am pleased that the clarity of our measures and strong link to 
strategy enables the Committee to have robust, data-driven debate 
about both targets and outcomes. 
2017 outturns
The 2015 performance share plan (PSP) awards will not vest as  
the performance conditions were not met over the three-year 
performance period to 31 December 2017. This reflects the reset in 
performance expectations, notably EPS, during this performance 
period as the business entered a major period of transition. This  
is the third consecutive year that PSP has not vested, an outcome 
which aligns with our shareholders’ experience over this period.
When setting targets for the 2017 annual bonus, the Committee 
took a diligent approach, recognising that many of the headwinds 
encountered in 2016 (for example the cash drain associated with 
delivery of increasing numbers of new engines) would continue  
to impact the businesses, but that substantial progress was  
needed on the path to a transformed business with stronger 
financial performance. 
The reported financial performance in 2017 saw both underlying 
profit and free cash flow exceeding expectations. This resulted  
from the growth in our installed engines delivering significantly 
higher service revenue, a solid performance in Defence Aerospace 
and strong performance by Power Systems, together with the 
benefits of the transformation programme being felt. The higher 
profitability and better working capital management led to the 
growth in cash flow. 
In determining the outcomes for bonus the Committee has 
rigorously examined the quality of both profit and cash flow 
outturns to ensure that awards reflect operational improvements 
and delivery of the transformation programme. Adjustments were 
made to remove the greater than budgeted benefit of the R&D 
capitalisation policy. After this adjustment both profit and cash 
outcomes remained above target levels.
For our non-financial incentive measures, our delivery metric was 
just above target level, with strong performances in some businesses 
offsetting challenges in Civil Aerospace. Employee engagement 
remained at the same level as in 2016 which limited the outturn  
of this metric to base level. The overall bonus outturn across both 
financial and non-financial metrics was 72% of maximum reflecting  
a strong performance in a year with many challenges.
The Committee also considered the bonus in the round, to decide 
whether this outperformance seemed appropriate, taking into 
account external factors, progress on the strategic journey and 
shareholder experience. Overall we felt that management had 
responded vigorously to the challenges posed by in-service issues  
as well as continued market challenges, for example in Marine,  
and had made good strategic progress. Taking everything into 
account we decided not to make any further adjustments.
I am also pleased that we are able to pay bonuses to employees 
throughout the organisation for a second consecutive year. 
Board changes
Stephen Daintith joined the Board in April 2017. Awards that he 
would otherwise have forfeited from his previous employer were 
bought out, retaining performance conditions where relevant and 
matching or exceeding previous time horizons.
We also announced the departure of both Colin Smith and David 
Smith from the Board in 2017. In both cases outstanding PSP awards 
were pro-rated and will vest at the normal time against achievement 
of the relevant performance conditions. The 2015 PSP awards  
have lapsed as the targets were not met. Neither Colin nor David 
participated in any incentive plans in 2017. David Smith’s contractual 
payments were mitigated due to his external appointment to QinetiQ.

Other attendees
In addition to the members of the Committee, the Chairman,  
Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and any of the  
Non-Executive Directors may attend one or more meetings at  
the Committee’s invitation, although none was present during 
discussion of his or her own remuneration package. The Committee 
is supported by the Company Secretary, the Group HR Director 
and Global Performance, Reward & Pensions Director. 
Advisers
During the year, the Committee had access to advice from Deloitte 
LLP’s executive compensation advisory practice. Total fees for 
advice provided to the Committee during the year by Deloitte  
were £126,750 (2016: £159,175). Deloitte also advised the Company 
on tax, corporate compliance, employee global mobility, assurance, 
pensions and corporate finance and Deloitte MCS Limited provided 
consulting services. The Committee is exclusively responsible for 
reviewing, selecting and appointing its advisers. 
Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and adheres to its code in relation to executive remuneration 
consulting. The Committee requests Deloitte to attend meetings 
periodically during the year and is satisfied that the advice it has 
received has been objective and independent. 
Principal responsibilities
  Set and monitor the strategy and policy for the remuneration  
of Executive Directors, Chairman and members of the executive 
leadership team (ELT). 
  Determine the design, conditions and coverage of annual 
incentives and LTIPs for senior executives and approve total  
and individual payments under the plans. 
  Determine targets for any performance-related pay plans.
  Determine the issue and terms of all-employee share plans. 
  Oversee any major changes in remuneration.
Areas of focus for 2018
The Committee is operating well with the members bringing a 
wealth of diverse experience. In 2018 in addition to our regular 
activities we will:
 — Continue our focus on incentive measures and targets to ensure 
they remain aligned with strategy and performance
 — Consider the forthcoming governance reforms and their impact 
on the Committee’s remit and process 
 — Continue to develop our approach to engaging with employees 
 — With the HR function, consider how the wider reward strategy 
can play an even stronger role in supporting new behaviours 
and culture through the forthcoming business restructuring
Ruth Cairnie 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
2018 salary review and incentives
The Committee has reviewed the salary levels of the Executive 
Directors and has concluded that no increases will be made  
for 2018. 
The only change we have made to the implementation of our policy 
is to increase the weighting of the cash metric in the annual bonus 
from 37.5% to 50%, reflecting that cash is the key performance 
metric across our business.
Gender pay
In line with the new UK regulations, we published our gender pay 
gap in November 2017. It showed a median pay gap of 8.1% (mean 
8.3%) across all Rolls-Royce employees in the UK. While our UK 
gender pay gap is better than the UK national average, as with many 
engineering organisations we have a relatively low number of women 
in our business and they are not as well represented in higher level 
roles as men. We are working to improve the representation of 
diverse talent at all levels in the organisation with the adoption  
of the Board Diversity policy and with plans in place that are set  
out on pages 47, 81 and 82.
Engagement with employees
I am keen that the Committee keeps in touch with what our 
employees are thinking about executive remuneration. Combined 
with insights from shareholders, this helps ensure the Committee has 
a rounded view to inform the decisions that we make. At the end of 
2017, I started to engage in employee focus groups to get feedback 
on this topic and I will continue to meet with employees in 2018. 
These meetings are closely aligned with the work of fellow director 
Irene Dorner in her role as employee champion.
In addition we have chosen to publish our CEO pay ratio versus  
UK employees in this year’s report on page 93. We believe it is 
helpful to be as transparent as possible about executive pay.
Operation of the Committee 
All members of the Committee are independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Lewis Booth joined the Committee in April 2017.  
Our biographies are on pages 67 and 68.
The Committee’s responsibilities are outlined in its terms of reference 
which can be found at www.rolls-royce.com, and which we review 
annually and refer to the Board for approval.
In addition to its five scheduled meetings, the Committee held 
unscheduled meetings in January and March to discuss 2017 bonus 
plan targets.

Remuneration  
policy
Gain shareholder approval for a new  
policy to: 
 — better align executive reward to the 
transformation agenda;
 — improve competitiveness of the total reward 
package to attract and retain talent;
 — align executive reward with the interests  
of shareholders; and
 — introduce simplified plans that can be 
cascaded down the organisation
The overall reward structure was reviewed with a continued 
focus on pay for performance. The designs of both annual bonus 
and LTIPs were simplified to additive models. Performance 
metrics focus on the measures that will drive the business 
strategy and align with shareholder interests.
The maximum level of LTIP award was increased to 250% for 
the Chief Executive and 225% for other Executive Directors. 
At the same time the amount vesting at threshold was reduced 
from 30% to 20% and an additional two-year holding period 
was introduced. The new policy was approved by 96% of 
shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
Base salaries
Review of base salaries in accordance with 
the remuneration policy and the broader 
employee context
Increase to Warren East’s salary of 2% with effect from 
September 2017. There will be no increases for Warren East  
and Stephen Daintith for 2018.
Annual bonus
2017 bonus – review of performance against 
the 2017 bonus targets
2018 bonus – Review of measures and targets 
to ensure continued alignment to strategy
Warren East received a bonus of 122% of salary (68% of 
maximum). Stephen Daintith received a bonus of 83% of salary, 
equivalent to 113% of salary (75% of maximum) on a full-year 
basis. 40% of the awards were deferred into shares. 
The Committee agreed that for the 2018 bonus plan the same 
measures would apply as in 2017 but with more focus on free 
cash flow as the key performance metric. The weighting  
will be as follows:
 — Profit – 25%
 — Cash – 50% 
 — Customer delivery – 12.5%
 — Employee engagement – 12.5%
Awards will be based 80% on Group performance and 20%  
on individual performance. The maximum opportunities remain 
at 180% of salary for the Chief Executive and 150% for other 
Executive Directors.
Long-term  
incentive plan
2015 PSP – review of achievement of 
performance measures
2018 LTIP – setting targets that ensure 
significant stretch 
The 2015 awards will not vest due to performance conditions  
not being satisfied.
For 2018 grants, targets will continue to be based on CPS (60%), 
EPS (20%) and TSR (20%). The EPS targets for threshold, on target 
and maximum vesting are now based on IFRS 15 accounting. 
The maximum opportunities remain at 250% for the Chief 
Executive and 225% for other Executive Directors.

Summary of our remuneration policy
There are four key themes that underpin the policy:
Simplification Stewardship Talent Supporting transformation
These themes continue to align to our organisational strategy and our reward programmes support them through a combination of salary, 
benefits, annual bonus and long-term incentives, underpinned by stretching performance measures and appropriate award levels. The full 
policy is in the 2016 Annual Report, available at www.rolls-royce.com.

c) Pension entitlements (audited)
The Company provides competitive pension arrangements suitable to attract and retain individuals of the right calibre to develop and 
execute the business strategy. Executive Directors are offered membership of a defined contribution pension plan. A cash allowance may 
be payable in lieu of pension contributions, reduced to allow for additional National Insurance incurred. Warren East receives a cash 
allowance of 25% and Stephen Daintith receives a cash allowance of 22% of salary in lieu of pension accrual. The Group’s UK pension 
schemes are funded, registered schemes and were approved under the regime applying until 6 April 2006. They include both defined 
contribution and defined benefit pension schemes and there is now only one defined benefit pension plan, the ‘Rolls-Royce UK Pension 
Fund’. None of the current Directors is a member of this plan. Colin Smith, who left the Group on 31 May 2017, started to receive his 
pension on 1 December 2016.
d) Annual bonus outturn (audited)
The Company’s annual bonus scheme is designed to incentivise the execution of the business strategy, delivery of financial targets and  
the achievement of personal objectives. Executive Directors receive any annual bonus awarded in March following the performance 
period. 60% of the bonus is paid in cash with the remaining 40% awarded in deferred shares. Deferred shares are held in trust for two 
years before being released, subject to the recipient still being employed by the Group and include the right to receive an amount equal 
in value to the C shares issued during the deferral period. The annual maximum for the Chief Executive is 180% of salary and 150% for  
the other Executive Director(s):
 — 80% of the award is based on Group performance
 — 20% of the award is based on individual performance
The Committee retains overriding discretion on the outturns of the annual bonus.
Malus and clawback provisions apply where there has been: a material misstatement of audited results; serious financial irregularity  
which invalidates the targets set; reputational damage; material failure of risk management; a serious breach of the Group’s Global Code  
of Conduct; or individual gross misconduct. Clawback will apply from the date of deferral until three years after the release of shares.
2017 annual bonus outturn
The Committee reviewed the 2017 outturn against the performance measures; 80% of annual bonus is based on Group performance  
and 20% is based on individual performance. The Group performance measures are shown below:

  For the purposes of assessing performance the Committee adjusted the underlying profit and free cash flow to reflect unbudgeted foreign exchange movements and the greater than 
budgeted benefit from the R&D capitalisation policy.
Definitions used for performance measures:
Profit – underlying profit before tax that is reported by the Group for 2017, adjusted for unbudgeted acquisitions and disposals. 
Cash – free cash flow which is cash flow before acquisitions and disposals, shareholder payments, foreign exchange and  
share buybacks.
Customer delivery – % on-time to purchase order, measured for new equipment, spare parts or equipment repair and overhaul.
Employee engagement – measured through our long-standing global employee opinion survey. 59% of our people participated  
in our survey in 2017 and our sustainable engagement score was 75.   Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

PSP awards vesting in March 2018
The following sets out details in respect of the March 2015 PSP award (made under the 2014 remuneration policy) for which the final year 
of performance was the 2017 financial year. Subject to performance conditions, the vesting date of these awards is March 2018, three years 
after the awards were made. 
Targets for 2015-2017 period Performance against targets
EPS growth (hurdle) Awards will vest if EPS growth exceeds the OECD 
index of consumer prices. Awards will lapse if the 
hurdle is not met.
EPS growth of -39.4% over the three-year period 
underperformed the hurdle which was 4.1%. 
Aggregate CPS Aggregate CPS over three-year period of less than 
60p – zero vesting.
Aggregate CPS over three-year period of 
100p – 100% vesting.
Aggregate CPS performance over three-year period 
of 26p.
Relative TSR Relative TSR versus FTSE 100 constituents less than 
median – 1.0 x multiplier.
Relative TSR versus FTSE 100 constituents equal  
to median – 1.25 x multiplier.
Relative TSR versus FTSE 100 constituents equal  
to upper quartile – 1.5 x mulitplier.
Relative TSR over the three-year period was  
below median.
Outturn None of the 2015 awards will vest in March 2018.  
There are also outstanding awards, made under the Rolls-Royce Performance Share Plan (PSP), which were agreed prior to the approval  
of the LTIP at the AGM in 2017. These include awards made to Stephen Daintith to compensate for unvested incentives awarded to him at 
Daily Mail & General Trust plc (DMGT) which were forfeited as a result of him joining Rolls-Royce. The awards shown below are of equivalent 
value to the DMGT awards forfeited and reflect performance conditions and match or exceed the time horizons. Awards vesting in 2019  
will be assessed against the 2016 PSP performance conditions.

invalidates the targets set; reputational damage; material failure of risk management; a serious breach of the Group’s Global Code of 
Conduct; or individual gross misconduct. These provisions will apply from the date of the award until three years from the date of vesting.
All awards under the 2017 LTIP are subject to a further two-year holding period after the three-year performance period. The holding 
period will normally continue to apply post-employment. 
f) Other (audited)
Payments for loss of office
David Smith left the Group on 28 February 2017 and Colin Smith on 31 May 2017. Neither received a bonus award for 2017. 
David Smith served six months of his 12 months’ notice and received a payment in lieu of notice in relation to the remaining six months  
of his notice period, paid in monthly instalments. The Committee reduced these payments to account for his remuneration with QinetiQ 
resulting in total payments of £124k (which included unpaid holiday entitlement).
Colin Smith, having served four months of his 12 months’ notice, received total payments of £469k in lieu of notice payable to him in eight 
instalments. Seven of these instalments, totalling £418k, were paid to him in 2017. The final instalment, which related to the last month of his 
notice period, was paid in January 2018. Outplacement support has also been provided.
Both will retain pro-rated PSP awards, granted prior to leaving, subject to the Company meeting the performance targets for those awards  
and subject to and in accordance with the rules of the plan. Shares will only be released on the normal vesting dates.
Payments to past directors 
Colin Smith stepped down from the Board on 4 May 2017 and left the Group on 31 May 2017. A short-term agreement was put in place  
to represent the Company in an ambassadorial capacity for a maximum of 15 days to the end of 2017 and 35 days to the end of 2018.  
The 15 days that Colin carried out this role in 2017 will be paid in 2018. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

Directors’ Report
Remuneration Committee Report
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Implementation of remuneration policy in 2018
Base salary
There will be no change to base salary for 2018; base salaries remain as:
 — Warren East – £943,500 
 — Stephen Daintith – £680,000
Benefits
There will be no change to our approach to benefits in 2018, which includes car or car allowance, financial 
planning assistance, insurances and other benefits.
Pensions
There will be no change to our approach to pensions in 2018. Pension arrangements will be:
 — Warren East: cash allowance of 25% of salary
 — Stephen Daintith: cash allowance of 22% of salary 
Annual bonus
For 2018, bonuses will continue to be awarded using a simple additive approach:
 — 80% of the award will be based on Group performance
 — 20% of the award will be based on individual performance
For 2018, the Group measures will be unchanged, however there will be an increased weighting to free cash 
flow to emphasise this as the key performance metric for 2018:
Profit (25%) – Free cash flow (50%) – Customer delivery (12.5%) – Employee engagement (12.5%)
Maximum opportunities will remain unchanged:
 — Chief Executive – 180% of salary
 — Other Executive Directors – 150% of salary
LTIP awards
For awards to be granted in 2018 performance measures will be weighted:
 — 60% on CPS
 — 20% on EPS
 — 20% on relative TSR (versus FTSE 100 and Global S&P Index, to recognise that Rolls-Royce is a global 
company).
Performance will be measured over three years to 31 December 2020. Performance targets will be:
CPS
EPS 
IFRS 15 basis 
1
Relative TSR
Threshold (20% vesting) 95p 73p Median
Mid (50% vesting) 126p 86p Between median and upper quartile
Maximum (100% vesting) 158p 103p Upper quartile
1
 EPS is now based on IFRS 15 accounting which is a different basis from prior years’ targets.
Performance below threshold will result in that element lapsing in full.
The above targets are not an indication of forecast numbers for the three-year period.
Methodologies
CPS – calculated as reported cash flow before the cost of business acquisitions or proceeds of disposals, 
foreign exchange translation effects, special payments into pension schemes and payments to shareholders, 
divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue. CPS is cumulative over a three-year period. The 
Committee will review CPS performance to ensure that it is a fair reflection of achievements over the period. 
EPS – calculated as cumulative absolute underlying EPS over the three-year performance period on an  
IFRS 15 basis. 
Relative TSR – measured 50% against the constituents of the FTSE 100 and 50% against the constituents  
of the S&P Global Industrials index.
Award sizes for maximum performance 
 — Chief Executive: 250% of salary
 — Other Executive Directors: 225% of salary
Threshold vesting at 20% equates to 50% of salary for the Chief Executive and 45% of salary for other 
Executive Directors. LTIP awards will be subject to an additional shareholding period of two years following  
the three-year performance period. 92

Shareholding requirement 
Executive Directors are required to work towards holding beneficially-owned shares equivalent in value to a percentage of their salary 
by retaining at least one half of after-tax shares released from the PSP/LTIP until this requirement is met. For the Chief Executive this 
requirement is 250% of salary and for other Executive Directors this requirement is 200% of salary. The current shareholdings, as a 
percentage of the requirement, for Warren East and Stephen Daintith are 26% and 42% respectively.
*
 
*  The percentage of the requirement was calculated by reference to the May 2017 LTIP grant price and salary as at date of grant. Unvested PSP awards, LTIP awards and Sharesave 
options are not included in this calculation.

Pay across the organisation
This section of the report enables our remuneration arrangements to be seen in context by providing:
 — a comparison of the year-on-year percentage change in our Chief Executive’s remuneration with the change in average remuneration 
across the UK;
 — a year-on-year comparison of the total amount spent on employment costs across the Group and shareholder payments;
 — a nine-year history of our Chief Executive’s remuneration;
 — our TSR performance over the same period; and
 — an indication of the ratio between our Chief Executive’s remuneration and the remuneration of employees.
Percentage change in Chief Executive remuneration
The following table compares the percentage change in the Chief Executive’s salary, bonus and benefits (excluding LTIP) to the average 
percentage change in salary, bonus and benefits for all UK employees from 2016 to 2017.
Change in remuneration
Salary Benefits Annual bonus
Chief Executive 2% 0% 25.6%
UK employees average 
1
2.3% 5% 2.1%
1
  UK employees were chosen as a comparator group in order to avoid the impact of exchange rate movements over the year. UK employees excluding apprentices, graduates and 
interns, make up 45% of the total employee population.
Chief Executive pay ratio
The Committee is mindful of the relationship between the remuneration of the Chief Executive and the wider employee population.  
All employees participate in a bonus plan. We also encourage all employees to join our Sharesave plan, launched every two years.  
For our recent launch around 50% of our employees globally joined the plan, sharing in 14 million shares/stock appreciation rights. 
Included below is the ratio of the remuneration of the Chief Executive to other UK employees in the Group during 2017. The ratio will  
be higher when Group performance triggers incentive pay-outs. The ratio could vary significantly depending on the extent that the 
Group’s performance triggers the payment of short and long-term incentives.

  On 31 March 2011, Sir John Rose retired and John Rishton was appointed. John Rishton retired on 2 July 2015 and Warren East was appointed as Chief Executive on 3 July 2015.
2
  John Rishton received a special grant of shares on joining the Company on 1 March 2011 to mirror the shares he forfeited on resigning from his previous employer.  
The share price had increased from 483.50p at the time this grant was made to 870p at the end of 2014. These are the main reasons why John Rishton’s remuneration in 2012  
and 2013 exceeded that of his predecessor.

 The remuneration for Sir John Rose does not include any pension accrual or contribution as he received his pension from 1 February 2008.
TSR performance
The Company’s TSR performance over the previous nine years compared to a broad equity market index is shown in the graph below.  
The FTSE 100 has been chosen as the comparator because it contains a broad range of other UK-listed companies. The graph shows  
the growth in value of a hypothetical £100 holding in the Company’s ordinary shares over nine years, relative to the FTSE 100 index.

Gender pay reporting
The Company is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive place to work where our people can be themselves and be at their best. 
We published our gender pay gap in November 2017, which showed:
■ Median gender pay gap across all Rolls-Royce UK employees   
■ Mean gender pay gap across all Rolls-Royce UK employees
8.1%
8.3%
Overall, women currently represent 15% of Rolls-Royce UK employees. Women are less well-represented than this figure in the higher pay 
quartiles due to proportionally more men being in senior level roles. Increasing the number of women in our business and moving towards  
a more balanced distribution of men and women across all levels is very important. We are making progress on this in many ways, such as 
increasing the proportion of women in our apprentice and graduate intakes. More details are available on page 47 and at www.rolls-royce.com. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The Chairman’s fee is reviewed by the Board as a whole on the recommendation of the Committee. The review of the other Non-Executive 
Directors’ base fees is reserved to the Executive Directors, who consider recommendations from the Chairman. No individual may be 
involved in setting his or her own fee. The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Group’s 
share schemes, incentive arrangements or pension schemes. A facility is in place which enables Non-Executive Directors (who reside in a 
permitted dealing territory) to use some or all of their fees, after the appropriate statutory deductions, to make market purchases of shares 
in the Company on a monthly basis. Ruth Cairnie, Sir Frank Chapman, Ian Davis, Lee Hsien Yang and Sir Kevin Smith use this facility. 96

Introduction 
I am pleased to present the 2017 report of the Audit Committee 
which describes how the Committee has carried out its 
responsibilities during the year. I would like to thank the members  
of the Committee, the executive management team and KPMG  
for the open discussions that take place at our meetings and the 
importance they all attach to its work.
The Group has complex long-term accounting and every year  
we spend much of our time reviewing the accounting policies and 
accounting judgements implicit in our financial results. For 2017,  
this work has been compounded by preparing for the change in 
revenue recognition under IFRS 15, which has a major impact on  
the presentation of the accounts; management has been pro-active 
in analysing the effect of this new standard and providing input to 
the market on its impact, and we are satisfied that the interpretation, 
judgements, and estimates for IFRS 15 are appropriate. In addition, 
we reviewed the plans to implement IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
from 2018. 
As a result of the audit tender completed in 2016, we have been 
preparing for the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(PwC) as the Company's new auditor in 2018. This has required a 
significant effort to reassign work from PwC to ensure that they are 
independent, and I am delighted that they achieved this in October. 
The management team has introduced effective controls to ensure 
that PwC (and KPMG until the completion of their audit 
responsibilities) maintain their independence. 
2017 has also seen the finance team strengthened at the senior level. 
Significant progress has been made in financial analysis and 
reporting and in the supporting management information systems. 
This has provided additional support for the Committee's work. 
For 2018, work will continue to strengthen the control environment 
(including recommendations arising from the DPAs), review of all key 
accounting judgements, as well as reviewing the progress on IFRS 16 
Leases which takes effect from 2019.

Directors’ Report
Audit Committee Report
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Financial reporting
During the year, we considered proposals for revisions to the 
methodologies applied to determine when development costs 
should be capitalised and how they should be amortised. These  
are described in more detail on pages 124 and 128. The Committee 
agreed that the experience on the significant number of new 
programmes in the Civil Aerospace business and changes in the  
way in which technical risk is being managed on these programmes 
indicated that the criteria for the capitalisation of development costs 
were generally met at an earlier stage than has previously been 
assessed, and that costs eligible for capitalisation continue to be 
incurred after the first engines have entered service. We were 
satisfied that appropriate governance procedures and controls are  
in place to manage this revised methodology. The impact of this 
change in 2017 is the capitalisation of an additional £83m of costs. 
We also agreed that an amortisation methodology that reflects  
the number of engines in service better reflects the pattern of 
consumption of the intangible asset.
A summary of the principal matters we considered in respect of  
the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements is set out in the table  
on page 100. Where relevant (in particular, in regard to the carrying 
value of programme assets and estimates on long-term contractual 
arrangements) we took account of the potential impact of the 
in-service issues on the Civil Aerospace Trent 1000 and Trent 900 
programmes. These are described on page 24. 
We continued to monitor the implementation of new standards.  
Our conclusions on IFRS 15 are shown in the table on page 100.  
IFRS 9 is applicable from 2018. The impact on the Group is not 
significant and is described on page 130. IFRS 16 is applicable  
from 2019. In broad terms this requires a balance sheet liability  
to be reported for all leases. We considered progress of the project  
and analysis of the Group’s lease portfolio.
Since the year end, we have reviewed the form and content of  
the Company’s 2017 Annual Report, together with the processes 
used to prepare and verify it. We have reported to the Board that, 
taken as a whole, we consider the Annual Report to be fair, balanced 
and understandable. We further believe the Annual Report provides  
the necessary information for shareholders to adequately assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
In making this assessment, we considered:
 — the process for preparing the Annual Report, including a steering 
committee, the core team, and instructions to contributors;
 — written representations from management in respect of the 
business reviews, sustainability, principal risks and Financial 
Statements;
 — the completion of a regulatory compliance checklist;
 — all reviews performed (including the Board, the ELT and KPMG) 
and ensured that all feedback was appropriately reflected; and
 — the presentation and discussion in the Strategic Report of:  
(i) the underlying as well as reported results; (ii) the in-service 
issues on the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 programmes; and (iii) 
trends, in particular, the impact of individually significant items. 
Sector audit committees
To strengthen the ownership of accounting policies and controls, 
and to support our work, each of the Group’s businesses and 
principal functions has its own sector audit committee. These 
committees are chaired by the director of internal audit, comprise 
business functional leaders and senior finance personnel and are 
attended by KPMG. They meet twice a year and: 
 — review the application of accounting policies, judgements  
and estimates;
 — review risk management, internal control systems and issues 
arising at a more detailed level;
 — give us further assurance as to the extent of management control 
and accountability;
 — promote the governance culture within the Group; and
 — inform areas for further consideration at our meetings.
The director of internal audit reported to this Committee on  
key matters arising and also provided updates on the work and 
effectiveness of the sector audit committees during the year. 
In 2017, the sector audit committees continued to focus on the 
improvement projects for internal control and risk management 
process, in particular the embedding of these in our normal 
operational processes.
Members of the Committee attended at least one sector audit 
committee each, and we are satisfied that this process is now 
owned by the business and is helping to improve our risk 
management and the control environment.
Business and function presentations
In addition to a regular review of the sector audit committee process 
and any key issues identified, we have a regular schedule of 
presentations from each of the Group’s businesses and its key 
functions. During 2017, we received presentations from the following:
 — Civil Aerospace – key business risks (focusing on new programme 
introductions, ramp-up in production and in-service product 
issues); supply chain resilience; internal control environment 
(including financial analysis, the implementation of IFRS 15 in 2018 
and planning and forecasting capability to reflect the business 
growth); and accounting policies, judgements and estimates. 
 — Power Systems – key accounting estimates (including warranty 
provisions and the impact of the transformation programme);  
key business risks (including regulatory compliance,  
competitive position, and transformation programmes); and  
the control environment.
 — Nuclear – key accounting estimates (which principally relate  
to accounting for long-term contracts and are affected by the 
changing contractual arrangements with the UK MoD); key 
business risks (including government relations, programme 
delivery, IT security, and safety of nuclear facilities and products); 
future of civil nuclear markets; and the control environment.
 — Group tax director – the main drivers of the Group’s tax position 
and key tax risks and how they are managed (with specific 
consideration of tax disputes); key tax law developments and  
new requirements (in particular the new UK corporate offence  
of ‘failure to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion’); key sources  
of estimation uncertainty (in particular the recognition of deferred 
tax assets); and key tax-related disclosures. 100

Audit Committee Report
Areas of focus for the 2017 Financial Statements
Key issue Matters considered Outcome
Accounting for 
development costs
Methodology for capitalisation and amortisation 
of development costs – see pages 124 and 128
We are satisfied that the revised methodology for 
capitalisation and amortisation of development costs 
appropriately reflects changes in the ways in which risk 
is managed in the programmes and the consumption  
of the programme asset.
Impairment of the carrying 
values of programme 
assets in Civil Aerospace
Assessments of the values of the principal 
programme assets, including key assumptions  
and estimates – see page 143
We are satisfied that no write-down of programme 
assets is required.
Determining the 
appropriateness of the 
judgements and estimates 
used in accounting for 
long-term contractual 
arrangements
Continuing appropriateness of the judgements
 
We considered carefully the estimates used in the 
accounting regarding the cost of the in -service 
engine issues on the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 
programmes and the resulting performance 
improvements
We are satisfied that the judgements continue to be 
appropriate and that the process produces balanced 
estimates, with appropriate consideration of the 
uncertainties. No significant changes to the basis  
of preparation were made in 2017.
Classification of 
restructuring costs
The criteria for excluding certain costs from  
the underlying results and whether the costs 
meet this criteria – see page 135
We are satisfied that the agreed criteria have been 
consistently applied.
The sale of engines  
to joint ventures
Basis for assessing the selling price – see page 166 We are satisfied that the price represents the fair  
value of the engines.
Indications of impairment 
of goodwill in Marine
The forecasts and the key assumptions on  
which they are based – see page 143
We are satisfied that no impairment is required but, as 
the headroom remains low, we will continue to monitor 
this. We were also satisfied that no adjustments were 
required in 2017 as result of the reorganisation of 
Marine announced in January 2018.
Deferred tax assets  
(DTAs) and advance 
corporation tax
Basis for recognition of DTAs arising from tax 
losses and advance corporation tax in the UK  
and non-recognition of DTAs in Norway
Based on the Group’s forecasts and taking account  
of the current uncertainties in the oil & gas market,  
we are satisfied that the treatment is appropriate.
Acquisition of ITP Aero The acquisition accounting focusing on the 
remeasurement of the existing joint venture 
investment and the allocation of the purchase 
price to the assets acquired, giving rise to the 
recognition of a gain – see page 167 
We are satisfied that the provisional judgements  
and estimates made were appropriate and that,  
in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations,  
these will be finalised in 2018.
Implementation of IFRS 9 The assessment of judgements and estimates 
necessary to implement IFRS 9 in 2018 –  
see page 130
We are satisfied that the judgements and estimates  
are appropriate.
Implementation of IFRS 15 The progress of the project to implement IFRS 15 
in 2018 and the preparation of the disclosures  
of the impact of the change for 2017 (see pages 
55 to 57, 131 to 132 and 170 to 171)
We are satisfied that the judgements and estimates 
made are appropriate and consistent with the new 
requirements; that the disclosures of the impact are 
appropriate; and that the Group has systems and 
processes in place to report on the new basis in 2018. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

Directors’ Report
Audit Committee Report
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
We have conducted a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management and internal controls systems, including those 
relating to the financial reporting process, in accordance with  
the Code. These systems have been in place throughout 2017.  
We consider that they meet the requirements of the Code and  
the DTR.
Going concern and viability statements
We reviewed the processes and assumptions underlying the 
statements set out on page 63. In particular, we considered:
 — the Group’s forecast funding position over the next five years;
 — an analysis of impacts of severe but plausible risk scenarios, 
ensuring that these were consistent with the risks reviewed  
by the Board as part of its strategy review;
 — the impact of multiple risks occurring simultaneously;
 — additional mitigating actions that the Group could take in  
extreme circumstances; and
 — the current borrowing facilities in place and the availability  
of future facilities.
As a result, we were satisfied that the going concern and viability 
statements have been prepared on an appropriate basis.
Principal risks
We considered in detail the principal risks that have been allocated 
to us by the Board, see pages 61 and 62. From our discussions  
we are satisfied that all of the principal risks that we oversee  
have received significant management attention during the year. 
We reviewed:
Business continuity
In February, the director of civil aerospace operations updated  
us on how business continuity risks present in the external supply 
chain were being mitigated and governed. 
In November, the Group's chief information officer updated us on 
the programme of work to identify and mitigate potential IT single 
points of failure.
In December, the director of civil aerospace operations presented 
information on supply chain resilience and potential single points 
of failure in our internal supply chain. 
We also spent time reviewing progress made with improvements 
agreed last year to mitigate specific business continuity risks and  
to address internal audit recommendations.
IT vulnerability
In May, the director, security, risk & compliance updated the 
Committee on the potential key risks related to cyber security, how 
the threat landscape is changing and how lessons are being learnt. 
We also reviewed the cyber security strategy, designed to improve 
the visibility of threats, enforcement of cyber security policies and 
learning from intelligence gained about the main cyber risk actors 
as well as our ‘defence in depth’ approach.
In November, we received an update from the Group's chief 
information officer on the progress that was being made to  
mitigate the cyber security threats that we discussed in May. 
We also received ad hoc updates during cyber attacks such  
as WannaCry.
Risk and control environment
Assessment of principal risks
Risk management is a fundamental and integral part of how we  
work. All risks are managed through a risk management system  
(RMS – described on page 59) in accordance with policies and 
guidance approved by the Board.
Judgement is required in:
 — evaluating the risks facing the Group in achieving its objectives;
 — determining the risks that are considered acceptable;
 — determining the likelihood of those risks materialising;
 — identifying the Group’s ability to reduce the incidence and 
impact on the business of risks that do materialise; and
 — ensuring the costs of operating particular controls are 
proportionate to the benefit provided.
During 2017, on behalf of the Board, we monitored the RMS, 
including continued developments and improvements. These are 
described in more detail on page 59. We also specifically 
considered how risks at remote sites are identified and managed.
This process and the principal risks arising (see pages 59 to 62) 
then formed the basis for our assessment of the going concern and 
viability statements which are discussed on page 63. The processes 
are designed to identify and manage, rather than eliminate, the risk 
of failure to achieve our business objectives.
We satisfied ourselves that the processes for identifying and 
managing the principal risks are appropriate and that all risks and 
mitigating actions had been subject, during the year, to a detailed 
review by the Board or an appropriate Board committee. Based  
on this and on our other activities, including consideration of the 
work of internal and external audit and presentations from senior 
management of each business which include risk management,  
we reported to the Board that a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Company had been undertaken.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility to the shareholders for  
the Group’s system of internal control over its business and risk 
management processes and the risks identified through the  
risk management process. The Committee has responsibility  
for reviewing the system’s operation and effectiveness.
The system comprises:
 — entity-level controls covering leadership and direction from  
the top; and
 — specific control activities, covering detailed process controls, 
and internal and external assurance activities.
We routinely review controls over the Group’s principal risks and  
the key risks and critical processes in each of the Group’s businesses. 
Both the sector audit committees and this Committee also consider 
KPMG’s observations on the Group’s control environment.
During 2017, the Group completed the documentation of core 
financial controls in line with the plans established in 2015, and 
commenced a formal programme to continually assess and test  
the effective operation of those controls across the Group. In 
addition, it is extending the documentation of internal controls  
to include compliance controls relating to the DPAs. In 2017, the 
testing and assessment of core financial controls identified that 
further improvements are required to fully embed and mature these 
controls. Therefore new policies and formalised compensating 
internal controls specifically in respect of financial reporting  
were introduced.  102
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Directors’ Report
Audit Committee Report
We are satisfied that the scope, extent and effectiveness of internal 
audit work are appropriate for the Group and that there is a sound 
plan for ensuring that this continues to be the case as our business 
progresses and risks change. I was pleased to see that the continued 
improvement in the function was recognised by the Institute of 
Internal Audit when awarding it the Private Sector Outstanding  
Team of the Year.
External audit
2017 audit
During the year, KPMG presented the audit strategy, which 
identified their assessment of the key audit risks and the proposed 
scope of audit work. We agreed the approach and scope of audit 
work to be undertaken and we also assessed KPMG’s qualifications, 
expertise and resources, independence and the effectiveness  
of the external audit process. 
Key risks and the audit approach to these risks are discussed in  
the Independent Auditor’s Report (pages 183 to 194), which  
also highlights the other significant risks that KPMG drew to our 
attention. We continue to support the extended auditor’s report and 
KPMG’s approach which goes beyond the minimum requirements, 
providing additional clarity on the key judgements and estimates.
As part of the reporting of the half-year and full-year results, in  
July 2017 and February 2018, KPMG reported to the Committee  
on its assessment of the Group’s judgements and estimates in 
respect of these risks and the adequacy of the reporting. KPMG 
also reported on its assessment of the Group’s control environment. 
It is important that for areas of judgement that are finely balanced, 
KPMG provide additional insight to assist in making the most 
appropriate judgement. In our meetings and discussions with 
KPMG and management, it is clear that this role is being  
performed well.
I meet with the lead partner prior to each meeting and the whole 
Committee has a private meeting with KPMG at least once a year.
Non-audit services provided by KPMG
In order to safeguard the auditor’s independence and objectivity, 
and in accordance with the FRC’s Ethical Standard, we do not 
engage KPMG for any non-audit services except where it is work 
that they must, or are clearly best-suited to, perform. Accordingly, 
our policies for the engagement of the auditor to undertake 
non-audit services broadly limit these to audit-related services  
such as reporting to lenders and grant providers.
Fees paid to KPMG are set out on page 141 and summarised on page 
103. All proposed services must be pre-approved in accordance with  
the policy which is reviewed and approved annually. Above defined 
levels, my pre-approval is required. During 2017, we have further 
strengthened the process and controls in this area. We also review 
quarterly the non-audit fees charged by KPMG.
Market and financial shock
In July, we reviewed potential key risks, including liquidity and 
credit rating risks and how they are managed by the Group's 
financial risk committee.
We also considered the impact of other risks, notably changing 
accounting standards and Brexit. 
Our risk management system
In February, we reviewed the programme to enhance the risk 
management system and in July and December reviewed progress 
that had been made. In December, we also received an update  
from the head of enterprise risk management on the development  
of the risk appetite framework to use risk metrics to inform decision 
making. The framework includes upper and lower limits and triggers 
to provide early warning if the limit of the Group’s capacity to 
withstand principal risks was being approached.

The director of internal audit provides the Committee with:
 — quarterly: a dashboard identifying the key trends and findings 
from internal audit reports, and the resolution of actions agreed; 
 — biannually: a detailed update of significant findings and his 
perspectives on the internal control environment, management 
responses to underlying root causes and systemic issues; 
 — the results of audits on advisor processes (including payments) 
and conflicts of interest, as part of the Group's response to the 
DPAs; 
 — an annual report on compliance with expenses policies for  
the directors and ELT members; and
 — a work plan for the following year. 
I meet the director of internal audit privately before each meeting 
and on an ad-hoc basis throughout the year, as do other members  
of the Committee. As a whole, we have a private meeting with him  
at least once a year. These discussions cover the activities, findings, 
resolution of control weaknesses, progress against the agreed plan 
and the resourcing of the department. Specific topics discussed in 
2017 included: process and control design; compliance to process; 
data security and integrity; project management; and accountability.
The nature and number of issues raised by internal audit and the 
time to complete the related actions remains a key focus. We pay 
particular attention to the small number of overdue actions and 
were pleased to observe a continued reduction in the time to 
complete actions. 
The plan is developed to focus on the key risks facing the business. 
We monitor changes during the course of the year.
We considered and reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal audit function, including resources, plans and performance 
as well as the function’s interaction with management. The outcome 
of the 2017 review was positive and identified opportunities for 
continued improvement which are being implemented. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Looking forward
As well as our regular review of accounting policies, our focus  
will include:
 — the audit transition activities;
 — the implementation of IFRS 16, including the supporting 
processes and controls;
 — embedding and maturing the finance processes and core 
financial controls with continued training and education;
 — completion of the documentation of compliance controls  
relating to the DPAs;
 — strengthening the information technology controls over key 
finance systems; and
 — the continuing development of the management information 
systems and improvements to the underlying systems and tools.
In addition to the continuing oversight by the Safety & Ethics 
Committee of the ethics and compliance programme (see page 109),  
we will continue to monitor the Group’s actions relating to risk 
management, internal controls and other matters relevant to  
the Committee that arise out of Lord Gold’s recommendations,  
and from the agreements with prosecuting authorities.

Based on our review of the services provided by KPMG and

the nature nor the scale of these services gave any concerns 
regarding the objectivity or independence of KPMG.
Auditor transition and appointment of PwC
The Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the Board 
with regard to the appointment of the external auditor. 
Following the audit tender process in 2016, we recommended to  
the Board that PwC be appointed as auditor for the financial year 
commencing 1 January 2018. No contractual obligations restricted 
our choice of external auditor. 
During 2017, we have monitored the activities of the audit transition 
team, which was established to ensure that the transition is as 
seamless as possible. A key part of the activities was to ensure  
that, on appointment, PwC meets the independence requirements 
and that we have procedures to ensure that this is maintained (and 
that of KPMG until the completion of their audit responsibilities).  
This involved moving existing PwC engagements, most significantly 
global tax compliance, to alternative providers. PwC became 
independent in October 2017. As well as this, during 2017, PwC  
has attended the Committee meetings and sector audit committee 
meetings, made familiarisation visits to our major sites and held  
a global planning workshop. Following the confirmation of 
independence, PwC has reviewed KPMG’s audit files for 2016  
and our key accounting policies and judgements, including  
those relating to IFRS 15. We are also working on a detailed plan  
for each of the subsidiary companies around the world.
KPMG has been the Company's auditor since 1990. On behalf  
of the Company, I express my thanks to them for their contribution 
over this period.
Ian Chambers, as the PwC lead audit partner, will be required to 
rotate after five years and other key audit partners will be required 
to rotate every seven years. We will monitor compliance with these 
requirements. The Committee and the Board will recommend PwC’s 
appointment at the 2018 AGM.

Review of the Group’s refreshed approach to sustainability
Introduction 
This year the importance of the Committee’s role in assisting the 
Board, and guiding and overseeing management, has been evident. 
As part of organisational transformation, there has been significant 
executive leadership emphasis on driving greater ambition in all 
aspects of safety and ethics. Employee, customer and public 
expectations in these areas continue to increase. I and the other 
Committee members welcome the opportunity to support the 
leadership as it strives for continuous performance improvement. 
The Committee has carefully monitored compliance with the DPAs. 
We have reviewed the handling of product in-service issues, the 
investigations and conclusions from occupational health and safety 
and asset integrity incidents, and have acted as a sounding board for 
plans to improve the Group’s vigour and approach to sustainability.
Operation of the Committee 
All members of the Committee are independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Our biographies are on page 67. The Committee’s 
responsibilities are outlined in its terms of reference, available  
at www.rolls-royce.com, which we review annually and refer to  
the Board for approval.
In addition to the usual scheduled meetings during the year, the 
Committee added extra calls in April and October so that we could 
maintain more regular oversight over the Group’s compliance with  
its obligations under the DPAs, the implementation of Lord Gold’s 
recommendations on ethics and compliance, and the embedding  
of compliance culture within the businesses. We held an 
unscheduled meeting to receive an update on the latest discussions 
with regulators following the DPAs. The Committee also conducted 
an on-site product safety review of Defence Aerospace operations.

Safety & Ethics Committee Report
Product safety
Rolls-Royce aims to go beyond compliance with regulatory product 
safety standards, setting a goal of continuous product safety 
improvement, in common with other industry participants. This is 
regarded as fundamental to the Group’s licence to operate and to 
the sustainability of our business. Product safety encompasses the 
design, manufacture, assembly, installation, in-service operation, 
maintenance and repair of products, across all of our businesses,  
and regions where we operate. It is critical that product safety 
processes develop continuously to underpin the science and 
technological innovation that enables product designs to evolve  
and extend operational boundaries.
In 2017, we continued with our rolling review programme of key 
product safety topics across the Rolls-Royce businesses, as well  
as considering special topics and in-service issues as they arose.
Throughout the year, we retained a focus on how safety risk was 
being managed through the period of transformation for the  
Group. This included overseeing changes to the product safety 
governance model and policy to reflect new organisational 
accountabilities aligned to changes in senior operations and 
engineering roles. We also emphasised the importance of ensuring 
safety processes continued on a positive trajectory against a 
backdrop of organisational change and pursuit of operational  
and cost efficiencies. Emphasis continued on the evolution of  
our product safety competence across the workforce, with new 
employees being appropriately trained on processes from the outset.
We monitor improvements that are proposed to the Group’s product 
safety management system (SMS). We reviewed the work of the 
product safety process council, part of the role of which is to ensure 
that the product safety processes are clearly understood and 
effective. The council gathers information from a broad range of 
sources including KPIs, audits, user surveys and feedback, and safety 
governance forums. Together these ensure that there is regular, 
diverse activity to monitor the state of our safety processes.  
These indicators showed the product safety processes to be 
effective, efficient and fit-for-purpose, and also continued to 
highlight opportunities for improvement in some areas. This led to 
work in 2017 on: continued communication to increase awareness; 
further safety case guidance and user support; document 
simplification and updates; development of a product safety 
assurance case; reporting tool simplifications; corporate audit of 
targeted safety processes; and updates to the senior managers’ 
product safety awareness training.
We reviewed progress on the use of a safety case to articulate  
why a product is acceptably safe to operate, supported by 
evidence (see example safety case below). The preparation of  
a product safety case was introduced to the Group’s processes 
based on best practice from the Rolls-Royce Nuclear business.  
We saw how the introduction of a safety case served to increase 
further the focus on safety in a structured and consistent manner 
across the businesses. We also noted the lessons being learned  
and captured for future projects on how to structure safety cases.
The Committee received briefings at each of its meetings during  
the year on issues that had arisen with products in service. These 
included updates on investigations of root cause, assessment of 
implications, and oversight of the Group’s response. The Committee 
was satisfied that processes and plans were appropriate and effective 
in identifying, managing and retiring safety risk. We were kept 
updated on the programme to address the issues previously 
identified on the Trent 1000 fleet and were satisfied with the 
approach taken from a safety perspective. 
In February, we reviewed the overall metrics for product safety  
in 2016. We noted that neither the number nor rate of safety events 
for 2016 indicated any significant concern with either the safety 
performance of the Group’s products or with performance  
in managing safety issues.
In December, we reviewed the processes for ensuring competence  
in manufacturing, as an element of the SMS. 
We were briefed on the activity during the year to refresh the 
product safety training for employees, which we noted would  
be more targeted to particular roles.
We also reviewed the product safety principal risk and supported 
the proposal to the Board to redefine this as product safety  
(you can read more about this on page 59).

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
HSE
The Committee maintained focus on HSE developments during  
a particularly challenging year in this area.
We regret to report that there were two employee fatalities in 
October. The first was the death of an electrical engineer employed 
in the civil nuclear business, while working at a customer site  
in central France. The matter remains under investigation.  
The second was an employee of Power Systems who died from 
injuries sustained in a road traffic accident while on the way to a 
customer’s site in Germany. No other vehicles were involved. These 
two tragic incidents have remained under the Committee’s review 
and are a stark reminder of the critical importance of managing HSE 
effectively across all activities. The leadership’s heightened HSE 
performance ambition aims to eliminate all recordable incidents. 
We were given detailed briefings on HSE matters throughout the 
year. In July and December, we reviewed the Group’s HSE key 
activities, performance metrics, insights and learning, noting that  
the total reportable injury (TRI) rate was behind the year-on-year 
target trajectory. Again, this added stimulus to the leadership’s 
determination to achieve higher HSE performance levels. Asset 
integrity, infrastructure maintenance and control of contractors  
were common factors across a number of these incidents and will  
be targeted for improvement as part of the structured HSE 
improvement plans.

We were briefed on the Group’s asset care strategy for Group 
property assets and manufacturing assets, noting that the  
property maintenance capital programme had been revised  
and re-prioritised based on asset criticality, condition, reliability 
data and lifecycle cost. We were encouraged that quarterly asset 
reports for certain sites outside the Americas had been introduced 
to provide an overview to local stakeholders of maintenance 
provided, costs, safety critical maintenance requirements, 
equipment reliability analysis, training needs and improvements 
delivered. We also welcomed the introduction of a new leading 
indicator to track planned maintenance schedule adherence for 
high-consequence safety critical equipment.
Slips, trips and falls remained the highest single cause of reportable 
injury and we reviewed the range of activities undertaken to 
mitigate this risk, including housekeeping, toolkits to help leaders 
engage and reinforce safety awareness, and a dynamic risk 
assessment application for use by employees working at customer 
locations to assess the safety risk level of their work environment.
DEFENCE AEROSPACE PRODUCT SAFETY 
WORKSHOP 
In order to provide effective oversight of product safety risk, 
the Committee remains conversant with product safety 
processes and the Group’s SMS. In September 2017, we focused 
our attention on product safety in Defence Aerospace with a 
visit to the Group’s facilities in Bristol, UK. 
We were briefed by the product safety leadership team on 
Defence Aerospace markets, products and operating 
environments. We learned about the governance of product 
safety through a robust product safety review board structure. 
We also discussed the product safety processes within Defence 
Aerospace joint ventures and how these interact with the 
Group’s own processes under a defined management plan.
We examined specific cases, how these were being handled, 
findings, corrective measures taken and the relationship 
management maintained with third parties involved. We were 
given a detailed briefing on the ‘red top’ and safety alert report 
processes, and reviewed current metrics.
We also gained an understanding of the military certification 
regulatory regimes and how these differ from the equivalent 
civil aerospace processes. This covered how engine 
documentation on legacy platforms is registered to maintain 
product knowledge and enable continuing support under the 
business’ historic engines policy.
We visited the Defence Aerospace operations centre and  
saw how incidents in service are handled. We then moved  
on to air safety investigations with a visit to the investigations 
workshops. We observed how the forensic teams work as 
leaders in this field using advanced equipment and techniques 
such as electron beam microscopy and 3D scanning.
We visited the maintenance, repair and overhaul facility, where 
we were able to gauge a strong and supportive product safety 
culture on the shop floor. We also viewed the new test bed  
for the TP400 engine that will allow for significantly enhanced 
test capability. The day finished with further discussions over 
dinner with key members of the Defence Aerospace team.
Overall, the workshop provided a good level of confidence  
to the Committee that the SMS, as operated in Defence 
Aerospace, was effective, robust and competently operated. 108

model. This approach allows the sustainability team to support  
the businesses and functions in embedding consideration of 
sustainability issues into core business strategies, policies, risk 
assessments, decision-making tools and programmes, and in  
doing so to identify and exploit opportunities.
The Committee has previously cautioned against the introduction  
of too many new safety and ethics initiatives, with attendant risks  
of confusion and dilution of key messages. A fresh look has been 
taken across these initiatives and many have been rationalised as 
part of a simpler approach. 
We were briefed during the year on the Group’s response to the  
new EU Non-Financial Reporting Regulations, UK gender pay gap 
reporting, and consideration of the recommendations of the FSB 
Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), as well  
as the publication in early 2018 of the Group’s annual update on 
progress against the UK Modern Slavery Act revisions.
Our overall score in the annual Dow Jones Sustainability Index  
(DJSI) declined slightly in 2017 versus 2016. Analysis showed this was 
largely as a result of the introduction of new question sets, significant 
changes to other sections, and receiving a lower score in the codes 
of conduct and export control sections as a result of the regulatory 
investigations leading to the DPAs in January. We were pleased  
to remain within the top 10% overall and to remain listed in both  
the DJSI World index (as one of only four aerospace and defence 
companies out of 36 invited to participate) and DJSI Europe index. 
Particularly encouraging was that we achieved the maximum 
possible score for environmental reporting and the industry-leading 
scores for human rights and stakeholder engagement. This 
contributed to the Company qualifying for inclusion in RobecoSAM’s 
2018 Sustainability Yearbook and receiving a Bronze Class distinction 
for excellent sustainability performance.
We reviewed a proposal to revise the Group’s target, set at the end 
of 2014, to reduce the amount of waste produced from the Group’s 
operations by 25% by 2020, normalised on turnover. Due to 
historical data discrepancies and inaccuracies we agreed a 
proposal in June 2017 to retain the 25% reduction target but to 
extend the time period to achieve this from 2020 to 2025. 
In July, we received a briefing on the Group’s aspiration to achieve 
significantly higher levels of HSE performance and move Rolls-Royce 
to a leading position in HSE across all businesses. We noted the 
benchmarking that had been undertaken with a number of large 
companies and supported the Group’s adoption of the HSE maturity 
model shown above, and the refocused strategy of themes and 
enablers to achieve high reliability.
The ELT members conducted a focused session in November  
on safety culture, challenging themselves on what more could  
be done to promote vigilance and awareness to keep employees 
safe. We were briefed on this in December and were encouraged  
to see commitment to demonstrating strong and sustained safety 
leadership. Work continues on developing structured improvement 
plans and defining common leadership themes and communications 
plans. The Committee will be keeping the Group’s progress on this 
under close review during 2018 and beyond.
Sustainability
Some organisational changes in the first half of the year provided an 
opportunity for a fresh look at the Group’s approach to sustainability.
We were briefed in July on some changes to the HSE and 
sustainability team structure to enable more strategic and aligned 
thinking across broader sustainability themes. In December, the 
team returned to present an update on a refreshed sustainability 
strategy. We discussed and endorsed a move away from having  
a separate, standalone, sustainability strategy with its own vision 
and principles, in favour of building on the strong alignment to  
the Group’s refreshed vision, its strategic focus areas and business

Directors’ Report
Safety & Ethics Committee Report
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
In the 2016 Annual Report, we reported on the significant reduction 
in the number of advisers used by the Group over recent years, and 
the stringent vetting process for any new engagements. We kept  
the level and nature of adviser engagements under review in 2017, 
and were notified of any claims received during the year from any 
advisers who had been terminated in the past. We noted the careful 
approach taken with regard to termination of certain Power Systems’ 
advisers to ensure that customers were not exposed to gaps in 
capability for safety-critical work.
We kept the resourcing and capabilities of the compliance team 
under review, both centrally and within the businesses. We were 
satisfied that the responsibilities of the director of risk, who left the 
business during the year, had been assumed either by the general 
counsel or the chief compliance counsel through an orderly 
transition process. We recognised the need for the compliance  
team to remain appropriately balanced between roles in the central 
team and within the businesses. We were therefore supportive  
of the recruitment of the new director of ethics and compliance  
at Power Systems, and the proposed addition of a number of new 
roles. We also recommended that likely resourcing requirements  
for the compliance function in the longer term be considered. 
Another area of interest for the Committee, and for Lord Gold, 
during the year was the coordination of training, disciplinary 
processes and the employee communications strategy to help  
drive the desired culture. We received briefings from the Group  
HR Director and members of her team, with input from the chief 
compliance counsel, on activity in this area. The Committee 
recognised the need to balance the drive to embed accountability 
for behaviour with considerations of employees’ legal rights to 
privacy, but encouraged the team to explore ways to show the 
workforce real examples of consequences for breach of the Global 
Code or group policies, or for failure to complete mandatory training.
We examined proposals to refresh the Global Code in 2018. The 
current Global Code was first introduced in 2013 and we agreed that 
a comprehensive review was therefore timely. The new Global Code 
will also be supported by new training modules designed to bring  
it to life in a simple, understandable and relevant way, focusing on 
behaviours. We look forward to seeing progress on this in 2018.  
We were also pleased to see this approach to providing a simplified 
and more concise document being applied in the consolidation  
of several group policies into one simple manual for employees.
Looking forward
Overall, this has been a year of challenge in all of the areas overseen 
by the Committee, that has required us to be constructively critical 
and supportive of management’s ambitions and plans.
In 2018, we will continue our focus on ensuring the Group 
progresses its ambitions for an improved HSE performance, 
continues to evolve product safety processes and meets its 
regulatory obligations under the DPAs. More generally, we will 
continue to provide support to management on the embedding of 
a productive culture encompassing all aspects of safety and ethics.
Sir Frank Chapman 
Chairman of the Safety & Ethics Committee
A new executive-level environment and sustainability committee, 
co-chaired by the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Technology 
Officer, was formed during the year to provide executive level 
oversight of the Group’s response to sustainability issues including 
policy, approach and related KPIs.
Overall, the Committee is supportive of the increased focus  
and governance on sustainability topics and with the continued 
strengthening of the Group’s reporting. This includes the Group’s 
updated website at www.rolls-royce.com/sustainability, which has  
its contents structured around the core topic areas of environment, 
people, ethics, customers and suppliers, and performance.
You can read more about the Group’s sustainability activities  
on pages 44 to 49.
Ethics and compliance
Following the DPAs, much of the Committee’s focus in the year has 
been on overseeing the Group’s work plans to meet its continuing 
obligations to the regulators, and monitoring progress in 
implementing the recommendations put forward by Lord Gold in  
his reports. Lord Gold himself attended most Committee meetings 
during the year and updated the Committee on how he has been 
overseeing and supporting this work, as well as reporting on his 
particular areas of focus and activities. This included a review of 
processes for the granting of commercial concessions to customers, 
and attending employee focus groups and other internal events to 
understand views from the workforce on ‘speaking up’ and on the 
Group’s culture in the area of ethics and compliance.
The Committee has also taken a keen interest in hearing from the 
leaders of some of the businesses as to how ethics and compliance 
are being embedded into the Group’s culture in practice. We 
scheduled two additional Committee meetings, which took place  
in April and October, to provide more time for status updates and 
discussion of these topics.
We discussed the need for the business leadership to continue  
to drive the right behaviours, as well as having the right processes, 
so that individuals are accountable for their own actions and feel 
able to speak up. To help us understand how this was progressing, 
we received separate updates from the president and the chief 
compliance officer of the Civil Aerospace business, and from the 
chief financial officer and general counsel & head of integrity  
at Power Systems. It was noted that the businesses operated  
globally across territories that had different levels of maturity  
and sophistication regarding ethics and compliance, and this  
could present challenging situations for employees such as field 
service engineers who work in remote locations. A programme of 
compliance verification visits to selected sites had been introduced 
to check the effectiveness of training and levels of awareness, so  
that any gaps could be promptly addressed. We heard about specific 
examples of areas for improvement being identified and addressed 
either through additional training or improved communications, 
processes or controls. Overall we were assured that the leadership 
teams, supported by the central ethics and compliance function, 
were setting the ‘tone from the top’, by expressing clearly and 
regularly the high standards expected and encouraging  
employees to speak up.
At each of our meetings during the year, we received an update  
from the General Counsel on the Group’s continuing dialogue and 
cooperation with regulators and government agencies. We also 
received reports and briefings from the chief compliance counsel  
on ethics and compliance matters generally.  110

ADVANCE3
In May, we viewed a live virtual tour of the Advance3 where we 
were shown some of the expert work on how the demonstrator 
engine was being assembled and the high degree of 
instrumentation required in preparation for the initial engine test. 
The Advance3 reflects a new engine core architecture (the 
high pressure system and the intermediate pressure system 
differ from the Trent engine family) and includes new 
technology such as a radically revised fuel system. 
The Committee was updated on each of the businesses’ electrical 
systems demonstrator programmes which vary significantly in 
complexity and pace. This highlighted implications in terms of skills, 
the requirement for a resourcing strategy, as well as a shift in 
thinking for senior leadership.
Rolls-Royce has a solid platform of electrical activities on which  
to build, covering rail (hybrid trains), power generation (including 
micro-grids), marine (hybrid and full electric ships) and applications 
in aerospace. We also noted the strong opportunity for  
cross-company synergies in electrical systems.
In May, as part of the review of competitiveness of civil aero engines, 
we visited our site in Derby, UK, where we received a tour of the 
Trent XWB final assembly and test facility, the large aero engine 
development test facility and test preparation area. 
2017 overview
The Committee’s main focus for 2017 was on our technology 
strategy and on aligning this to the Group’s strategic reviews,  
the allocation of technology funding and our competitiveness  
in key technology and product areas. At the beginning of the year, 
we reviewed the programme of work to deliver in 2017 and the 
investment funding allocation and received an update on the 
progress made on technology plans for each business. 
Of note was a significant increase in spend in our aerospace 
businesses as activity on our technology demonstrator programmes 
ramps up. Although there were resource constraints, the overall 
programme was considered reasonable.
We gave our support to management in seeking to take a new 
approach to strategic planning for technology. In the past, 
investment has been allocated principally by matching resource  
bids from the businesses to our product strategies. At the beginning 
of the year, it had been decided by management that a stronger 
Group-driven approach should be developed to allocate investment 
across different types of technology programmes which provided 
synergy and opportunity across the Group. This will achieve a better 
balance of product-specific technologies with broader sector 
opportunity. Each Committee member gave time to management 
individually and provided input to help shape the approach and  
align it to the Group’s strategy. 
We received a briefing on the Group’s activities in additive layer 
manufacturing (ALM), its development, supply chain and reasons 
for its importance.
We noted that the use of ALM globally has been rising at a  
35% compound annual growth rate. The Group is exploring  
a number of partnership and supply chain strategies to accelerate 
its development. The Group’s technology focus in ALM is on 
specialised materials, such as high temperature alloys and parts 
with high value and high manufacturing complexity. The Committee 
benefited significantly from a visit to the ALM research facility  
in 2016 and will keep the delivery of the Group’s strategy for  
ALM under review.
Throughout the year, the Committee discussed technology 
competitiveness and carried out a specific review on the Civil 
Aerospace business and the market for large engines. We looked  
at: the business’ product and technology strategies and product 
evolution path; the relative position on key technologies versus 
competitors; the fundamental capability drivers and enabling 
technologies; and an analysis of our R&D/R&T spend compared to 
competitors. A similar session was held with the Power Systems team 
to discuss competitiveness of our reciprocating engine technology.
We also reviewed the Group’s emerging electrical systems strategy. 
There is a growing demand for electrical capability across all our 
platforms hence this is an important area of focus to ensure the 
Group positions itself competitively for the future. We heard about  
potential future applications of hybrid electrical configurations  
for aircraft in the aerospace businesses and how electrical systems 
technology was rapidly increasing in the markets addressed by  
our Marine and Power Systems businesses.  Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

Directors’ Report
Science & Technology Committee Report
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
We also received a virtual tour of the UltraFan power gearbox rig  
via videolink from Dahlewitz, Germany. This facility is the largest  
of its kind in the world and is critical to supporting changes to 
engine architecture and component technologies to form the core 
of the next generation of more efficient Rolls-Royce aero engines. 
The rig simulates real in-service pitch and roll conditions by tilting 
the gearbox to place it under different torque and load, which 
enables analysis of oil flows for heat management. The rig is now 
fully functional and provides the Group with a very powerful 
capability for the future.
In September, the Board visited our site in Bristol, UK and also  
had the opportunity to visit the National Composites Centre (NCC).  
The NCC was established by the University of Bristol, in collaboration 
with sponsors including Rolls-Royce, and its key objective is to 
enable UK design and manufacturing enterprises to deliver winning 
solutions in the application of composites. The visit provided 
valuable background to our understanding of the technology 
development route for the UltraFan composite fan system.
In December 2016, the Committee was allocated responsibility  
for overseeing management of the Group’s new principal risk of 
disruptive technologies and business models. This was brought  
to the Committee twice for discussion in 2017. We were updated  
on the key processes the Company has developed to keep the risk 
under review, including five advisory boards with external subject 
matter experts that report to and support the ELT.
Looking forward
In my view, the Science & Technology Committee is the most  
exciting and uplifting of the Board committees and I feel privileged 
to chair it. Our subject matter is the life blood of the Group vested 
in some extremely talented people. I am grateful to all of them for 
the support they have given during the year.
I have been pleased with our progress this year as the Group has 
carried out a detailed review of its technology strategy.
In 2018, we will continue to focus on supporting management and 
the Board in further deploying this strategy with a particular focus 
on technology skills and capability development and building 
partnerships to accelerate progress.

The Company
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The Consolidated Financial Statements  
of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2017 consist of the consolidation of the Financial Statements of the Company  
and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’) and include the Group’s interest in jointly controlled and associated entities. 
Basis of preparation and statement of compliance
In accordance with European Union (EU) regulations, these Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as adopted for use in the EU effective 
at 31 December 2017 (Adopted IFRS). 
The Company has elected to prepare its individual Company Financial Statements under FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.  
They are set out on pages 172 to 174 and the accounting policies in respect of Company Financial Statements are set out on page 173.
These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except where Adopted IFRS requires the 
revaluation of financial instruments to fair value and certain other assets and liabilities on an alternative basis – most significantly 
post-retirement scheme obligations are valued on the basis required by IAS 19 Employee Benefits – and on a going concern basis  
as described on page 63.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling which is the Company’s functional currency.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with Adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements and estimates that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and 
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Key areas of judgement
Introduction
The Group generates a significant portion of its revenue and profit on aftermarket arrangements arising from the installed original 
equipment (OE) fleet. As a consequence, the Group will often agree contractual prices for OE deliveries that take into account the 
anticipated aftermarket arrangements. Accounting policies reflect this aspect of the business model, in particular the policies for the 
recognition of contractual aftermarket rights and the linkage of OE and actual aftermarket arrangements.
When a civil large engine is sold, the economic benefits received usually far exceed the cash receivable under the contract, due to the 
rights to valuable aftermarket spare parts business. However, because the value of this right cannot be estimated with enough precision, 
accounting standards require that the revenue recognised in the accounts on sale of the engine is restricted to a total amount that results 
in a break even position. The amount of the revenue recognised in excess of cash receivable is recognised as an intangible asset, which is 
called a contractual aftermarket right (CAR). 
There is only one circumstance where accounting standards require the recognition of more of the value of the aftermarket rights 
when an engine is sold. This occurs where a long-term aftermarket contract (generally a TotalCare agreement – TCA) and an engine 
sale contract have been negotiated together. In this circumstance, the part of the aftermarket rights covered by the TCA can be valued 
much more precisely and is recognised at the time of the engine sale through accounting for the engine sale and TCA as a single contract. 
Nevertheless, the accounting profit recognised is still less than the economic benefits on the sale as there will be other valuable 
aftermarket rights (for instance for the period beyond the TCA term or for the sale of parts which are outside the scope of the TCA) 
which cannot be recognised.
The Group enters into arrangements with long-term suppliers to share the risks and rewards of major programmes – risk and revenue 
sharing arrangements (RRSAs). The accounting policy for these arrangements has been chosen, consistent with Adopted IFRS, to reflect 
their commercial effect.
The key judgements in determining these accounting policies are described below. 
Contractual aftermarket rights 
On delivery of Civil Aerospace engines, the Group has contractual rights to supply aftermarket parts to the customers and its intellectual 
rights, warranty arrangements and, where relevant, statutory airworthiness or other regulatory requirements provide reasonable control 
over this supply. The Directors consider that these rights meet the definition of an intangible asset in IAS 38 Intangible Assets. However, 
the Directors do not consider that it is possible to determine a reliable fair value for this intangible asset. Accordingly, an intangible asset 
(CAR) is only recognised on the occasions where the contractual price of the engine is below the cost of manufacture and then only to  
the extent of this deficit, as this amount is reliably measurable. An equal amount of revenue is recognised at the same point. Where a 
long-term aftermarket contract is linked to the OE contract (see page 123), the contractual price of the engine (including amounts 
allocated from the aftermarket contract) is above its cost of manufacture; consequently no CAR is recognised.
Measure of performance on long-term aftermarket contracts
A large proportion of the Group’s activities relate to long-term aftermarket contracts, in particular TotalCare and similar arrangements  
in Civil Aerospace. Under these contracts, the Group’s primary obligation is to maintain customers’ equipment in an operational condition 
and it achieves this by undertaking various activities, such as engine monitoring, line maintenance and repair and overhaul, over the 
122
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued
period of the contract. In general, the Directors consider that the stage of performance of the contract should be by reference to the 
obligation to maintain an operational fleet and that this is best measured by the operation of the fleet. Accordingly, stage of performance 
is measured by reference to flying hours of each fleet under contract. Consistent with the above, the Directors also consider that, in 
general, all costs incurred to meet the primary obligation should be included in the accounting for these contracts, even if these costs had 
not been originally anticipated. This includes the additional costs being incurred to address the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 in-service 
issues. (In contrast, provision is made when additional costs on non long-term contract arrangements are identified.)
Linkage of OE and long-term aftermarket contracts 
Where the key terms of a long-term aftermarket contract are substantively agreed (e.g. in a term sheet) at the same time as an OE contract 
with the operator, the Directors consider these to be linked for accounting purposes and they are treated as a single contract, as this best 
reflects the overall commercial effect. Where the OE contract is not with the operator (e.g. where it is with an OE manufacturer or a lessor) 
the contracts are not linked as they were not negotiated on a unified basis.
Sales of spare engines to joint ventures
Whether the sales price reflects fair value when the Group sells spare engines to a joint venture company. 
Risk and revenue sharing arrangements
RRSAs with key suppliers (workshare partners) are a feature of our Civil Aerospace business. Under these contractual arrangements,  
the key commercial objectives are that: (i) during the development phase the workshare partner shares in the risks of developing an 
engine by performing its own development work, providing development parts and paying a non-refundable cash entry fee; and (ii) during 
the production phase it supplies components in return for a share of the programme revenue as a ‘life of type’ supplier (i.e. as long as  
the engine remains in service). The share of development costs borne by the workshare partner and of the revenue it receives reflect  
the partner’s proportionate cost of providing its production parts compared to the overall manufacturing cost of the engine. The share  
is based on a jointly-agreed forecast at the commencement of the arrangement.
These arrangements are complex and have features that could be indicative of: a collaboration agreement, including sharing of risk and cost 
in a development programme; a long-term supply agreement; sharing of intellectual property; or a combination of these. In summary, and  
as described below, the Directors’ view is that the development and production phases of the contract should be considered separately  
in accounting for the RRSA, which results in the entry fee being matched against the non-recurring costs incurred by the Group.
Having considered the features above, the Directors consider that there is no directly applicable IFRS to determine an accounting policy 
for the recognition of entry fees of this nature in the income statement. Consequently, in developing an accounting treatment for such 
entry fees that best reflects the commercial objectives of the contractual arrangement, the Directors have analysed these features in the 
context of relevant accounting pronouncements (including those of other standard setters where these do not conflict with IFRS) and have 
weighed the importance of each feature in faithfully representing the overall commercial effect. The most important considerations that 
need to be balanced are: the transfer of development risk; the workshare partner receiving little standalone value from the payment of the 
entry fee; and the overall effect being collaboration between the parties which falls short of being a joint venture as the Group controls 
the programme. Also important in the analysis is the fact that, whilst the Group and the workshare partner share risks and rewards through 
the life of the contract, these risks and rewards are very different during the development and production phases.
In this context, the entry fee might be considered to represent: an amount paid as an equalisation of development costs; a payment to 
secure a long-term supply arrangement; a purchase of intellectual property; or some combination thereof. The accounting under these 
different scenarios could include: recognition of the entry fee to match the associated costs in the income statement; being spread over 
the life of the programme as a reduction in the cost of supply during production; or being spread over the time period of the access  
to the intellectual property by the workshare partner.
The Directors consider that the most important features of the arrangement are the risk sharing and that the entry fee represents a 
contribution to the development costs that the Group incurs in excess of its proportionate programme share. The key judgements taken in 
reaching this view are: the entry fee is determined by the parties on that basis and the contract specifies that, in the event that a derivative 
engine is to be developed, additional entry fees will also be calculated on this basis; the workshare partners describe the entry fee in this 
way; although the workshare partner receives little stand-alone value from paying the entry fee, the entry fee together with its own 
development activities represent its aggregate investment in the collaboration; the amount of the entry fee does not include any amount 
in excess of that necessary to equalise forecast development costs; the Group is not ‘on risk’ for the full development costs it incurs but  
for that amount less the entry fees received.
The resulting accounting policy (described on page 126) represents the commercial effect of the contractual arrangements in that the 
Group recognises only those development costs to which it is exposed (and thus reflects the significant transfer of development risk  
to the workshare partner) and the costs of supply of parts during the production phase is measured at the workshare partner’s share  
of programme revenue (which we consider to be a commercial fair value). The Directors do not consider that accounting which would 
result in entry fees only being recognised in the production phase would appropriately reflect the sharing of development risk. 
Accordingly, the Directors believe that the policy adopted best reflects the commercial objectives of the arrangements, the nature  
of the relationship with the workshare partner and is in accordance with Adopted IFRS.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies continued
As described in the 2013 Annual Report, an alternative view is that the RRSA contract cannot be divided into separate development and 
production phases, as the fees and development components received by the Group during the development phase are exchanged for 
the obligation to pay the supplier a predetermined share of any sales receipts during the production phase. On this basis, the entry fees 
received would be deferred in their entirety and recognised over the period of production. The size of the difference between the two 
approaches is monitored and is not currently expected to become material in the foreseeable future. The impact of the different 
approaches on profit before tax and net assets, which is not considered to be material, is as follows:

If the alternative policy were adopted, the difference would be included in operating profit, which would change from £1,287m as reported to £1,310m (2016: £44m to £42m).
As part of our assessment of accounting policies under IFRS 15 (see page 131), we have concluded that the way we account for the entry 
fees received from RRSAs should be aligned with how we account for participation fees we pay to airframers (which will change on 
adoption of IFRS 15). This will result in an accounting policy similar to the alternative view set out above.
Internally-generated development costs
IAS 38 requires that internally generated development costs should only be capitalised if strict criteria are met, in particular relating to 
technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits. The Group incurs significant research and development expenditure  
in respect of various development programmes, most notably in Civil Aerospace. Determining when capitalisation should commence and 
cease is a critical judgement as is the determination of when subsequent expenditure on the programme assets should be capitalised. 
Within the Group there is an established Product Introduction and Lifecycle Management process (‘PILM’) process in place. This is  
a gated process which assesses both the technical feasibility and commercial viability of programmes. A multi-functional team is involved 
in the assessment ensuring the technical and operational aspects of the programme have been assessed together with the financial 
assessment. Until the programme has obtained sign off on the criteria set out under ‘Research and development costs’ on page 128,  
all expenditure is expensed as incurred. 
Subsequent expenditure which enhances the performance of the engine and the economic benefits to the Group is capitalised. This 
expenditure is referred to as enhanced performance and is governed by the PILM process referred to above. Expenditure on sustaining 
engineering is expensed as incurred.
Following a review of progress on Civil Aerospace programmes during 2017, the point at which the relevant criteria are met has been 
moved one gate earlier than in the past. This has resulted in an additional £83m of development costs being capitalised than otherwise 
would have been.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
In applying the accounting policies, estimates are made in many areas; the actual outcome may differ from that calculated. The key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts  
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are set out below. The estimation of the relevant assets and liabilities involves the 
combination of a number of assumptions. Sensitivities are disclosed in the relevant notes where this is appropriate and practicable.
Forecasts and discount rates
The carrying values of a number of items on the balance sheet are dependent on the estimates of future cash flows arising from the 
Group’s operations, in particular:
 – The assessment of whether the goodwill (carrying value at 31 December 2017: £1,545m, 31 December 2016: £1,537m), arising on the 
consolidation of acquired businesses, is impaired is dependent on the present value of the future cash flows expected to be generated 
by the business. Sensitivities to impairment risk on Marine goodwill are shown in note 9.
 – The assessment as to whether there are any indications of impairment of development, participation, certification, customer 
relationships and contractual aftermarket rights recognised as intangible assets (carrying values at 31 December 2017: £4,687m,  
31 December 2016: £2,846m) is dependent on estimates of cash flows generated by the relevant assets and the discount rate used to 
calculate a present value. These estimates include the performance of long-term contractual arrangements as described below, as well 
as estimates for future market share, pricing and unit cost for uncontracted business. The risk of impairment is generally higher for 
newer programmes and for customer-specific intangible assets (CARs) for launch customers and typically reduces as programmes 
become more established.
Assessment of long-term contractual arrangements
The Group has long-term contracts that fall into different accounting periods and which can extend over significant periods – the most 
significant of these are long-term service arrangements in the Civil Aerospace business. The estimated revenue and costs are inherently 
imprecise and significant estimates are required to assess: engine flying hours, time on wing and other operating parameters; the pattern 
of future maintenance activity (including the in-service fleet issues) and the costs to be incurred; lifecycle cost improvements over the 
124
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued
term of the contracts and escalation of revenue and costs. The estimates take account of the inherent uncertainties and the risk of 
non-recovery of any resulting contract balances. In addition, many of the revenues and costs are denominated in currencies other than 
that of the relevant Group undertaking. 
These are translated at an estimated long-term exchange rate, based on historical trends. In 2016, the US dollar long-term exchange  
rate was reduced by five cents, resulting in a one-off benefit to profit before tax of £35m. 
Post-retirement benefits
The Group’s defined benefit pension schemes and similar arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19. The accounting 
valuation, which is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in a net surplus of £738m before 
deferred taxation being recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: net deficit £29m). The size of the net 
surplus/deficit is sensitive to the market value of the assets held by the schemes and to actuarial assumptions, which include price 
inflation, pension and salary increases, the discount rate used in assessing actuarial liabilities, mortality and other demographic 
assumptions and the levels of contributions. Further details and sensitivities are included in note 19.
Provisions
As described in the accounting policy on page 129, the Group measures provisions (carrying value at 31 December 2017: £883m, 
31 December 2016: £759m) at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. 
These estimates take account of information available and different possible outcomes.
Taxation
The tax payable on profits is determined based on tax laws and regulations that apply in each of the numerous jurisdictions in which the 
Group operates. Where the precise impact of these laws and regulations is unclear, or uncertain, then reasonable estimates may be used 
to determine the tax charge included in the Financial Statements. 
The main area of uncertainty is in relation to cross-border transactions, entered into in the normal course of business, as the amount of 
income or profit taxable in each country involved can be subjective and therefore open to interpretation by the relevant tax authorities. 
This can result in disputes and possibly litigation.
Tax provisions require management to make judgements and estimates of exposures in relation to tax audit issues and other areas of 
uncertainty. Contingent liabilities in respect of any tax disputes or litigation, are covered in note 23. All provisions are in current liabilities. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which the deductible 
temporary difference can be utilised, based on management’s assumptions relating to the amounts and timing of future taxable profits.
Further details on the Group’s tax position can be found on page 196.
Significant accounting policies
The Group’s significant accounting policies are set out below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements and by all Group entities.
Basis of consolidation
The Group Consolidated Financial Statements include the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings together 
with the Group’s share of the results of joint arrangements and associates made up to 31 December. In line with common practice in 
Germany, a small number of immaterial subsidiaries of Rolls-Royce Power Systems are not consolidated and are carried at cost in other 
investments. As set out in note 25, ITP Aero was acquired on 19 December 2017. It has been assumed that ITP Aero did not have any 
significant trading activity between the acquisition date and 31 December 2017.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has power over an entity, exposure to variable 
returns from its involvement with an entity and the ability to use its power over an entity so as to affect the Company’s returns. 
A joint arrangement is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or 
more other venturers under a contractual arrangement. Joint arrangements may be either joint ventures or joint operations. An associate 
is an entity, being neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement, in which the Group holds a long-term interest and where the Group has  
a significant influence. The results of joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Joint 
operations are accounted for using proportionate accounting.
Any subsidiary undertaking, joint arrangement or associate sold or acquired during the year are included up to, or from, the date 
of change of control. Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in equity.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Adjustments are made to eliminate the 
profit or loss arising on transactions with joint arrangements and associates to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity.

Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises sales to outside customers after discounts, excluding value added taxes.
Sales of products (both OE and spare parts) are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods 
are transferred to the customer, the sales price agreed and the receipt of payment can be assured – this is generally on delivery. On 
occasion, the Group may participate in the financing of OE, most commonly by the provision of guarantees as described in note 18. In such 
circumstances, the contingent obligations arising under these arrangements are taken into account in assessing when the significant risks 
and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer. As described on page 122, a sale of OE at a contractual price below its 
cost of manufacture is considered to give rise to revenue to the extent that an intangible asset (contractual aftermarket right) is 
recognised at the same time. 
Sales of services are recognised by reference to the stage of completion based on services performed to date. As described on page 122, 
the assessment of the stage of completion is dependent on the nature of the contract, but will generally be based on: flying hours or 
equivalent for long-term aftermarket arrangements where the service is provided on a continuous basis; costs incurred to the extent these 
relate to services performed up to the reporting date; or achievement of contractual milestones where relevant. 
As described on page 123, sales of products and services are treated as though they are a single contract where these components have 
been negotiated as a single commercial package and are so closely interrelated that they do not operate independently of each other  
and are considered to form a single transaction with an overall profit margin. The total revenue is allocated between the two components 
such that the total agreed discount to list prices is allocated to revenue for each of the two components pro rata, based on list prices.  
The revenue is then recognised for each component on this basis as the products are delivered and services provided, as described 
above. Where the contractual price of the OE component is below the revenue allocated from the combined arrangement, this will give 
rise to an asset included in ‘amounts recoverable on contracts’. This asset reduces as services are provided, increases as costs are 
incurred, and reduces to zero by the end of the contract. Where the balance is a liability, it is recognised in ‘accruals and deferred income’. 
Provided that the outcome of construction contracts can be assessed with reasonable certainty, the revenue and costs on such contracts 
are recognised based on stage of completion and the overall contract profitability. Full provision is made for any estimated losses to 
completion of contracts, having regard to the overall substance of the arrangements.
Progress payments received, when greater than recorded revenue, are deducted from the value of work in progress except to the extent 
that payments on account exceed the value of work in progress on any contract where the excess is included in accruals and deferred 
income within trade and other payables. The amount by which recorded revenue of long-term contracts is in excess of payments on 
account is classified as amounts recoverable on contracts and is separately disclosed within trade and other receivables.
TotalCare arrangements
As described above, these are accounted for on a stage of completion basis, with the stage of completion based on the proportion of 
flying hours completed compared to the total estimated under the contract. In making the assessment of future revenue, costs and the 
level of profit recognised the Group takes account of: (i) the forecast utilisation of the engines by the operator; (ii) the forecast costs to 
maintain the engines in accordance with the contractual requirements – the principal variables being the time between shop visits and the 
cost of each shop visit; and (iii) the recoverability of any contract asset arising. The Group benchmarks the forecast costs against previous 
programmes, recognising that the reliability of the forecasts will improve as operational experience of the engine increases. To the extent 
that actual costs differ from forecast costs or that forecast costs change, the cumulative impact is recognised in the period. An allowance 
is made against forecast contract revenue given the potential for reduced engine flying hours based on historical forecasting accuracy, 
the risk of aircraft being parked by the customer and the customer’s creditworthiness. Again, changes in this allowance are recognised  
in the period.
Risk and revenue sharing arrangements
As described on page 123, the Group enters into arrangements with certain workshare partners under which these suppliers: (i) contribute 
to the forecast costs of developing an engine by performing their own development work, providing development parts and paying a 
non-refundable cash entry fee; and (ii) supply components for the production phase for which they receive consideration, which is an 
agreed proportion of the total programme revenue. Both the suppliers’ contributions to the forecast non-recurring development costs  
and their consideration are determined by reference to their proportionate forecast scopes of supply relative to that of the engine overall. 
Once the forecast costs and the scopes of supply have been agreed at the inception of the contract, each party is then accountable for  
its own incurred costs. No accounting entries are recorded when the suppliers undertake development work or when development 
components are supplied. Cash sums received are recognised in the income statement, as a reduction in research and development costs 
incurred, to match the expensing of the Group’s related costs – where the cash sums are received in advance of the related costs being 
expensed or where the related costs are capitalised as intangible assets, the recognition of the cash received is deferred (in accruals  
and deferred income) to match the recognition of the related expense or the amortisation of the related intangible asset respectively.  
The payments to suppliers of their shares of the programme revenue for their production components are charged to cost of sales  
as programme revenue arise.
The Group has arrangements with partners who do not undertake development work or supply parts. Such arrangements are considered to 
be financial instruments as defined by IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are accounted for using the amortised cost method.
Government investment
Where a government or similar body has previously invested in a development programme, the Group treats payments to that body  
as royalty payments, which are matched to related sales.

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued
Government grants
Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match them with the related expenses that they are intended to 
compensate. Where grants are received in advance of the related expenses, they are included in the balance sheet as deferred income. 
Non-monetary grants are recognised at fair value.
Interest
Interest receivable/payable is credited/charged to the income statement using the effective interest method. Where borrowing costs are 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs are capitalised as part of the specific asset.
Taxation
The tax charge/credit on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax:
 – Current tax is the expected tax payable for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date,  
and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
 – Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes and is calculated using the enacted 
or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled.
Tax is charged or credited in the income statement or other comprehensive income (OCI) as appropriate, except when it relates to items 
credited or charged directly to equity in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint arrangements, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will  
not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is not recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition  
of goodwill or for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets 
can be utilised.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting Group undertaking are translated into 
the functional currency at the exchange rates ruling on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate ruling at the year end. Exchange differences arising on foreign 
exchange transactions and the retranslation of assets and liabilities into functional currencies at the rate ruling at the year end are taken 
into account in determining profit before taxation.
The trading results of Group undertakings are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the year. The assets and liabilities 
of overseas undertakings, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at the exchange rates ruling 
at the year end. Exchange adjustments arising from the retranslation of the opening net investments, and from the translation of the profits 
or losses at average rates, are recognised in OCI. The cumulative amount of exchange adjustments was, on transition to IFRS in 2004, 
deemed to be nil. 
Financial instruments
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement requires the classification of financial instruments into separate categories 
for which the accounting requirement is different. The Group has classified its financial instruments as follows:
 – Short-term investments are generally classified as available for sale.
 – Short-term deposits (principally comprising funds held with banks and other financial institutions), trade receivables and short-term 
investments not designated as available for sale are classified as loans and receivables.
 – Borrowings, trade payables, financial RRSAs, and C Shares are classified as other liabilities.
 – Derivatives, comprising foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity contracts are classified as fair value through profit or loss.
Financial instruments are recognised at the contract date and initially measured at fair value. Their subsequent measurement depends 
on their classification:
 – Available for sale assets are held at fair value. Changes in fair value arising from changes in exchange rates are included in the income 
statement. All other changes in fair value are taken to equity. On disposal, the accumulated changes in value recorded in equity are 
included in the gain or loss recorded in the income statement.
 – Loans and receivables and other liabilities are held at amortised cost and not revalued (except for changes in exchange rates and 
forecast contractual cash flows, which are included in the income statement) unless they are included in a fair value hedge accounting 
relationship. Where such a hedging relationship exists, the instruments are revalued in respect of the risk being hedged, with the 
change in value included in the income statement.
 – Fair value through profit or loss items are held at fair value. Changes in fair value are included in the income statement unless the 
instrument is included in a cash flow hedge. If the instruments are included in an effective cash flow hedging relationship, changes 
in value are taken to equity. When the hedged forecast transaction occurs, amounts previously recorded in equity are recognised 
in the income statement.
Financial instruments are derecognised on expiry or when all contractual rights and obligations are transferred.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies continued
Hedge accounting
The Group does not generally apply hedge accounting in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts or commodity swaps held to 
manage the cash flow exposures of forecast transactions denominated in foreign currencies or in commodities respectively.
The Group applies hedge accounting in respect of transactions entered into to manage the fair value and cash flow exposures of its 
borrowings. Forward foreign exchange contracts are held to manage the fair value exposures of borrowings denominated in foreign 
currencies and are designated as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps are held to manage the interest rate exposures and are designated 
as fair value or cash flow hedges of fixed and floating rate borrowings respectively.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and changes in fair value of the related hedged item are 
recognised directly in the income statement.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges and are effective are recognised directly in equity.  
Any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationships is included in the income statement. The amounts deferred in equity are recognised  
in the income statement to match the recognition of the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, for cash flow hedges and if the forecast transaction remains probable, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected  
to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
The portion of a gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective 
hedge is recognised directly in equity. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses 
accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to profit when the foreign operation is sold.
Business combinations and goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities. Where fair 
values of acquired contingent liabilities cannot be measured reliably, the assumed contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in 
the same manner as other contingent liabilities. 
Goodwill recognised represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value to the Group of the net  
of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. On transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004, business combinations were not 
retrospectively adjusted to comply with Adopted IFRS and goodwill was recognised based on the carrying value under the previous 
accounting policies. Goodwill in respect of the acquisition of a subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill arising on the 
acquisition of joint arrangements and associates is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Certification costs and participation fees
Costs incurred in respect of meeting regulatory certification requirements for new civil aero engine/aircraft combinations including 
payments made to airframe manufacturers for this and participation fees are carried forward in intangible assets to the extent that they 
can be recovered out of future sales and are charged to the income statement over the programme life on a straight-line basis, up to  
a maximum of 15 years from the entry into service of the product.
Research and development
In accordance with IAS 38, expenditure incurred on research and development is distinguished as relating either to a research phase or to 
a development phase. All research phase expenditure is charged to the income statement. Development expenditure (which predominantly 
relates to Civil Aerospace engine programmes) is capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset (programme asset) only if it meets 
strict criteria, relating in particular to technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits. 
More specifically, development costs are capitalised from the point at which the following conditions have been met:
 – the technical feasibility of completing the programme and the intention and ability (availability of technical, financial and other 
resources) to complete the programme asset and use or sell it;
 – the probability that future economic benefits will flow from the programme asset; and
 – the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the programme asset during its development.
Capitalisation continues until the point at which the programme asset meets its originally contracted technical specification (defined 
internally as the point at which the asset is capable of operating in the manner intended by management). 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised where it enhances the functionality of the programme asset and demonstrably generates an 
enhanced economic benefit to the Group. All other subsequent expenditure on programme assets is expensed as incurred. 
Development expenditure capitalised is amortised on a straight-line basis up to a maximum of 15 years from the entry into service of the 
programme asset. In accordance with IAS 38, we assess the basis on which we amortise programme assets annually. At the end of 2017,  
we confirmed that we will commence amortisation of programme assets on a 15 year straight-line basis pro rata over the estimated number 
of units produced. We will apply this approach prospectively from 1 January 2018.

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued
Contractual aftermarket rights
As described under key judgements on page 122, the Group may sell OE to customers at a price below its cost, on the basis that it also 
receives valuable aftermarket rights. Such a sale is considered to give rise to an intangible asset which is recognised, in accordance with 
IAS 38, at the same time as the revenue at an amount equal to the cash deficit and is amortised on a straight-line basis over the period  
that highly probable aftermarket sales are expected to be earned.
Customer relationships
The fair value of customer relationships recognised as a result of a business combination relate to the acquired company’s established 
relationships with its existing customers that result in repeat purchases and customer loyalty. Amortisation occurs on a straight-line basis 
over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of 15 years.
Software 
The cost of acquiring software that is not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment is classified as an intangible asset and 
amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of five years.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment 
over their estimated useful lives. No depreciation is provided on assets in the course of construction. Estimated useful lives are as follows:
 – Land and buildings, as advised by the Group’s professional advisers: 
 – freehold buildings – five to 45 years (average 26 years); 
 – leasehold buildings – lower of adviser’s estimates or period of lease; and 
 – no depreciation is provided on freehold land.
 – Plant and equipment – five to 25 years (average 12 years).
 – Aircraft and engines – five to 20 years (average 13 years).
Where the Group obtains effective control of customers’ installed engines as a result of a TotalCare Flex arrangement, the fair value  
of these engines is recognised as an addition (shown separately in note 10). The corresponding liability is recognised either as deferred 
revenue or a financial liability depending on the precise nature of the arrangement.
Operating leases
Payments made and rentals received under operating lease arrangements are charged/credited to the income statement on a  
straight-line basis.
Impairment of non-current assets
Impairment of non-current assets is considered in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Where the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are independent of other assets, impairment is considered for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Goodwill  
and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. Other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment 
and investments are assessed for any indications of impairment annually. If any indication of impairment is identified, an impairment test  
is performed to estimate the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be below the carrying value, the carrying value is reduced 
to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised as an expense. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use or 
fair value less costs to sell, if this is readily available. The value in use is the present value of future cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate  
that reflects the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where 
applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, including depreciation of property, plant and equipment, that have been incurred in 
bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling prices less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, investments in money-market funds and short-term deposits with a maturity 
of three months or less on inception. The Group considers overdrafts (repayable on demand) to be an integral part of its cash management 
activities and these are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will  
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.

Post-retirement benefits
Pensions and similar benefits (principally healthcare) are accounted for under IAS 19.
For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value, using a discount rate derived from high-quality corporate 
bonds denominated in the currency of the plan, whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. Surpluses in schemes are recognised as 
assets only if they represent economic benefits available to the Group in the future. A liability is recognised to the extent that the minimum 
funding requirements in respect of past service will give rise to an unrecognisable surplus. 
The service and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement:
 – current service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees;
 – past service costs and settlements are recognised immediately; and
 – financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses and movements in unrecognised surpluses and minimum funding liabilities are recognised immediately in OCI.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments
The Group provides share-based payment arrangements to certain employees. These are principally equity-settled arrangements and  
are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed  
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares  
or options that will vest, except where additional shares vest as a result of the total shareholder return (TSR) performance condition in  
the Performance Share Plan (PSP).
Cash-settled share options (grants in the International Sharesave plan) are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The Group 
recognises a liability at the balance sheet date based on these fair values, taking into account the estimated number of options that will 
actually vest and the relative completion of the vesting period. Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income 
statement for the year.
The cost of shares of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc held by the Group for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of employee share 
plans is deducted from equity in the consolidated balance sheet. See note 21 for a further description of the share-based payment plans.
Customer financing support
In connection with the sale of its products, the Group will, on occasion, provide financing support for its customers. These arrangements 
fall into two categories: credit-based guarantees and asset-value guarantees. In accordance with the requirements of IAS 39 and IFRS 4 
Insurance Contracts, credit-based guarantees are treated as insurance contracts. The Group considers asset-value guarantees to be 
non-financial liabilities and accordingly these are also treated as insurance contracts. As described on page 158, the Directors consider  
the likelihood of crystallisation in assessing whether provision is required for any contingent liabilities.
The Group’s contingent liabilities relating to financing arrangements are spread over many years and relate to a number of customers  
and a broad product portfolio, and are reported on a discounted basis. 
Revisions to Adopted IFRS in 2017
There were no changes to accounting standards that had a material impact on the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Revisions to IFRS not applicable in 2017
Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 (effective for the year beginning 1 January 2018) relates to the accounting for financial instruments and covers: classification and 
measurement; impairment; and hedge accounting. Except for hedge accounting, retrospective application is required with any adjustment 
being made to reserves on 1 January 2018. The Group is not required to restate 2017 comparative information and is analysing the impact 
of adoption on its Financial Statements. This is not expected to be material.
 – The Group can sell its trade receivables from certain customers before their due date. The trade receivables of these customers that  
are not sold will be classified and disclosed as fair value through other comprehensive income from 2018. This will not have a significant 
impact on the income statement. 
 – The Group will adopt the simplified approach to provide for losses on receivables and contract assets resulting from transactions within  
the scope of IFRS 15. The Group has performed a preliminary assessment of the adoption of the standard on the basis of average default 
risk of customers and will continue to analyse the impact during 2018. We do not anticipate that this will have a significant impact on the 
income statement.
 – The Group has determined that all existing effective hedging relationship will continue to qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9.  
We will continue not to hedge account for forecast foreign exchange transactions. This will not have an impact on the Financial Statements.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 provides a single, principles based five-step model to be applied to all sales contracts. It is based on the transfer of control of 
goods and services to customers and replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts currently included  
in IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue. There are three broad implications: 
 – linked accounting will cease to exist so all OE sales will be treated on the same basis; 
 – OE engine cash deficits will no longer be capitalised and recorded as contractual aftermarket rights, they will instead be recognised on 
delivery; and 
 – revenue and profits for aftermarket services will be recognised on an activity basis as costs are incurred. 
The Group will adopt IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 using the ‘full’ retrospective approach. The Group has undertaken significant analysis  
on the impact of IFRS 15 and the most significant accounting judgements, estimates and policies are set out below. Work will continue 
during 2018 to review and refine policies and procedures required to implement IFRS 15. As a result it is possible that there may be some 
changes to the impact reported.
Key areas of judgement:
Determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations:
 – Where the performance obligation is the supply of goods (principally OE and spare parts) which is satisfied at the point in time that 
those goods are transferred to the customer, the Group will recognise revenue at that point in time.
 – The Group generates a significant proportion of its revenue and profit from aftermarket arrangements arising from the use of the 
installed OE. These aftermarket contracts, such as TotalCare and CorporateCare agreements in Civil Aerospace, cover a range of 
services and generally have contractual terms covering more than one year. Under these contracts, the Group’s primary obligation  
is to maintain customers’ equipment in an operational condition and this is achieved by undertaking various activities, such as repair, 
overhaul and engine monitoring over the period of the contract. Revenue on these contracts is recognised over the period of the 
contract and the measure of performance is a matter of judgement. In general, the Directors consider that the stage of performance of 
the contract is best measured by using the actual costs incurred to date compared to the estimated costs to complete the performance 
obligations.
 – The assessment of stage of completion is generally measured for each contract. However, in certain cases, such as for CorporateCare 
agreements where there are many contracts covering aftermarket services, each for a small number of engines, the Group will apply  
the practical expedient offered by IFRS 15 to account for a portfolio of contracts together as it expects that the effects on the Financial 
Statements would not differ materially from applying the standard to the individual contracts in the portfolio.
The Group has paid participation fees to airframe manufacturers, its customers for OE on certain programmes. Amounts paid are initially 
treated as contract assets and subsequently charged as a reduction to the OE revenue when it is transferred to the customer. The number 
of units over which the asset will be charged is a matter of judgement as the orders will grow over the course of the programme.
In assessing the accounting for the participation fee payments we make to our OE customers, we have also assessed the accounting for 
up-front payments we sometimes receive from the Group’s suppliers under RRSAs to allow them to participate in an engine programme. 
We have concluded that, consistent with changes to how we will account for participation fees noted above, these receipts should be 
deferred and recognised against cost of sales over the period of supply. This will also require judgement as to the number of units over 
which the receipts will be allocated. 
The Group has elected to use the practical expedient to expense as incurred any incremental costs of obtaining or fulfilling a contract  
if the amortisation period of an asset created would have been one year or less. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty:
Assessment of long-term contractual arrangements.
 – The estimated revenue and costs under such agreements are inherently imprecise and significant estimates are required to take into 
account uncertainties relating to: (i) the forecast utilisation of the engines by the operator and related pricing; (ii) the frequency of 
engine overhauls where the principal variables are the operating parameters of the engine and operational lives of components; and (iii) 
the forecast costs to maintain the engines in accordance with the contractual requirements where the cost of each overhaul is 
dependent on the required work-scope and the cost of parts and labour at the time.
 – An allowance is made against the risk of non-recovery of resulting contract balances from reduced utilisation e.g. engine flying hours, 
based on historical forecasting experience, the risk of aircraft being parked by the customer and the customer’s creditworthiness.
 – A significant amount of revenue and cost is denominated in currencies other than that of the relevant Group undertaking. These are 
translated at estimated long-term exchange rates.
Significant accounting policies:
Revenue recognition comprises sales to outside customers after discounts and amounts payable to customers and excludes value added 
taxes. The Group has elected to use the practical expedient not to adjust revenue for the effect of financing components where the 
expectation is that the period between the transfer of goods and services to customers and the receipt of payment is less than a year.
Sales of services are recognised by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation provided the 
outcome of contracts can be assessed with reasonable certainty. Full provision is made for any estimated losses to completion of contracts, 
having regard to the overall substance of the arrangements.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies continued
TotalCare and similar long-term aftermarket service arrangements are accounted for on a stage of completion basis. A contract liability  
will be created where payment is received ahead of the costs incurred to meet performance obligations. In making the assessment of 
future revenue, costs and the level of profit recognised, the Group takes account of the inherent uncertainties and the risk of non-
recovery of any resulting contract balances. To the extent that actual revenue and costs differ from forecast or that forecasts change, the 
cumulative impact is recognised in the period. When accounting for a portfolio of long-term service arrangements, such as CorporateCare 
agreements, the Group uses estimates and assumptions that reflect the size and composition of the portfolio. The new standard has no 
impact on the timing of the reported cash flows. 
The comparative 2017 results to be included in the 2018 Financial Statements will be restated. Certain tables from note 2, have been prepared 
on the IFRS 15 basis set out above and are shown in note 27. Overall, the adoption of IFRS 15 is expected to result in a reduction in 2017 
underlying revenue and operating profit of £1,408m and £854m respectively and a reduction of net assets of £5.2bn at 31 December 2017. 
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 (effective for the year beginning 1 January 2019) will require all leases to be recognised on the balance sheet. Currently, IAS 17 
Leases only requires leases categorised as finance leases to be recognised on the balance sheet. 
The Group is progressing well in its analysis of how IFRS 16 should be implemented and is developing the data-set, systems and processes 
that will be required. The most significant leases, by value, relate to property and aircraft engines. The Group expects to apply the 
standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial application recognised on 1 January 2019. Under this approach the Group will 
not restate comparative periods. 
In broad terms the impact of the standard will be to:
 – recognise an additional lease liability equivalent to the present value of the lease commitments at the date of transition. Further work  
is required to validate the contracts which will represent leases under IFRS 16, including ongoing consideration of some supply chain 
contracts. The Group is also considering whether there are any re-assessments of lease term required, and the discount rate to be 
applied. Under the expected transition option, payments will be discounted using incremental borrowing rates at 1 January 2019. The 
Group holds some leases in non-functional currencies where the value of the lease liability will be dependent on spot exchange rates  
on transition; and
 – recognise a right-of-use asset measured either: as if the standard had applied since commencement of the lease; or at an amount equal 
to the lease liability on transition.
The Group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable will have 
a significant impact on the Financial Statements.
2 Segmental analysis
The analysis by business segment is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, on the basis of those segments whose 
operating results are regularly reviewed by the Board (the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8), as follows:
Civil Aerospace – development, manufacture, marketing and sales of commercial aero engines and aftermarket services.
Defence Aerospace – development, manufacture, marketing and sales of military aero engines and aftermarket services.
Power Systems – development, manufacture, marketing and sales of reciprocating engines and power systems.
Marine  – development, manufacture, marketing and sales of marine-power propulsion systems and aftermarket services.
Nuclear –  development, manufacture, marketing and sales of nuclear systems for civil power generation and naval  
propulsion systems. 
The operating results are reviewed by the Board and are prepared on an underlying basis, which the Board considers reflects better the 
economic substance of the Group’s trading during the year and provides financial measures that, together with the results prepared in 
accordance with Adopted IFRS, allow better analysis of the factors affecting the year’s results compared to the prior year. This approach 
has been applied consistently. The principles adopted to determine underlying results are:
Underlying revenue and cost of sales
Where revenue and costs are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking and the Group 
hedges the net exposure, these reflect the achieved exchange rates arising on derivative contracts settled to cover the net exposure. This 
reflects the economic hedging that the Group undertakes. These achieved exchange rates are applied to all relevant revenue and costs, 
including those for which there is a natural offsetting position, rather than translating the offsetting transactions at spot rates. The 
underlying profits would be the same under both approaches, but the Board considers that the approach taken provides a better 
indication of trends over time.
Underlying profit before financing
In addition to the impact of exchange rates on revenue and costs above, adjustments have been made to exclude one-off past service 
costs or credits on post-retirement schemes, exceptional restructuring costs (associated with the substantial closure or exit of a site, facility 
or line of business or other major transformation activities), the effect of acquisition accounting (including in 2017, the gains arising on the 
acquisition of ITP Aero) – so that all segments are measured on a consistent basis, the effect of business disposals, the impairment of 
goodwill and similar items, and in 2016 financial penalties from agreements with investigating bodies.

Underlying profit before taxation
In addition to those adjustments in underlying profit before financing:
 – includes amounts realised from settled derivative contracts and revaluation of relevant assets and liabilities to exchange rates forecast 
to be achieved from future settlement of derivative contracts; and 
 – excludes unrealised amounts arising from revaluations required by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, 
changes in value of financial RRSA contracts arising from changes in forecast payments and the net impact of financing costs related  
to post-retirement scheme benefits.
Taxation
The tax effect of the adjustments above are excluded from the underlying tax charge. In addition, changes in the amount of recoverable 
advance corporation tax recognised and the impact of changes in tax rates are also excluded.
The tables below and overleaf set out the results of the reportable segments on the basis described above and a reconciliation of these 
underlying results to those reported in the consolidated income statement.

Realised losses/(gains) on settled derivative contracts include adjustments to reflect the losses/(gains) in the same year as the related trading cash flows.
2   
Unrealised fair value changes to derivative contracts included in profit before financing: (i) include those of equity accounted joint ventures; and (ii) exclude those for which the 
related trading contracts have been cancelled when the fair value changes are recognised immediately in underlying profit.
3   
The adjustment eliminates charges recognised as a result of recognising assets in acquired businesses at fair value.
4   
In the UK, tax is provided on pension surpluses at a rate of 35%, which is the relevant rate if the surpluses were to be returned to the Group. 
5 
The 2017 reduction in corporate tax rates relates to the reduction in the Federal tax rate in the US. The 2016 comparative relates to the reduction in the UK corporate tax rate.

Deferred tax assets include £285m (2016: £326m) relating to tax losses in the UK and £163m (2016: nil) relating to advance corporation tax. 
In both cases, a recoverability assessment has been undertaken, taking account of deferred tax liabilities against which the reversal of the 
deferred tax asset can be offset and using latest UK forecasts to assess the level of future taxable profits. The assessment takes into 
account new tax laws that are effective from 1 April 2017 (restricting the offset of tax losses), and the fact that neither asset time expires. 
The forecasts show the UK business, which is mainly Civil Aerospace and Defence Aerospace, continues to generate sufficient future 
taxable profits to support the continued recognition of the deferred tax asset relating to tax losses even though the new tax laws extend 
the period over which the losses are expected to be used. This is aligned to the business outlook, in particular Civil Aerospace with its 
growth in original equipment revenue from large engines and engine unit cost improvements. 
Prior to the new tax laws, advance corporation tax would not be utilised until after all the UK tax losses had been used. One of the 
consequences of the change in tax laws is that UK tax payments will be accelerated. Advance corporation tax can be offset against such 
payments. This is reflected in the forecasts that show it now being used over a similar period to the losses. As a result the advance 
corporation tax has been recognised as a deferred tax asset in 2017. The resulting credit to the income statement has been excluded from 
underlying profit.
The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on 22 December 2017. This reduces the Federal tax rate in the US from 35% to 21% with effect 
from 1 January 2018. As the reduction has been enacted prior to the year end, the closing deferred tax assets and liabilities of US 
companies within the Group have been calculated at this rate. The resulting charges or credits have been recognised in the income 
statement except to the extent that they relate to items previously charged or credited to OCI or equity. Accordingly in 2017, £25m has 
been charged to the income statement and £45m has been charged to OCI. 
The Budget 2016 announced that the UK tax rate will reduce to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.  
The rate reduction to 17% was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. The deferred tax assets and liabilities of UK companies within 
the Group have therefore been calculated at 17%. 
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, for which a deferred tax liability  
has not been recognised, aggregate to £188m (2016: £276m). No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the potential withholding  
tax due on the remittance of undistributed profits as the Group is able to control the timing of such remittances and it is probable that 
consent will not be given in the foreseeable future. 
6 Earnings per ordinary share
Basic earnings per ordinary share (EPS) are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares held under trust, which have been treated as if they had 
been cancelled.
Diluted EPS are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year for the bonus element 
of share options.

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Financial Statements

Goodwill has been tested for impairment during 2017 on the following basis:
 – The carrying values of goodwill have been assessed by reference to value in use. These have been estimated using cash flows from  
the most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information  
on market conditions. These forecasts cover the next five years. Growth rates for the period not covered by the forecasts are based  
on a range of growth rates that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
 – The key assumptions for the impairment tests are the discount rate and, in the cash flow projections, the programme assumptions,  
the growth rates and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the relationship between selling prices and costs. Impairment tests are 
performed using prevailing exchange rates.
The principal value in use assumptions for goodwill balances considered to be individually significant are:
Marine
 – Trading assumptions (e.g. volume of equipment deliveries, capture of aftermarket and cost escalation) are based on current and known 
future programmes, estimates of customers’ fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts, in particular the cyclical recovery of 
the commercial marine market.
 – Cash flows beyond the five-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 2.5% (2016: 2.5%). 
 – Pre-tax discount rate 13% (2016: 13%).
The estimate of value in use is approximately £50m higher than the carrying value and deterioration of key assumptions could result in an 
impairment. For example, the value in use would reduce by approximately £50m if alternative trading assumptions resulted in forecast cash 
flows reducing by 10%, by approximately £60m if the discount rate increased by 1% and by approximately £100m if the market recovery 
were delayed by one year compared to that assumed.
On 17 January 2018, the Group announced a strategic review of commercial marine. Until the review is sufficiently advanced, it is not 
possible to determine reliably the full financial impact. 
Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG
 – Trading assumptions (e.g. volume of equipment deliveries, pricing achieved and cost escalation) are based on current and known future 
programmes, estimates of capture of market share and long-term economic forecasts.
 – Cash flows beyond the five-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 1.8% (2016: 2%). 
 – Pre-tax discount rate 11.7% (2016 11.7%).
The Directors do not consider that any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill 
to fall below its carrying value. 
Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG
 – Trading assumptions (e.g. volume of engine deliveries, flying hours of installed fleet and cost escalation) are based on current and 
known future programmes, estimates of customers’ fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts.
 – Cash flows beyond the five-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 2.5% (2016: 2.5%). 
 – Pre-tax discount rate 13% (2016: 13%).
The Directors do not consider that any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill 
to fall below its carrying value.
Other intangible assets
Certification costs and participation fees, development costs and contractual aftermarket rights have been reviewed for impairment 
in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Where an impairment test was considered necessary, it has been 
performed on the following basis:
 – The carrying values have been assessed by reference to value in use. These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent 
forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions 
over the lives of the respective programmes.
 – The key assumptions underlying cash flow projections are assumed market share, programme timings, unit cost assumptions, discount 
rates, and foreign exchange rates.
 – The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 9–13% (2016: 9-13%), based on the Group’s weighted average cost of  
capital, adjusted for the estimated programme risk, for example taking account of whether or not the forecast cash flows arise from 
contracted business.
No impairment is required on this basis. However, a combination of adverse changes in assumptions (e.g. market size and share, unit costs  
and programme delays) and other variables (e.g. discount rate and foreign exchange rates), could result in impairment in future years.  
In making this assessment, the Directors noted that the adoption of IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 would result in the derecognition of contractual 
aftermarket rights of £873m, which will itself significantly reduce the risk of impairment on other intangible assets.

On 11 July 2016, the Group announced that it would purchase the outstanding 53.1% shareholding in ITP Aero owned by SENER Grupo  
de Ingeniería SA (SENER). This followed a decision by SENER to exercise its put option. On 19 December 2017, the Group completed  
the purchase of ITP Aero to take its shareholding to 100% at a valuation of €718m. Under the agreement, consideration will be settled over  
a two-year period in eight quarterly instalments of equal value. The updated agreement allows flexibility to settle the consideration either 
in cash, in the form of Rolls-Royce shares or any mixture of the two. A decision as to whether each payment will be settled in cash, shares 
or cash and shares will be determined by Rolls-Royce during the payment period.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the price at which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, 
willing parties in an arms-length transaction. Fair values have been determined with reference to available market information at the 
balance sheet date, using the methodologies described below.
A  These primarily comprise unconsolidated companies where fair value approximates to the book value.
B   Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of the investments is reset after 
periods not exceeding six months.
C   Fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash ﬂows using prevailing interest rate curves. 
Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. These financial instruments are included on the 
balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices (Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement).
D   Borrowings are carried at amortised cost. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. The fair 
value of borrowings is estimated by discounting contractual future cash flows. (Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13).
E   The fair values of RRSAs and TotalCare Flex liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows. The contractual cash flows are based on future trading 
activity, which is estimated based on latest forecasts (Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13).
IFRS 13 defines a three-level valuation hierarchy:
Level 1 – quoted prices for similar instruments
Level 2 – directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs
Level 3 – inputs not based on observable market data

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses various financial instruments to manage its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. Where the effectiveness 
of a hedging relationship in a cash flow hedge is demonstrated, changes in the fair value that are deemed effective are included in the 
cash flow hedge reserve and released to match actual payments on the hedged item. The Group uses commodity swaps to manage its 
exposure to movements in the price of commodities (jet fuel and base metals). To hedge the currency risk associated with a borrowing 
denominated in US dollars, the Group has currency derivatives designated as part of fair value hedges. The Group uses interest rate  
swaps and forward rate agreements to manage its exposure to movements in interest rates.
Movements in the fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities were as follows:

Risk management policies and hedging activities 
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange rate risk; liquidity risk; credit risk; interest rate 
risk; and commodity price risk. The Board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk – The Group has significant cash flows (most significantly US dollars, followed by the euro) 
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity. To manage its exposures to changes in values 
of future foreign currency cash flows, so as to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the 
Group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions. For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are generally not 
designated as hedging instruments.
The Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies. To manage  
the risk of changes in these fair values, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as fair 
value hedges for accounting purposes.
The Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments. The Group aims to match its translational 
exposures by matching the currencies of assets and liabilities. 
Liquidity risk – The Group’s policy is to hold financial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure 
that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and 
opportunities. The Group holds cash and short-term investments, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group 
to manage its liquidity risk. 
Credit risk – The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial 
instruments. The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the Group’s risk management activities. The 
Group has credit policies covering both trading and financial exposures. Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a 
central treasury function in accordance with the Group credit policy. The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the Group’s 
exposure to credit risk from its treasury activities by ensuring the Group transacts strictly with ‘BBB+’ or higher-rated financial institutions 
based on pre-established limits per financial institution. At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk 
to individual customers or counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying 
value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate risk – The Group’s interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings (fair value risk), floating rate borrowings 
and cash and cash equivalents (cash flow risk). Interest rate derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate profile within the 
Group policy, which is to maintain a higher proportion of net funds at floating rates of interest as a natural hedge to the net cash position. 
These are designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
Commodity risk – The Group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations. To minimise its cash 
flow exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Group enters into derivative commodity transactions. For accounting purposes, these 
derivative contracts are generally not designated as hedging instruments.
Other price risk – The Group’s cash equivalent balances represent investments in money-market instruments, with a term of up to three 
months. The Group does not consider that these are subject to significant price risk.

  The Group regularly renegotiates the contractual maturities of its foreign exchange contracts. In general, the effect of such negotiations is the settlement of derivative financial 
liabilities somewhat earlier than the contractual maturity date.

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 17 Financial instruments continued
Some of the Group’s borrowings are subject to the Group meeting certain obligations, including customary financial covenants. If the 
Group fails to meet its obligations these arrangements give rights to the lenders, upon agreement, to accelerate repayment of the 
facilities. There are no rating triggers contained in any of the Group’s facilities that could require the Group to accelerate or repay any 
facility for a given movement in the Group’s credit rating. 
In addition, the Group has £2,106m (2016: £2,280m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities of which £2,000m is available for at least 
the next two years.

At 31 December 2017, the Group had no material sensitivity to changes in interest rates on that date. The main interest rate sensitivity for 
the Group arises as a result of the gross up of net cash and this is mitigated as described under the interest rate risk management policies 
on page 152. 
C Shares and payments to shareholders
The Company issues non-cumulative redeemable preference shares (C Shares) as an alternative to paying a cash dividend. C Shares in 
respect of a year are issued in the following year. Shareholders are able to redeem any number of their C Shares for cash. Any C Shares 
retained attract a dividend of 75% of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis, and have limited voting 
rights. The Company has the option to compulsorily redeem the C Shares, at any time, if the aggregate number of C Shares in issue is  
less than 10% of the aggregate number of C Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.

The reclassification of provisions includes: (i) £61m relating to employer healthcare liability claims as a result of an historic insolvency of the previous provider; and (ii) a provision for  
tax related interest and penalties of £56m that was previously included in current tax liabilities which has been reclassified following guidance issued by the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) in September 2017. Prior year figures have not been restated.
Provisions for warranties and guarantees primarily relate to products sold and generally cover a period of up to three years.
Provisions for contract loss and restructuring are generally expected to be utilised within two years. 
In connection with the sale of its products the Group will, on some occasions, provide financing support for its customers – generally 
in respect of civil aircraft. The Group’s commitments relating to these financing arrangements are spread over many years, relate to a number 
of customers and a broad product portfolio and are generally secured on the asset subject to the financing. These include commitments  
of US$3.3bn (2016: US$3.2bn) (on a discounted basis) to provide borrowing facilities to enable customers to purchase aircraft (of which 
approximately US$390m (on a discounted basis) could be called during 2018). These facilities may only be used if the customer is unable  
to obtain financing elsewhere and are priced at a premium to the market rate. Consequently the Directors do not consider that there  
is a significant exposure arising from the provision of these facilities.
Customer financing provisions cover guarantees provided for asset value and/or financing. It is estimated that the provision will be utilised 
as follows:

Commitments on delivered aircraft in excess of the amounts provided are shown in the table below. These are reported on a discounted basis 
at the Group’s borrowing rate to reflect better the time span over which these exposures could arise. These amounts do not represent values 
that are expected to crystallise. The commitments are denominated in US dollars. As the Group does not generally adopt cash flow hedge 
accounting for future foreign exchange transactions, this amount is reported, together with the sterling equivalent at the reporting date spot 
rate. The values of aircraft providing security are based on advice from a specialist aircraft appraiser.

Although sensitivity calculations are complex, the reduction of relevant security by 20% illustrates the sensitivity to changes in this assumption.
The Group’s captive insurance company retains a portion of the exposures it insures on behalf of the remainder of the Group. Significant 
delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost  
and timing of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date. The insurance provisions are based on information currently 
available, however it is inherent in the nature of the business that ultimate liabilities may vary. Provisions for outstanding claims are established 
to cover the outstanding expected liability as well as claims incurred but not yet reported.
Other provisions comprise a number of liabilities with varying expected utilisation rates.

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 19 Post-retirement benefits
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes:
 – The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Employees are entitled  
to retirement benefits based on either their final or career-average salaries and length of service. 
 – Overseas defined benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans and provide benefits in line with local practice. 
Additionally, in the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Group’s employment practices include the provision  
of healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees. These schemes are unfunded.
The valuations of the defined benefit schemes are based on the most recent funding valuations, where relevant, updated by the  
scheme actuaries to 31 December 2017.
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity, interest rate, inflation and investment risks. In the UK, 
and in the principal US and Canadian pension schemes, the Group has adopted investment policies to mitigate some of these risks.  
This involves investing a significant proportion of the schemes’ assets in Liability Driven Investment portfolios, which hold investments 
designed to offset interest rate and inflation rate risks. In addition, in the UK, the scheme has invested in a longevity swap, which is 
designed to offset longevity risks in respect of approximately two thirds of current pensioners.
Following the buy-out of the liabilities of the Vickers Group Pension Scheme in 2016, the scheme returned its remaining surplus  
of £5m (net of tax) to the Group in the year. This scheme is expected to be formally wound up in early 2018.

Defined benefit schemes’ assumptions
Significant actuarial assumptions for the UK schemes used at the balance sheet date were as follows: 
2017 2016
Discount rate 2.55% 2.70%
Inflation assumption (RPI) 
1
3.40% 3.50%
Rate of increase in salaries 3.65% 4.25%
Life expectancy from age 65: current male pensioner 22.2 years 22.7 years
 future male pensioner currently aged 45 23.5 years 24.3 years
 current female pensioner 23.5 years 24.1 years
 future female pensioner currently aged 45 25.3 years 26.4 years
1 
This is the assumption for the Retail Price Index. The Consumer Price Index is assumed to be 1.1% lower.
Discount rates are determined by reference to the market yields on AA rated corporate bonds. The rate is determined by using the  
profile of forecast benefit payments to derive a weighted average discount rate from the yield curve.
The inflation assumption is determined by the market implied assumption based on the yields on long-term indexed linked government 
securities and increases in salaries are based on actual experience, allowing for promotion, of the real increase above inflation.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the UK pension schemes are derived from the SAPS 2 “All” actuarial tables, with future 
improvements in line with the CMI 2016 core projections and long-term improvements of 1.25%. Where appropriate, these are adjusted  
to take account of the relevant scheme’s actual experience. 
Other assumptions have been set on advice from the relevant actuary, having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and the 
assumptions used in the most recent funding valuation. The rate of increase of pensions in payment is based on the rules of the relevant 
scheme, combined with the inflation assumption where the increase is capped. 
Assumptions for overseas schemes are less significant and are based on advice from local actuaries. The principal assumptions are:
2017 2016

Pension contributions to UK pension arrangements are generally paid via a salary sacrifice scheme under which employees agree to a reduction in gross contractual pay in return for 
the Group making additional pension contributions on their behalf. As a result, there is a decrease in wages and salaries and a corresponding increase in pension costs of £30m (2016: 
£31m) in the year.

Under the longevity swap, the Rolls-Royce UK Pension fund has agreed an average life expectancy of pensioners with a counterparty. If pensioners live longer than expected the 
counterparty will make payments to the fund to offset the additional cost of paying pensioners. If the reverse applies the cost of paying pensioners will be reduced but the scheme  
will be required to make payments to the counterparty. The longevity swap is valued at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 (Level 3).
4  
A portfolio of swap contracts designed to provide investment returns in line with global equity markets. The notional value of the portfolio was $84m (2016 $125m).
The investment strategy for the UK scheme is controlled by the Trustee in consultation with the Group. The scheme assets do not directly 
include any of the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group. At 31 December 
2017, there was an indirect holding of £1m of the Group’s financial instruments.
The longevity swap is valued by the scheme actuaries based on the difference between the agreed longevity assumptions at inception and 
actual longevity experience. All other fair values are provided by the fund managers. Where available, the fair values are quoted prices 
(e.g. listed equity, sovereign debt and corporate bonds). Unlisted investments (private equity) are included at values provided by the fund 
manager in accordance with relevant guidance. Other significant assets are valued based on observable inputs such as yield curves.

Future contributions
The Group expects to contribute approximately £230m to its defined benefit schemes in respect of 2018 (UK: £145m, Overseas: £85m).
In the UK, the funding is based on a statutory triennial funding valuation process. This includes a negotiation between the Group and  
the Trustee on actuarial assumptions used to value obligations (Technical Provisions) which may differ from those used for accounting set 
out above. The assumptions used to value Technical Provisions must be prudent rather than a best estimate of the liability. Most notably, 
the Technical Provision discount rate is currently based upon UK Government yields plus 0.5% rather than being based on yields of AA 
corporate bonds. Following the triennial valuation process, a Schedule of Contributions (SoC) must be agreed which sets out the required 
contribution for current service cost and any contributions from the employer to eliminate a deficit. The most recent valuation, as at  
31 March 2017, agreed by the Trustee in December 2017, showed that the UK scheme was estimated to be 112% funded on the Technical 
Provisions basis. Employer contributions (inclusive of employee contributions paid by a salary sacrifice arrangement) will subsequently be 
paid at a rate of 27% in 2018/19 and 28.5% in 2020 (2017: 31.6%). The SoC includes an arrangement for a potential increase in contributions 
during 2021 to 2023 (capped at £48.3m a year) if the Technical Provisions funding position is below 107% at 31 March 2020. As at  
31 December 2017 the Technical Provisions funding position was estimated to be 114%. 
Sensitivities
The calculations of the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the assumptions set out above. The following table summarises how  
the estimated impact of a change in a significant assumption would affect the UK defined benefit surplus at 31 December 2017, while 
holding all other assumptions constant. This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit 
obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may  
be correlated.
For the most significant funded schemes, the investment strategies hedge the risks from interest rates and inflation measured on a proxy 
solvency basis. For the UK scheme, the interest rate and inflation hedging is currently based on UK Government bond yields without any 
adjustment for any credit spread. The longevity risk of approximately two thirds of UK pensioner liabilities is also hedged. Where 
appropriate, the table also includes the corresponding movement in the value of the plan assets.

The differences between the sensitivities on obligations and plan assets arise largely due to differences in the methods used to value the obligations for accounting purposes and the 
adopted proxy solvency basis.

was 847p (2016: 668p).
Fair values of share-based payment plans
The weighted average fair value per share of equity-settled share-based payment plans granted during the year, estimated at the date 
of grant, are as follows:
2017 2016
PSP – 25% TSR uplift (CEO) n/a 714p 
PSP – 30% TSR uplift (Board) n/a 731p 
PSP – 50% TSR uplift (ELT) n/a 795p

Sharesave – three-year grant 244p n/a 
Sharesave – five-year grant 260p n/a 
APRA 773p n/a 
PSP/LTIP
The fair value of shares awarded are calculated using a pricing model that takes account of the non-entitlement to dividends (or equivalent) 
during the vesting period and the market-based performance condition based on expectations about volatility and the correlation of share 
price returns in the group of FTSE 100 companies and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share price 
performance and TSR vesting. This adjustment increases the fair value of the award relative to the share price at the date of grant.
Sharesave
The fair value of the options granted under the Sharesave plan is calculated using a binomial pricing model that assumes that participants 
will exercise their options at the beginning of the six-month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price. Otherwise it 
assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term. This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between 
the start and end of the exercise window.
APRA
The fair value of shares awarded under APRA is calculated as the share price on the date of the award, excluding expected dividends 
(or equivalent).

Non-cancellable operating lease rentals payable at 31 December 2016 were previously disclosed as £1,217m with changes made to correct the exchange rate applied to foreign 
currency leases and to include leases erroneously omitted, which have been identified during the IFRS 16 transition programme.
 – Operating lease rental obligations at 31 December 2017 primarily relate to either aero engines (£1,143m) that are used to support 
customer’s aircraft fleets or to land and buildings (£630m) used for production, administration or training purposes.  
 – Both classes of asset contain some contracts where payments are linked to an index such as LIBOR.  
 – Operating leases for aero engines typically contain no specific contractual right to renewal. Certain building operating leases have 
renewal options with an assessment of the appropriate lease term having being made at inception of each lease.  
 – Renewal dates for the most significant property leases fall between 2022 and 2025.
During the year £277m was recognised as an expense in the income statement in respect of operating leases (2016: £224m).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities in respect of customer financing commitments are described in note 18.
In January 2017, after full cooperation, the Company concluded deferred prosecution agreements with the SFO and the US Department  
of Justice and a leniency agreement with the MPF, the Brazilian federal prosecutors. Prosecutions of individuals may follow and other 
investigations or enforcement action may be taken by other authorities. In addition, we could still be affected by actions from customers 
and customers’ financiers. The Directors are not currently aware of any matters that are likely to lead to a financial loss, but cannot 
anticipate all the possible actions that may be taken or their potential consequences. 
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, 
performance and reliability. The Group has, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export finance, 
performance bonds, countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items. Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions  
and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are for substantial amounts. As a consequence of the insolvency 
of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured against known and potential claims from employees who worked 
for certain of the Group’s UK based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those businesses by the Group. While the outcome 
of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the Directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, 
after allowing for provisions already made, to result in significant loss to the Group. 
The Group’s share of equity accounted entities’ contingent liabilities is nil (2016: £12m).

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Financial Statements

Acquisitions
On 19 December 2017, the Group completed the acquisition of the 53.1% of the shares of Industria de Turbo Propulsores SA (ITP Aero) 
owned by SENER Grupo de Ingenieria SA (SENER) which it did not already own. 
The consideration of €718m is payable in eight quarterly instalments, commencing on 15 January 2018. At the Group’s election, each 
instalment may be settled in either cash or Rolls-Royce Holdings plc shares. If the consideration is in shares, a 3% premium is applied. 
Interest is accrued on the outstanding balance based on LIBOR + 1.5%.
The fair value of the previous joint venture investment in ITP Aero of £204m was re-measured using a discounted cash flow methodology 
using judgement in estimating future cash flows, assessing the discount rate and establishing a non-controlling interest discount. This gave 
rise to a gain of £553m.
Given the proximity of the acquisition to the year end, and as permitted by IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the fair value of acquired 
identifiable assets and liabilities have been presented on a provisional basis. Fair values were determined on the basis of an initial 
assessment performed by an independent professional expert prior to the acquisition date. Measurement techniques and estimation  
of future cash flows have been used to assess the value of the intangible assets at the date of acquisition. The total fair value of acquired 
identifiable assets and liabilities is £1,650m of which a significant value was allocated to intangible assets. The valuation indicated a  
bargain purchase of £245m, which has been recognised in the income statement.
The acquisition of the controlling interest in ITP Aero on 19 December 2017 did not have a significant impact on the Group’s underlying 
results for the year.

stakeholders funding the business (including debt holders and shareholders). Free cash flow is calculated as trading cash flow less 
recurring tax and post-employment benefit expenses excluding capital expenditures, payments made to shareholders, amounts spent 
(or received) on business acquisitions and foreign exchange changes on net funds. The Board considers that free cash flow reflects  
cash generated from the Group’s underlying trading.

Company Statement of Changes in Equity 1 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(FRS 101) on the historical cost basis.
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRS), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with  
the Companies Act 2006.
In these financial statements the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
 – A Cash Flow Statement and related notes.
 – Comparative period reconciliations for share capital.
 – The effects of new, but not yet effective accounting standards.
 – The requirements of IAS 24 Related Party Transactions and has, therefore, not disclosed transactions between the Company and 
its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
Financial Statements.
There were no changes to accounting standards that had a material impact on the 2017 Financial Statements.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement for the Company has not been included in these 
Financial Statements. As permitted by the audit fee disclosure regulations, disclosure of non-audit fees information is not included in 
respect of the Company.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are reported at cost less any amounts written off.
Share-based payments
As described in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 89 to 90, the Company grants awards of its own shares to employees of its 
subsidiary undertakings (see note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). The costs of share-based payments in respect of these 
awards are accounted for, by the Company, as an additional investment in its subsidiary undertakings. The costs are determined in 
accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. Any payments made by the subsidiary undertakings in respect of these arrangements 
are treated as a return of this investment.
Financial instruments
In accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, the Company’s C Shares are classified as financial liabilities and held 
at amortised cost from the date of issue until redeemed.

Accordingly, movements in C Shares are included in note 3.
5 Contingent liabilities
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the 
Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the 
guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment 
under the guarantee.
At 31 December 2017, these guarantees amounted to £2,930m (2016: £2,735m).

1 Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc 
(“the parent Company”) for the year ended 31 December 2017 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, and the related notes, including  
the accounting policies in Note 1, and the Company Balance Sheet, 
Company Statement of Changes in Equity, and the related notes, 
including the accounting policies in Note 1. 
In our opinion: 
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state  
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year  
then ended; 
 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union; 
 – the parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and 
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards  
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our 
audit opinion is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the directors for the year ending 
31 December 1990. The period of total uninterrupted engagement 
is for the 28 financial years ended 31 December 2017. This is my 
fifth year as Senior Statutory Auditor. We have fulfilled our ethical 
responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group  
in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC 
Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. No 
non-audit services prohibited by that standard were provided.
2 Key audit matters: our assessment of risks  
of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of  
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit 
strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing  
the efforts of the audit team. We summarise below the key audit 
matters in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key 
audit procedures to address those matters and our findings from 
those procedures in order that the Company’s members as a body 
may better understand the process by which we arrived at our audit 
opinion. These matters were addressed, and our findings are based 
on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the 
purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that 
opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
When planning our audit, we made an assessment of the relative 
significance of the key risks of material misstatement to the  
Group financial statements, initially without taking account of the 
effectiveness of controls implemented by the Group. This initial 
assessment is shown below in the output from our Dynamic Audit 
planning tool. Of the 20 key risks identified, we consider nine  
(those in dark blue on the risk map) to be key audit matters.  
There have been a number of changes since last year:
 – During the year, the Group acquired the 53.1% of Industria  
De Turbo Propulsores SA (ITP Aero) that it did not already own 
and the risks relating to the remeasurement of the interest 
already owned to fair value, the risks relating to the identification 
and measurement at fair value of the acquired intangible assets  
and the consequent recognition of a “bargain purchase gain”  
are key risks (and a key audit matter) this year. 
 – The Group will adopt IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with 
customers with effect from 2018 and is disclosing the impact  
in these financial statements for the first time. The risks that the 
Group has not developed policies in line with the new standard, 
that not all material areas of potential change have been 
identified and that the policies have not been applied 
appropriately are key risks (and a key audit matter) this year. 
 – The Group entered into deferred prosecution and leniency 
agreements in connection with alleged bribery and corruption  
in overseas territories in January 2017. If the Group were found 
to have failed to fulfil its responsibilities under the deferred 
prosecution agreements it would risk prosecution and this  
would require disclosure in the financial statements. The key  
risk identified last year relating to bribery and corruption has 
been subsumed into a broader key risk (which is also a key audit 
matter) relating to the omission of such disclosure. In addition, 
the key risk identified last year relating to the disclosure of the 
consequences of the investigations is no longer considered  
to be a key risk.
 – Over recent years, the Group has reduced the level of asset 
value support provided to customers (though it continues to 
provide standby credit lines to customers) and we assessed the 
risk of material misstatement to have reduced to such an extent 
that this key risk is no longer a key audit matter.
Apart from this, the key risks are the same as in the previous year.
Finally, following changes to auditing standards, we have included 
a key audit matter relating to the recoverability of the parent 
Company’s investment in its subsidiaries.

Independent Auditor’s Report
 A  The pressure on and incentives for management to meet 
revenue, profit and cash targets
Refer to pages 21 to 41 (Business review) and pages 99 and 100 
(Audit Committee report – Financial reporting)
The risk (Subjective estimates) – The continuing pressure on and 
incentives for management to meet targets increases the inherent 
risk of manipulation of the Group financial statements. The financial 
results are sensitive to significant estimates and judgements, 
particularly in respect of revenues and costs associated with 
long-term contracts, and there is a broad range of acceptable 
outcomes of these that could lead to different levels of profit  
and revenue being reported in the financial statements. Relatively 
small changes in the basis of those judgements and estimates could 
result in the Group meeting, exceeding or falling short of forecasts, 
guidance or targets. The Group’s incentive schemes include targets 
related to profit and to cash generation.
The significance of this risk increased somewhat during the year  
as (1) the Group has been impacted by the increasing cost and 
challenge of managing significant in-service engine issues on the 
Trent 1000 and Trent 900 programmes and so there could be 
motivation to overstate financial performance to downplay the 
impact of these on the Group and (2) there have been significant 
changes in the Executive Leadership Team in the last year and so 
there could be motivation to establish credibility.
Our response – Our procedures included:
 – Personnel interviews: We have made specific enquiries designed 
to assess whether judgements and estimates exhibited 
unconscious bias or whether management had taken systematic 
actions to manipulate the reported results and whether sector 
management received instruction from Group to make changes 
in estimates that failed to consider appropriately all relevant 
information in determining the estimate; 
 – Test of details: Compared the results to forecasts, guidance and 
targets, and challenged variances at a much lower level than  
we would otherwise have done based on our understanding  
of factors affecting business performance with corroboration 
using external data where possible;  
 – Our sector experience: Applied an increased level of scepticism 
throughout the audit by increasing the involvement of the senior 
audit team personnel, with particular focus on audit procedures 
designed to assess whether revenues and costs have been 
recognised in the correct accounting period, whether central 
adjustments were appropriate and whether the segmental 
analysis has been properly prepared. In particular:
 – when considering the risk relating to The measurement of 
revenue and profit in the Civil Aerospace business ( C refer  
to pages 185 and 186), we challenged the basis for changes  
in the estimated revenues and costs in long-term contracts,  
with a heightened awareness of the possibility of unconscious 
or systematic bias with particular emphasis on the treatment  
of the additional costs estimated to have to be incurred as a 
consequence of the in-service engine issues on the Trent 1000 
and Trent 900 programmes;
 – when considering the risk relating to Recoverability of 
intangible assets in the Civil Aerospace business ( D refer  
to pages 186 and 187), we challenged, with a heightened 
awareness of the possibility of unconscious or systematic bias, 
the basis of cost estimates in particular those relating to the 
development of the Trent 900 modifications required to give 
improvements to time on wing and fuel burn; and
 – Assessing transparency: When considering the risk relating  
to The presentation of underlying profit ( F refer to pages 188 
and 189) and the risk relating to Disclosure of the effect on the 
trend in profit of items which are uneven in frequency or amount

( G refer to pages 189 and 190), we sought to identify items that 
affected profit (and/or the trend in profit) unevenly in frequency 
or amount (especially those where management had a greater 
degree of discretion over the timing or scale of transactions 
entered into) at a much lower level than we would otherwise 
have done and to assess the balance and transparency of 
disclosure of these items.
Our findings – Our testing did not identify any indication of 
manipulation of results (2016 audit finding: none). We found the 
degree of caution/optimism adopted in estimates to be balanced 
overall (2016 audit finding: balanced). We found that there was 
ample unbiased disclosure of items affecting the trend in profit.
 B  The basis of accounting for revenue and profit in the  
Civil Aerospace business
Refer to pages 122 and 123 (Key areas of judgement – Introduction, 
Contractual aftermarket rights, Linkage of OE and long-term 
aftermarket contracts), page 126 (Significant accounting policies 
– Revenue recognition) and pages 99 and 100 (Audit Committee 
report – Financial reporting)
The risk (Accounting treatment) – The amount of revenue and profit 
recognised in a year on the sale of engines and aftermarket services 
is dependent, inter alia, on the appropriate assessment of whether  
or not each long-term aftermarket contract for services is linked  
to or separate from the contract for sale of the related engines as 
this drives the accounting basis to be applied. As the commercial 
arrangements can be complex, significant judgement is applied in 
selecting the accounting basis in each case. The most significant risk 
is that the Group might inappropriately account for sales of engines 
and long-term service agreements as a single arrangement as this 
would usually lead to revenue and profit being recognised too early 
because the margin in the long-term service agreement is usually 
higher than the margin in the engine sale agreement.
The significance of the risk increased during the year as more 
engines were delivered this year.
Our response – Our procedures included:
 – Accounting analysis: We evaluated the appropriateness of the 
accounting bases the Group applies in the Civil Aerospace 
business by reference to accounting standards focusing on  
the substance of the transactions. 
 – Assessing transparency: We considered whether the disclosure 
included in the financial statements enables shareholders to 
understand how the accounting policies represent the commercial 
substance of the Group’s contracts with its customers. 
 – Testing application: We made our own independent assessment, 
with reference to the relevant accounting standards, of the 
accounting basis that should be applied to each long-term 
aftermarket contract entered into during the year and compared 
this to the accounting basis applied by the Group.
Our findings – We found that the Group has developed a 
framework for selecting the accounting bases which is consistent 
with a balanced interpretation of accounting standards and has 
applied this consistently (2016 audit finding: balanced). We found 
that the disclosure was ample (2016 audit finding: ample). For the 
agreements entered into during this year, it was clear which 
accounting basis should apply. 
 C  The measurement of revenue and profit in the Civil Aerospace 
business
Refer to pages 122 and 123 (Key areas of judgement – 
Measurement of performance on long-term aftermarket contracts), 
page 126 (Significant accounting policies – Revenue recognition 
and TotalCare arrangements) and pages 99 and 100  
(Audit Committee report – Financial reporting)
The risk (Subjective estimates) – The amount of revenue and profit 
recognised in a year on the sale of engines and on aftermarket 
services is dependent, inter alia, on the assessment of the 
percentage of completion of long-term aftermarket contracts  
and the forecast cost profile of each arrangement. As long-term 
aftermarket contracts can typically span 15-25 years and the 
profitability of these arrangements typically assumes substantial 
life-cycle cost improvement over the term of the contracts, the 
estimated outturn requires significant judgement to be applied  
in estimating future engine flying hours, time on wing and other 
operating parameters, the pattern of future maintenance activity 
and the costs to be incurred. In addition unanticipated technical 
issues can emerge without prior indication and add many hundreds 
of millions of pounds to future cost estimates.
The nature of these estimates means that their continual refinement 
can have an impact on the profits of the Civil Aerospace business 
that can be significant in an individual financial year and the range of 
acceptable of judgements are such that the cumulative profit to date 
on the programs could vary by some hundreds of millions of pounds. 
The Group has experienced significant in-service engine issues  
on both the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 programmes. Assessing the 
estimated cost of managing these issues, assessing which costs relate 
to long-term aftermarket contracts and which are development  
costs and assessing the extent to which the proposed engineering 
solutions will improve engine performance are all significant 
judgements which have a significant effect on profit recognition. 
As a consequence of these in-service engine issues, the significance 
of the risk has increased significantly during the year.
Our response – Our procedures included:
 – Controls: We tested the controls designed and applied by the 
Group to provide assurance that the estimates used in assessing 
revenue and cost profiles are appropriate and that the resulting 
estimated cumulative profit on these contracts is accurately 
reflected in the financial statements; these controls operated 
over both the inputs and the outputs of the calculations. 
 – Historical comparisons and our sector knowledge: We 
challenged the appropriateness of these estimates for each 
programme and assessed whether or not the estimates indicated 
any evidence of systematic or unconscious management bias in 
the context of the heightened pressure on and incentives for 
management to meet forecasts, guidance and targets discussed 
above. Our challenge was based on our assessment of the 
historical accuracy of the Group’s estimates in previous periods 
in relation to both cost and revenue forecasts, identification and 
analysis of changes in assumptions from prior periods and an 
assessment of the consistency of assumptions within programmes 
as well as with our sector experience. 186
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Other Information
Independent Auditor’s Report
Our analysis of forecast revenues considered each significant 
airframe that is powered by the Group’s engines. We developed 
expectations of changes which were based on discussions  
with commercial and operational management and our own 
experience, supplemented by discussions with an aircraft 
valuation specialist engaged by the Group. We assessed whether 
the valuation specialist was objective and suitably qualified. 
Our analysis of forecast costs considered costs on both a 
programme-by-programme basis and on a cross-programme basis. 
We undertook detailed assessments of the achievability of the 
Group’s plans to reduce life-cycle costs and an analysis of the 
impact of these plans on forecast cost profiles taking account  
of the impact of known technical issues on cost forecasts. We 
compared future cost assumptions to those adopted in the prior 
year and sought explanations for these movements from financial 
and operational management, corroborating to appropriate 
engineering cost data. We focused on the estimates of costs 
expected to be incurred to respond to the in-service engine  
issues on the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 programmes.
We considered the nature of the causes of the in-service  
engine issues on the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 programmes  
and challenged management on its assessment of the extent to 
which the proposed engineering solutions will improve engine 
performance and the extent to which this assessment has been 
reflected in the estimated cumulative profit on aftermarket 
contracts on the affected fleets. As this assessment is dependent 
on deep engineering expertise of management personnel, we 
requested and received specific representations from the Board 
of Directors that it was likely that the proposed engineering 
solutions should improve engine performance to at least the 
levels included in these accounting estimates.
 – Test of details: We considered a combination of external and 
internal information to determine expectations for contract 
revenue and cost assumptions for each programme and 
identified contracts that were outliers. We sought explanations 
for these outliers and corroborated these explanations by 
reference to appropriate commercial information and, where 
necessary, the underlying contracts. 
For all new contracts in the period we assessed whether key 
contractual terms, such as the contract length, the number of 
engines expected to be delivered and the flying hour rates, were 
correctly reflected in the contract accounting models. We also 
reviewed the contracts for unusual terms that might indicate a 
cost profile different to the baseline cost assumptions for the fleet.
We also checked the mathematical accuracy of analysis of the 
in-year margin impact of changes in cost and revenue estimates 
on a contract by contract basis. For a sample of contracts  
we obtained explanations for the changes in assumptions, 
corroborating those explanations by reference to appropriate 
commercial and operational data, and assessed whether any 
changes identified had been reflected across other fleets  
where relevant.
We considered the completeness of cost estimates for emerging 
technical issues by reviewing a combination of external 
information, such as air worthiness directives, and internal 
information such as registers of in-flight events and  
disruption indices.
We challenged the assessment of the recoverability of contract 
assets by considering external customer credit ratings and 
searching for any other indicators of stress amongst the 
customer base. We also considered whether there were any 
indicators of heightened risk over forecast revenue assumptions 
by considering the recent hours flown by customers, with a 
particular focus on older fleets.
 – Personnel interviews: We interviewed a wide range of financial 
and operational personnel to identify any factors that should be 
taken into account in our analysis. In all cases we corroborated 
management’s explanations, including changes in assumptions, 
and evaluated these relative to our own analysis. We assessed 
whether there were any indicators of bias in the explanations 
provided to us by management.
Our findings – We focused our controls testing on controls that we 
assessed as likely to provide effective audit evidence, largely those 
relating to revenue estimates. We also considered the operation of 
other controls in order to provide relevant comment to management 
and the Audit Committee. We found that the remediation of control 
weaknesses identified in earlier periods had been consolidated. The 
scope and depth of our detailed testing and analysis was expanded 
to take account of the remaining control weaknesses. 
We found that the in-service issues on the Trent 1000 and Trent 
900 programmes largely related to a shorter than expected life  
of turbine blades. We therefore consider that the short-term costs 
of monitoring the condition of these blades and replacing them 
earlier than anticipated where necessary and the costs of fitting 
replacement parts with longer lives (and the cost of related 
disruption claims) were properly assessed as being contract costs 
and that the cost of designing replacement parts with longer lives 
(and associated improvements) were properly assessed as being 
development costs that should be charged to the income statement 
as incurred.
We found that the estimates included in the accounting for 
long-term aftermarket contracts on the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 
fleets affected by the in-service engine issues were balanced and 
that the current level of understanding and the nature of some of 
these issues are such that the estimated level of improvement in 
engine performance and the estimated costs could change 
significantly in the future as this understanding matures.
Our testing did not identify any indicators of management bias in  
the estimation of future contract costs or revenues and verified that 
refinements to estimates made during the period were justifiable  
and within a range of reasonably expected outcomes. Overall, our 
assessment is that the assumptions and resulting estimates resulted 
in balanced (2016 audit finding: balanced) profit recognition. 
 D  Recoverability of intangible assets (certification costs and 
participation fees, development expenditure and contractual 
aftermarket rights) in the Civil Aerospace business
Refer to page 124 (Key sources of estimation uncertainty – 
Forecasts and discount rates), pages 128 and 129 (Significant 
accounting policies – Certification costs and participation fees, 
Research and development, Contractual aftermarket rights and 
Impairment of non-current assets), pages 142 to 143 (Note 9 to  
the financial statements – Intangible assets) and pages 99 and 100 
(Audit Committee report – Financial reporting)
The risk (Forecast-based valuation) – The recovery of these assets 
depends on a combination of achieving sufficiently profitable 
business in the future as well as the ability of customers to pay 
amounts due under contracts often over a long period of time. 
Assets relating to a particular engine programme are more prone  
to the risk of impairment in the early years of a programme as the 
engine’s market position is established. In addition, the pricing  
of business with launch customers makes assets relating to these 
engines more prone to the risk of impairment.  Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
187
Other Information
Independent Auditor’s Report
OTHER INFORMATION
The significance of the risk has increased during the year due to  
the substantial increase in the estimated cost of managing in-service 
engine issues and developing longer-lived turbine blades (and 
associated improvements) for the Trent 900 programme, which is  
the programme where the intangible assets are most susceptible  
to impairment. 
Our response – Our procedures focused on the Trent 900 
programme intangible assets and included: 
 – Controls: We tested the controls designed and applied by  
the Group to provide assurance that the assumptions used in 
preparing the impairment calculations are regularly updated, 
that changes are monitored, scrutinised and approved by 
appropriate personnel and that the final assumptions used  
in impairment testing have been appropriately approved. 
 – Historical comparisons and our sector knowledge: We 
challenged the appropriateness of the key assumptions in the 
impairment tests (including market size, market share, pricing, 
engine and aftermarket unit costs, individual programme 
assumptions, price and cost escalation, discount rate and 
exchange rates). Our challenge was based on our assessment  
of the historical accuracy of the Group’s estimates in previous 
periods, our understanding of the commercial prospects of  
key engine programmes, identification and analysis of changes  
in assumptions from prior periods and an assessment of the 
consistency of assumptions across programmes and customers 
and comparison of assumptions with public data where this  
was available. This assessment was also informed by discussions 
with an aircraft valuation specialist engaged by the Group.  
We assessed whether the valuation specialist was objective  
and suitably qualified. 
We also assessed whether the significant increase in the estimated 
cost of managing the in-service engine issues on the Trent 900 
programme indicated that management’s estimates made for the 
2016 impairment test for that programme were optimistic and 
whether that should impact on our assessment of estimates made 
this year.
We considered the nature and causes of the in-service engine 
issues on the Trent 900 programme and challenged management 
on its assessment of the cost of addressing these issues and  
on the extent to which the proposed engineering solutions  
will improve engine performance and the extent to which this 
assessment has been reflected in the estimated future cash flows 
of the affected fleets. As these assessments are dependent on 
deep engineering expertise of management personnel, we 
requested and received specific representations from the Board 
of Directors that it was likely that the proposed engineering 
solutions should improve engine performance to at least the 
levels included in these accounting estimates. 
 – Test of details: For in-service engines we compared the 
assumptions in the impairment model to those that we had 
verified to be appropriate in the contract accounting models 
through the procedures discussed above. We compared 
assumptions in the business plans to those adopted in prior 
periods and for all changes we obtained explanations, 
corroborating those explanations by reference to appropriate 
commercial and operational data.
 – Sensitivity analysis: We performed sensitivity analysis to assess 
the impact of possible different assumptions related to revenue 
and cost estimates including (1) increases or decreases to the 
forecast period of aftermarket revenue on current in-service 
engines, (2) decreases to the forecast future engine sales and (3) 
increases or decreases to the forecast costs or delays in 
delivering the solutions to the in-service technical issues 
referred to above including any increased pay-outs under 
associated guarantees to a cornerstone customer.
 – Personnel interviews: We interviewed a wide range of financial 
and operational personnel to identify any factors that should be 
taken into account in our analysis. In all cases we corroborated 
management’s explanations, including changes in assumptions, 
and evaluated these relative to our own analysis. We assessed 
whether there were any indicators of bias in the explanations 
provided to us by management.
 – Assessing transparency: We considered whether the disclosures 
in Note 9 to the financial statements describe the inherent 
degree of subjectivity in the estimates and the potential impact 
on future periods of revisions to these estimates.
Our findings – Our testing did not identify weaknesses in the 
design and operation of controls that would have required us to 
expand the nature or scope of our planned detailed test work.  
We found no errors in calculations (2016 audit finding: none).
With regard to the Trent 900 programme assets, we found (1)  
that the cost estimates made for the 2016 impairment test were 
appropriate in hindsight, based on the emergence of the issues  
late in 2016 and the data available at that time; (2) that there is no 
evidence that estimates made for the 2017 impairment test were 
biased; and (3) that overall the assumptions and resulting estimates 
on the Trent 900 programme were mildly optimistic and that other 
acceptable estimates could have led to the recognition of an 
impairment (2016 audit finding: balanced). We found that the 
disclosures relating to the carrying value of programme intangible 
assets were proportionate in the context of a significant portion of 
these assets being derecognised on adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers (2016 audit finding: proportionate).
 E  Consequences of deferred prosecution and leniency 
agreements in connection with alleged bribery and  
corruption in overseas markets
Refer to pages 109 (Safety & Ethics Committee report –  
Ethics and compliance)
The risk (Omitted disclosure) – In January 2017, the Group entered 
into deferred prosecution agreements with the UK Serious Fraud 
Office (SFO) and the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and a leniency 
agreement with the Brazilian Federal Prosecution Service (MPF)  
(the “Agreements”) related to allegations against the Group for  
making fraudulent payments to commercial intermediaries in 
overseas territories. Under the Agreements, prosecution was 
suspended provided that the Group fulfils certain requirements, 
including the payment of a financial penalty. If the Group were found 
to have failed to fulfil its responsibilities under the Agreements it 
would risk prosecution and this would require disclosure in the 
financial statements. 188
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Other Information
Independent Auditor’s Report
We have read the Agreements and consider that the most relevant 
circumstance that could result in the risk of prosecution would  
be identification of further instances of bribery and corruption 
(whether or not reported to the authorities). The Group operates  
in an industry where some procurement processes are highly 
susceptible to the risk of corruption. A large part of the Group’s 
business is characterised by competition for individually significant 
contracts with customers which are often directly or indirectly 
associated with governments. In addition the Group operates in  
a number of territories where the use of commercial intermediaries 
is either required by the government or is common practice. 
We therefore designed an approach to provide reasonable 
assurance that we would identify bribery and corruption involving 
commercial intermediaries that would require disclosure in the 
financial statements. However, as described below reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance. It does not guarantee that  
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect 
a material misstatement when one exists. As with any audit, there 
remains a higher risk of non-detection of irregularities (such as 
bribery and corruption), as these may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal controls. 
Whilst this inherent limitation is the same as that in other audits,  
it should be of greater significance to the addressee of this  
audit report. 
This is a risk arising for the first time this year.
Our response – Our procedures included:
 – Heightened scepticism and use of our anti-bribery and 
corruption expertise: Throughout the audit we maintained  
a high level of vigilance to possible indications of significant 
non-compliance with laws and regulations relating to bribery  
and corruption whilst carrying out our other audit procedures.  
In particular, we communicated the risks over bribery and 
corruption to our team, which included individuals with 
experience relevant to considering bribery and corruption risks 
in the context of an audit, and we requested our component 
teams to report on any possible indications of irregularities in 
this area.
 – Control design: We evaluated the tone set by the Board of 
Directors and the Executive Leadership Team and the Group’s 
approach to managing the risk of bribery and corruption.  
We evaluated and tested the Group’s policies, procedures  
and controls over selection, appointment and renewal of 
intermediaries, contracting with intermediaries, ongoing 
management of contracts with intermediaries and payments made 
to intermediaries. We observed Sector Audit Committee meetings 
at which lists of payments were reviewed for completeness.  
We evaluated internal audits covering payments to intermediaries 
and we compared the results of the internal audits to the results of 
our testing of payments described below. We also made enquiries 
of the Group’s central compliance function and reviewed their 
reporting to the Safety & Ethics Committee and to the Sector 
Audit Committees in connection with the identification of and 
response to suspected breaches of policy. 
 – Test of details: We sought to identify payments made to 
commercial intermediaries during the year using data analysis 
techniques. This included (1) searching for transaction details 
which included specific terms or names of organisations that  
in our experience could be associated with potential payments  
to commercial intermediaries, or the names of commercial 
intermediaries that had been rejected through the Group’s 
selection process or had been identified during the 
investigations by the DoJ, SFO and MPF and (2) extracting details 
of transactions that had been recorded in accounts that were 
intended to record payments to commercial intermediaries.  
For a sample of these transactions, we then tested whether the 
identified transactions had been subject to the Group’s controls 
over approval of payments made to commercial intermediaries 
including whether the organisations to which payments were 
made had been subject to the Group’s controls over the 
appointment and renewal of commercial intermediaries.
 – Enquiry of lawyers: Having enquired of management, including 
the Head of Ethics and Compliance and the Group General 
Counsel, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors as to 
whether the Group is in compliance with laws and regulations 
relating to bribery and corruption, we made written enquiries  
of and met with the Group’s legal advisers to cross check the 
results of those enquiries and also to enquire whether they were 
aware of any matters relating to the Group’s compliance with  
the Agreements. 
 – Compliance report scrutiny: We reviewed the compliance 
reports required to be made to the DoJ and the SFO under  
the Agreements and to other authorities and vouched the status 
of matters documented in these reports to further support where 
objectively verifiable. 
Our findings – We did not identify any breaches of the requirements 
of the Agreements, payments of bribes or other corrupt behaviour 
that would result in omitted disclosure in the financial statements.

Refer to pages 21 to 41 (Business review), pages 16 to 19 and 50  
to 54 (Financial review), pages 132 to 136 (Note 2 to the financial 
statements – Segmental analysis) and pages 99 and 100  
(Audit Committee report – Financial reporting)
 F  The presentation of ‘underlying profit’
The risk (Presentation appropriateness) – In addition to its Adopted 
IFRS financial statements, the Group presents an alternative income 
statement on an ‘underlying’ basis. The directors believe the 
‘underlying’ income statement reflects better the Group’s trading 
performance during the year. The basis of adjusting between the 
Adopted IFRS and ‘underlying’ income statements and a full 
reconciliation between them is set out in Note 2 to the financial 
statements on pages 134 and 135. 
A significant recurring adjustment between the Adopted IFRS 
financial information and the ‘underlying’ financial information 
relates to the foreign exchange rates used to translate foreign 
currency transactions. The Group uses forward foreign exchange 
contracts to manage the cash flow exposures of a proportion of 
forecast transactions denominated in foreign currencies (with the 
aim of having transactions denominated in foreign currencies in  
the current period fully hedged) but does not apply hedge 
accounting in its Adopted IFRS financial information for these 
transactions. The ‘underlying’ financial information translates 
transactions denominated in foreign currencies at the achieved 
foreign exchange rate on forward foreign exchange contracts 
settled in the period, retranslates assets and liabilities at exchange 
rates forecast to be achieved from future settlement of such 
contracts and excludes unrealised gains and losses on such 
contracts which are included in the Adopted IFRS income 
statement. The Group has discretion over which forward foreign 
exchange contracts are settled in each financial year, which could 
impact the achieved rate both for the period and in the future. 
Management bias in the selection of the settled forward foreign 
exchange contracts could distort the performance of the Group. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

Independent Auditor’s Report
OTHER INFORMATION
In addition, adjustments are made to exclude one-off past-service 
costs on post-retirement schemes, the cost of restructuring 
programmes that involve the substantial closure or exit from a site, 
facility or line of business or other major transformation activities, 
the effect of acquisition accounting (including any subsequent 
impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets), gains or losses 
on the sale of businesses and a number of other items. 
Alternative performance measures (such as the ‘underlying’ 
financial information) can provide shareholders with appropriate 
additional information if properly used and presented. In such 
cases, measures such as these can assist shareholders in gaining  
a more detailed and hence better understanding of a company’s 
financial performance and strategy. However, when improperly 
used and/or presented, these kinds of measures might prevent the 
Annual Report being fair, balanced and understandable by hiding 
the real financial position and results or by distorting the apparent 
profitability of the Group.
The significance of this risk has decreased this year following  
the inclusion of somewhat improved disclosure of the nature  
and amounts of the adjustments between Adopted IFRS and 
underlying measures in the 2016 and 2017 Annual Reports.
Our response – Our procedures included:
 – Assessing principles: We assessed the appropriateness of the 
basis for the adjustments between the Adopted IFRS income 
statement and the ‘underlying’ income statement.
 – Assessing application: We assessed the consistency of 
application of this basis and we recalculated the adjustments 
with a particular focus on the impact of the foreign exchange 
rates used to translate foreign currency amounts in the 
‘underlying’ income statement. We assessed whether or not  
the selection of forward foreign exchange contracts settled  
in the year showed any evidence of management bias. 
 – Assessing transparency: We also assessed: (i) the extent to which 
the prominence given to the ‘underlying’ financial information 
and related commentary in the Annual Report compared to the 
Adopted IFRS financial information and related commentary 
could be misleading; (ii) whether the Adopted IFRS and 
‘underlying’ financial information are reconciled with sufficient 
prominence given to that reconciliation; (iii) whether the basis  
of the ‘underlying’ financial information is clearly and accurately 
described and consistently applied; and (iv) whether the 
‘underlying’ financial information is not otherwise misleading in 
the form and context in which it appears in the Annual Report.
Our findings – We found no concerns regarding the basis of  
the ‘underlying’ financial information or its calculation and no 
indication of management bias in the settlement of forward foreign 
exchange contracts. We consider that there is proportionate 
disclosure of the nature and amounts of the adjustments to allow 
shareholders to understand the implications of the two bases  
on the financial measures being presented (2016 audit finding: 
proportionate (and somewhat improved)). We found the overall 
presentation of the ‘underlying’ financial information to be 
balanced (2016 audit finding: balanced).
 G  Disclosure of the effect on the trend in profit of items which  
are uneven in frequency or amount
The risk (Presentation appropriateness) – The Group’s profits  
are significantly impacted by items, such as cumulative adjustments 
to profit recognised on long-term contracts, impairments (and 
reversals of impairments) of goodwill, CARs and other intangible 
assets, sale and leasebacks of spare engines to joint ventures, 
research and development charges, reorganisation costs and 
foreign exchange translation, which can be uneven in frequency 
and/or amount. If significant either to the profit for the year or  
to the trend in profit, appropriate disclosure of the effect of these 
items is necessary in the Annual Report and financial statements  
to provide the information necessary to enable shareholders to 
assess the Group’s performance.
The significance of this risk has decreased this year as the Group 
now has a well-established practice of providing ample disclosure 
of these items.
Our response – Our procedures included:
 – Assessing balance and assessing transparency: We undertook 
detailed analysis of business performance at Group and segment 
level that sought to identify items that affect profit (and the trend 
in profit) which are uneven in frequency or amount at a much 
lower level than we would otherwise have done and to assess  
the transparency of disclosure of these items. We challenged the 
prominence and adequacy of the disclosures throughout the 
Annual Report and in the results announcement relating to the 
significant in-service engine issues on the Trent 1000 and Trent 
900 programmes, in particular the adequacy of the disclosure 
indicating the estimated future cost of these issues in the context 
of only a proportion of the cash impact being incurred to date 
and of contract accounting resulting in only a proportion of the 
estimated ultimate cost having been recorded in the income 
statement to date. 
Our findings – We identified a number of significant items that  
had affected profit for the year or the prior year that required 
appropriate disclosure in the Annual Report to enable shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance. The key items are: 
(1)  the £2,648m unrealised fair value gains (2016: £4,420m losses) 
on derivative contracts;
(2)  the £227m loss (2016: £98m loss) relating to in-service engine 
issues on the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 programmes;
(3)  the £113m gain (2016: £217m gain) arising from the impact  
of improvements in lifecycle costs on long-term contracts; 
(4)  the £148m loss (2016: £98m loss) on long-term contracts arising 
from technical issues on Civil Aerospace engines including 
£114m (2016: £55m) relating to the in-service engine issues  
on the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 programmes which is also 
included in (2) above;
(5)  the £77m gain (2016: nil) resulting from an improvement  
in a customer credit rating;
(6)  the £60m loss (2016: £29m loss) arising from other estimate 
changes on long-term contracts;
(7)  the £795m (2016: £918m) of research and development charges, 
which excludes £83m of costs capitalised in 2017 as certain 
programmes reached capitalisation point under revised 
application of the Group’s accounting policy; 
(8)  the £104m, net of a release of prior year provisions of £3m, 
(2016: £129m, net of a £5m release) of exceptional  
restructuring charges; 
(9)  the £75m (2016: £119m) profit arising from sales of spare engines 
to joint ventures; 
(10)  the £798m of gains resulting from the acquisition of a 
controlling interest in ITP Aero; 190
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Other Information
Independent Auditor’s Report
(11)  the £163m (2016: nil) of advance corporation tax recognised  
on change of tax legislation;
(12)  the £219m impairment of goodwill recognised in 2016;
(13)  the £30m loss arising on Civil Aerospace new engine 
programmes in 2016;
(14)  the £671m financial penalties recognised in 2016 from 
agreements with investigating authorities in connection  
with alleged historic bribery and corruption involving 
intermediaries in overseas territories;
(15)  the £53m release of accruals in 2016 relating to the termination 
in prior years of intermediaries services;
(16)  the £306m loss recognised in 2016 from the restructuring of  
the UK pension schemes.
We found that ample disclosure of these items had been provided 
in the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole 
(2016 audit finding: ample).
 H  Gains resulting from the acquisition of a controlling interest  
in Industria De Turbo Propulsores SA (ITP Aero)
Refer to pages 99 and 100 (Audit Committee report – Financial 
reporting), page 128 (Note 1 to the financial statements – 
Accounting policies) and page 167 (Note 25 to the financial 
statements – Acquisitions and disposals)
The risk (Subjective valuation) – On 19 December 2017, the Group 
purchased the outstanding 53.1% of Industria de Turbo Propulsores 
SA (ITP Aero) that it did not already own. As explained on page 167, 
given the proximity of the acquisition to the end of the year, the fair 
values of the assets and liabilities acquired have been assessed on 
a provisional basis. 
Estimating the fair value of the intangible assets of ITP Aero at the 
date of acquisition involved the use of complex valuation techniques 
and the estimation of future cash flows over a considerable period  
of time.
The Group’s existing 46.9% shareholding has been remeasured  
to estimated fair value at the acquisition date and a £553m gain  
has been recognised in the income statement. As the consideration 
payable for the remaining interest was established through  
a contractual mechanism included in the option agreement  
under which the remaining interest was “put” to the Group, it is  
not considered to be indicative of a fair value of the existing 
shareholding. The Group has calculated the fair value of the existing 
shareholding using a discounted cash flow methodology that 
involves the use of significant judgement in estimating future cash 
flows over a considerable period of time, assessing the appropriate 
discount rate to use and establishing a suitable non-controlling 
interest discount to deduct from the enterprise value. 
Our response – Our procedures, which were carried out in the 
context of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets only 
being able to be estimated on a provisional basis, included: 
 – Assessing the valuer’s credentials: Management engaged a  
third party expert to assist in identifying ITP Aero’s intangible 
assets and in determining their fair values at the acquisition date. 
We evaluated the expert’s competence and independence  
and whether it had been appropriately instructed and had  
been provided with complete, accurate data on which to base  
its valuations. 
 – Assessing the due diligence provider’s credentials: Management 
engaged a third party expert to assist in estimating the future  
cash flows of ITP Aero to be used in valuing the intangible assets 
acquired and the existing shareholding in ITP Aero. The third party 
expert was provided with base data by the management of ITP 
Aero and subjected this to challenge and derived adjustments  
to the base cash flows provided by management for use in  
the valuations. We evaluated the expert’s competence and 
independence and whether it had been appropriately instructed. 
 – Our corporate finance expertise and our sector knowledge:  
We evaluated the basis upon which management identified the 
intangible assets acquired. We assessed whether the measurement 
bases used to estimate the fair values of the identified assets were 
reasonable, taking account of our experience of similar assets in 
other comparable situations and our assessment of the work 
performed by the third party expert. 
 – Our corporate finance expertise and our sector knowledge:  
We assessed the basis used by management to value the existing 
shareholding in ITP Aero. We challenged the appropriateness of 
the key assumptions underlying the forecast cash flows (including 
program assumptions and the terminal value growth rate) and 
compared these to the Group’s own forecasts where ITP Aero’s 
and the Group’s businesses overlapped. We challenged the 
discount rate applied and the non-controlling interest discount 
deducted from the enterprise value in management’s valuation. 
We also assessed whether or not the estimates showed any 
evidence of management bias.
 – Assessing transparency: We assessed whether the appropriate 
disclosures have been provided on the judgements and 
estimates applied in arriving at the fair values.
Our findings – We found that the intangible assets identified  
were typical of acquisitions of similar businesses and the valuation  
bases were in accordance with accounting standards. We have no 
concerns with the basis on which the valuer had been instructed by 
the Group and found that the valuer was objective and competent 
and the estimates used in the valuations were balanced. We found 
that the disclosure regarding the provisional nature of the fair values 
attributed to the intangible assets was balanced given the timing  
of the acquisition and limitations on the information ITP Aero could 
provide to the Group prior to completion of the acquisition.
We found that the basis used to value the existing shareholding  
in ITP Aero was in accordance with accounting standards and that 
the key assumptions applied in the valuation were balanced. 
 I Disclosure of the impact of adopting IFRS 15
Refer to pages 99 and 100 (Audit Committee report – Financial 
reporting), pages 131 to 132 (Note 1 to the financial statements – 
Accounting policies – IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers) and pages 170 to 171 (Note 27 to the financial 
statements – Impact of IFRS 15)
The risk (Accounting treatment and accounting application) –  
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers will be effective  
for the year beginning 1 January 2018 and will have a pronounced 
impact on the recognition of revenue and profit in the Civil 
Aerospace business. The Group has disclosed the estimated  
impact of applying the new standard to its 2017 results. The Group’s 
contracts can be complex and there is significant judgement applied 
in selecting the accounting policies under IFRS 15. There is a risk that 
the Group has not captured the correct policies in line with the new 
standard and that not all material areas of potential change have 
been identified. In addition there is a risk that the policies are not 
applied appropriately. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

OTHER INFORMATION
Our response – Our procedures included: 
 – Accounting analysis and our sector experience: Starting in 2015, 
we reviewed the process and outputs of the adoption of IFRS 15 
impact analysis, evaluated the appropriateness of the key 
judgements and estimates, and assessed whether the policies 
adopted are in compliance with IFRS 15. Based on our knowledge 
of the business and of the impact of adoption of IFRS 15 on other 
companies with similar businesses, we assessed whether all 
material areas of potential change under IFRS 15 have been 
identified. We considered each significant distinct revenue 
stream and our knowledge of the terms of the contracts to 
determine the likelihood of there being a material difference 
between the current treatment and the requirements of IFRS 15. 
Our analysis covered the whole business but we were particularly 
focused on the Civil Aerospace business and on the treatment of 
long-term contracts in other parts of the Group.
 – Test of details: We selected samples of contracts based on a risk 
assessment of contracts most likely to be affected by IFRS 15 and 
recalculated the impact of applying the accounting policies 
developed by the Group.
 – Assessing transparency: We assessed whether the disclosure 
adequately disclosed the key revenue recognition policies under 
IFRS 15 and the estimated impact on the 2017 income statement 
and net assets at 31 December 2017.
Our findings – We found that the Group had carried out an analysis 
of potential differences between revenue recognition under IFRS 15 
and under its current accounting policies commensurate with 
describing the effect of applying the new standard. We found that 
the Group had made judgements in developing its IFRS 15 
accounting policies that were consistent with a balanced 
interpretation of the new standard with an objective of faithfully 
representing the substance of the Group’s transactions with its 
customers. We found that in compiling the estimated impact of 
applying IFRS 15, the Group had applied those policies consistently  
to similar transactions. We found the resulting disclosure to be ample.
Recoverability of the parent Company’s investment in subsidiaries
(£12 bn; 2016: £12bn)
Refer to page 173 (parent Company financial statements).
The risk (Low risk, high value) – The carrying amount of the parent 
Company’s investments in subsidiaries represents 100% (2016: 
100%) of its total assets. Their recoverability is not at a high risk  
of significant misstatement or subject to significant judgement. 
However, due to their materiality in the context of the parent 
Company financial statements, this is considered to be the area  
that had the greatest effect on our audit of the parent Company’s 
financial statements.
Our response – Our procedures included:
 – Our sector experience: Having established that the parent 
Company owns the whole of the issued share capital of a 
company that directly or indirectly owns all other group 
companies, we used our understanding of the sectors in which 
the Group operates and of the Group’s business to identify  
any potential indicators of impairment of the investment in  
that company and then carried out analysis to evaluate whether 
any of these potential indicators of impairment represented an 
indicator of impairment.
Our findings – We identified some potential indicators of 
impairment, including the current trading conditions affecting the 
Commercial Marine business and the parent Company’s net assets 
exceeding the Group’s consolidated net assets. We assessed that 
individually and in aggregate these did not amount to an indicator 
of impairment.
In reaching our audit opinion on the financial statements we took 
into account the findings that we describe above and those for other, 
lower risk areas included in the output from our Dynamic Audit 
planning tool set out above. Overall the findings from across the 
whole audit are that the financial statements have been prepared  
on the basis of appropriate accounting policies, reflect balanced 
estimates and provide proportionate disclosure. However, having 
assessed these findings and evaluated uncorrected misstatements  
in the context of materiality and considered the qualitative aspects  
of the financial statements as a whole, we have not modified our 
opinion on the financial statements.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview  
of the scope of our audit 
Materiality
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at 
£40m (2016: £30m), determined with reference to a benchmark of 
group profit before tax averaged over the last three years, in order 
to take into account the volatility in profits over this period, and 
normalised to exclude the impact of gains and losses on revaluation 
of foreign currency and other derivative financial instruments, 
which could otherwise result in an inappropriate materiality level 
being determined. This benchmark was £950m (2016: £1,039m)  
and this materiality measure represents 4.2% (2016: 2.9%) of this 
benchmark and 0.8% (2016: 0.6%) of total reported profit/loss 
before tax. We carry out audit procedures to assess the accuracy  
of the gains and losses on these derivative financial instruments 
(which this year amounted to a £2.6bn gain (2016: £4.4bn loss))  
as part of our audit of the Group’s treasury operations.
Materiality for the parent Company financial statements as a whole 
was set at £36m (2016: £27m), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of net assets, of which it represents 0.3% (2016: 0.2%), 
as the parent Company is treated as a component for the purposes 
of the audit of the Group financial statements. 
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee (i) all material 
corrected identified misstatements; (ii) uncorrected identified 
misstatements exceeding £2m (2016: £1.5m) for income statement 
items; and (iii) other identified misstatements that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
The scope of our audit
Of the Group’s 367 reporting components, we subjected 25  
(2016: 34) to full scope audits for group purposes and 7 (2016: 13)  
to specified risk-focused audit procedures. The latter were not 
individually financially significant enough to require a full scope 
audit for group purposes, but did present specific individual risks 
that needed to be addressed. This work also provided further  
audit coverage. 
The components within the scope of our work accounted for  
the percentages illustrated opposite. 
The remaining 5% of total group revenue, 4% of group profit  
before tax and 5% of total group assets is represented by 335 
reporting components, none of which individually represented 
more than 0.8% of any of total group revenue, group profit before 
tax or total group assets. For these residual components, we 
performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine  
our assessment that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement within these. 192

■  Group-level procedures only
The Group operates shared service centres for the bulk processing 
of financial transactions in Derby (UK), Indianapolis (US) and 
Singapore, the outputs of which are included in the financial 
information of the reporting components they service and therefore 
they are not separate reporting components. Each of the service 
centres is subject to specified risk-focused audit procedures, 
predominantly the testing of transaction processing and review 
controls. Additional audit procedures are performed at certain 
reporting components to address the audit risks not covered by  
the work performed over the shared service centres.
The work on 21 of the 32 components (2016: 19 of the 47 components) 
was performed by component audit teams and the rest, including  
the audit of the parent Company, was performed by the Group audit 
team. The Group audit team instructed component auditors and the 
audit teams of the shared service centres as to the significant areas 
to be covered (including the relevant risks detailed above), the audit 
approach to be taken on significant risks and the information to  
be reported to the Group audit team. The Group audit team set  
the materiality to be used for each component audit, which ranged 
from £1.4m to £30m (2016: £0.2m to £30m), having regard to the mix 
of size and risk profile of the components. 
The Group audit team maintained close contact with the audit teams 
on the more significant components through weekly telephone 
conference meetings and other ad hoc communications and the 
Group team visited 20 (2016: 33) locations in UK, the US, Germany 
and Scandinavia meeting with the component audit teams and 
component management. The purpose of these communications  
was to update the Group team’s understanding of the components’ 
business and related risks of material misstatement and to monitor 
progress of the audit. 
For the more significant components (18 components contributing 
88% of revenue and 70% profit before tax), the Group audit team 
received reporting on audit findings and participated in Sector 
Audit Committee meetings and closing meetings with component 
management. Towards the conclusion of each component audit, 
the Group audit team met the component audit teams (either face 
to face or on a telephone conference) and discussed the findings 
reported to the Group audit team in more detail and reviewed  
and evaluated the audit work of each component audit team on 
significant audit risks and other relevant areas. Any further work 
required by the Group audit team was then performed by the 
component audit team.
The Group audit team communicated the independence and other 
ethical requirements that apply to the audit to component audit 
teams. Throughout the year, the Group audit team assessed each 
non-audit service that the Group requested KPMG undertake 
worldwide and only approved the service once it was established 
that the service was permissible under auditor independence 
regulations and had been pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
4 We have nothing to report on going concern
We are required to report to you if:
 – we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation 
to the directors’ statement in Note 1 to the financial statements  
on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no 
material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the 
Group and Company’s use of that basis for a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements; or 
 – the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 63 
is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
5 We have nothing to report on the other information 
in the Annual Report
The directors are responsible for the other information presented 
in the Annual Report together with the financial statements.  
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover this other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion  
or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing  
so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, 
the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on 
that work we have not identified material misstatements in the 
other information. 
Strategic report and directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
 – we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report; 
 – in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 – in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance

Companies Act 2006. 
Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention 
to in relation to: 
 – the directors’ confirmation within the Compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2016 Statement (page 77) that they 
have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency and liquidity; 
 – the Principal Risks disclosures (pages 59 to 62) describing  
these risks and explaining how they are being managed and 
mitigated; and 
 – the directors’ explanation in the Going Concern and Viability 
Statements (page 63) of how they have assessed the prospects of 
the Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement  
as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Going 
Concern and Viability Statements (page 63). We have nothing  
to report in this respect. 
Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if: 
 – we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit 
and the directors’ statement that they consider that the Annual 
Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy (page 114); or 
 – the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the 
Audit Committee (pages 97 to 103) does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2016 Statement (pages 77 and 78) 
does not properly disclose a departure from the eleven provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing 
Rules for our review. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
6 We have nothing to report on the other matters on 
which we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you  
if, in our opinion: 
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
 – the parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or 
 – we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
7 Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 114,  
the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group 
and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or other irregularities (see 
below), or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error  
and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
Ability to detect irregularities
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably  
be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements 
from our sector experience, through discussion with the directors 
and other management personnel (as required by ISAs (UK)), and  
from inspection of the Group’s regulatory and legal correspondence.
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that directly affect  
the financial statements including those relating to financial reporting 
(and related company legislation) and taxation. We considered the 
extent of compliance with those laws and regulations as part of our 
procedures on the related financial statements items.  194
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Other Information
Independent Auditor’s Report
In addition, we considered the impact of laws and regulations in  
the specific areas of civil aviation safety, export control, defence 
contracting and anti-bribery and corruption legislation recognising 
the financial and regulated nature of the Group’s activities. With 
the exception of any known or possible non-compliance identified 
in the course of our audit, as required by ISAs (UK), our work in 
respect of these areas was limited to enquiry of the directors and 
other management personnel and inspection of regulatory and 
legal correspondence. We considered the effect of any known or 
possible non-compliance in these areas as part of our procedures 
on the related financial statements items. 
Additional considerations in respect of bribery and corruption are 
set out in the key audit matter disclosures in section 2 of this report.
We communicated these identified areas of laws and regulations 
throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of 
non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication 
from the Group audit team to component audit teams of relevant laws 
and regulations identified at group level, with a request to report on 
any indications of the potential existence of non-compliance with 
relevant laws and regulations (“irregularities”) in these areas, or other 
areas directly identified by the component team.
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of 
irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. 
8 The purpose of our audit work and to whom we 
owe our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the parent Company’s members, as  
a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and the terms of our engagement by the parent 
Company. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the parent Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and the further 
matters we are required to state to them in accordance with the 
terms agreed with the parent Company and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the parent Company and the 
parent Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Sustainability Assurance Statement
OTHER INFORMATION
Independent limited assurance statement
Introduction and objectives of work
Bureau Veritas UK Limited (Bureau Veritas) has been engaged by 
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc (Rolls-Royce) to provide limited assurance 
over selected sustainability performance indicators for inclusion  
in its 2017 Annual Report and website. This assurance statement 
applies to the related information included within the scope of 
work described below.
Scope of work
The scope of our work was limited to assurance over the following 
information included within the Rolls-Royce Holdings plc 2017 
Annual Report (the Report) for the period 1 January to  
31 December 2017 (the selected information):
 – energy consumption;
 – scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; 
 – total reportable injury (TRI) rate; and
 – the number of people reached through the science, technology, 
engineering and mathematics (STEM) education outreach 
programmes. 
Reporting criteria 
The selected information are reported according to the  
Rolls-Royce basis of reporting document, as set out at  
www.rolls-royce.com/sustainability.
Limitations and exclusions 
Excluded from the scope of our work is any verification of 
information relating to: 
 – activities outside the defined verification period; and
 – other information included in the Report.
This limited assurance engagement relies on a risk-based selected 
sample of sustainability data and the associated limitations that  
this entails. This independent statement should not be relied upon 
to detect all errors, omissions or misstatements that may exist.
Responsibilities 
This preparation and presentation of the selected information  
in the Report are the sole responsibility of the management  
of Rolls-Royce.
Bureau Veritas was not involved in the drafting of the Report  
or of the reporting criteria. Our responsibilities were to:
 – obtain limited assurance about whether the selected information 
has been prepared in accordance with the reporting criteria; 
 – form an independent conclusion based on the assurance 
procedures performed and evidence obtained; and
 – report our conclusions to the management of Rolls-Royce.
Assessment standard 
We performed our work in accordance with International Standard 
on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised, Assurance 
Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information (effective for assurance reports dated on or after 15 
December 2015), and in accordance with International Standard  
on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3410, Assurance Engagements 
on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the International 
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. 
Summary of work performed 
As part of its independent verification, Bureau Veritas undertook 
the following activities: 
 – assessed the appropriateness of the reporting criteria for the 
selected information;
 – conducted interviews with relevant personnel of Rolls-Royce;
 – carried out nine site visits, selected employing a risk-based 
approach, in the UK, US, Germany, Italy, Norway and Singapore; 
 – reviewed the data collection and consolidation processes used 
to compile the selected information, including assessing 
assumptions made, the data scope and reporting boundaries; 
 – reviewed documentary evidence produced by Rolls-Royce; 
 – agreed a selection of the selected information to the 
corresponding source documentation; and 
 – re-performed aggregation calculations of the selected information. 
Conclusion 
On the basis of our methodology and the activities described 
above, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the 
selected information has not been properly prepared, in all  
material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria.

Foreign exchange
Foreign exchange rate movements influence the reported income 
statement, the cash flow and closing net funds balance. The average 
and spot rates for the principal trading currencies of the Group are 
shown in the table below:
2017 2016 Change
USD per GBP Year end spot rate 1.35 1.23 +10%

The Group’s global corporate income  
tax contribution
Around 95% of the Group’s underlying profit before tax (excluding 
joint ventures and associates) is generated in the UK, the US, 
Germany, Norway, Finland and Singapore. The remaining profits  
are generated across more than 40 other countries. This reflects 
the fact that the majority of the Group’s business is undertaken,  
and employees are based, in the above countries. 
In common with most multinational groups, the total of all profits  
in respect of which corporate income tax is paid is not the same  
as the consolidated profit before tax reported on page 116.  
The main reasons for this are:
(i)  the Consolidated Income Statement is prepared under Adopted 
IFRS whereas tax is paid on the profits of each Group company, 
which are determined by local accounting rules; 
(ii)  accounting rules require certain income and costs relating to 
our commercial activities to be eliminated from, or added to,  
the aggregate of all the profits of the Group companies when 
preparing the Consolidated Income Statement (‘consolidation 
adjustments’); and
(iii)  specific tax rules including exemptions or incentives as 
determined by the tax laws in each country. 
The Group’s total corporation tax payments in 2017 were £180m. 
The level of tax paid in each country is impacted by the above.  
In most cases, (i) and (ii) are only a matter of timing and therefore 
tax will be paid in an earlier or later year. As a result, they only  
have a negligible impact on the Group’s underlying tax rate,  
which excluding joint ventures and associates would be 34.9% 
(2016: 37.5%). The underlying tax rate including joint ventures and 
associates can be found on pages 19 and 50. This is due to deferred 
tax accounting, details of which can be found in note 5 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of (iii) will often  
be permanent depending on the relevant tax law.
Further information on the tax position of the Group can be found 
as follows:
 – Audit Committee report (page 99) – The group tax director gave 
a presentation to the Audit Committee during the year which 
covered various matters including tax risks and how they are 
managed; 
 – Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (pages 125 and 
127) – Details of key areas of uncertainty and accounting policies 
for tax; and
 – Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (pages 138 to 
140) – Details of the tax balances in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements together with a tax reconciliation. This explains the 
main drivers of the tax rate.
At this stage we expect these items to continue to influence the 
underlying tax rate. The reported tax rate is more difficult to forecast 
due to the impact of significant adjustments to reported profits,  
in particular the net unrealised fair value changes to derivative 
contracts and the recognition of advance corporation tax.
Information on the Group’s approach to managing its tax affairs  
can be found at www.rolls-royce.com/sustainability. 
Investments and capital expenditure
The Group subjects all major investments and capital expenditure 
to a rigorous examination of risks and future cash flows to ensure 
that they create shareholder value. All major investments, including 
the launch of major programmes, require Board approval.
The Group has a portfolio of projects at different stages of their 
lifecycles. Discounted cash flow analysis of the remaining life 
of projects is performed on a regular basis.
Sales of engines in production are assessed against criteria in 
the original development programme to ensure that overall value 
is enhanced.
Financial risk management
The Board has established a structured approach to financial risk 
management. The Financial risk committee (Frc) is accountable for 
managing, reporting and mitigating the Group’s financial risks and 
exposures. These risks include the Group’s principal counterparty, 
currency, interest rate, commodity price, liquidity and credit rating 
risks outlined in more depth in note 17. The Frc is chaired by the 
Chief Financial Officer. The Group has a comprehensive financial 
risk policy that advocates the use of financial instruments to 
manage and hedge business operations risks that arise from 
movements in financial, commodities, credit or money markets. 
The Group’s policy is not to engage in speculative financial 
transactions. The Frc sits quarterly to review and assess the  
key risks and agree any mitigating actions required. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

Total equity 5,849 1,864
Cash flow hedges 112 107
Group capital 5,961 1,971
Net funds (305) (225)
Operations are funded through various shareholders’ funds, bank 
borrowings, bonds and notes. The capital structure of the Group 
reflects the judgement of the Board as to the appropriate balance  
of funding required. Funding is secured by the Group’s continued 
access to the global debt markets. Borrowings are funded in various 
currencies using derivatives where appropriate to achieve a required 
currency and interest rate profile. The Board’s objective is to retain 
sufficient financial investments and undrawn facilities to ensure that 
the Group can both meet its medium-term operational commitments 
and cope with unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and short-term investments which, together 
with the undrawn committed facilities, enable it to manage its 
liquidity risk.
During the year, the Group extended the maturity of the £1,500m 
committed bank borrowing facility from 2021 to 2022 and extended 
the maturity of the £500m committed bank borrowing facility from 
2019 to 2020. Both of these facilities were undrawn at the period 
end. Also during 2017, the Group drew a committed loan of £280m, 
maturing in 2024. At the year end, the Group retained aggregate 
liquidity of £5.1bn, including cash and cash equivalents of £3.0bn 
and undrawn borrowing facilities of £2.1bn. Circa £80m of 
borrowings mature in 2018 and £745m in 2019.
The maturity profile of the borrowing facilities is regularly reviewed 
to ensure that refinancing levels are manageable in the context  
of the business and market conditions. There are no rating triggers  
in any borrowing facility that would require the facility to be 
accelerated or repaid due to an adverse movement in the Group’s 
credit rating. The Group conducts some of its business through  
a number of joint ventures. A major proportion of the debt of these 
joint ventures is secured on the assets of the respective companies 
and is non-recourse to the Group. This debt is further outlined  
in note 11.
Credit rating
Rating Outlook Grade
Moody’s Investors Service A3 Negative Investment
Standard & Poor’s BBB+ Stable Investment
The Group subscribes to both Moody’s Investors Service and 
Standard & Poor’s for independent long-term credit ratings. At the 
date of this report, the Group maintained investment grade ratings 
from both agencies.
As a capital-intensive business making long-term commitments 
to its customers, the Group attaches significant importance 
to maintaining or improving the current investment grade 
credit ratings.
Accounting
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), 
as adopted by the EU.
No new accounting standards had a material impact in 2017. 
The impacts of changes to IFRS, in particular IFRS 15 Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which 
are effective from 1 January 2018 are included within the 
accounting policies in note 1.
Share price
During the year, the share price increased by 27% from 668p to 847p, 
compared to a 5% increase in the FTSE aerospace and defence 
sector and a 8% increase in the FTSE 100. The Company’s share price 
ranged from 640p in January 2017 to 981p in November 2016. 198

Share capital
On 31 December 2017 the Company’s issued share capital 
comprised of:
1,840,597,108 Ordinary shares 20p each
28,429,035,421 C Shares 1p each
1 Special Share £1
The ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Payment to shareholders
The Company issues non-cumulative redeemable preference shares 
(C Shares) as an alternative to paying a cash dividend.
Shareholders can choose to:
 – redeem all C Shares for cash;
 – redeem all C Shares for cash and reinvest the proceeds in the 
C Share Reinvestment Plan (CRIP); or
 – keep the C Shares.
The CRIP is operated by Computershare Investor Services PLC 
(the Registrar). The Registrar will purchase ordinary shares in the 
market for shareholders electing to reinvest their C Share proceeds. 
Shareholders wishing to participate in the CRIP or redeem their 
C Shares in July 2018 must ensure that their instructions are lodged 
with the Registrar no later than 5.00pm (BST) on 1 June 2018 (CREST 
holders must submit their election in CREST before 3.00pm (BST)  
on 1 June 2018). Redemption will take place on 5 July 2017.
At the 2018 AGM, the Directors will recommend an issue of 71 
C Shares with a total nominal value of 7.1p for each ordinary share. 
The C Shares will be issued on 2 July 2018 to shareholders on the 
register on 27 April 2018 and the final day of trading with entitlement 
to C Shares is 25 April 2018. Together with the interim issue 
on 3 January 2018 of 46 C Shares for each ordinary share with a total 
nominal value of 4.6p, this is the equivalent of a total annual payment 
to ordinary shareholders of 11.7p for each ordinary share.
Further information for shareholders is on pages 202 and 203.
Share class rights
The full share class rights are set out in the Company’s Articles 
of Association (Articles), which are available at www.rolls-royce.com. 
The rights are summarised below.
Ordinary shares
Each member has one vote for each ordinary share held. Holders 
of ordinary shares are entitled to: receive the Company’s Annual 
Report; attend and speak at general meetings of the Company; 
appoint one or more proxies or, if they are corporations, corporate 
representatives; and exercise voting rights. Holders of ordinary 
shares may receive a bonus issue of C Shares or a dividend and  
on liquidation may share in the assets of the Company. 
C Shares
C Shares have limited voting rights and attract a preferential 
dividend of 75% of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, 
paid on a twice-yearly basis. The Company has the option to 
redeem the C Shares compulsorily, at any time if: the aggregate 
number of C Shares in issue is less than 10% of the aggregate 
number of all C Shares issued on or prior to that time or the event 
of a capital restructuring of the Company; the introduction of a new 
holding company; the acquisition of the Company by another 
company; or a demerger from the Group.
On a return of capital on a winding-up, the holders of C Shares 
shall be entitled, in priority to any payment to the holders of 
ordinary shares, to the repayment of the nominal capital paid-up or 
credited as paid-up on the C Shares held by them, together with a 
sum equal to the outstanding preferential dividend which will have 
been accrued but not been paid until the date of return of capital.
The holders of C Shares are only entitled to attend, speak and vote 
at a general meeting if a resolution to wind up the Company is to 
be considered, in which case they may vote only on that resolution.  Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

OTHER INFORMATION
Special Share
Certain rights attach to the special rights non-voting share 
(Special Share) issued to the UK Secretary of State for Business, 
Energy & Industrial Strategy (Special Shareholder). These rights are 
set out in the Articles. Subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006 (the Act), the Treasury Solicitor may redeem the Special 
Share at par value at any time. The Special Share confers no rights 
to dividends but in the event of a winding-up it shall be repaid at 
its nominal value in priority to any other shares.
Certain Articles (in particular those relating to the foreign 
shareholding limit, disposals and the nationality of the Company’s 
Directors) that relate to the rights attached to the Special Share 
may only be altered with the consent of the Special Shareholder. 
The Special Shareholder is not entitled to vote at any general 
meeting or any other meeting of any class of shareholders.
Restrictions on transfer of shares and limitations 
on holdings
There are no restrictions on transfer or limitations on the holding 
of the ordinary shares or C Shares other than under the Articles 
(as described here), under restrictions imposed by law or regulation 
(for example, insider trading laws) or pursuant to the Company’s 
share dealing code. The Articles provide that the Company should 
be and remain under UK control. As such, an individual foreign 
shareholding limit is set at 15% of the aggregate votes attaching 
to the share capital of all classes (taken as a whole) and capable 
of being cast on a poll and to all other shares that the Directors 
determine are to be included in the calculation of that holding. 
The Special Share may only be issued to, held by and transferred 
to the Special Shareholder or his successor or nominee. 
Shareholder agreements and consent requirements
The Company and Bradley Singer are party to a relationship 
agreement with ValueAct (a summary of which can be found at 
www.rolls-royce.com). The agreement will expire on 3 May 2018  
but will be replaced with a new agreement covering treatment  
of confidential information and conflicts of interest only. 
No disposal may be made to a non-Group member which, alone  
or when aggregated with the same or a connected transaction, 
constitutes a disposal of the whole or a material part of either the 
nuclear propulsion business or the assets of the Group as a whole, 
without the consent of the Special Shareholder.
Authority to issue shares
At the AGM in 2017, authority was given to the Directors to allot 
new C Shares up to a nominal value of £500m as an alternative  
to a cash dividend.
In addition, a special resolution was passed authorising the 
Directors to allot new ordinary shares up to a nominal value  
of £122,588,225 equivalent to one-third of the issued share capital 
of the Company. This resolution also authorised the Directors  
to allot up to two thirds of the total issued share capital of the 
Company, but only in the case of a rights issue.
A further special resolution was passed to effect a disapplication  
of pre-emption rights for a maximum of 5% of the issued share 
capital of the Company.
These authorities are valid until the AGM in 2018, and the Directors 
propose to renew each of them at that AGM. The Board believes 
that these authorities will allow the Company to retain flexibility  
to respond to circumstances and opportunities as they arise.
Authority to purchase own shares
At the AGM in 2017, the Company was authorised by shareholders 
to purchase up to 183,882,337 of its own ordinary shares 
representing 10% of its issued ordinary share capital.
The authority for the Company to purchase its own shares expires 
at the conclusion of the AGM in 2018 or 15 months from 4 May 2017, 
whichever is the earlier. A resolution to renew it will be proposed  
at the 2018 meeting.
Deadlines for exercising voting rights
Electronic and paper proxy appointments, and voting instructions, 
must be received by the Registrar not less than 48 hours before a 
general meeting.
Voting rights for employee share plan shares
Shares are held in an employee benefit trust for the purpose of 
satisfying awards made under the various employee share plans. 
For shares held in a nominee capacity or if plan/trust rules provide 
the participant with the right to vote in respect of specifically 
allocated shares, the trustee votes in line with the participants’ 
instructions. For shares that are not held absolutely on behalf  
of specific individuals, the general policy of the trustees, in 
accordance with investor protection guidelines, is to abstain  
from voting in respect of those shares. 200

Disclosures in the Strategic Report
The Board has taken advantage of Section 414C(11) of the Act  
to include disclosures in the Strategic Report including:
 – employee involvement;
 – the future development, performance and position of the Group;
 – the financial position of the Group;
 – R&D activities; and
 – the principal risks and uncertainties.
Political donations
The Group’s policy is not to make political donations and therefore 
did not donate any money to any political party during the year.
However, it is possible that certain activities undertaken by the 
Group may unintentionally fall within the broad scope of the 
provisions contained in the Act. The resolution to be proposed at the 
AGM, authorising political donations and expenditure, is to ensure 
that the Group does not commit any technical breach of the Act.
During the year, expenses incurred by Rolls-Royce North America, 
Inc. in providing administrative support for the Rolls-Royce 
North America political action committee (PAC) was US$118,104 
(2016: US$42,742). PACs are a common feature of the US political 
system and are governed by the Federal Election Campaign Act.
The PAC is independent of the Group and independent of any 
political party. The PAC funds are contributed voluntarily by 
employees and the Group cannot affect how they are applied, 
although under US law, the business expenses are paid by the 
employee’s company. Such contributions do not count towards the 
limits for political donations and expenditure for which shareholder 
approval will be sought at this year’s AGM to renew the authority 
given at the 2017 AGM.
Change of control
Contracts and joint venture agreements
There are a number of contracts and joint venture agreements 
which would allow the counterparties to terminate or alter those 
arrangements in the event of a change of control of the Company. 
These arrangements are commercially confidential and their 
disclosure could be seriously prejudicial to the Company. 
Borrowings and other financial instruments
The Group has a number of borrowing facilities provided by  
various banks. These facilities generally include provisions which 
may require any outstanding borrowings to be repaid or the 
alteration or termination of the facility upon the occurrence  
of a change of control of the Company. At 31 December 2017,  
these facilities were less than 22% drawn (2016: 15%).
The Group has entered into a series of financial instruments  
to hedge its currency, interest rate and commodity exposures.  
These contracts provide for termination or alteration in the event 
that a change of control of the Company materially weakens the 
creditworthiness of the Group.
Employee share plans
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the effect  
on the employee share plans would be as follows:
 – PSP – awards would vest pro rata to service in the performance 
period, subject to Remuneration Committee judgement of  
Group performance.
 – APRA deferred shares – the shares would be released from  
trust immediately. 
 – Sharesave – options would become exercisable immediately.  
The new controlling company might offer an equivalent option  
in exchange for cancellation of the existing option.
 – Share Incentive Plan (SIP) – consideration received as shares 
would be held within the SIP, if possible, otherwise the 
consideration would be treated as a disposal from the SIP.
 – LTIP – awards would vest on the change of control, subject to  
the Remuneration Committee’s judgement of performance  
and may be reduced pro rata to service in the vesting period. 
Any applicable holding period will cease in the event of a 
change in control. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017

ITP Aero post balance sheet events
Following approval from the relevant authorities in Spain in 
December 2017, the Company has now concluded the acquisition 
of a 53.1% shareholding in ITP Aero from SENER resulting in ITP 
Aero becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  
The consideration of €718m will be settled over a two-year payment 
period, payable in eight equal instalments, and the agreement with 
SENER allows the Company flexibility to settle up to 100% of the 
consideration in the form of ordinary shares. The first instalment 
was settled by issuing 9,612,581 ordinary shares on 15 January 2018 
and the Company has notified SENER of its intention to settle the 
second instalment in the form of ordinary shares. Final consideration 
as to whether the remaining six instalments will be settled in the form 
of cash or ordinary shares will be determined by the Company 
during the remaining payment period.

Management report
The Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report together are the 
management report for the purposes of Rule 4.1.8R of the DTR.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this 
report confirms that:
 – So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware. The 
Director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken  
as a director in order to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given, and should be interpreted, in accordance 
with the provisions of section 418 of the Act.
Greenhouse gas emissions
In 2017, our total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 715 
kilotonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (ktCO
2
e). This represents 
a increase of 1% compared with 705 ktCO
2
e in 2016. This is a result 
of increased production and product testing as new engine variants 
enter service. 
We have revised our total GHG emissions for 2016 to reflect the 
actual figures for the full year, rather than estimated figures 
prepared in line with our basis of reporting. This revision is not 
material (< ±5%) but does impact the year-on-year trend.
We have included the reporting of fugitive emissions of 
hydroflurocarbons (HFCs), associated with air conditioning 
equipment, into our GHG emissions figures for 2016 and 2017. 
These include emissions from our facilities in the UK, US, Canada 
and France only. We do not anticipate that emissions from other 
facilities will have a material impact. Figures from prior years (2013 
to 2015) exclude emissions associated with HFCs.

Figures for 2013 do not include GHG emissions associated with Power Systems and 
therefore are not directly comparable.

The intensity ratio for 2013 has been restated to reflect the exclusion of revenues 
associated with Power Systems.
  
We engaged Bureau Veritas to undertake a limited assurance engagement, reporting 
to Rolls-Royce Holdings plc, using the assurance standards ISAE 3000 and ISAE 3410 
over the energy, GHG, TRI rate and STEM data that has been highlighted with  and as 
set out on pages 44 to 48 and in the table above. The sustainability assurance statement 
is included on page 195. 
With the exceptions noted above, we have reported on all of 
the emission sources required under the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. 
These sources fall within our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
We do not have responsibility for any emission sources that are 
not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition) as of 31 December 2014, data 
gathered to fulfil our requirements under the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment (CRC) Energy Efficiency scheme, and emission factors 
from the UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting 2016. 
Further details on our methodology for reporting and the criteria 
used can be found within our basis of reporting, available to

Shareholder Information
Share dealing
The Registrar offers shareholders an internet dealing service 
available from its website www.computershare.co.uk and  
a telephone dealing service (+44 (0)370 703 0084). Real-time 
dealing is available during market hours, 8.00am to 4.30pm, 
Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays. Orders can still be 
placed outside of market hours. The fee for internet dealing  
is 1% of the transaction value subject to a minimum fee of £30.  
The fee for telephone dealing is 1% of the transaction value plus 
£35. Stamp duty of 0.5% is payable on all purchases. This service  
is only available to shareholders resident in certain jurisdictions. 
Before you can trade you must register to use the service. Other 
share dealing facilities are available but you should always use  
a firm regulated by the FCA (see www.fca.org.uk/register).
Your share certificate
Your share certificate is an important document. If you sell or 
transfer your shares you must make sure that you have a valid share 
certificate in the name of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc. If you place  
an instruction to sell your shares and cannot provide a valid share 
certificate, the transaction cannot be completed and you may be 
liable for any costs incurred by the broker. If you are unable to  
find your share certificate please inform the Registrar immediately.
American Depositary Receipts (ADR)
ADR holders should contact the depositary, JP Morgan, by  
calling +1 (800) 990 1135 (toll free within the US) or emailing  
adr@jpmorgan.com.
Managing your shareholding
Your shareholding is managed by Computershare Investor Services 
PLC (the Registrar). When making contact with the Registrar please 
quote your Shareholder Reference Number (SRN), a 10-digit number 
prefixed with the letter ‘C’ that can be found on the right-hand side  
of your share certificate or in any other shareholder correspondence.  
It is very important that you keep your shareholding account  
details up to date by notifying the Registrar of any changes in  
your circumstances.
You can manage your shareholding at www.investorcentre.co.uk, 
speak to the Registrar on +44 (0)370 703 0162 (8.30am to 5.30pm 
Monday to Friday) or you can write to the Registrar at 
Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater 
Road, Bristol BS13 8AE.
Payments to shareholders
The Company makes payments to shareholders by issuing 
redeemable C Shares of 0.1p each. You can redeem C Shares for 
cash and either take the cash or reinvest the cash to purchase 
additional ordinary shares providing you complete a payment 
instruction form, which is available from the Registrar. Once you  
have submitted your payment instruction form, you will receive cash 
or additional ordinary shares each time the Company issues 
C Shares. If you choose to receive cash we strongly recommend that 
you include your bank details on the payment instruction form and  
have payments credited directly to your bank account. This removes 
the risk of a cheque going astray and means that cleared payments 
will be credited to your bank account on the payment date.

Warning to shareholders – investment scams
We are aware that some of our shareholders have received 
unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence, offering to buy  
or sell their shares at very favourable terms. The callers can be very 
persuasive and extremely persistent and often have professional 
websites and telephone numbers to support their activities.  
These callers will sometimes imply a connection to Rolls-Royce  
and provide incorrect or misleading information. This type of call 
should be treated as an investment scam – the safest thing to do  
is hang up.
You should always check that any firm contacting you about 
potential investment opportunities is properly authorised by  
the FCA. If you deal with an unauthorised firm you will not  
be eligible for compensation under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme. You can find out more about protecting 
yourself from investment scams by visiting the FCA’s website  
www.fca.org.uk/consumers, or by calling the FCA’s consumer 
helpline on 0800 111 6768 (overseas callers dial +44 20 7066 1000). 
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters contact Action  
Fraud immediately on 0300 123 2040, whose website is at  
www.actionfraud.police.uk.
Remember: if it sounds too good to be true it probably is.
