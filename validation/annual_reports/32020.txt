I am delighted to be able to report another year of 
considerable progress for Swallowfield and one in which we 
have seen real benefits from consistent focus on the elements 
of our ‘Building a Better Swallowfield’ strategy which we first 
put in place in 2014. Sales, profitability, earnings per share  
and shareholder value have again increased significantly, 
through a combination of both organic growth and successful 
acquisition activity.

CHAIRMAN’S
FOREWORD ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 9 –
CHAIRMAN’S FOREWORD
Our business comprises two complementary streams and it 
is pleasing that both have performed well over the course 
of the year. Our manufacturing business focusses on the 
development, formulation, and supply of personal care and 
beauty products for customers which include many of the 
world’s leading brands. Through continued investment and 
execution of our Drive Category Focus, our offering to those 
customers has become increasingly differentiated, which has 
the dual benefit of a positive impact on margin contribution 
and also improving our competitive advantage, thereby 
making the Group more resilient.
Over the last three years we have developed, both organically 
and through acquisition, a growing portfolio of brands that are 
owned and managed by the Group and which we control from 
formulation through to distribution. The acquisition of The 
Brand Architekts in June 2016 has significantly accelerated 
this owned brand segment of our business and brought critical 
mass to our portfolio. This now represents 24% of Group 
revenues in the period. 
DIVIDEND 
Further evidence of our confidence in the business can be 
seen in the Board’s intention to propose a final dividend of 
3.5 pence. Together with the interim dividend already paid of 
1.7 pence this represents a total dividend for the year of 5.2 
pence, an improvement of 68% over the prior year (2016: 3.1p). 
It remains the directors’ intention to align future dividend 
payments to the underlying earnings and cash flow of the 
business, taking in to account the gearing and the operational 
requirements of the business. 
 
BOARD SUCCESSION
After eight successful years as Group Finance Director,  
Mark Warren has decided to retire from his full-time executive 
career and therefore will be stepping down from the Board. 
Mark has played a significant role in helping the business grow 
and develop over that period and the Board and his colleagues 
in the business are grateful for his contribution and wish him 
continued success in the future.
Advanced notice of Mark’s intentions has allowed the Board to 
engage in a thorough and structured search for his successor 
and we are pleased to announce that Matthew Gazzard will be 
succeeding Mark. Matthew has extensive experience in senior 
financial leadership roles. He served as Group Finance Director 
for four years at Thatchers Cider during a period of substantial 
growth for that business where he delivered the financial 
support required to underpin both the development of the 
Thatchers brand itself and the company’s manufacturing 
facilities. Prior to that he spent nine years as both Group 
Finance Director and ultimately CEO of British Ceramic 
Tiles where he successfully navigated the business through 
challenging times and to a merger with Ceramic Prints Ltd.
Matthew will join Swallowfield on 2 October 2017 and work 
alongside Mark until the end of the calendar year to ensure a 
smooth and thorough handover. Matthew will formally replace 
Mark on the Board with effect from 1 January 2018.
OUTLOOK 
We have delivered another significant improvement in 
business performance in the year helped by the acquisition  
of The Brand Architekts and major new product launches in 
our manufacturing business.
We expect the strong momentum in our branded business 
to continue, supported by a steady stream of new products, 
innovation and continued strong support for our brands across 
our retail customers.
In our manufacturing business, the outlook is solid with a 
steady flow of new product development (NPD) and new 
contract wins that will positively impact the year ahead. 
As indicated previously, this needs to be balanced against 
the normalisation of volumes on particularly large product 
launches that bolstered H2 FY16 and H1 FY17 performance. 
In line with the industry, both business segments have been 
challenged by increasing material and packaging costs 
resulting from the fall in sterling and global inflationary 
pressures.  Our teams have put in place a wide range of 
programmes to mitigate the impact of these increases and 
we believe that these measures and our strong overall trading 
momentum will compensate.
Having successfully integrated The Brand Architekts, we 
continue to be alert to further acquisition opportunities should 
they offer the potential to build incremental shareholder value.
Over the course of the year we have strengthened both 
sides of our business with an improved ability to deliver the 
innovation, quality and service demanded by our customers. 
This combined with the progress made on our owned brands, 
gives us confidence that we are well positioned for the future.

“It has been a year of excellent progress for the Group with the successful execution  
of our stated strategy”
CHRIS HOW, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER STRATEGIC REPORT
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 12 –
It has been a year of tremendous progress for the Group. Our 
teams have worked extremely hard to maintain the positive 
momentum in our manufacturing business and to successfully 
integrate and accelerate the growth of the acquired The Brand 
Architekts business. Within The Brand Architekts’ portfolio it is 
pleasing to report that all major brands and major customers 
are showing year on year growth and that the pace and quality 
of new product launches have continued seamlessly. This is 
a great credit to the team at Teddington who have proved 
themselves to be as talented, professional and committed as 
we had hoped at the time of acquisition.
In the manufacturing business, our ability to support our 
customer base with the innovation, quality and service 
they require has enabled us to continue to grow sales and 
contribution margins against strong prior year comparators 
and the headwinds of significant raw material and packaging 
inflation. Our reputation and relationship has been enhanced 
across several key customers, both longstanding and new,  
as we have successfully supported a number of critical 
product launches for them which contributes to current 
business performance and augurs well for future projects.

Within each value stream we have three strategic pillars which 
we believe are the critical focus areas to ensure we continue  
to grow these businesses in the medium and long term. 
Our manufacturing business focusses on the development, 
formulation, and supply of personal care and beauty products 
for customers which include many of the world’s leading 
brands. Through continued investment and execution of our

STRATEGIC REPORT
– 15 –
Over the last three years we have developed, both organically 
and through acquisition, a growing portfolio of brands that are 
owned and managed by the Group and which we control from 
formulation through to distribution. The acquisition of The 
Brand Architekts in June 2016 has significantly accelerated this 
owned brand pillar and brought critical mass to our portfolio, 
now representing 24% of Group revenues in the period. 
The convergence of a number of macro trends has created 
a significant and demonstrable opportunity for smaller more 
agile companies to create and profitably grow well-crafted 
and well positioned brands in the Personal Care and Beauty 
sector. National retailers are keen to support brands that can 
differentiate their offering and thereby drive shopper loyalty. 
Digital channels and social media allow brands to deliver 
well targeted, fast and flexible consumer communication 
campaigns at a fraction of the cost of traditional media. 
Smaller companies are able to identify trends and develop  
new products without the time consuming and complex 
decision-making processes that can often be a feature of 
larger global companies.
Bringing together the product development, production 
and supply chain expertise of Swallowfield with the proven, 
creative and dynamic brand management team of The Brand 
Architekts creates a strong and broad capability within the 
group to profitably realise market opportunities through 
development of our owned brand portfolio.

“Fast paced new product development that quickly identifies and responds to market 
trends is a core element of our success”
JANE FLETCHER, GROUP SALES AND MARKETING DIRECTOR STRATEGIC REPORT
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 20 –
Our business strategy is developed on two complimentary 
platforms:
• the first ‘Creating for Tomorrow’ identifies within each of 
the manufacturing and owned brands value streams the 
three strategic pillars which we believe are the critical focus 
areas to ensure we continue to grow these businesses in the 
medium and long term.  
• the second ‘Delivering for Today’ identifies some key 
operational focus areas that we need to drive in order to 
deliver our more immediate (i.e. current fiscal) performance.
EXECUTING OUR
STRATEGY
The three strategic pillars that we are focussing on within our 
owned brands value stream are:
NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (NPD)
Fast paced NPD that quickly identifies and responds to  
market trends is a core element of The Brand Architekts 
business model. We are pleased that this responsiveness 
continues as part of the Swallowfield Group and that retailer 
appetite remains high. 78 new lines were launched in the 
course of the financial year across 11 different brands. Of 
particular note are a range of new beauty accessories 
launched under a new brand ‘Beautopia’, a new line of Epsom 
Salts under the Dr.Salts brand, and a new Retinol Serum in our 
SuperFacialist range. We are busy on further new ranges to be 
launched in Autumn 2017.
Progress has also continued on our original Swallowfield 
brands. The Real Shaving Company has grown strongly in the 
year thanks in part to the good performance of a new gift 
range but also the effect of digital marketing activity linked to 
the sponsorship of Somerset T20 cricket. The Bagsy Savannah 
Miller collection was launched in the year and has helped us 
to find new distribution opportunities for the brand. MR, our 
premium male hair loss brand has seen rate of sale increase 
even further with the introduction of new packaging for the 
shampoo, conditioner and styling paste lines and continued 
innovative and impactful digital marketing activity.
We have also seen very good growth in our range of value 
brands, such as Tru Shave, aimed at the growing UK value 
retail sector. We have successfully added new products to  
our offering and in doing so have extended the number of 
retail customers to virtually all the major national UK chains  
in this channel.
On 4 September 2017, we concluded a transaction to acquire a 
70% shareholding in Sterling Shave Club Ltd. Over the last two 
years Sterling has established a presence in the fast-growing 
on-line subscription shave club sector. 
The business is currently at a relatively small scale and 
our investment is appropriately modest. The entire 
consideration is to be invested into the business to support  
a significantly enhanced marketing plan directed at 
accelerating membership recruitment and expanding the 
range of products available beyond the current range of 
blades and shaving products, which currently include our  
own The Real Shaving Company range.
It offers us the opportunity to further develop our knowledge 
and capabilities in e-commerce which we believe will be 
critical to the further development of our owned brands 
business in the years ahead. 
As the business will very much be in an ‘invest to grow’ phase, 
we expect a broadly neutral impact on group profitability in 
the current financial year moving to a positive contribution in 
subsequent years.
OWNED BRANDS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT

LEVERAGE SWALLOWFIELD RESOURCES
At the time of acquisition of The Brand Architekts,  
we identified a number of opportunities to either drive 
revenue growth or create savings by leveraging the existing 
resources and capabilities of the parent business. We are 
pleased to have made excellent progress in this regard 
through the course of the year.
Several Swallowfield developed and produced products 
are now on shelf including Dirty Works Body Sprays and 
Happy Naturals footcare products. Many more projects are in 
progress covering not only new products but also the transfer 
of some existing products from other suppliers.
Swallowfield had, prior to the acquisition, developed a  
very competent digital marketing and e-commerce capability 
and we have been able to utilise these resources to launch 
digital marketing programmes and e-commerce functionality 
across Dirty Works, SuperFacialist, Quick Fix Facials,  
and Kind Natured.
PR and Marketing agencies were consolidated across the 
portfolio in the course of the year which has led to better 
quality output at lower cost.
On the Supply side, we are leveraging our materials and 
packaging sourcing network (including our China purchasing 
office), our knowledge of best practice production processes, 
and our expertise in product design and formulation to drive 
cost improvements across the inherited The Brand Architekts 
supply base. As part of this programme we have secured 
significant savings in freight and duty on shipments of gifts 
and accessories from China by combining our expertise and 
our buying power.
INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
Growth in international revenues has been strong, led in 
particular by export sales to North America. Across the full 
portfolio of our brands, international sales now account for 
24% of segment sales and we are investing to grow this further 
still. We have put in place dedicated resource to grow this area 
and are pleased in the course of the year to have opened new 
distribution channels for a number of our brands in France, 
Netherlands, Austria and Chile. Additionally, we are extending 
the international reach of our Christmas gifting ranges with 
orders already having been received for USA, Turkey, Ireland 
and South Africa. STRATEGIC REPORT
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 22 –
We have continued to make measurable progress across our 
three strategic pillars in this segment of our business.
INNOVATION
Our manufacturing business relies on our ability to bring 
innovative new products to our customer base which consists 
of some of the leading global brand owners and retailers in 
the Personal Care and Beauty sector. In the financial year, we 
introduced over 200 Swallowfield developed new products, 
a level of innovation activity that compares favourably to 
prior year. We were particularly active in haircare and colour 
cosmetic products with a number of our innovations being 
taken to market by leading brands. Volumes on our innovative 
plastic aerosol products continued to grow in the period 
and during the year we have progressed projects which we 
expect will lead to the technology being introduced by other 
customers in the new financial year.
DRIVE CATEGORY FOCUS
In the reporting period, we have seen particularly strong 
growth in Personal Care Aerosols, Cosmetic Pencils, and 
Premium Liquids. In each case, recently won contracts to 
support new product launches have been a major contributor, 
underlining our position as a reliable partner for major global 
brand owners. The success of our partnership with a major 
European cosmetics company has supported a project to 
increase wood pencil capacity and improve cost efficiency 
at our Bideford site to meet growing demand. Further 
improvements in capacity and capability have been completed 
at our Wellington site with particular focus on Personal Care 
aerosols and Hot Pour products which enabled us to both 
extend existing contracts and win new ones.
COST BASE OPTIMISATION
Energy saving improvements continue at the Wellington site 
and line efficiency programmes continue to contribute to 
margin improvement across all sites. The investment in pencil 
automation in Bideford decreases cost per unit and increases 
capacity. The flexibility of our site footprint has enabled us to 
accommodate the needs of a major customer who needed to 
transfer sourcing from a dollar denominated supply chain out 
of China to a euro-denominated supply chain. 
The first wave of products were produced for The Brand 
Architekts brands in this financial year. This will now be 
accelerated with significant volumes brought in-house over 
the next 18 months.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 24 –
The Group operates in an environment that is constantly 
changing and as a result the risks it is facing will change  
over time. The Group’s management processes assess risks 
and then develop strategies for dealing with these risks on  
an ongoing basis. A formal review of these risks is carried  
out by the Group twice a year. The review process involves  
the classification of risks, assessment to determine the  
relative likelihood of them impacting the business and the 
potential severity of the impact, and determination of whether 
changes to management processes are needed to manage 
them effectively.
 
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND  
CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS 
The market remains competitive, and the Group therefore  
has exposure to loss of contracts and/or slow-down in  
demand for products. 
The focus on the six strategic pillars of ‘creating for tomorrow’ 
outlined earlier in this report are a key part of the risk 
management process associated with this specific risk. Within 
the manufacturing business, the drive category focus, product 
innovation, and cost base optimisation pillars, all help to 
strengthen customer relations and position the Group as a 
strong partner, supporting customers’ key needs of innovation, 
quality, cost efficiency and service. The development of 
our owned brands adds a further level of diversification to 
managing this risk, and now represents 24% of Group sales.
PRODUCT QUALITY 
Product quality is a key strength of the Group and failure to 
maintain a high standard of quality and safety would have a 
severe impact on service levels, customer relationships, and 
have financial repercussions. 
We have formalised development protocols to ensure the 
products we design are safe, fit for purpose and comply with 
all legal requirements, working with our suppliers to prepare 
detailed product, component and material specifications and 
ensure correct materials are chosen and specified, and that the 
products are clearly labelled for any markets in which they  
are sold.
The Group’s quality assurance procedures are reviewed 
continuously with improvements made as appropriate.  
The Group is subject to frequent internal and external safety, 
environmental, and quality audits covering both accreditations 
held and our customers required operating standards.
RISKS AND
UNCERTAINTIES ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
– 25 –
LABOUR COSTS, PRICES AND SUPPLY 
The Group, along with other businesses, will face the risk of 
inflationary pressures through commodities cost increases, 
further driven by currency weakness post Brexit, the National 
Living Wage, and other ongoing legislative changes. 
The Group in the normal course of its business, transacts in 
and holds various currencies, and follows a policy of managing 
currency exposure through natural hedging wherever possible.
The Group maintains a high level of expertise in its purchasing 
and supply chain team. The team seeks to cultivate strong 
relationships with major suppliers to ensure continuity of 
supply at competitive prices. 
The regular renovation and innovation across our products can 
help to manage margin pressures in an effective manner, as far 
as the competitive environment allows. 
Ongoing capital investment and improvements in operational 
efficiency help reduce the impacts of inflation. 
ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT 
The market place remains challenging and there is an 
uncertain macro-economic outlook following the vote to 
leave the EU. Our focus on executing our clear strategy, 
outlined earlier in this report, has improved our ability to 
deliver the innovation, quality and service requirements of 
our manufacturing business customers, which, alongside 
the progress made on our owned brands, both developed 
internally and through acquisition, leaves us well placed to 
navigate any potential macro uncertainty.
CYBER SECURITY
The Group, along with other businesses, is exposed to the risk 
of increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks aimed at causing 
business disruption, capture of data for financial gain, general 
embarrassment and reputational damage, or that the Groups’ 
data privacy protective measures are considered by regulators 
to be inadequate.
 
PENSION FUND DEFICIT 
The revaluation of the one defined benefit pension scheme 
on a technical provision basis at each reporting date can 
cause large fluctuations in valuations based on factors outside 
the Groups control. There is an agreed deficit recovery plan 
fixed until July 2025 or until a new schedule is agreed based 
on the next triennial valuation which will be at 5 April 2017. 
This deficit recovery plan provides certainty over cash flows 
between triennial reviews.  The Group maintains a close 
relationship and regular communication with the Trustees.  STRATEGIC REPORT

RESULTS
2017
A reconciliation of underlying operating profit to 
statutory profit before taxation is shown below:
The Group uses a number of non-GAAP measures 
which are shown in the tables above and in the 
segmental analysis. These measures are used to 
illustrate the impact of non-recurring and non-trading 
items on the Group’s financial results.
In addition to the financial key performance measures, 
a range of non-financial key performance indicators are 
monitored at an operational level covering, amongst 
others, new product development, customer service, 
quality and health and safety.  The Board receives an 
overview of these on a regular basis. 
Revenue growth has been bolstered by the continuing 
strong performance of owned brands, in particular,  
The Brand Architekts’ portfolio acquired in June 2016. 
In the Group’s manufacturing business, revenues 
continued to perform solidly on the back of a stream  
of innovative new product launches.  
Revenue growth was 36% at £74.3m (2016: £54.5m), 
and 8% excluding the acquisition of The Brand 
Architekts which completed on 27 June 2016.  
The weakness of Sterling has increased sales  
revenue by £3.4m, with £1.8m of this coming from  
US dollar denominated sales and £1.6m from the Euro,  
so revenue growth on a constant currency basis would 
have been 31%, and 2% excluding the acquisition.   
The favourable currency impact on revenue has been 
offset by an equivalent adverse currency impact on cost 
of goods, reflecting the Group’s broadly natural hedge 
profile. Notwithstanding this impact, contribution 
margin % has improved, mainly due to the increase of 
owned brands in our product mix.  
The overall re-shaping of the business towards stronger 
growth and margins has enabled us to deliver a close 
to three-fold increase in underlying operating profit 
to £5.6m (2016: 2.0m), at a time when we have also 
increased investment in organisational capability and 
brand support.
Underlying operating profit is shown before charges for 
share-based payments, with a provision made of £1.76m 
(2016: £0.22m), reflecting the share price appreciation 
in the year and the impact on the accounting valuation 
of the phantom shares awarded at the closing share- STRATEGIC REPORT
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 30 –
price of 395p (2016: 180p).  The majority of the charge 
on share-based incentives relates to awards made in 2014 
and become exercisable towards the end of 2017. These 
share options were put in place in order to incentivise the 
Group’s wider management team (including the executive 
directors of Swallowfield) and to ensure that their interests 
are aligned with shareholders. At the time, this incentive plan 
was introduced the average share price was 95p and since 
that time shareholders have been rewarded with a capital 
improvement of over 250% in addition to progressive  
dividend income.
The net effect is that the Group made an adjusted operating 
profit of £3.9m (2016: £1.8m). Adjusted profit before tax 
increased to £3.6m (2016: £1.6m). 
The exceptional item of £0.34m in the current period relates 
to “one off” costs incurred in the acquisition of The Brand 
Architekts Ltd. In 2016 there was an exceptional credit of 
£0.65m relating to the closure to future accrual of the defined 
benefit pension scheme.
The overall effective rate of Group taxation for the period was 
17.4% (2016: 12.0%) of pre-tax profits. The prior year benefitted 
from brought-forward UK tax losses which were fully utilised 
in the last financial year. The current year tax charge reflects 
standard UK and the Czech Republic rates of taxation.
This results in adjusted earnings per share of 17.7p (2016: 
12.7p).
The Group’s strategic investment of a 19% shareholding in 
Shanghai Colour Cosmetics Technology Company Limited 
(SCCTC) was further re-valued upwards by £0.68m during  
the period, to fair value based on SCCTC’s June 2017 net 
assets.  The initial cost of this investment was £0.14m and 
this is now valued at £1.24m. This improved valuation reflects 
a very strong trading performance, supplying customers in 
Europe and the USA. In addition, a dividend of £0.1m was 
received in the year (2016: £0.06m). 
NET DEBT AND CASH FLOW
Net debt decreased to £3.6m (2016: £4.3m). This includes 
an additional £2m five-year term loan facility taken out to 
support the acquisition of The Brand Architekts Ltd. The 
Group maintains a broadly natural hedge position on the Euro 
and US Dollar, and manages timing differences through a 
multi-currency invoice finance facility. At the reporting date, 
the Group was maintaining a hedged position by holding 
Euro and US Dollar cash balances, whilst drawing on its GBP 
facility, resulting in an increased cash position in the statement 
of financial position of £4.1m (2016: £0.8m) whilst retaining 
an overall net debt position of £3.6m (2016: £4.3m), note 24 
provides an analysis of net debt.  
The movement in the components of working capital 
reflect the impact of the four major product launches in 
our manufacturing business across the prior June year-end, 
plus the inclusion of The Brand Architekts working capital 
components in the closing position. 
The increase in tax paid reflects the payment of The Brand 
Architekts prior-year corporation tax, and the re-introduction 
of quarterly instalments across the enlarged Group.      
Financing costs of £0.31m (2016: £0.22m) comprised interest 
expense of £0.16m (2016: £0.13m) plus a pension scheme 
notional finance charge of £0.15m (2016: charge £0.08m).  
Capital expenditure was £1.4m which was broadly in line 
with depreciation. We have made a number of investments 
to improve line efficiencies and support incremental new 
customer contracts and have an active capital investment 
programme planned for the new year. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION SCHEME
The defined benefit pension scheme underwent its last 
triennial valuation as of 5 April 2014. The deficit on a statutory 
funding basis was £1.3m and the Group entered into a revised 
deficit recovery plan and schedule of contributions in July 
2015. The deficit reduction payment will be £108k per annum 
(previously £111.5k per annum) for ten years. The scheme was 
subsequently closed to future accrual with effect from 31 
December 2015. The latest triennial valuation at April 2017 is in 
process, and it is expected will be finalised during year-ending 
June 2018. 
For accounting purposes at 24 June 2017, the Group 
recognised under IAS19 ‘employee benefits’, a deficit of 
£6.1m (25 June 2016: £4.5m). The Accounting Standards 
require the discount rate to be based on yields on high 
quality (usually AA-rated) corporate bonds of appropriate 
currency, taking into account the term of the relevant pension 
scheme’s liabilities. Corporate bond indices are used as a 
proxy to determine the discount rate. At the reporting date, 
the yields on bonds of all types were lower than they were at 
25 June 2016. This has resulted in lower discount rates being 
adopted for accounting purposes compared to last year, 
which has been coupled with an increase in expectations of 
long term inflation, with the combination materially increasing 
the fair value of the scheme liabilities, with the strong 
investment return performance only partially mitigating. 
This has translated into an increased liability under the IAS19 
methodology.
DIVIDENDS
The Board is pleased to announce that it will be proposing a 
final dividend of 3.5 pence. Together with the interim dividend 
already paid of 1.7 pence this represents a total dividend for 
the year of 5.2 pence, an improvement of 68% over the prior 
year (2016: 3.1p). If approved, the final dividend will be paid 
on 8 December 2017 to shareholders on the register on 17 
November 2017. The shares will be marked as ex-dividend on 
16 November 2017.
GOING CONCERN
As part of its normal business practice, the Group prepares 
annual and longer-term plans and, in reviewing this 
information the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.  
Accordingly, we continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the annual report and accounts.  STRATEGIC REPORT

EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES 
The success of our business is dependent upon the quality, 
commitment and behaviour of our employees. Therefore, the 
Group provides clear policies and direction to our employees 
and strives for the highest standards of behaviour.
The ‘Building a Better Swallowfield’ agenda outlines the key 
elements of how we want to build a Swallowfield that is an 
interesting and rewarding place to work, that consistently 
exceeds the expectations and needs of our customers, and 
delivers sustained profitable growth for our shareholders.  
This has provided a framework that clarifies our values, our 
short, mid and long-term priorities and the key measures in 
place to measure our progress.
The foundation of this agenda is our values. These are the 
behaviours that we believe are critical to be successful in 
everything we do, and are as follows: 
‘Making it happen’ - means being action oriented and being 
accountable for what we have agreed and committed to do 
with colleagues, customers and suppliers. If something needs 
doing, let’s get it done. 
‘Making it better’ - means a mindset of continuous 
improvement in everything we do and a challenge to not only 
identify things that are not working so well, but to also to do 
something about it. 
‘Making it together’ – reminds us that whatever we are trying 
to make happen or to make better, we are highly unlikely to be 
able to do it on our own. We will always need the involvement 
and support of colleagues, customers and suppliers to ensure 
solutions work best for all concerned. 
Also, within the ‘Building a Better Swallowfield’ agenda we 
have set out both a clear set of near term and longer-term 
business priorities and focus areas. The nearer term initiatives 
are set out under the heading of ‘Delivering for Today’ and 
the longer-term initiatives are set out under the heading of 
‘Creating for Tomorrow’. The ‘Delivering for Today’ initiatives 
have been varied on an annual basis.
All of these elements come together under our ‘Building 
a Better Swallowfield’ pyramid, which is used across the 
business as a visual mnemonic to capture how we want to 
develop the business.

EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATION 
The policy of informing and consulting with employees is 
given prominence and has continued by means of regular 
briefing groups and consultative committees.  Employees 
are encouraged to present their views and suggestions 
in respect of the Group’s performance.  During the year a 
number of employee workshops and briefings have taken 
place to engage employees in the delivery of ‘Building a 
Better Swallowfield’. This has been supported through the 
all employee reward and recognition scheme and an on-line 
facility to capture employee suggestions and questions. 
 
EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY 
The Group continues to carefully consider applications for 
employment by an individual from any background, including 
disabled persons. The Group’s training, development and 
promotion policies aim to ensure all employment decisions are 
based on fairness and merit. 
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
The Group recognises the importance of social responsibility 
in its business and remains strongly committed to reducing the 
environmental impact of its production and design processes, 
and advancing its systems and policies to comply with 
and, wherever possible, anticipate changing legislative and 
customer demands. This important area is covered as part of 
regular team briefs to all members of staff, and the Group uses 
a variety of key performance indicators as part of its regular 
reporting cycle.
The Group is subject to regular external audits associated 
with both accreditations held and customer requirements, and 
during the year hosted over 35 separate audits. These include 
ISO 9001; ISO 14001; ISO 22716 Cosmetics GMP; ISO 13485 
Medical Devices; FDA; CLAS; BRC; FSC; plus, a number of 
Ethical, Environmental, Health & Safety Executive (COMAH), 
and Customer audits. 
ETHICAL TRADING  
The Group is a member of SEDEX (Supplier Ethical Data 
Exchange) and regularly participate in SMETA audits at its 
production sites to ensure compliance with all applicable 
Ethical and responsible business practices in global supply 
chains covering Labour Standards, Business Ethics, Health & 
Safety and the Environment.
The Group discloses on and is assessed on the EcoVadis CSR 
platform giving assurance of meeting the highest standards of 
sustainable procurement, business practices environment and 
labour practices. EcoVadis gathers information from around 
24,000 subscribers, based in 95 different countries and 145 
different industry sectors. Over 100 multinational companies 
use EcoVadis to monitor the CSR performance of their 
suppliers. The Group was awarded a Gold award following 
initial assessment in 2015 and this Gold rating was maintained 
in 2016, placing the Group in the top 13% of all suppliers 
assessed across all categories.
Within its supply chain, the Group is also certified to FSC 
(ensuring the ethical supply chain of wood) and members  
of RSPO (for ethical & sustainable purchase of palm oil),  
with each organisation giving assurance that correct business 
practices are being applied.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
The philosophy of Continuous Improvement remains core 
to the Group’s approach to Health and Safety Management.  
There are regular Health and Safety reviews led by senior 
management involving the Health and Safety Manager and 
workforce representatives.  All areas of the business are 
audited twice each year to assess any Health and Safety 
strengths and remedy any identified weaknesses.  Action plans 
for all issues are developed and monitored by the Health and 
Safety Manager and local management, and are reviewed 
by senior management.  Risk Assessments are prepared for 
all foreseen issues and are regularly reviewed.  The Group’s 
Health and Safety System is designed to run parallel to  
BS 18001.
The Group has invested in the IOSH ‘Working safely’ training 
package which is being rolled out across all UK employees 
over a two-year period, with over 120 employees receiving the 
training to date. The ‘Working safely’ package is a completely 
different approach to safety and health training. It’s a high-
impact programme designed to be enjoyable and stimulating, 
and is aimed at getting people involved at all levels across the 
organisation. ‘Working safely’ covers:
– defining hazard and risk
– identifying common hazards
– improving safety performance
– protecting our environment
Successful delegates are awarded an IOSH Working safely 
certificate, a nationally recognised and respected certificate.
Successful delegates are now utilising their training to run 
proactive hazard spotting workshops in their own areas of 
work, with employees coming together to spot potential 
hazards before they could develop into incidents. These 
potential hazards are then analysed and if necessary corrective 
actions are raised.
All Accidents, Incidents and Near Misses are fully investigated 
to identify root cause and preventive actions are developed 
and put in place and we continue to increase our focus on 
near-miss reporting.  All the above are afforded a score rating 
which is assessed each year and monitored through the 
Group’s ‘Building a Better Swallowfield’ Score Card.

ENVIRONMENT
The Group remains strongly committed to continuously reduce 
the environmental impact of its operations and products.
The Group’s Environmental Management System was certified 
by BSI to ISO14001 in December 2005.  Since that date,  
all six-monthly surveillance audits have been passed with no 
major non-conformances. No major non-conformances were 
reported in the last financial year & the Group transitioned to 
the new ISO14001:2015 standard in June 2017.
The Group has made significant steps forward in reducing its 
consumption of energy and its impact on the environment 
since 2005/6 and uses site based metrics to monitor energy 
consumption, water usage and CO2 emissions.
The Group has registered under the UK CRC Energy Efficiency 
Scheme, and a result of energy saving initiatives such as 
replacing compressors & installing more LED lighting has seen 
Group electricity consumption reduce by over 17.9% since 2012 
and at 4,102 MWh currently falls well below the full compliance 
thresholds outlined under CRC of 6,000 MWh. The Group also 
publicly declares its carbon emissions via the CDP scheme, 
achieving awareness status & has changed over to the use of 
Zero Carbon Renewable Electricity in the UK from December 
2016. The Group was also given a 64% sustainability rating 
score from Carbon Clear, compared to an industry average  
of 49%.
The Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) is 
a mandatory energy assessment and energy saving 
identification scheme for large undertakings (and their 
corporate groups). The Group achieved the mandatory 
requirement under the ESOS scheme to comply by December 
2015.  The report continues to assist the Group in identifying 
any further savings opportunities.
Levels of dry waste recycling or reuse for aluminium,  
metal, cardboard, wood, paper, plastic etc. were maximised 
and we continue to focus on improving the percentage of 
waste recycled.  
Challenging objectives have been established for the 
forthcoming year with the aim of continuing to reduce the 
overall environmental impact of our business, including that  
of our operations and products.
The Group continues to seek to be ‘environmentally 
responsible’ in all its activities and to minimise the impact  
of our activities on the environment.

 delegation of authority and other control procedures,  
 together with appropriate accounting policies, are   
 communicated throughout the Group;
• The Group appoints experienced and professional  
 staff of the necessary calibre, both through promotion and  
 recruitment, to fulfil their responsibilities;
• The Group maintains an annual budget process.  
 The Board sets budgets once per year and monitors actual  
 performance against those budgets at every Board meeting.  
 The Board also reviews forecasts and expectations in  
 the light of up-to-date circumstances and takes action  
 as appropriate; 
• The Audit Committee considers significant control matters.  
 Management letter points raised by the external auditors  
 are discussed by the Audit Committee and are dealt with  
 as appropriate;
• The Group maintains an expenditure approval process  
 that ensures that the Board approves major expenditure and  
 investments; and

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year.  Under that law the 
Directors have elected to prepare financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.  The financial 
statements are required by law to give a true and fair view  
of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of 
the profit or loss of the Group for that period.  In preparing 
these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRS’s have been followed,  
subject to any material departures disclosed and  
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare financial statements on the going concern basis  
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company  
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, 
the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006.  They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information on the 
Group’s website.  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of the financial statements 
and other information included in annual reports may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
At the date of making this report each of the Company’s 
Directors, as set out on page 38-39, confirm the following:
• so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant 
information needed by the Company’s auditors in 
connection with preparing their report of which the  
Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
• each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to 
have taken as a director in order to make themselves  
aware of any relevant information needed by the 
Company’s auditors in connection with preparing their 
report and to establish that the Company’s auditor is  
aware of that information.

OUR OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS UNMODIFIED 
We have audited the financial statements of Swallowfield plc (the ‘company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the 52 week 
period ended 24 June 2017 which comprise the group statement of comprehensive income, the group and company statements 
of financial position, the group and company statements of changes in equity, the group and company cash flow statements 
and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the company financial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 24 June 2017 
and of the group’s profit for the period then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
 
BASIS FOR OPINION 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.  
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and the company in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied 
to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
WHO WE ARE REPORTING TO
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or 
for the opinions we have formed.
CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to  
you where:
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt about the group’s or the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of 
at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
• Overall materiality: £372,000, which represents 0.5% of total group revenues for the period ended 24 June 2017
• Key audit matters were identified as the acquisition of The Brand Architekts Limited (applicable to the Group), the accounting 
treatment applied in relation to share based payments (applicable to the Company), and disclosures in relation to the defined 
benefit pension scheme (applicable to the Company)
• We performed full scope UK statutory audit procedures on the company and significant components Swallowfield Consumer 
Products Limited, MR. Haircare Limited, and The Brand Architekts Limited 
• Full scope audit procedures were performed by the component auditor Grant Thornton Prague on the significant component 
Swallowfield s.r.o. 
• Analytical procedures at group level were performed by us for non-significant components Swallowfield s.a.r.l., Swallowfield 
Inc., and Bagsy Beauty Limited
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
KEY AUDIT MATTER - GROUP
Acquisition of The Brand Architekts Limited
On 27 June 2016 the Group acquired the entire issued share 
capital of The Brand Architekts Limited. The total consideration 
payable was £12.08m, of which £1.85m was contingent upon The 
Brand Architekts Limited performance during the first 12 months 
post acquisition. The contingent consideration was accrued at 
the period end and was paid on 24 July 2017. The acquisition 
was financed via the issue of 5,558,985 new £0.05 Ordinary 
shares to raise £8.6m and a new £2.00m loan facility. 
Following the acquisition of The Brand Architekts Limited 
a purchase price allocation exercise was performed by 
management to determine how the assets associated with 
the acquisition should be recognised within the consolidated 
financial statements.
Following this exercise, intangible assets with a total value of 
£8.21m were recognised. This total value is classified as brands 
(£5.09m), customer relationships (£1.65m), and goodwill 
(£1.47m).
Customer lists are being amortised over a ten-year period. 
Management considers that the brands have an indefinite useful 
economic life on the basis that they are well-established brands 
and there is no foreseeable limit on the period of time over 
which they are expected to contribute to cash flows. Therefore, 
brands are not being amortised but instead are being tested 
for impairment annually. In accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union, goodwill is not being amortised but is 
being tested for impairment annually.
The acquisition was one of the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement because it is a transaction that is outside 
of the normal course of business.
 
 
HOW THE MATTER WAS ADDRESSED IN THE AUDIT - GROUP
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• An assessment of the acquire entity’s statement of financial 
position at the date of acquisition to assess whether any 
fair value adjustments were required; 
• An assessment of the reasonableness of the accounting 
treatment applied in relation to the share issue, directly 
attributable expenditure, and the contingent consideration;
• A Grant Thornton valuation specialist was engaged to 
assess managements purchase price allocation exercise and 
challenge the model and the underlying assumptions; and
• An assessment of the amortisation policies applied by 
management, including the charge recognised in the 
period, and the assertion that no impairment charge is 
required in the period in relation to brands and goodwill. 
The group’s accounting policy on intangible assets is shown in 
note 1 to the financial statements and the related disclosures 
are included in note 13. 
KEY OBSERVATIONS
Our audit work did not identify any significant issues that 
would require us to amend the nature or scope of our planned 
detailed testing. 
Overall, based on our audit work, our assessment is that the 
accounting treatment applied is considered appropriate. GOVERNANCE
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 44 –
KEY AUDIT MATTER - COMPANY
Share based payments
During the period a charge of £1.76m (2016: £0.22m) has 
been recognised in relation to the Long Term Incentive Plans 
for executive directors (£1.48m) and the management team 
(£0.28m). 
The transaction was one of the most significant assessed risks 
of material misstatement based on the material nature of the 
charge and the level of management judgement required in its 
calculation.
HOW THE MATTER WAS ADDRESSED IN THE AUDIT - COMPANY
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• An assessment of the method used to calculate the share 
option charge;
• Observation of issue documentation for new schemes 
during the period; 
• An assessment of the reasonableness of the underlying 
assumptions for all schemes; 
• Calculation of the expected charge and comparison with 
the charge recognised in the financial statements; and 
• An assessment of whether the associated financial 
statement disclosures are in accordance with accounting 
standards.
The company’s accounting policy on share based payments 
is shown in note 1 to the financial statements and the related 
disclosures are included in note 6.
KEY OBSERV ATIONS
Our audit work did not identify any significant issues, which 
would require us to amend the nature or scope of our planned 
detailed testing. The treatment applied is deemed to be 
appropriate and in accordance with accounting standards. 
Defined Benefit Pension Scheme
The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme. 
The valuation at 24 June 2017 shows that the pension scheme 
deficit has increased to £6.1m (2016:  £4.5m). The value of the 
scheme assets is comparable at £23.3m (2016: £20.2m), with 
the increase in the deficit is primarily due to a decrease in the 
discount rate. 
Accounting Standards require the discount rate to be based 
on yields on high quality (usually AA-rated) corporate bonds 
of appropriate currency, taking into account the term of the 
relevant pension scheme’s liabilities. Corporate bond indices 
are used as a proxy to determine the discount rate. At the 
reporting date of 24 June 2017, the yields on bonds of all 
types were lower than they were at 25 June 2016. This has 
resulted in lower discount rates being adopted for accounting 
purposes compared to the prior period, offset by a reduction 
in expectations of long term inflation, this coupled with the 
volatile market conditions at the reporting date impacting fair 
value asset valuations, has translated into an increased liability 
under International Accounting Standard (IAS) 19.
The transaction was one of the most significant assessed risks 
of material misstatement as the measurement of pension 
liabilities involves significant judgement and is subject to a 
number of complex actuarial assumptions. 
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• An assessment of the qualifications and competency of the 
valuation specialist used by management to prepare the 
actuarial report as at 24 June 2017; 
• An assessment of the assumptions of the actuary included 
within the actuarial report and the associated financial 
statement disclosures; and 
• Confirmation of all scheme assets directly with the scheme. 
The company’s accounting policy on the defined benefit 
pension scheme is shown in note 1 to the financial statements 
and the related disclosures are included in note 26. 
KEY OBSERVATIONS
Whilst confirming the scheme assets it was identified that 
assets with a value of £2.4m had been omitted from the 
original valuation by the actuary in error, resulting in the 
scheme deficit being overstated by £2.4m. The required 
adjustment has been posted to the financial statements. 
The assumptions of the actuary are considered to be 
appropriate, and derived on a consistent basis with those 
used in previous valuations. The revised associated financial 
statement disclosures are also considered to be appropriate. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of that work.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the group’s business, its environment 
and risk profile and in particular included: 
• evaluation by the group audit team of identified components to assess the significance of that component and to determine 
the planned audit response based on a measure of materiality. This evaluation focused on the significance of the component 
based on its percentage of the group’s total assets, revenues and profit before taxation; 
• a full scope UK statutory audit in respect of the company. This included an interim review, evaluation of the internal controls 
environment including its IT systems and controls, and attendance at two perpetual inventory counts, one of which was at 
period end, at the Wellington and Bideford sites;  
• a full scope UK statutory audit was also performed in respect of significant components Swallowfield Consumer Products 
Limited, MR. Haircare Limited, and The Brand Architekts Limited. These included evaluation of the internal controls 
environment including IT systems and controls, and attendance at two perpetual inventory counts, one of which was  
at period end, at The Brand Architekts Limited;
• under instruction from us, full scope audit procedures were performed by Grant Thornton Prague in respect of significant 
component Swallowfield s.r.o. We performed a full review of the Grant Thornton Prague audit file. This audit included 
evaluation of the internal controls environment including IT systems and controls, and attendance at the period-end stock 
take. Regular correspondence was maintained with the component audit throughout the audit process;
• the procedures detailed above covered 100% of group revenue, 100% of group underlying profit before taxation and 100% of 
total group assets; and
• analytical procedures at group level were performed by us for non-significant components Swallowfield s.a.r.l., Swallowfield 
Inc., and Bagsy Beauty Limited. 
OTHER INFORMATION
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained  
in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a 
material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.
OUR OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 IS UNMODIFIED
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial period for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the company and its environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report. 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 41, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as 
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO
THE ACCOUNTS
NOTE 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
GENERAL INFORMATION
Swallowfield plc is a Company incorporated in the United 
Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of 
the registered office is given on page 86. The nature of the 
Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in  
the Strategic Report.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and 
also in accordance with IFRS issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board.  These financial statements have 
been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified 
to include the revaluation of certain non-current assets and 
financial instruments.
The Directors have considered trading and cash flow forecasts 
prepared for the Group, and based on these, and the 
confirmed banking facilities, are satisfied that the Group will 
continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for 
at least one year from the date of signing of these accounts.  
On this basis, they consider it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in the preparation of these accounts.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling 
and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) 
except where otherwise indicated.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.  
The results and net assets of undertakings acquired or 
disposed of during a financial year are included in the Group 
Statement of Comprehensive Income and Group Statement of 
Financial Position from the effective date of acquisition or to 
the effective date of disposal.  Subsidiary undertakings have 
been consolidated using the purchase method of accounting.  
In accordance with the exemptions given by section 408 of 
the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its 
own Statement of Comprehensive Income.  The Company’s 
profit before tax for the year to June 2017 was £1.621m (2016: 
profit before tax £2.303m).
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the 
parent company and all of its subsidiaries as of June 2017. The 
parent controls a subsidiary if it is exposed, or has rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the subsidiary. All subsidiaries have a reporting date of June.
All transactions and balances between Group companies are 
eliminated on consolidation, including unrealised gains and 
losses on transactions between Group companies. Amounts 
reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been 
adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the 
accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Profit or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries 
acquired or disposed of during the year are recognised from 
the effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date  
of disposal, as applicable.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account 
for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity 
instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration 
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the:
• fair values of the assets transferred 
• liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired 
business 
• equity interests issued by the group 
• fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, and 
• fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the 
subsidiary.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited 
exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. The group recognises any non-controlling 
interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition 
basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable 
assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The excess of the
• consideration transferred,
• amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired 
entity, and
• acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in 
the acquired entity
over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is 
recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair 
value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, 
the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss as a 
bargain purchase. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 55 –
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is 
deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to 
their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount 
rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being 
the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained 
from an independent financier under comparable terms and 
conditions.
Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a 
financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are 
subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair 
value recognised in profit or loss.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
(i) Computer software
Computer software is stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation.  Computer software is amortised on a straight-
line basis over the expected useful life of 3 years.
(ii) Research and development
Expenditure on the research phase of projects to develop new 
products is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs that are directly attributable to a project’s development 
phase are recognised as intangible assets, provided they meet 
the following recognition requirements:
• the development costs can be measured reliably
• the project is technically and commercially feasible
• the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to 
complete the project
• the Group has the ability to use or sell the development
• the development will generate probable future economic 
benefits.
Development costs not meeting these criteria for capitalisation 
are expensed as incurred.
Any capitalised development costs that are not yet complete 
are not amortised but are subject to impairment testing. 
Complete development projects are amortised on a straight-
line basis over 5 years.
(iii) Brand names and customer relationships
Brand names and customer relationships acquired are 
recognised as intangible assets at their fair values (see note 
13).
Customers relationships are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over 5 or 10 years, based on evaluation at point of acquisition.
Brand names are considered to have an indefinite life and are 
tested for impairment annually. This is on the basis that the 
brand is well established and there is no foreseeable limit on 
the period of time over which it is expected to contribute to 
cash flow.
(iv) Goodwill
An impairment test is undertaken where there are indicators of 
impairment or on an annual basis where intangible assets are 
determined to have an infinite useful life such as brands and 
goodwill. Brands and goodwill are combined together as part 
of the same CGU and tested together using a discounted cash 
flow approach. 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation.  Where there is evidence of 
impairment, property, plant and equipment is written down to 
its recoverable amount.  Any such write down is charged to 
the profit or loss for the year.  Property, plant and equipment 
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their expected 
useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 2% per annum
Plant and machinery 6.7% to 33% per annum
Freehold land is not depreciated.
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
An impairment test is performed annually where required and 
whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value of an asset may exceed its recoverable amount.  The 
carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable 
amount of the asset, generally by reference to the present 
value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from 
that asset.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value.  Costs are those incurred in bringing each product to its 
present location and condition.  In the case of raw materials, 
cost comprises purchase costs including transport costs, 
calculated on a first-in, first-out basis.  In the case of work in 
progress and finished goods, cost comprises direct material, 
direct labour plus attributable overheads.  Net realisable value 
is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected 
to be incurred to completion and disposal.
TAXATION
Current tax is the tax payable based on taxable profit for the 
year.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability 
method on temporary differences.  Deferred tax is generally 
provided on the difference between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  Deferred tax on 
temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries 
is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can 
be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal 
will not occur in the foreseeable future.  In addition, tax losses  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 56 –
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
available to be carried forward as well as other income tax 
credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred 
tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that the underlying deductible temporary differences 
will be able to be offset against future taxable income.  
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at 
tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period 
of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively 
enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised in 
profit or loss as a component of tax expense in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, except where they relate to items 
that are charged or credited directly to equity (such as the 
revaluation of land) in which case the related deferred tax is 
also charged or credited directly to equity.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Trading transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
are recorded in sterling at actual rates as at the date of the 
transaction.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the middle market 
rates ruling at the Statement of Financial Position date.  Such 
exchange differences are recognised in the profit or loss for 
the year.
The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign 
subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling 
at the Statement of Financial Position date.  Income and 
expenses are translated at the actual rate.  The exchange 
differences arising from the retranslation of foreign operations 
are charged / credited to other comprehensive income and 
recognised in the ‘Exchange reserve’ in equity.  On disposal of 
a foreign operation, the cumulative translation differences are 
reclassified from equity to profit or loss. 
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable and represents amounts receivable 
for goods provided in the normal course of business, net of 
discounts and rebates, VAT and other sales-related taxes.  
Revenue is recognised when the Group has transferred the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership to the customer, 
which is generally when the production of goods is complete, 
the customer has accepted title of the goods under 
contractual shipping arrangements and collectability of the 
related receivables is reasonably assured.
LEASED ASSETS
Operating lease rental payments are charged to profit or loss 
on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Pension obligations
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined 
contribution pension schemes.
i) Defined benefit schemes
Scheme assets are measured at fair values. Defined benefit 
pension scheme liabilities are measured by an independent 
actuary using the projected unit method and discounted at 
the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of 
equivalent term and currency to the liability.  The increase 
in the present value of the liabilities of the Group’s defined 
benefit pension schemes expected to arise from employee 
service in the year is charged to operating profit. The scheme 
was closed to future accrual on 31 December 2015.  The 
expected return on the scheme’s assets and the increase 
during the year in the present value of the scheme’s liabilities, 
arising from the passage of time, are included in other finance 
income or cost.
ii) Defined contribution schemes
Costs of defined contribution pension schemes are charged to 
the profit or loss in the year they fall due. 
iii) Share-based Payment Transactions
The value, as at the grant date, of options granted to 
employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a 
corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. 
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an 
option valuation model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the options were granted.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the 
liability needs to be re-measured at the end of each reporting 
period up to the date of settlement, with any changes in fair 
value recognised in the profit or loss.
FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group’s financial assets consist of loans and receivables; 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and 
available-for-sale financial assets.  Financial assets are 
assigned to the different categories by management on initial 
recognition, depending on the purpose for which they were 
acquired.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market.  Trade and other receivables are classified as 
loans and receivables.  Loans and receivables are measured 
subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.  
Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of 
impairment is recognised in the profit or loss.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 57 –
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
of those receivables.  The amount of the write-down is 
determined as the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value 
with gains or losses being recognised in other comprehensive 
income and reported within the available sales reserve within 
equity.  Where fair value cannot be reliably estimated such 
assets are reviewed for impairment annually. Impairment 
charges are recognised in profit or loss. 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and on 
demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible into known amounts 
of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.  The Group considers overdrafts (repayable 
on demand) to be an integral part of its cash management 
activities and these are included in cash and cash equivalents 
for the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
The Group’s financial liabilities consist of bank borrowings, 
trade and other payables.
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other 
financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.  
Financial liabilities categorised as at fair value through profit 
or loss are recorded initially at fair value, all transaction costs 
are recognised immediately in the profit or loss.  All other 
financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value, net of 
direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities categorised as at fair value through profit 
or loss are re-measured at each reporting date at fair value, 
with changes in fair value being recognised in the profit or 
loss.  All other financial liabilities are carried subsequently 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with 
interest-related charges recognised as an expense in finance 
cost in the profit or loss.  Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, 
are charged to the profit or loss on an accruals basis using 
the effective interest method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not 
settled in the period in which they arise.
Financial liabilities are categorised as at fair value through 
profit or loss where they are classified as held-for-trading 
or designated as at fair value through profit or loss on initial 
recognition.  A financial liability is derecognised only when 
the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is 
discharged or cancelled or expires.
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS
Dividends and other distributions to shareholders are reflected 
in financial statements when approved by shareholders in 
a general meeting, except for interim dividends which are 
included in financial statements when paid by the Company.  
Accordingly, proposed dividends are not included as a liability 
in the financial statements.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional items are non-recurring material items which are 
outside the normal scope of the Group’s ordinary activities 
such as liabilities and costs arising from a fundamental 
restructuring of the Group’s operations. 
SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGEMENT IN APPLYING 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following are significant management judgements in 
applying the accounting policies of the Group that have the 
most significant impact on the financial statements:
Deferred Taxation
The Group has not made full provision for deferred taxation 
on the full carrying value of the Group’s land and buildings, on 
the basis that the full value of these assets will be recovered 
through sale and not through use and that indexation will 
result in no taxable gain arising on disposal.
KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In applying the above accounting policies, the Group has 
made appropriate estimates in a number of areas and the 
actual outcome may differ from those calculated.  The key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the year-end that may 
have a risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year 
are as follows:
Fair value on acquisition 
Judgement and estimates arise in the determination and 
fair value of intangible and tangible assets and contingent 
and other liabilities arising when acquiring a business. The 
valuation of externally acquired assets such as brands and 
customer lists require judgement regarding estimated future 
cash flows arising for those established assets, discounted to 
reflect the time value of money.  Judgement is also used in 
determining the useful economic life and amortisation periods.  
Further information is included in Note 13.  
Impairment reviews
An impairment test is undertaken where there are indicators 
of impairment or on an annual basis where intangible assets 
are determined to have an infinite useful life such as brands 
and goodwill using a discounted cash flow approach. Note 13 
discloses the assumptions used.
Share based payments
The balance is significant due to its judgemental nature 
and the high level of estimation uncertainty. The Group’s 
accounting policy on share based payments is shown in note 1 
and related disclosures are included in note 6. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 58 –
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Post-retirement benefits
The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme is assessed 
annually.  The value in these accounts which has been based 
on the assumptions of an independent actuary resulted in 
a deficit of £6.1m (2016: £4.5m) before deferred taxation.  
The size of the deficit is sensitive to the market value of the 
underlying scheme investments and the actuarial assumptions 
which include price inflation, pension and salary increases, the 
discount rate used in assessing the liabilities, mortality rates, 
and other demographic factors.  Further details are included in 
Note 26.
STANDARDS IN ISSUE BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, 
certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to 
existing standards have been published by the IASB but are 
not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the 
Group.
Management anticipates that all of the relevant 
pronouncements will be adopted in the Group’s accounting 
policies for the first period beginning after the effective 
date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, 
amendments and interpretations that are expected to be 
relevant to the Group’s financial statements is provided below. 
Certain other new standards and interpretations have been 
issued but are not expected to have a material impact on the 
Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 9 ‘FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS’
The IASB have released IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, 
representing the completion of its project to replace IAS 
39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. 
The new standard introduces extensive changes to IAS 39’s 
guidance on the classification and measurement of financial 
assets and introduces a new ‘expected credit loss’ model for 
the impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 also provides new 
guidance on the application of hedge accounting.
The Group’s management have yet to assess the impact of 
IFRS 9 on these consolidated financial statements. The new 
standard is required to be applied for annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 ‘REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS’
IFRS 15 presents new requirements for the recognition of 
revenue, replacing IAS 18 ‘Revenue’, IAS 11 ‘Construction 
Contracts’, and several revenue-related Interpretations. The 
new standard establishes a control-based revenue recognition 
model and provides additional guidance in many areas 
not covered in detail under existing IFRSs, including how 
to account for arrangements with multiple performance 
obligations, variable pricing, customer refund rights, supplier 
repurchase options, and other common complexities.
IFRS 15 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018. The Group’s management have not yet 
assessed the impact of IFRS 15 on these consolidated financial 
statements.
IFRS 16 ‘LEASES’
IFRS 16 represents new requirements for the recognition of 
operating leases, replacing IAS 17 ‘Leases’. The new standard 
requires that certain operating leases are disclosed within the 
Statement of Financial Position.
The Group’s management have yet to assess the impact of 
IFRS 16 on these consolidated financial statements. The new 
standard is required to be applied for annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2019. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 59 –

NOTE 2 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
The Group is a market leader in the development, formulation, and supply of personal care and beauty products. 
The reportable segments of the Group are aggregated as follows:
• Brands – we leverage our skilled resources to develop and market a growing portfolio of Swallowfield owned and managed 
brands. These include organically developed Bagsy, MR. and Tru, plus the acquisitions of The Real Shaving Company (in 2015) 
and the portfolio of brands included in The Brand Architekts acquisition, acquired at the start of this financial year. This latter 
acquisition brings critical mass to our owned brands and has therefore changed the segmental analysis for this year. 
• Manufacturing – the development, formulation and production of quality products for many of the world’s leading personal 
care and beauty brands. 
• Eliminations and Central Costs. Other Group-wide activities and expenses, including defined benefit pension costs (closed 
defined benefit scheme), share-based payment expenses, amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles, interest, taxation 
and eliminations of intersegment items, are presented within ‘Eliminations and central costs’.
This is the basis on which the Group presents its operating results to the Directors, which is considered to be the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (CODM) for the purposes of IFRS 8. 
No comparative figures are shown as it is only since the acquisition of The Brand Architekts that this segmentation has been 
adopted.  Prior to this brand performance was not considered to be sufficiently material to be separately reported.  Comparative 
full year numbers have been presented on the same basis.

Inter segment revenue earned by manufacturing from sales to brands is determined on normal commercial trading terms as if 
brands were any other third-party customer.
All defined benefit pension costs and share-based payment expenses are recognised for internal reporting to the CODM as part 
of Group-wide activities and are included within ‘Eliminations and central costs’ above. Other costs, such as Group insurance and 
auditors’ remuneration which are incurred on a Group-wide basis are recharged by the head office to segments on a reasonable

NOTE 6 SHARE BASED EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION
Executive and Managers Share Option Scheme
The Group operates both approved and unapproved share option schemes.
There have been a number of options granted during the course of the financial year to 24 June 2017 with further details  
given below:
The Company has used the QCA-IRS option valuer TM (based on the Black-Scholes-Merton based option pricing model) to 
calculate the fair value of the outstanding share options. This model was developed by The QCA partnered with Independent 
Remuneration Solutions (IRS) and City Group Plc. The development was led by Mr Edward Beale, a Director of the Group, and at 
that time Chief Executive of City Group Plc.
Year-ended June 2015 awards
All of the 225,119 share options and 457,061 phantom share options granted have a performance condition attached to them, 
linked to certain stretching share price targets ranging from a threshold at £1.80 to the full award at a share price of £2.20; and 
to the extent that the performance condition is met, have an exercise price of £0.95.
The phantom share options do not result in any dilution. The difference between the share price target achieved and the 
notional exercise price would become payable in cash. The phantom options are designed to finance the exercise of the share 
options and cover the tax liabilities. 
The performance conditions are as follows:
With the percentage of the quantity of shares vesting pro-rated between these levels.
The performance conditions have exceeded 240p and as a consequence the % awarded will be 120% of the quantity outlined above.

(b) Factors affecting total tax charge for the year
The tax assessed on the profit before taxation for the year is lower (2016: lower) than the standard rate of UK corporation tax  
of 19.75% (2016: 20%).  The differences are reconciled below:
(c) Factors that may affect future tax charges
Provision has not been made for deferred taxation on the Group’s land and buildings on the basis that the principal location will 
be sold in the short to medium term, and that the majority of its value will therefore be recovered through sale. Because of this  
no tax liability is expected to arise and therefore no provision has been made in relation to deferred taxation.
There are potential reductions arising from any Research and Development tax credits when received which may affect future 
tax charges.

Adjusted profit for the current year of £2.98m is shown after adding back Exceptional Items of £0.34m and Amortisation of 
Acquisition Related Intangibles of £0.19m, and then deducting a notional tax charge of £0.10m.  Adjusted earnings per share 
has been calculated by dividing the adjusted profit of £2.98m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue at 24 
June 2017 respectively.  The 2016 comparative figures have also been adjusted to a comparable basis.
The Group elected to revalue its Wellington land portfolio only, as allowed under the transitional provisions of IFRS.  
The revaluation adjustment is based on an independent valuation prepared in April 2005 on the basis of market value assuming 
existing use to a total of £1.75m (historical value £0.79m).

months immediately following acquisition. Management can confirm that the margin target was achieved and as such the fair 
value of the transaction assumed the payment of this deferred consideration in full during July 2017, post the reporting date. 
The acquisition costs, including due diligence costs, that relate to the transaction have been expensed as operating costs in 
compliance with IFRS3 and shown as exceptional items. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 69 –

The portfolio of brand names, value £5.09m, is considered to have an indefinite life and is tested for impairment annually.  This 
is on the basis that there is no foreseeable limit on the period of time over which it is expected to contribute to cash flow. 
Customer relationships, value £1.65m, are amortised on a straight-line basis over ten years. 
Goodwill of £1.47m has been recognised on acquisition and is attributable to future product launches and assembled workforce 
at point of acquisition.
IMPAIRMENT TESTING
The Brand Architekts acquisition completed within the year, and has performed in excess of forecasted expectations, and as 
consequence no impairment testing was deemed necessary at the reporting date.  
In the case of The Real Shaving Co brand, value £0.92m, the recoverable amount of the brand was determined based on value-
in-use calculations, covering a detailed 5-year forecast, followed by an extrapolation of expected cash flows for the remaining 
useful life using growth assumptions determined by management. 
The present value of the expected cash flows is determined by applying a suitable discount rate reflecting current market 
assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the brand. The rate applied is a pre-tax 10%.
GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS
The growth assumptions reflect the specific initiatives planned by management to grow and develop the brand. No general or 
average growth rate has been applied. 
DISCOUNT RATES
The discount rates reflect appropriate adjustments relating to market risk and specific risk factors.
CASH FLOW ASSUMPTIONS
Management’s key assumptions include stable profit margins, based on past experience in this market. The Group’s management 
believes that this is the best available input for forecasting this mature sector. 
Apart from the considerations in determining the value-in-use of the brand described above, management is not currently aware 
of any other probable changes that would necessitate changes in its key estimates. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 70 –

provision made having regard to the credit risk identified.  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 72 –
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other payables approximates to their fair value. 
Included within accruals and deferred income is an amount of £1,850k, representing the contingent consideration on the 
acquisition of The Brand Architekts (see Note 13).
The amount due to ‘other payables’ represents a CID facility that allows a regular drawdown of cash funds in Sterling and foreign 
currency, and which is secured on the book debts of the Company.  This facility carries an interest rate of 1.5% over base and is 
repayable on demand.

NOTE 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group uses financial instruments comprising borrowings, some cash and cash equivalents, and various items such as trade 
receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.  The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise 
finance for the Group’s operations.
The Group also has bank accounts denominated in Euros, US Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Czech Koruna, and Chinese Renminbi.  
The purpose of these accounts is to manage the currency transactions arising from the Group’s operations overseas.  The main 
risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and liquidity risk.  The Board 
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.  These policies have remained 
unchanged from the previous year.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of debt and equity. 
The Group’s loan borrowings bear interest at rates based on the bank’s base rate.  The Group Statement of Financial Position 
also includes financial assets in the form of cash at bank and in hand totalling £4,057,000 (2016: £798,000) which are exposed 
to floating interest rates based on bank base rates. 
A 0.5% increase in bank base rates would reduce pre-tax profits by £39,000 in the period.  A 0.5% decrease would have the 
opposite effect.  
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to transactional foreign exchange risk.  The Group seeks to hedge its exposures using bank facilities 
denominated in Euros, US Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Czech Koruna, and Chinese Renminbi and also by buying and selling 
products in these currencies with the objective of minimising fluctuations in exchange rates on future transactions and cash 
flows. 
Approximately 12% (2016: 14%) of the Group’s sales are invoiced in Euros and 16% (2016: 14%) in US Dollars.  These sales are 
calculated in sterling, but invoiced in Euros / US Dollars.  The Group policy is to minimise currency exposures on balances for 
which settlement is not anticipated until a later date through the use of the respective bank facilities.  All other Group sales are 
denominated in sterling.
At 24 June 2017, there were sums totalling £2,423,000 (2016: £670,000) held in foreign currency bank accounts.  
A 5% weakening of sterling would result in a £154,000 increase in reported profits and equity, while a 5% strengthening of 
sterling would result in a £146,000 decrease in profits and equity.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet the identifiable needs of the Group 
and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.  
The Group’s and Company’s liabilities have contractual maturities as summarised below: ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 74 –

Working capital
The Group’s working capital policy is to fund short-term movements through excess cash generated from the trading business.  
The Group had £13.1m (2016: £7.3m) undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at June 2017.  The maturity profile of 
committed bank facilities is regularly reviewed and such facilities are extended or replaced well in advance of their expiry.
Capital maintenance
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders 
and benefits for other stakeholders;
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk; and
• to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.  The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to 
it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.  In order to maintain or adjust 
the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue 
new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 26 POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Group and Company operates defined contribution pension plans and a defined benefit plan, all of which are funded by the 
payment of contributions to separately administered plans.
The Group and Company operates a funded defined benefit scheme (the Scheme) in the UK which provides both pensions in 
retirement and death benefits to members.
Expected future cash flows to and from the Scheme:
The Scheme is subject to the scheme funding requirements outlined in UK legislation. The last scheme funding valuation of the 
Scheme was as at 5 April 2014 and revealed a funding deficit of £1.3m.  The liabilities of the Scheme are based on the current 
value of expected benefit payment cash flows to members of the Scheme over the next 60 to 80 years. The average duration of 
the liabilities is approximately 21 years.
In accordance with the schedule of contributions dated 3 July 2015 the Company is expected to pay contributions to the 
Scheme to make good any shortfalls in funding and has agreed to pay £108k per annum for 10 years from 18 July 2015 to 
eliminate the deficit. The magnitude of such payments will be reviewed following the next scheme funding valuation as at April 
2017. Prior to July 2015 the Company was paying £111.5k per annum. 
In addition, the Company has agreed to meet the cost of administrative expenses and Pension Protection Fund insurance 
premiums for the Scheme. 
Payments made by the Company to the Scheme and in respect of Scheme liabilities were:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Accounting Standards require the discount rate to be based on yields on high quality (usually AA-rated) corporate bonds of 
appropriate currency, taking into account the term of the relevant pension scheme’s liabilities. Corporate bond indices are often 
used as a proxy to determine the discount rate. At the reporting date, the yields on bonds of all types were lower than they 
were at June 2016. This has resulted in lower discount rates being adopted for accounting purposes compared to last year, this 
was coupled by an increase in expectations of long term inflation, the combination of these two factors has translated into an 
increased liability.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SCHEME AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCHEME
a) Information about the characteristics the Scheme 
i. The Scheme provides pensions in retirement and death benefits to members. Pension benefits are linked to a member’s final  
salary at retirement and their length of service. As of 31 December 2015, the Scheme closed to future accrual.
ii. The Scheme is a registered scheme under UK legislation and was contracted out of the State Second Pension.
iii. The Scheme is subject to the scheme funding requirements outlined in UK legislation. The last scheme funding valuation of 
the Scheme was as at 5 April 2014 and revealed a deficit of £1,298,000.
iv. The Scheme membership as at 5 April 2014 comprised of 128 active members accruing benefits, 171 deferred pensioner 
members and 118 pensioner members. Since 31 December 2015, the Scheme has been closed to future accrual with those 
active members if still employed by the Company transferring to a new category of employed deferred member. If no longer 
employed, they became a deferred member.
v. The Scheme was established from 1 January 1987 under trust and is governed by the Scheme’s trust deed and rules dated 19 
January 2001. The Trustees are responsible for the operation and the governance of the Scheme, including making decisions 
regarding the Scheme’s funding and investment strategy in conjunction with the Company. 
b) Information about the risks of the Scheme to the Employer
The Scheme exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as: market (investment) risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and 
longevity risk. The small number of Scheme members means that the Scheme and ultimately the Company are exposed to the 
experience (such as life expectancy and take-up of member options) of individual members. The Scheme does not expose the 
Employer to any unusual Scheme specific or Company specific risks.
c) Information about any amendments, curtailments and settlements
There has been no allowance for any amendments, curtailments, or settlements within this accounting period.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
b) Description of asset-liability matching strategies 
The Trustees holds a proportion of the Scheme’s assets in pooled funds invested in gilts, corporate bonds and liability driven 
investment funds to provide some degree of matching with the Scheme’s liabilities.
Liability driven investment funds and index-linked gilts fund are used to provide a degree of price inflation and interest rate 
matching with the liabilities.
c) The Scheme’s investment strategy
The Scheme’s investment strategy is to invest broadly 70% in return seeking and 30% in matching assets. This strategy reflects 
the Scheme’s liability profile and the Trustees’ and Employer’s attitude to risk.
The plan holds a number of annuity policies which match a portion of pensions in payment. 
d) Information about the most recent actuarial valuation of the Scheme and the valuation of the defined benefit obligation at 
the accounting date
The value of the liabilities at the reporting date have been estimated by updating the results of the scheme funding valuation  
as at 5 April 2014 to allow for the passage of time, the accrual of new benefits up to 31 December 2015, benefits paid out of  
the Plan and changes in actuarial assumptions over the period from 5 April 2014 to 24 June 2017.
Such an approach is common for the purposes of accounting disclosures. It is not expected that these projections will 
be materially different from a summation of individual calculations at the accounting date, although there may be some 
discrepancy between the actual liabilities for the Plan at the accounting date and those included in the disclosures.
