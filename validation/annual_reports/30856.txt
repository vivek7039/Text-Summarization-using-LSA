Annual Report 
and Financial Statements 2017 Alternative Performance Measures
This Annual Report and Financial Statements provides alternative performance measures (APMs) which are not defined or specified  
under the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards. We believe these APMs provide readers with important additional 
information on our business. To support this we have included an accounting policy note on APMs on page 101, a reconciliation of the 
APMs we use where relevant and a glossary on pages 133 to 136 indicating the APMs that we use, an explanation of how they are 
calculated and why we use them.

Discontinued operations
The sale of our home credit business in Bulgaria in June 2017 resulted in a one-off accounting charge of £5.7 million which, together with  
the trading loss of £2.7 million generated in 2017, has been accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5.

Delivering long-term 
growth responsibly
Chairman’s statement
Overview
I am pleased to report that we delivered a solid operational and 
financial performance in 2017. This was achieved against the 
backdrop of an external environment characterised by regulatory 
proposals and changes, tax challenges and intense competition. 
We provide much-needed access to regulated credit for people 
who might otherwise be financially excluded and, while we 
continue to modernise the Group in response to the changing 
needs of consumers, our values of being respectful, responsible 
and straightforward guide the way we serve our customers and 
govern our business. Led by the Board, we continued to take an 
active approach to risk management. This, together with product 
innovation and our regulatory stakeholder engagement programme, 
supports the work we have undertaken to help protect our business 
model. I was delighted to see our businesses receive numerous 
prestigious awards over the course of the year in recognition of our 
responsible lending practices, outstanding corporate culture and 
offering a great place to work, all of which are indicative of the high 
regard we are held in when serving customers, managing risk and 
developing our people. 
Our strategy
We understand our consumer segment well and are evolving the 
business to ensure our products and services suit customers' 
changing needs and circumstances. By offering a broader choice  
of more competitively priced products, including longer-term home 
credit loans and digital credit offerings, we aim to offer better 
customer value and improve credit quality. Our strategy is focused 
on delivering sustainable growth, enhancing profitability and making 
efficient use of capital. We now segment our businesses into two 
broad categories, namely 'growth' focused businesses and 'returns' 
focused businesses. Our European home credit businesses are in the 
returns category and they are managed to deliver the best possible 
level of customer service and to optimise returns. The capital they 
generate is used to fund investment in our growth businesses, IPF 
Digital and Mexico home credit, as well as delivering progressive 
returns to our shareholders. We made more good progress against 
our strategy in 2017 and it is particularly pleasing to see the strong 
performance delivered by IPF Digital. 
Regulatory update 
Consumer credit operators serving customers in Europe continued  
to face regulatory challenges during 2017, and our business was  
no exception. Rate cap proposals, changes to tax law and more 
stringent creditworthiness assessment requirements impacted how 
we do business.
As I reported in last year’s annual report, the Polish Ministry of Justice 
published a proposal at the end of 2016 to tighten the existing rate 
cap on consumer loans in Poland. There has been no further update 
on this matter and we, together with other consumer lending 
operators, continue to serve customers in this uncertain environment. 
We are also working with interested parties to encourage an 
“We are adapting our business to 
capture the opportunity that growing 
consumer credit demand offers and 
responding to a more challenging 
competitive and regulatory 
environment.”
Dan O’Connor
Chairman Strategic Report
International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 3
outcome that is good for both consumers and business. As 
previously reported, our home credit business in Poland appealed 
decisions received in January 2017 from the Polish Tax Chamber  
with respect to its 2008 and 2009 financial years. At the time of our 
original announcement, we said that we intended to initiate a 
process with the UK tax authority aimed at ensuring that the 
intra-group arrangement, which is being challenged, is taxed in 
accordance with international tax principles. This has now been 
initiated and, in response, the Polish court has stayed the hearings  
of the 2008 and 2009 appeals pending resolution of this process. 
Additionally, a comprehensive set of changes to Polish corporate 
income tax came into force on 1 January 2018. The main impact for 
our business is a one-off deferred tax charge of £30 million which has 
been reflected in the 2017 financial statements. Further detail on both 
these matters is included in the financial review on pages 31 to 35.
We also faced regulatory changes in Romania where more stringent 
creditworthiness assessment requirements introduced in January 
2017 impacted growth. More recent regulatory change means that 
our business in Romania is now supervised by the National Bank of 
Romania and this is likely to lead to a further tightening of credit 
criteria and a reduction in the volume of loans we are allowed to 
serve customers. We have a good track record of adapting our 
business model to regulatory changes and CEO, Gerard Ryan 
covers current regulatory matters on page 15. 
2017 financial performance
We delivered profit before taxation from continuing operations of 
£105.6 million, an increase of £9.6 million including an £11.3 million 
positive FX benefit. We delivered credit issued growth of 6% led by  
IPF Digital and our Mexico home credit business. Group portfolio 
quality remains good and I am pleased to report that our home 
credit business in Mexico made a strong operational recovery 
following the disruption caused by two earthquakes in September. 
Further details on our 2017 financial performance are covered in  
the operational review on pages 24 to 30.
Shareholder returns
Subject to shareholder approval, a final dividend of 7.8 pence per 
share will be payable, bringing the full-year dividend to 12.4 pence 
per share (2016: 12.4 pence per share). The full-year dividend of  
12.4 pence per share represents a total payment equivalent to 
approximately 61.3% of post-tax earnings from continuing operations 
for 2017. As a percentage of pre-exceptional profit after tax from 
continuing operations for 2017, it equates to a pay-out ratio of 
approximately 36.8%, which is modestly above our target pay-out 
rate of 35%. We aim to run and develop high-return businesses 
providing good returns to shareholders while maintaining a strong 
financial profile, more of which is detailed in the financial review on 
pages 31 to 35. 
Our Board and people
As reported in my prior year statement, we appointed Justin 
Lockwood to the Board as Chief Financial Officer in February 2017. 
Justin’s knowledge of the business and financial expertise have 
enabled him to take on the challenges of this role effectively. We 
also continue our search for a Senior Independent Director to 
replace Tony Hales who has served as a director on our Board for 
more than 10 years. I am pleased to report that Tony has agreed to 
continue in his role until a suitable replacement is appointed and, as 
such, will put himself forward for re-election at our forthcoming AGM. 
Jayne Almond will step down as non-executive director of IPF with 
effect from the conclusion of our 2018 AGM. The Board would like to 
thank Jayne for her service and valuable contribution to the Group.
This year, our Board visited our home credit and digital operations  
in Poland where we heard first-hand how these businesses operate 
to deliver value to our customers, the opportunities they are seeking 
to capture and the risks they face. From my discussions with our 
teams, it is clear that my colleagues take pride in the customers they 
serve and the values that we uphold. We have strong leaders and 
talented people who are delivering on our strategy and, on behalf  
of the Board, I would like to thank our team for their contribution  
in delivering the results set out in this annual report. 
Sustainability and ethics
Making a contribution to society is important to us and our 
stakeholder engagement programmes help our businesses play  
a positive role in their communities. We are an essential part of  
a competitive and well-functioning credit market, providing 
underserved consumers with an entry point to mainstream 
consumer finance in a transparent and responsible way. On  
page 17, CEO Gerard Ryan explains that a sustainable lending 
business must have a strong ethical culture embedded throughout 
the business, and this is fully endorsed by our Board. This year, we 
launched a new code of ethics and 98% of employees and 91%  
of agents completed the annual ethics e-learning programme. 
Outlook
We will continue to focus on optimising our European home credit 
operations to generate further returns, which will support investment 
in growing Mexico home credit and IPF Digital, and deliver enhanced 
shareholder value. The regulatory and competitive landscape is  
likely to remain challenging. In particular, both we and you, as our 
shareholders, are keen to hear an update from the Polish Ministry of 
Justice on its proposed reduction to the existing non-interest pricing 
cap in Poland. We will continue to work to encourage a more positive 
outcome on this matter. We have a clear plan and remain confident 
that we will continue to manage the business to deliver further 
sustainable growth and returns.

Home credit customers
Personal relationships with our customers
Many of our home credit customers have low, often fluctuating incomes and a limited credit 
history. This means some would not qualify for credit from a mainstream lender or an online loan 
and, as such, are suited to home credit. They value the personal service provided by agents as 
well as the convenience and speed of our offering. High levels of advocacy for our products and 
services show we are a trusted and valued business delivering high levels of customer satisfaction. 
Our home credit business model has operated successfully for more than 130 years and remains 
a relevant and important component of the consumer finance market.
Typical customer features
• Low, fluctuating income 
• Limited credit history 
• Prefer agent service 
• Need to manage 
finances carefully 
• Seek flexibility
How customers use their loans 
• Unexpected expenses
• Healthcare
• Household goods
• Education 
• Family celebrations
“Over the years, Provident 
has helped me buy lots of things 
for my house including a washing 
machine, my bed, a stove and, 
most importantly, school books  
and uniforms for my children.”
Home credit customer, Mexico
Enhancing the lives 
of our customers
quickly and efficiently
We know our customers well and understand their specific needs and financial 
circumstances. Our customers want to borrow small amounts to pay for everyday 
items and repay in manageable, affordable instalments. This responsible approach 
runs parallel with our robust credit policies ensuring our customers are able to 
manage their repayments and do not become over-indebted.

Digital customers
Fast, efficient and personalised service anytime
The increasing use of mobile services means a growing number of consumers in our target 
segment are choosing to borrow online. Our target customers earn low to middle incomes 
and have high smartphone adoption levels. They already have a credit history that may 
allow them to qualify for an online loan. We are able to meet their needs through our digital 
offering, which has operated successfully for over ten years and offers a significant strategic 
opportunity to grow the number of customers we serve with instalment loans and credit 
line facilities.

Our business model
Creating value  
responsibly
Key resources 
Our business model offers distinct but 
complementary home credit and digital 
channels through which we offer a range 
of products that meet the everyday needs 
of our customers. Our business is an 
essential part of a competitive and well-
functioning credit market that promotes 
economic and social development by 
providing underserved consumers with 
consumer finance. 
Our business model generates good, sustainable returns for 
shareholders. We are focused on serving our customers to a 
high standard and, as a leading non-banking financial 
institution in many of our markets, we are a respected financial 
brand and award-winning employer.
Our values underpin our business model, and we operate and 
make decisions consistent with being responsible, respectful 
and straightforward. Credit risk is managed responsibly using 
robust credit scoring systems and credit bureaux, and in our 
home credit businesses these systems are supported by the 
critical judgement of agents. We have a ‘low and grow’ 
strategy, starting new customers on smaller, shorter-term loans 
and only offer more credit once their creditworthiness is proven. 
High standards of governance are essential to the sustainability 
of our business and we actively identify, manage and aim to 
mitigate the principal risks we face.
Our profit is generated from lending responsibly while 
managing the business efficiently. Our home credit businesses 
generate a high proportion of Group revenue primarily through 
the agent-service model. While IPF Digital delivers a smaller 
contribution currently, we believe it offers a significant future 
growth opportunity driven by increased demand for online 
lending and the ability to operate within a regulatory 
environment where the trend is for lower-cost products.
People
We resource the business with skilled, 
motivated and knowledgeable employees 
and agents who implement our strategy 
and ensure our customers are well served.
Technology
Technology is fundamental to driving 
efficiency through agent mobile 
technology, supporting digital lending 
growth and making effective 
credit decisions.
Financial
We manage financial resources effectively 
to sustain our business and generate good 
returns for our investors.
Relationships
Open and straightforward engagement 
with our stakeholders is critical, particularly 
the relationships with our customers to 
ensure they receive the products and 
services they want.

Our multi-channel strategy
We made good progress against our 
strategy, which is focused on delivering 
sustainable growth, enhancing 
profitability and making efficient use of 
capital. It has been defined in 
response to:
• strong demand from consumers for 
unsecured credit, particularly via 
digital loans;
• increased competition from digital 
lenders and retail banks;
• growing preference for digital options 
with the rise of smartphone and 
internet penetration; and
• increased regulatory oversight focused 
on price and affordability, which is 
driving lower margins and restricting 
issue values.
Our operations are at different stages of 
maturity and our strategy segments them 
into ‘growth’ and ‘returns’ focused 
businesses. There are significant growth 
opportunities in our IPF Digital and Mexico 
home credit businesses supported by 
investment of capital generated by our 
European home credit businesses. To 
deliver this strategy, we continue to 
modernise the business through 
investment in technology and developing 
our people and their capabilities.

Delivering on our  
multi-channel strategy
Chief Executive Officer’s review
Q. International Personal Finance has changed in 
the six years you have led the Group. What does the 
business stand for today?
In so many ways, our business has changed enormously but in  
some very fundamental ways it remains entirely consistent with the 
business I joined in 2012. Back then, we were a provider of weekly 
cash loans delivered through agents; our competitors were mainly 
other home credit operators and the regulatory outlook was 
reasonably foreseeable.
Today, we face competition from multiple digital lenders and banks 
are taking a keen interest in our best customers. The regulatory 
landscape is almost unrecognisable in terms of the volume of new 
legislation as well as the fact that the key instigators of regulatory 
change are politicians as well as regulators. In response to these 
changes, we have adapted our offering so that we continue to give 
our customers the best service we can while protecting our business 
model. We now offer an array of products (weekly and monthly 
instalment cash loans, digital instalment loans, lines of credit, 
insurance services and small business loans) through multiple 
channels (agents, call centres, digital and distribution partners).
Notwithstanding all of this change, our vision and how we treat our 
customers remain true to our values. We aim to make a difference 
in the lives of our customers by providing simple and personalised 
financial solutions in a responsible, respectful and straightforward way. 
CEO, Gerard Ryan, discusses the operating 
landscape and progress made on 
delivering our multi-channel strategy. 
“We delivered a solid 
operational and financial 
performance and 
made progress on our 
multi-channel strategy.” Strategic Report
International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 15
Q. What are the key drivers of your strategy? 
Fundamentally, we have always been in the business of providing 
finance to customers who could be deemed to be underbanked  
or underserved. We have adapted our strategy to respond primarily 
to four external forces: strong demand for unsecured credit; 
changing customer behaviour with an increasing preference for 
digital delivery; increased competition leading to faster service  
from application to loan disbursement; and significant regulatory 
intervention leading to lower prices and restricted access to credit  
for large numbers of consumers. With the addition of our new 
products and channels, we are now broadening our appeal to 
customers and offering more access points, longer and larger  
loans, and more competitive rates.
Our strategy aims to build a sustainable and growing business  
that delivers increasing returns to shareholders. We now segment  
our businesses into 'growth' and 'returns' focused operations.  
IPF Digital and Mexico home credit are growth businesses and  
our European home credit operations are in the returns category. 
Our European home credit businesses generate the returns to invest 
in our growth businesses as well as delivering progressive returns to  
our shareholders. 
Q. Recent years have been characterised by 
regulatory change. How did it impact IPF in 2017?
We had a difficult start to 2017 from a regulatory and tax perspective. 
The publication by the Polish Ministry of Justice in December 2016  
of a proposal to further reduce the cap on non-interest charges on 
consumer loans unsettled the Polish consumer finance market.  
A new cap had been in place for less than a year and appeared  
to be working well, so it was a surprise to the market when further 
changes were proposed without warning. There has since been no 
update from the Ministry of Justice on this matter. Throughout 2017, 
we worked with our advisors and other key stakeholders in Poland  
to try to arrive at a sensible outcome that provides appropriate 
protection for consumers and, at the same time, promotes a vibrant 
and competitive marketplace. This work is still ongoing.
As previously reported, our home credit business in Poland appealed 
decisions received in January 2017 from the Polish Tax Chamber (the 
upper tier of the Polish tax authority) with respect to its 2008 and 2009 
financial years. At the time of our original announcement, we said 
that we intended to initiate a process with the UK tax authority aimed 
at ensuring that the intra-group arrangement, which is being 
challenged, is taxed in accordance with international tax principles. 
This action resulted in the Polish court staying the hearings of the 2008 
and 2009 appeals pending resolution of this process. Also in Poland, 
changes to corporate income tax legislation came into force on 
1 January 2018 which has resulted in an exceptional one-off deferred 
tax charge of £30 million in 2017. Further information on these tax 
matters is included in the financial review on pages 31 to 35.
Also in January 2017, more stringent creditworthiness assessment 
rules were introduced in Romania which reduced the number of 
customers we were allowed to serve. While we were adapting our 
business to cope with these changes, new rules were introduced in 
the final few months of 2017 which have since resulted in our business 
being supervised by the National Bank of Romania for the first time. 
This is likely to lead to a further tightening of credit criteria and a 
reduction in the volume of loans we are allowed to provide  
to customers in that market. 
We operate within price cap environments in all our European 
markets with the exception of the Czech Republic, Romania and 
Spain, and we expect pricing regulations to be implemented in 
these markets at some point in the future. A proposal to implement 
an APR cap of 18% for existing and new consumer lending is being 
debated in the Romanian Parliament and we are contributing to this 
discussion. There have been, and continue to be, numerous 
regulatory challenges to our business, but we have a proven track 
record of adapting to regulatory change and I believe we will 
continue to do so.
Q. In light of these regulatory challenges, how are 
you making your business more resilient?
I’d like to emphasise we will always adapt our business to be fully 
compliant with local regulation, no matter what regulatory change  
is introduced. A key part of our strategy is that our business should 
form an essential part of a well-functioning and competitive 
consumer finance market. To perform that role effectively, we aim  
to ensure regulators better understand the part we play in society 
and demonstrate how we protect our customer segment from illegal 
lenders and the excesses of the ‘grey’ market, while also providing 
many of these customers with their first step towards creating a 
positive credit history that will benefit them in the future. 
We also recognise it is politicians as well as regulators who are now 
likely to instigate regulatory change in many of our markets. As a 
result, we have developed a programme of increased engagement 
with those who are likely to influence how business is conducted and 
we now work more effectively through local trade bodies to help put 
the case forward for sensible and well thought through regulation. 
Internally, we are also modernising our business to make it more 
resilient, and new products and channels play a key role in this. We 
are using technology to make customer interaction with our business 
easier and more appealing. These investments include handheld 
mobile technology for agents through to seamless digital processing 
from credit application to loan repayment.
Q. How are you differentiating the business in a 
highly competitive landscape? 
Our business is unique in that we offer choices from traditional home 
credit loans delivered by agents through to a fully digital line of credit 
via IPF Digital. For customers who may not have a strong enough 
credit profile for a digital offering, we can offer a hybrid solution 
whereby they meet an agent for the initial assessment but then 
make subsequent repayments via their bank.
“We have the ability to offer choices 
from traditional home credit loans 
delivered by agents through to a fully 
digital line of credit.” 16
There are significant differences between our home credit  
and digital business models. I am aware that many of our 
stakeholders view the latter as having few, if any, barriers to entry, 
whereas the home credit business is deemed to be very difficult  
to replicate. While there is some truth to this, and we have seen 
an explosion in the number of digital providers, to be successful 
requires experienced leadership, well-developed scorecards, the 
right products, trusted brands and an excellent customer journey. 
Our digital business, having been in existence for more than ten 
years, meets all of these criteria and its results are a clear 
indicator that we are on the right path to build a large and 
complementary business to our home credit operation. 
Q. What is the global economic outlook for 
your business?
We saw reasonably stable macroeconomic conditions in all of 
our markets in 2017. In many of our European markets there were 
record levels of employment and good GDP growth. While the 
Mexican economy had a more difficult time, driven by 
uncertainty over its trading relationship with the US and the 
impact of relatively subdued oil prices, it still continued to grow.
As we look to 2018 and beyond, current indicators suggest that 
we should expect our markets to deliver positive GDP growth,  
low but increasing inflation and subdued interest rates.
Q. How would you evaluate performance in 2017? 
We delivered a solid financial and operational performance  
in 2017 and profit before tax increased to £105.6 million.  
We generated an increase in like-for-like profit before tax of 
£5.3 million primarily as a result of improved profitability delivered 
by IPF Digital’s established markets. Overall, like-for-like profit in 
home credit was broadly flat reflecting an £11.4 million reduction 
in our ongoing businesses offset largely by an £11.1 million 
year-on-year increase in Slovakia and Lithuania arising from lower 
costs of closure. Stronger FX rates resulted in an £11.3 million 
positive impact which was offset partially by incremental new 
business investment in IPF Digital of £7.0 million.
We delivered a 6% increase in credit issued as a result of strong 
growth in our Mexico home credit and IPF Digital businesses, and 
this resulted in growth in average net receivables and revenue of 
7% and 1% respectively. We managed credit quality effectively 
and impairment as a percentage of revenue at 24.4% was slightly 
below our target range of 25% to 30%. The compression of 
revenue yields, and our planned investments in driving growth 
and efficiency, resulted in a slight increase in our cost-income 
ratio, up 0.5 ppts to 45.8%. Full details of our operational 
performance are covered on pages 24 to 30.
Q. What were the operational highlights in 2017? 
European home credit businesses
We are improving the sustainability of our European home credit 
businesses by creating more modern, efficient and higher credit  
quality operations that provide a good service to customers,  
and continue to generate the cash and capital to fund growth 
opportunities and progressive returns to shareholders. We have done 
this in response to the regulatory and competitive market conditions in 
which we operate in Europe by offering customers a broader choice of 
more competitively priced products, and improving the efficiency of 
our operations through investment in technology. We continued to roll 
out our agent mobile technology which will improve the customer 
experience and make the role of the agent more efficient. At the end 
of 2017, all agents in Hungary and the Czech Republic were using the 
technology and the implementation in Poland is expected to be 
completed in the first half of 2018. I am pleased to say there has been 
no significant operational disruption as a result of these changes and 
agent feedback is supportive. To enable us to serve more customers 
with digital offerings, we are leveraging our Provident brand with a 
Provident digital offering in Poland. This has been well received and 
around 15,000 customers are being served through this channel. We 
plan to introduce this offering in the Czech Republic in the first half of 
2018. To support the changes we are making, we simplified our 
business structure and created a Northern Europe region comprising 
our Polish and Czech businesses to complement the existing Southern 
Europe region of Hungary and Romania. This is enabling our teams to 
better share best practice and is expected to support the delivery of 
cost efficiencies over the longer-term. 
Mexico home credit
Our strategy in Mexico is to expand our geographic footprint, build 
our micro-business channel, and improve operational efficiency and 
customer penetration rates in selected longer-established branches. 
At the start of 2017, we made a commitment to maintain the 
momentum we had generated in the second half of 2016. Our 
leadership team delivered on this in the first half and it would have 
been maintained in Q3 had it not been for the two earthquakes that 
hit Mexico in September. Inevitably, this impacted our agents, 
employees and customers and, consequently, we saw a reversal of 
growth in Q3 and collections deteriorated. In times such as these,  
it is important to recognise the human impact of such events and 
our focus was on ensuring that we took care of our people and 
customers. We activated our business disruption plan and I am 
pleased to say that we returned to more normal trading towards the 
second half of November.
We opened six branches in the first half of 2017 which, together with 
those branches opened in 2016, now serve around 55,000 customers 
and we plan to open a similar number of branches in 2018. We also 
took the opportunity to review our less profitable branches and 
decided to close two branches in Monterrey. Consequently, our 
results include a reduction of 16,000 customers and a charge of 
£1.9 million for the write down of the associated receivables portfolio 
and closure costs. Our micro-business channel, now available in the 
majority of our branches in Mexico, is growing well with around 
16,000 customers, and we expect further expansion in 2018.

part of a competitive and  
well-functioning credit market.” Strategic Report
International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 17
IPF Digital
Our digital business has existed for more than a decade and has  
a leadership team that has built up considerable experience in 
product and channel development, scorecard building, providing  
a great customer experience, and creating brands that resonate 
with consumers. 
Growing our digital lending business and demonstrating that the  
IPF Digital business model can deliver a good financial return are key 
strategic priorities for the Group, and we made good progress 
against both of these objectives. Focusing on providing a superior 
customer experience through product and process innovation 
helped deliver strong demand for our credit line product. In many  
of our markets this line of credit facility has replaced instalment loans 
as our core customer offering. In our new markets of Poland, Spain, 
Mexico and Australia, we continued to refine our credit scorecards 
and delivered strong receivables growth as well as improved credit 
quality and cost efficiency. In our established markets of Finland and 
the Baltics, we delivered further credit issued growth through smarter, 
risk-based pricing strategies, enhanced customer relationship 
management (CRM) activities and increased penetration of our 
credit line product. 
Q. Would it not make more sense to focus on 
growing home credit and not diversify into digital?
For some of our stakeholders there would be a comfort factor in 
sticking to what has proved to be a very successful business model 
based around the delivery of loans via an agent. The truth, however, 
is that neither our customers nor our competitors stand still and we 
should not either.
Customer behaviour is changing and there is a growing preference 
for digital credit. In addition, we have some customers who have 
been with us for several years who would be capable of obtaining a 
loan remotely. If consumers have not dealt with us before, they may 
choose to obtain a loan from our purely digital brands. Alternatively, 
if they are an existing or past customer of Provident, they may 
choose to apply for credit through our Provident-branded digital 
channel. Either way, we aim to offer them a choice of channel and 
product that is most suitable for them.
Q. How does stakeholder engagement impact 
your strategy?
Consumer finance is an industry that impacts most people and, 
rightly so, attracts scrutiny. It is critical to have a positive dialogue 
with, and to listen carefully to, our key stakeholders, principally our 
customers, employees, agents, regulators, politicians and 
shareholders. Our aim is to ensure we design and provide products 
that our customers want, are appropriately priced and that, if 
customers find themselves in difficulty with repayments, we are 
understanding and accommodating to their changed 
circumstances. All of our stakeholders expect us to act in an ethical 
and transparent way and this is at the heart of how we conduct 
our business.
Q. How do you ensure your people stay engaged 
with your ethics programme?
I’m sure that most CEOs would say that ethics are very important for 
their business, but, in our case, we would not have a sustainable 
business without a very clear and strong ethical culture throughout 
the organisation. We have mandatory ethics e-learning programmes 
for both employees and agents and I deliver our annual international 
ethics week with the assistance of our senior leadership team. Many 
of our customers continue to have limited disposable incomes so it is 
critically important that the way we incentivise our people does not 
promote the provision of credit to consumers who are already over 
indebted or who do not have the means to repay the loan. For that 
reason, our incentives are weighted to promote the right behaviours 
and not simply to generate new loans.
Q. How do you ensure diversity in the workplace?
We value the significant benefits that having a diverse international 
team brings. In 2017, we strengthened this further by introducing 
global functional and regional leadership structures which will 
encourage further focus on diversity in all its forms as people work 
more closely together. From a gender diversity perspective, we will 
focus upon building our people strategies further to ensure that we 
attract, retain and develop people on merit. Our global people, 
organisation and planning process ensures that our talent rises in  
a fair, diverse and transparent way, and in accordance with our 
values and ethics.
Q. What are your aspirations for the Group in 2018?
As far as our core purpose is concerned, I see very little if any 
change as we go into 2018. We are a business that provides credit  
in a responsible, respectful and straightforward way to those who  
are underbanked and underserved, We are an essential part of a 
competitive and well-functioning credit market and, by acting in  
an ethical and transparent way, we can help to improve how the 
overall segment is governed.
In terms of business performance, we are focused on serving  
our customers responsibly within a regulatory and competitive 
landscape that we expect will remain challenging. We will continue 
to improve the sustainability of our European home credit operations 
by creating more modern, efficient and higher credit quality 
operations that provide a good service to customers, and continue 
to generate the cash and capital to fund growth opportunities and 
progressive returns to shareholders. We expect IPF Digital to deliver 
further strong growth and an improved performance driven by 
increased scale and enhancements in financial metrics as our  
new markets grow and mature. In Mexico, we expect to return to 
customer growth, expand our geographic footprint and micro-
business channel, and deliver improved operational efficiency in  
our established branches.  18
Making good progress 
on our strategy
Our goals to serve our customers well and deliver shareholder value drive our strategy. 
We assess our performance against the following key performance indicators, each of 
which is linked to our long-term strategy. We use these KPIs to monitor the performance 
of the business to ensure we deliver value for our stakeholders.

Performance
The total number of customers across  
the Group contracted by 9% in 2017 
driven primarily by regulatory and 
competitive pressures in our European 
home credit markets.
Why we measure it
Customer numbers demonstrate our 
scale in our individual markets. While 
growth of our customer base is critically 
important to our continued success, we 
will reject potential new customers, and 
not seek to retain existing customers who 
contravene our credit policies or have a 
poor repayment record.
Performance
The number of customers who have  
three or more loans with our business. 
Customer retention in both home credit 
and IPF Digital was maintained in 2017. 
Why we measure it
Our ability to retain customers is central  
to achieving our growth ambitions  
and is a key indicator of the quality of  
our products and service. We do not 
retain customers who have a poor 
payment history as it can create  
a continuing impairment risk and  
runs counter to our responsible 
lending commitments.
Performance
The proportion of employees and agents 
who have worked with us for more than 
12 months. Employee retention improved 
slightly on 2016. Agent retention reduced 
as a result of changes to criteria required 
to offer financial services in the Czech 
Republic together with contraction in that 
business, and new employment 
regulations in Romania. 
Why we measure it
Experienced people help us achieve and 
sustain strong customer relationships and 
deliver a high-quality service. Good 
retention also helps reduce recruitment 
and training costs, enabling more 
investment in people development.

Performance
ROA is measured as profit before interest 
and exceptional items, after pre-
exceptional tax, and divided by average 
net receivables. Group ROA reduced by  
0.8 ppts to 11.5% due to lower profits in 
European home credit and a higher 
effective tax rate. 
Why we measure it
ROA is a good measure of the financial 
performance of our businesses, showing 
the ongoing return on the total equity and 
debt capital invested in the average net 
receivables of our operating segments 
and the Group.
Performance
Revenue, which is income generated  
from customer receivables, increased  
by 1% driven by our customer retention 
strategy to serve customers with longer-
term, lower-yielding products and the 
impact of the lower total cost of credit  
rate cap in Poland. 
Why we measure it
Revenue is one of the key drivers of overall 
performance outcomes in the 
income statement.
Performance
The average amounts receivable from 
customers translated at the average 
monthly actual exchange rate increased 
by 7% in 2017 principally as a result of 
strong growth in Mexico home credit  
and IPF Digital. 
Why we measure it
This measure allows stakeholders to 
compare changes in amounts receivable 
from customers on a consistent basis with 
revenue growth because it is a key driver 
of revenue growth. 
Performance
The direct expenses of running the 
business as a percentage of revenue, 
excluding agents’ commission. The 
cost-income ratio increased in 2017 
reflecting investment in growth and 
efficiency together with compression  
of revenue yields.
Why we measure it
The cost-income ratio is useful for 
comparing performance across markets.
Performance
Impairment is the amount charged as a 
cost to the income statement as a result 
of customers defaulting on contractual 
loan payments. Credit quality remains 
good and Group impairment as a 
percentage of revenue at 24.4% is slightly 
below our target range of 25% to 30%.
Why we measure it
Profitability is maximised by optimising  
the balance between growth and 
credit quality.

A strong international 
business with good returns 
and growth opportunities
We are a profitable, well-funded home credit and digital lending business with a good 
track record of serving customers profitably and responsibly, while delivering attractive, 
sustainable returns to our shareholders. We have achieved this even during periods of 
macroeconomic and financial market volatility and periods of competitive and 
regulatory challenges. We operate in a dynamic consumer finance market and have 
successfully expanded our offering to include digital loans, which has resulted in us 
being able to serve a larger target segment of customers.
Diversified channels, products and brands 
to meet customer needs
There is growing demand for unsecured, small-sum 
consumer credit and we focus on providing credit 
to customers who are largely underserved. We 
know our customers well and offer products that 
meet their specific needs. Our home credit 
business model has operated for over 130 years 
and proven resilient to economic downturns. Our 
digital lending business has operated successfully 
for more than a decade and we are making the 
most of future lending opportunities driven by 
technology and changing consumer behaviour.

a balanced maturity profile.
Experience of managing key risks including 
credit, regulation, competition and liquidity
We are proficient in managing key risks and have 
adapted our business and product offering to 
comply with consumer credit regulation and 
increased competition. Our decision-making is 
underpinned by our control framework and the 
processes we implement to identify and manage 
risks. This dynamic, well-developed system is 
integrated at all levels of the Group and aligned to 
our strategic objectives to deliver long-term growth 
and protect our people, assets and reputation.
High-return businesses and maintain strong 
financial profile
Our business and financial strategy supports the 
significant future growth and returns opportunities 
we see for our businesses. Our European home 
credit businesses are highly cash and capital 
generative. They are managed to provide a high 
level of service to our customers and to optimise 
returns, which are used to fund growth in our IPF 
Digital and Mexico home credit businesses as well 
as provide progressive returns to our shareholders.

Contributing to the wider economy
We are an active corporate citizen with more than 28,600 
employees and agents contributing to their wider economies 
through taxes and spending on goods and services. Total tax 
contribution in 2017 was over £220 million, comprising £140 million 
of taxes paid (representing a cost to the Group) and £80 million of 
taxes collected on behalf of governments such as payroll taxes 
and employees’ social security contributions. We are also 
committed to investing in our local communities supporting 
financial literacy, local development and enterprise initiatives.

Protecting consumers
By providing regulated credit products, we protect our 
customers from illegal lenders and the unregulated excesses 
of the ‘grey’ market. All our lending is unsecured and we don’t 
ask our customers to pledge assets, such as a car  
or property, as collateral in the event that they default on 
their repayments.
Supporting people who are not well served by other 
mainstream credit providers or excluded altogether comes 
with higher risks and we understand that some of our home 
credit customers will take a little bit longer than contractually 
obliged or won’t fully repay their loans, and so we price our 
loans to take this into account.

Operational review
We delivered a solid financial and operational performance in 2017 and profit before tax increased to £105.6 million. We generated an 
increase in like-for-like profit before tax of £5.3 million primarily as a result of improved profitability delivered by IPF Digital’s established markets. 
Overall, like-for-like profit in home credit was broadly flat reflecting an £11.4 million reduction in our ongoing businesses offset largely by an 
£11.1 million year-on-year increase in Slovakia and Lithuania. Stronger FX rates resulted in an £11.3 million positive impact which was offset 
partially by incremental new business investment in IPF Digital of £7.0 million.

We delivered a 6% increase in credit issued as a result of strong growth in our Mexico home credit and IPF Digital businesses, and this resulted 
in growth in average net receivables and revenue of 7% and 1% respectively. We managed credit quality effectively and impairment as a 
percentage of revenue at 24.4% was slightly below our target range of 25% to 30%. The compression of revenue yields and our planned 
investments in driving growth and efficiency resulted in a slight increase in our cost-income ratio, up 0.5 ppts to 45.8%.
Home credit 
Our home credit businesses delivered profit before tax of £132.2 million in 2017 which comprised £129.0 million from our ongoing businesses 
and £3.2 million from our home credit operations in Slovakia and Lithuania, which are being wound down. The increase in profit delivered by 
our ongoing home credit businesses reflects a reduction in like-for-like profit of £11.4 million before a £12.8 million benefit from stronger FX rates. 
The like-for-like profit growth in Slovakia and Lithuania was £11.1 million, after a loss in 2016 of £7.4 million, was driven by a strong collections 
performance together with a significantly lower cost base following the wind-down of these operations.

Slovakia and Lithuania
The collect-out of our portfolios in Slovakia and Lithuania was  
more effective than our original expectations and we reported a 
combined profit in 2017 of £3.2 million compared to a loss of 
£7.4 million in 2016. The result for 2017 is £2.2 million lower than we 
reported at the half year reflecting an increase in the expected costs 
of the liquidation of our Slovakia business following a delay in the 
surrender of our operating licence to the National Bank. 
Discontinued operations 
The sale of our home credit business in Bulgaria in June 2017 resulted 
in a one-off accounting charge of £5.7 million which, together with 
the trading loss of £2.7 million generated in 2017, has been 
accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 
5. The 2016 comparatives have been adjusted accordingly.
Reporting segments 
In order to further simplify our financial reporting in alignment with  
our strategy, we have decided to consolidate all our European home 
credit businesses into one reporting segment. Accordingly, in 2018 
our segmented reporting will comprise European home credit, 
Mexico home credit and IPF Digital. 
Outlook
We are focused on serving our customers responsibly within a 
regulatory and competitive landscape that we expect will remain 
challenging. We will continue to improve the sustainability of our 
European home credit businesses by creating more modern, efficient, 
higher credit quality operations that provide a good service to 
customers, and continue to generate the cash and capital to fund 
growth opportunities and returns to shareholders. We expect IPF Digital 
to deliver further strong growth and an improved performance driven 
by increased scale and further enhancements in financial metrics as 
our new markets grow and mature. In Mexico, we expect to return to 
customer growth, expand our geographic footprint and micro-
business channel, and deliver improved operational efficiency in  
our established branches. 26
Operational review continued
Poland
Czech 
Republic
Northern Europe
Our Northern Europe region delivered profit 
before tax of £59.8 million which reflects a 
reduction in like-for-like profit of £24.9 million 
driven primarily by intense competition in the 
Czech Republic and lower pricing introduced 
following the price cap on consumer loans 
which came into force in Poland in March 
2016. In addition, we took the decision to 
increase our credit score cut-off threshold in 
Poland which resulted in a smaller but higher 
quality portfolio. The result for the region was 
offset partly by a £9.1 million benefit from 
stronger FX rates. 
Credit issued for the region reduced by 1% in 2017 with 3% growth in 
Poland and a 16% contraction in the Czech Republic, due mainly to 
intense competition from banks, and payday and digital lenders. 
Average net receivables contracted by 4% reflecting the reduction in 
credit issued in the Czech Republic. The smaller receivables portfolio, 
together with a reduction in revenue yield from 82% to 77%, resulted in 
a 10% contraction in revenue. In Poland, our decision to implement 
increased credit score thresholds combined with price cap driven 
yield compression led to a reduction in revenue. In the Czech 
Republic, reduced revenue arose due to the contraction in the 
receivables book and a reduction in yield as a result of our strategy 
of serving customers with longer-term loans.
We continued to deliver a good collections performance which 
resulted in a 0.3 ppt year-on-year improvement in impairment as a 
percentage of revenue to 22.7%. The cost-income ratio for the region 
increased by 5.0 ppts to 41.8%, which reflected the contraction of 
revenue yields together with higher costs. The cost increase was 
driven by further investment in our Provident-branded digital offering 
in both markets together with higher levels of depreciation and 
increased IT spend largely arising from the rollout of our agent mobile 
technology. 
In the absence of an update from the Polish Ministry of Justice on its 
proposal to further tighten existing cost of credit legislation, we will 
continue to operate in line with our strategy and manage our 
Northern Europe region to deliver a high level of service to our 
customers while optimising returns. We also expect to deliver 
progressive improvements in the cost-income ratio in 2018 as we  
see the benefits of agent mobile technology being used across 
the region.

International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 27
Southern Europe delivered improved profit 
performances in both markets, increasing 
total profit before tax for the region to £54.5 
million driven by good growth in Hungary 
and a significant contribution from debt sale 
profit in Romania. This result reflects like-for-like 
profit growth of £11.1 million and a  
£2.9 million positive impact of FX rates.
Non-banking financial institutions in Romania were required to 
operate under tighter creditworthiness assessment legislation from 
January 2017, and serving customers under this new framework 
resulted, as expected, in a contraction in growth rates in Southern 
Europe. For the region as a whole, credit issued reduced by 6% 
reflecting growth in Hungary offset by a 20% contraction in Romania. 
Average net receivables increased by 9% as a result of our continued 
strategy to offer higher value, longer-term loans in response to 
customer demand. Revenue contracted by 2% due to the lower 
yields earned on this longer-term lending.
We delivered very good collections with a strong, consistent 
performance in Hungary throughout the year and a progressive 
improvement in Romania following a difficult first quarter as we 
transitioned the business to operate under the new regulations.  
In the second half of the year, we also executed a number of 
significant debt sales, principally in Romania, and this contributed 
approximately £11 million to profit growth in the year. We expect 
approximately half of this benefit to recur in 2018 as we move to 
forward flow agreements in both countries. The good collections 
performance together with the debt sale profit delivered an 11.0 ppt 
improvement in impairment as a percentage of revenue to 9.6% at 
the year end.
The cost-income ratio increased by 3.0 ppts to 39.1% which reflects 
higher levels of IT investment to support the digitisation of our 
business together with compression in revenue yields. 
Like Northern Europe, we will continue to focus on transitioning  
our business in Romania to operate within the requirements of the 
National Bank of Romania Special Registry framework and improve 
the efficiency of our operations.

“We delivered good 
credit issued growth, and 
expanded our geographic 
footprint and micro-
business channel despite 
disruption caused by two 
earthquakes. ”
Robert Husband
Country Manager
Mexico
Our business in Mexico delivered a £3.0 million 
improvement in profit before tax to £14.7 
million, despite being impacted by two 
earthquakes in September. This result includes 
a £4.3 million investment in geographic 
expansion and building our micro-business 
channel (2016: £2.5 million). 
Our objective in 2017 was to maintain the growth momentum 
achieved in Q4 2016 (8% annualised). We delivered credit issued 
growth of 19% in the year to August and, notwithstanding the 
disruption caused by the two earthquakes in September (which 
resulted in a contraction of 7% rather than growth), our teams worked 
hard to react to these events and achieved credit issued growth in 
the fourth quarter of 8% and 13% for the year as a whole. We also 
executed our programme of investment in our micro-business 
channel and geographic expansion, opening six new branches in 
the first half of 2017.
This growth delivered an increase in average net receivables of 11% 
and, with revenue yields remaining consistent year-on-year, revenue 
increased at a similar rate. The growth in credit issued was 
accompanied by an improvement in our collections performance 
and impairment as a percentage of revenue improved by 1.7 ppts to 
34.8%. This is higher than our original guidance for 2017 but in line 
with the expectations set out in our Q3 trading update following the 
earthquakes. It also includes £1.5 million of impairment arising from 
our decision to close two branches in the north of Mexico in order to 
focus on improved operational efficiency.
We continued to invest in growth which resulted in an increase in 
other costs of £10.9 million at constant exchange rates (actual: 
£13.7 million). Around half of this investment supported improved 
operating performance in our existing branches with the balance 
invested in our expansion programme and micro-business channel. 
This led to a small increase of 0.8 ppts in the cost-income ratio to 
40.4% for Mexico as a whole. 
There are significant growth opportunities for our home credit business 
in Mexico and we expect to return to customer growth in 2018. We will 
continue to implement our new branch opening programme and 
build our micro-business channel to maximise these opportunities, 
while simultaneously focusing on managing selected established 
branches to deliver improved operational leverage.

issued and good profit growth to £18.5 million,

Demand continued to grow for our credit line and digital instalment 
loans, which drove a 44% increase in credit issued to £230.8 million. 
Average net receivables increased by 73% which resulted in 68% 
revenue growth while impairment as a percentage of revenue 
increased year-on-year by 11.1 ppts to 41.2%. This reflects an 
improved credit performance in our established markets, offset by  
the increased weighting of new markets in our portfolio and the 
inclusion of the benefit of a one-off debt sale in our established 
markets in our 2016 impairment charge. 
As previously guided, we invested an additional £7.0 million in 
building our new markets of Poland, Spain, Australia and Mexico,  
and strengthening our head office capabilities and technology 
platform to deliver future growth. The strong increase in revenue offset 
these additional costs and resulted in a 17.0 ppt reduction in the 
cost-income ratio to 62.0%.

strategies, strong customer relationship management (CRM) 
activities and increased penetration of our credit line product, all of 
which delivered credit issued growth of 20%.

which included a £4.4 million benefit from a one-off debt sale. The 
cost-income ratio improved by 7.7 ppts to 40.9% demonstrating the 
benefits of increased scale and tight cost control, while continuing to 
invest in generating growth. 
New markets
Our new markets delivered another year of strong growth driven by 
Poland and Spain. We accelerated our investment in building 
consumer awareness of our brand and CRM activities, which resulted 
in strong credit issued growth of 105% to £92.1million, and average 
net receivables and revenue growth of over 200%. 
Impairment as a percentage of revenue in these rapidly growing 
markets continues to run at a relatively elevated level reflecting the 
greater mix of new customers who have a higher risk profile, and  
the normal learning curve for managing credit risk in new markets.  
We are continuously refining the credit settings and collections 
processes and, as expected, impairment as a percentage of revenue 
improved to 73.0% at the 2017 year end representing a 10.7 ppt 
improvement since the half year. Other costs increased by 53% to 
£28.9M reflecting increased expenditure on brand building and CRM 
activities. The cost-income ratio improved from 140% in 2016 to 71%  
in 2017, driven by increasing economies of scale.

Outlook
Looking ahead to 2018 for IPF Digital as a whole, we expect to deliver 
continuing strong growth and an improved performance, driven by 
increased scale and further enhancements in impairment and 
cost-efficiency trends as our new markets grow and mature. Our 
previous guidance, based on accounting standard IAS39, was that 
we expected IPF Digital to deliver its maiden profit in 2018. Under the 
new accounting standard IFRS 9, the timing of impairment and 
therefore profit recognition, particularly in our new markets which are 
growing strongly, will be negatively impacted. Further information on 
IFRS 9 can be read in the financial review on page 33.

Financial strategy and financial model
We aim to deliver long-term profitable growth and deploy capital 
efficiently, in order to develop and run high-return businesses which 
provide good returns to shareholders while maintaining a strong 
financial profile. We have a good track record of doing this, even 
during periods of macroeconomic and financial market volatility, 
as well as periods of competitive and regulatory change for 
our business.
We adopt a Group financial model which sets key aligned 
financial parameters. This focuses on returns and capital; financial 
profile; and balancing investment, growth and risk. Over the 
medium term, we aim to achieve a good return on the capital 
invested in receivables for each of our businesses, recognising their 
different stages of development and investment profile, and pay 
an appropriate level of dividends to shareholders. We continue to 
maintain a strong balance sheet with appropriate capital supporting 
receivables, and have a strong debt funding position with good 
headroom on debt facilities and on debt covenants. We ensure that 
we have adequate equity capital and debt funding to support future 
growth and to withstand external shocks if they arise, enabling us to 
achieve good returns within the financial parameters.
Our businesses are at different stages of development. The European 
home credit businesses are cash and capital generative and provide 
attractive returns. Our IPF Digital and Mexico home credit businesses 
are growing strongly and we continue to invest in them to further 
build returns over the medium term. The strong capital generation of 
the European home credit businesses provides significant capital for 
our IPF Digital and Mexico home credit businesses, in addition to any 
capital generated by those growth businesses themselves.
We have a strong balance sheet, funding position and robust 
financial risk management. We operate with a target equity to 
receivables capital ratio of around 40%. To maintain the credit quality 
of lending, we target an impairment to revenue range of 25-30% and 
at Group level we have always operated within or just below this 
range. Our debt funding strategy provides a resilient funding position 
for the existing business and for future growth, through a diversified 
debt portfolio of bond and bank facilities including significant 
long-term funding. By maintaining our strong financial profile, we are 
able to operate with significant headroom on the financial covenants 
in our debt facilities. Our strong balance sheet and funding position 
also give us significant resilience to counter external factors including 
taxation challenges and regulatory turbulence.

Returns
As a Group, we aim to deliver long-term profitable growth, good 
returns for shareholders, and the efficient deployment of capital 
generated to support growth and pay dividends.
We believe that the return on assets (ROA) metric is a good measure 
of financial performance of our businesses, showing the ongoing 
return on the total equity and debt capital invested in the receivables 
book for those businesses, and for the Group. In addition, we believe 
that the Group return on equity (ROE) metric is a good measure of 
overall returns for shareholders.
The table below shows the ROA for our European home credit, IPF 
Digital and Mexico home credit businesses, and for the Group as a 
whole. ROA is measured as profit before interest, after tax, divided by 
the average receivables during the period.
We would expect to earn higher returns on our European home 
credit businesses, and lower but growing returns on the IPF Digital 
and Mexico home credit growth businesses. It is expected that these 
growth businesses will deliver improved returns over the medium term 
and, notwithstanding any other changes, the overall Group ROA will 
reflect this dynamic.

Return on equity from continuing operations
Return on equity for the Group is measured as profit after pre-
exceptional tax divided by average equity.
ROE reduced from 18.8% in 2016 to 15.7% in 2017 which reflects the 
fact that average equity has increased at a faster rate than pre-
exceptional post tax earnings. The increase in pre-exceptional post 
tax earnings was driven by growth in profit before tax partially offset 
by the impact of a 3.2% increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 
whereas, the increase in equity was driven predominately by the 
foreign exchange impact on reserves explained later in this report.

In 2017, ROA in our ongoing European home credit business reduced 
from 18.2% to 16.2% which reflects a reduction in like-for-like profit in 
Northern Europe partially offset by an improvement in Southern 
Europe, with the investment in average net receivables remaining 
broadly flat. We reported marginally improved returns in Mexico 
reflecting an increase in profit that was slightly higher than the 
increase in receivables. IPF Digital delivered a negative ROA in both 
years due to the investment in new markets and building functional 
capability to support growth, and in 2017 we reported a reduction in 
the negative return reflecting the improving return dynamics of the 
business. In addition, ROA in 2017 in all segments was adversely 
impacted by a 3.2% increase in the effective tax rate, excluding 
exceptional items (2017: 29.0%; 2016:25.8%). The overall Group ROA 
contracted by 0.8 ppts which was driven by the moderation of 
returns from European home credit, an increase in the scale of IPF 
Digital in the context of the Group and the higher effective tax rate.
Capital generation
Strong capital generation is a key feature of our business, providing 
capital for the continuing growth of the business and dividends to 
shareholders, while maintaining our strong financial profile.
The table below shows capital generated by our home credit 
businesses, and the net capital investment in IPF Digital, along with 
dividends declared. We fund our receivables book with 
approximately 40% equity and 60% debt. Capital generated is 
calculated as profit after tax, after assuming that 60% of the growth  
in receivables is funded with debt and 40% with equity.
Capital generated before investing in receivables growth was 
£75.0 million in 2017 increasing from £71.2 million in 2016. 
£49.9 million of this was used to invest in receivables growth (at 40% 
equity funding for receivables). The European home credit business 
generated £63.1 million of capital in 2017 (2016: £56.2 million),  
and Mexico home credit generated £9.0 million (2016: £6.2 million). 
There was a £38.8 million investment of capital in IPF Digital 
(2016: £33.9 million). The other balance comprises the net of  
central costs, and Slovakia and Lithuania.

Earnings per share from continuing operations
Earnings per share based on a pre-exceptional tax charge was  
33.7 pence in 2017 compared with 32.2 pence in 2016 reflecting the 
increase in profitability, partially offset by the higher effective tax rate.
Dividend 
Subject to shareholder approval, a final dividend of 7.8 pence per 
share will be payable, which will bring the full-year dividend to 12.4 
pence per share (2016: 12.4 pence per share). The full-year dividend 
of 12.4 pence per share represents a total payment equivalent to 
approximately 61.3% of post-tax earnings from continuing operations 
for 2017. As a percentage of pre-exceptional profit after tax from 
continuing operations for 2017, it equates to a pay-out ratio of 
approximately 36.8%, which is modestly above our target pay-out rate 
of 35%. The final dividend will be paid on 11 May 2018 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 13 April 2018. The shares  
will be marked ex-dividend on 12 April 2018. 
Financial profile
We aim to maintain a strong financial profile with a robust balance 
sheet and funding position. The target equity to receivables capital 
ratio of 40% balances having sufficient capital to withstand external 
shocks including macroeconomic, regulatory, and tax factors, while 
providing good returns on equity to shareholders. At times, we may 
choose to hold equity higher than the target level to support future 
growth and to ensure a continuing strong financial profile. 
At December 2017, the equity to receivables ratio was 47.0 % 
(2016: 45.7%) compared with our target level of 40%, meaning equity 
capital was £74 million above the target level. Equity reflects a 
£51.3 million positive currency movement and an exceptional tax 
charge of £30.0 million in respect of deferred tax. While the capital 
ratio is substantially higher than the target level, we are comfortable 
with this, to ensure sufficient capital for growth while maintaining the 
resilience of the balance sheet given the regulatory and tax 
challenges that the Group faces. Gearing was 1.4x at December 
2017 (2016: 1.5x), well within the covenant level of 3.75x maximum  
in our debt facilities.
Our target range of impairment to revenue of 25% to 30% means  
that we maintain credit quality throughout an economic cycle, and 
the Group has always operated within or just below this range since 
demerger in 2007, even during the global financial crisis of 2009.  
Our shorter-term lending provides significant flexibility to adjust credit 
parameters as macroeconomic conditions change. 
Group impairment as a percentage of revenue at 24.4% in 2017 was 
slightly below the target range. The average period of receivables 
outstanding at December 2017 was 9.1 months (2016: 7.8 months) 
with 82.0% of year-end receivables due within one year (2016: 86.0%). 
The average period of receivables outstanding has increased as  
a result of issuing longer-term loans in our European home credit  
and IPF Digital businesses. Closing receivables in 2017 were 
£1,056.9 million, which is £61.8 million (6%) higher than 2016 in 
constant currency terms reflecting the growth in the business.
We operate a prudent, objective and centrally controlled impairment 
provisioning system in both our home credit and IPF Digital 
businesses that has the following key attributes, as detailed in the 
following table:
Assessment 
period
Home credit 
Weekly and monthly
Digital
Monthly
Impairment  
trigger
Missed payment or part  
of a missed payment, even  
if the agent fails to visit 
the customer.
Default point when the 
debt is passed to a 
third-party collection 
agency . This averages 
around 60 days past 
due across IPF Digital.  
An incurred but not 
reported provision is 
held for receivables 
pre-default. This is 
calculated based on 
probability of 
default factors.
Segmentation 
of receivables
Any missed payment or 
portion of payment, even  
if the agent fails to visit a 
customer, with the  
exception of the first four 
weeks for a new customer 
 to allow repayment patterns 
to be established.
Debt is segmented 
based on the number 
of days past due and 
provision is based on 
expected loss of 
each segment.
Provisioning Provision percentages for 
each arrears stage have 
been derived using statistical 
modelling of past customer 
performance that estimates 
the amount and timing of 
cash flows.
The provision 
percentage is based  
on probability of default 
and loss given default 
factors. This calculation  
is updated quarterly.
IFRS 9 
IFRS 9 is a new accounting standard that addresses accounting for 
financial instruments with the main impact on the Group being a 
change to the methodology used to account for loans due from 
customers. The key change compared to the old accounting 
standard is a shift from incurred loss to expected loss impairment 
accounting. Under IFRS 9, the Group will be required to record 
impairment charges at the inception of a loan based on the losses 
that are expected to be incurred and this will result in negative net 
revenue at the start of a loan. The new standard became effective 
from 1 January 2018.
The overall impact of the new standard will be a reduction in the 
carrying value of receivables on the balance sheet and our 
preliminary assessment is that it will have an impact of between 11% 
and 13%. The day one impact of this adjustment will be charged to 
equity. After this adjustment to receivables, IFRS 9 would have no 
impact on net revenue generation if a receivables book is stable 
both in terms of size and quality. This is because for every new loan 
issued where impairment is booked on origination, there is another 
older loan where net revenue is higher than under the current 
accounting standard. However, if a receivables book is growing, profit 
will be lower under IFRS 9 because impairment booked at origination 
is larger than the benefit arising from higher net revenue on older 
agreements. In contrast, if the receivables book is contracting, profit 
will be higher under IFRS 9 because the early impairment booked at 
origination is offset by higher net revenue on the older agreements.  34
Under IFRS 9, our preliminary assessment is that profit in 2017 would 
have been around 6% to 8% lower than under the current 
accounting standard which is principally due to lower net revenue 
generation in IPF Digital and our Mexican home credit business, 
where receivables portfolios are growing.
The financial covenants on our debt funding facilities are based on 
the current accounting standard and therefore are not impacted by 
this change. 
IFRS 9 is an accounting change that has no impact on the business 
model, credit quality, cash flows and economic value or returns.
Further information on IFRS 9 can be found in the accounting policies 
on pages 99 to 100. 
Treasury risk management and funding
There are Board-approved policies to address the key treasury risks 
that the business faces – funding and liquidity risk, financial market 
risk (currency and interest rate risk), and counterparty risk. The policies 
are designed to provide robust risk management, even in more 
volatile financial markets and economic conditions within our 
planning horizon.
Our funding policy requires us to maintain a resilient funding position 
for the existing business and for future growth in each market. We aim 
to maintain a prudent level of headroom on undrawn bank facilities. 
Our currency policy addresses economic currency exposures and 
requires us to fund our currency receivables with currency borrowings 
(directly or indirectly) to achieve a high level of balance sheet 
hedging. We choose not to hedge the translational risk of foreign 
currency movements on accounting profits and losses. Our interest 
rate policy requires us to hedge interest rate risk in each currency  
to a relatively high level. Our counterparty policy requires exposures 
to financial counterparties to be limited to single A-rated entities, 
except as approved by the Board. In addition to these policies, our 
operational procedures and controls ensure that funds are available 
in the right currency at the right time to serve our customers 
throughout the Group.
Debt funding is provided through a diversified debt portfolio at 
competitive cost with appropriate terms and conditions. We have  
a range of bonds across a number of currencies, wholesale and 
retail, with varying maturities including significant long-term funding, 
together with facilities from a core group of banks with a good 
strategic and geographic fit with our business. IPF’s debt is senior 
unsecured debt, with all lenders substantially in the same structural 
position. We maintain our Euro Medium Term Note programme as  
the main platform for bond issuance across a range of currencies.  
In addition, a Polish Medium Term Note programme has been  
used for bond issuance in the Polish market. This achieves further 
diversification and reinforces our corporate position in that market.
Our debt funding strategy has been successful over a number of 
years, and we have a consistent record of accessing debt markets 
throughout the economic cycle.
In 2017 we added £53.0 million of new and increased three  
year bank funding, including increased commitments in Poland  
and Hungary, and two new banks. Also, we issued €12 million  
(£10.7) million of new bonds as a tap of our existing 2021 bonds,  
and at the same time bought back €11.75 million (£10.5 million)  
of our 2018 bonds. In addition the funding position in 2017 benefited 
from the strong cash collection in Slovakia and Lithuania. 
Our debt funding position is summarised in the table below.  
At December 2017 we had total debt facilities of £867.0 million 
(£593.2 million bonds and £273.8 million bank facilities) and 
borrowings of £677.7 million with headroom on undrawn debt 
facilities of £189.3 million. In January 2018, we repaid £11.5 million 
Hungarian bonds. We have further bond maturities in 2018 of 
£25.3 million in May and £28.3 million in November and December. 
We have significant long-term funding, with over £500 million of bonds 
in place until 2020/21. The vast majority of bank facilities are 
extended on a rolling basis annually.

The currency structure of our debt facilities matches the asset and 
cash flow profile of our business. We have local currency bank 
facilities and bonds, and our main €412 million (£368.4 million) 
Eurobond provides direct funding to our markets using the Euro 
currency, and to markets using other currencies via foreign exchange 
transactions. Therefore, we do not expect fluctuations in the value of 
sterling to have a major impact on our funding position. 
By maintaining a strong financial profile, we operate with significant 
headroom on the financial covenants in our debt facilities, as set out 
in the table below.

Foreign exchange input on reserves
The majority of the Group’s net assets are denominated in our 
operating currencies and, therefore, the sterling value fluctuates  
with changes in currency exchange rates. In accordance with 
accounting standards, we have restated the opening foreign 
currency net assets at the year-end exchange rate and this resulted 
in a £51.3 million foreign exchange movement, which has been 
credited to the foreign exchange reserve. 
Taxation
The taxation charge for the year on statutory pre-tax profit from 
continuing operations excluding exceptional items was £30.6 million 
(2016: £24.8 million) which equates to an effective rate of 29.0% 
(2016: 25.8%). This excludes a £30.0 million one-off tax charge arising  
in respect of a change of tax law in Poland, which is further explained 
below and including this item the tax charge was £60.6 million, which 
equates to an adjusted effective tax rate of 57.4%. It also excludes a 
£0.5 million tax charge in respect of our Bulgarian operation, which  
was disposed of during 2017 and which is reported as a loss on 
discontinued operations. The effective tax rate for 2018 is expected to  
be in the region of 33% to 35% which assumes the impact of changes 
to our business operations in Poland that we are currently evaluating 
following the change in tax legislation on 1 January 2018.
As previously reported, our home credit business in Poland appealed 
decisions received in January 2017 from the Polish Tax Chamber (the 
upper tier of the Polish tax authority) with respect to the 2008 and 
2009 financial years. The decisions for both years involve a transfer 
pricing challenge relating to an intra-group arrangement with a UK 
entity, together with a challenge to the timing of taxation of home 
collection fee revenues. In order to appeal these decisions, with 
which we strongly disagree, it was necessary to pay the amounts 
assessed. The payment is not a reflection of our view on the merits of 
the case and, accordingly, it has been recognised as a non-current 
financial asset of £37 million (comprising tax and associated interest) 
in our Group accounts. At the time of our original announcement in 
January 2017, we said that we intended to initiate a process with the 
UK tax authority aimed at ensuring that the intra-group arrangement 
is taxed in accordance with international tax principles. This has now 
been initiated and, in response, the Polish court has stayed the 
hearings of the 2008 and 2009 appeals pending resolution of this 
process. The 2010 and 2011 financial years are being audited by the 
tax authorities in Poland currently. In the event that the Polish tax 
authority were to issue decisions following the same reasoning as the 
decisions for 2008 and 2009 we would need to pay c. £44 million in 
order to appeal the cases. All subsequent financial years remain 
open to future audit. 
As indicated in our statement of 4 October 2017, a comprehensive 
set of proposed changes to Polish corporate income tax was 
approved by the Polish Government's Council of Ministers. This came 
into force on 1 January 2018. The main impact for our business relates 
to the tax deductibility of certain expenses linked to intra-group 
transactions. Due to the absence of adequate transitional provisions in 
the new law, payments made prior to 1 January 2018 under long-
standing arrangements have become tax ineffective. Historically , these 
amounts have been treated as giving rise to a deferred tax asset, which 
has now been written off. The overall impact of this is a one-off deferred 
tax charge of £30 million in 2017, which has been treated as an 
exceptional tax expense in the 2017 accounts.

Going concern
The Board has reviewed the budget for the year to 31 December 2018 
and the forecasts for the two years to 31 December 2020, which 
include projected profits, cash flows, borrowings, headroom against 
debt facilities, and funding requirement. The Group’s total debt 
facilities including a range of bonds and bank facilities, combined 
with a successful track record of accessing debt funding markets 
over a long period (including periods of adverse macroeconomic 
conditions and a changing competitive and regulatory environment) 
is sufficient to fund business requirements for the foreseeable future. 
Taking these factors into account, together with regulatory and 
taxation risks set out on pages 39 and 40, the Board has a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operation for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Board has 
adopted the going concern basis in preparing this annual report.

Principal risks and uncertainties
CEO Gerard Ryan reviews 
risk management
“Our risk management process is 
designed to support the execution  
of our strategy, improve decision- 
making and deliver on the 
commitments made to our key 
stakeholders. ”
Gerard Ryan
Chief Executive Officer
Q. What were the key risk focus areas in 2017?
We continued to operate within a challenging external environment. 
During 2017, regulatory risk remained a priority for our Board and 
management teams, as did competition, tax and technology. 
Changes to consumer lending regulations in Romania impacted 
how we serve customers in that market, we await an update on the 
Polish Ministry of Justice’s rate cap proposals and we were focused 
on the taxation risk in Poland. Details of these matters are outlined in 
my CEO review on pages 15. 
Q. Did the principal risks change in 2017?
Yes. As the implementation of our strategy relies more on technology 
we now consider the development and maintenance of effective 
technology solutions as one of our principal risks. During the year,  
we also split the review of the Legal and Regulatory risk into three 
categories – Legal and Regulatory Compliance, Legal and 
Regulatory Challenges and Issues, and Future Legal and Regulatory 
Developments. This decision was taken in order to better manage 
internally- driven compliance risk separately from the external risk of 
potential challenge to our interpretation or application of existing 
laws and regulations, or potential changes to laws and regulations.
Q. Looking ahead, what are the key risks in 2018?
We expect regulation, competition, tax and technology to be a key 
focus for the Board and senior management team in the year ahead 
although all of our principal risks will be monitored and managed 
closely. These risks are included on pages 38 to 43.
Q. How are risks identified at IPF? Did this change 
in 2017?
We identify emerging risks and manage current issues as part of 
day-to-day business management, and this is undertaken through 
monitoring the external environment and discussions with internal 
management and external agencies. Formal risk management 
discussions occur in line with the management framework set out  
on page 37.
Risk management is integral to the Group’s 
strategy and the achievement of our long-
term goals. Our risk management activities 
are undertaken within a framework that is 
tailored to IPF and ensures we have robust 
processes in place to allow management 
to identify, evaluate, manage and report on 
the principal risks that could affect 
the Group.
For our governance and oversight structure 
go online to www.ipfin.co.uk Strategic Report
International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 37
Internally, we are enhancing the risk management process across 
our business, maintaining emphasis on the ability to identify and 
evaluate emerging risks. This includes the implementation of a new 
risk reporting and evaluation tool across the Group. The Internal Audit 
function has also continued to monitor the effectiveness of the overall 
operational governance and oversight structure.
Q. How is risk evaluated at IPF?
We evaluate each risk that could impact the business at least 
quarterly and this is based on the likelihood and potential financial 
impact of that risk at both market and Group level. We consider 
two aspects:
• inherent risk – the impact of the risk before internal controls or 
mitigating actions; and
• residual risk – the risk that remains after the effect of mitigating 
actions and controls are considered. 
Using this assessment, we identify the principal risks and determine 
whether further actions are required to mitigate the risk to within our 
agreed risk appetite levels. 
This process also identifies risks that have a high reliance on the 
effective operation of our internal control system which, in turn, guides 
the planning of our internal audit team’s work.
Q. How is risk managed at IPF?
Effective management of risks, uncertainties and opportunities is 
critical to our business in order to deliver long-term shareholder value, 
and to protect our people, assets and reputation. The principal risks  
to our strategy are identified, evaluated and managed at Group level 
in accordance with our operational governance and oversight 
structure, which can be viewed at www.ipfin.co.uk. We operate similar 
structures in each of our home credit markets and IPF Digital. A 
bottom-up assessment of principal risks by our business unit teams  
is aggregated for their Group-level owners and then validated to 
produce an overall assessment of those risks.
Q. How do you determine risk appetite and did it 
change in 2017?
Group risk appetite is proposed by the risk owners, reviewed by the 
Risk Advisory Group and approved by the Board on an annual basis. 
Action plans are created in cases where residual risk is in excess of 
this appetite and progress against these is monitored by the Board  
at each meeting. 
The setting of appetite includes consideration of the external 
environment impacting the risk, driven largely by the markets in  
which we operate, and the extent to which this can be managed  
or influenced. We accept that the nature of our operating model  
and the external environment in the markets in which we operate 
generates risk and this needs to be balanced to optimise returns.  
Our appetite for risks which can be mitigated largely by our internal 
control system is low.
Our risk appetite remained broadly unchanged in 2017.
The Board determines the nature and extent of the principal risks it 
is willing to take in achieving our strategic objectives (as described 
on pages 12 and 13) and target business model (as described on 
pages 8 and 9), taking account also of the environment in which 
the Group operates. The Board approves the principal risks as 
described in the Group Schedule of Key Risks on a six-monthly 
basis and approves risk appetite annually.
The management team is responsible for day-to-day risk 
management and internal control systems. Risk identification, 
evaluation and management processes form an integral part 
of business processes. Control and oversight activities are 
identified for all risks in the Group Schedule of Key Risks.
The Risk Advisory Group comprises the senior leadership team. 
It supports the Audit and Risk Committee by reviewing the level 
of risk exposure facing the Group against risk appetite, to 
ensure that the Group’s risk-taking and response are 
appropriate. It meets four times each year.
First line: 
Business-level management identifies, assesses and controls risks 
principally at market level and also within major projects and 
change initiatives.
Second line: 
Group-level management risk owners provide oversight on the 
effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems.
Third line: 
Internal Audit reviews the operation and oversight to the systems of 
internal control, including risk management. The Head of Internal Audit 
reports directly to the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee.

Our framework for the identification, evaluation and 
management of our principal risks
On behalf of the Board, the Committee reviews the Group’s 
processes for the management of the principal risks and its 
systems of internal control. The Committee receives and 
challenges the Group Schedule of Key Risks together with 
regular reports and presentations on the effectiveness of the 
control environment. It has confirmed the adequacy of the 
actions being taken by management to manage risks to 
within risk appetite levels. The Committee undertakes a robust 
assessment of the Group Schedule of Key Risks on a six-
monthly basis. See page 53 for Committee membership 
and remit. 38

1. Regulatory
We suffer losses or fail to 
optimise profitable growth 
due to a failure to operate in 
compliance with, or 
effectively anticipate 
changes in, all applicable 
laws and regulations, or due 
to a regulator interpreting 
these in a different way.
Objective
We aim to ensure that 
effective arrangements are in 
place to enable us to comply 
with legal and regulatory 
obligations and take 
assessed and fully informed 
commercial risks.
  
Changes in regulation, 
differences in interpretation or 
clarification/enforcement of 
laws not previously enforced by 
courts and other bodies can 
lead to challenge of our 
products/practices.
We must monitor legal and 
regulatory developments to 
ensure we maintain 
compliance, remain 
competitive and provide value 
for our customers.
Likelihood
The frequency of legal and 
regulatory change and the 
likelihood of challenge vary  
by market. In 2017, notable 
changes occurred in Romania.
We also expect pricing 
regulations to be implemented 
at some point in the future in 
those markets where there are 
no price caps currently. 
We have highly skilled and 
experienced legal and public 
affairs teams at Group level 
and in each of our markets.
Expert third-party advisors are 
used where necessary.
Strong relationships are 
established and maintained 
with regulators, legislators 
and other stakeholders.  
The strategy of strengthening 
relevant associations 
contributes to the monitoring, 
as well as to the 
influencing capabilities.
Co-ordinated legal and 
public affairs teams, at  
a Group level and in  
each market, monitor 
political, legislative and 
regulatory developments.
Compliance programme 
focused on key 
consumer legislation.
 
Lead responsibility:  
Chief Executive Officer
See Chief Executive Officer’s review 
and operational review for details of 
key regulatory changes in 2017 and 
proposals for future regulation.
A number of legislative and 
regulatory changes have been 
implemented in 2017 and further 
potential changes continue to be 
proposed and debated, particularly 
in Europe. As stated elsewhere in this 
report, these have had a significant 
impact on our business in Romania 
in particular this year, and there 
continues to be the potential for a 
significant impact on our business 
in Poland.
We continued to evolve and 
strengthen our approach to 
governing this risk focusing on 
establishing and maintaining 
constructive relationships with 
regulators, politicians and other 
stakeholders, participating in sector 
associations and informing our 
stakeholders about the role our 
services play in society and 
the economy.
2. Competition 
and product  
proposition 
We suffer losses or fail to 
optimise profitable growth 
through not responding to 
the competitive environment 
or failing to ensure our 
proposition meets 
customer needs.
Objective
We aim to ensure we 
understand competitive 
threats and deliver customer 
– focused products to 
drive growth.
  
In an environment of increasing 
competition and broadening 
customer choice, ensuring our 
product meets customers’ 
needs is critical to 
delivering growth.
Likelihood
Competition varies by market 
and is likely to remain at a high 
level, particularly in Europe. 
Regular monitoring of 
competitors and their 
offerings, advertising and 
share of voice in our markets.
Regular surveys of  
customer views on our 
product offerings.
Product development 
committees established 
across the Group to manage 
product change and 
introduce new products.
Lead responsibility:  
Chief Executive Officer
In Europe, competition in 2017 
remained intense particularly  
from digital lenders, home credit 
operators and banks as they 
enhanced their customer 
propositions. In Mexico  
competition is stable and digital 
lending remains small-scale. 
IPF Digital continued to grow strongly 
in 2017 and diversification into digital 
lending enables us to offer further 
product choices to customers in our 
target segment. 
In 2017, we launched a number of 
pricing promotions in our European 
home credit markets to acquire new, 
and retain existing, customers.

3. T axation
We suffer additional taxation or 
financial penalties associated 
with failure to comply with tax 
legislation or adopting an 
interpretation of the law that 
cannot be sustained.
Objective
We aim to generate shareholder 
value through effective 
management of tax while acting 
as a good corporate citizen. We 
are committed to ensuring 
compliance with tax law and 
practice in all of the territories in 
which we operate.
  
Against a backdrop of 
increasing fiscal challenges  
for most economies, many 
authorities are turning to 
corporate taxpayers to 
increase revenues, either  
via taxation reforms  
or through changes  
to interpretations of 
existing legislation.
Likelihood
The likelihood of changes or 
challenges arising from tax 
legislation varies by market. 
Globally, OECD and EU-led 
developments may lead to  
an increase in transfer 
pricing audits.
Binding rulings or clearances 
obtained from authorities 
where appropriate.
External advisors used for all 
material tax transactions.
Qualified and experienced  
tax teams at Group level and 
in-market.
Lead responsibility:  
Chief Financial Officer
Further detail on tax matters is 
included in the Chief Executive 
Officer's review on pages 14 to 
17 and the financial review on 
pages 31 to 35.
We have ongoing tax audits in 
Poland, Mexico and Slovakia.  
In Poland, where we appealed 
two adverse decisions made by 
the Polish tax authority in respect 
of 2008 and 2009, hearings have 
been stayed pending resolution 
of a process with the UK tax 
authority aimed at ensuring  
the intra-group arrangement 
being challenged is taxed in 
accordance with international 
tax principles. In order to appeal 
these decisions, we had to pay 
c. £37 million in tax and interest, 
and further payments could  
be required in respect of future 
years that are still open to audit, 
including 2010 and 2011  
where audits are ongoing. All 
subsequent years remain open 
to audit. For further information 
see pages 35, 118 and 132.
4. T echnology and 
change management 
We suffer losses or fail to optimise 
profitable growth due to a failure 
to develop and maintain effective 
technology solutions or manage 
change in an effective manner.
Objective
We aim to effectively manage the 
design, delivery and benefits 
realisation of major technology 
and change initiatives and 
deliver according to requirements, 
budgets and timescales.
  
A core part of our strategy is to 
modernise our home credit 
operation and invest in digital 
developments. 
Effective management of the 
initiatives within this 
programme is essential.
Likelihood
Our change programme is 
complex covering numerous 
markets. By centralising our  
IT resources into an expanded 
Group IT structure and 
strengthening our programme 
management capabilities  
we are better placed to 
minimise the likelihood of 
programme-wide issues. 
Executive director and country 
manager level prioritisation of 
key initiatives.
Standard project  
management methodology 
principles defined.
Governance structure in place 
to oversee ongoing change  
at Group and market levels, 
and review existing 
systems architecture.
Lead responsibility:  
Chief Executive Officer
Our change programme 
encompasses a broad 
technological remit and  
we are rolling out mobile 
technology applications 
to agents.
A revised IT strategy was 
launched in 2016 to ensure we 
are able to respond effectively  
to changing regulatory, 
competitor and customer 
behaviour dynamics. Strategic Report

5. People
Our strategy is impacted by not 
having sufficient depth and 
quality of people or being 
unable to retain key people 
and treat them in accordance 
with our values and 
ethical standards.
Objective
We aim to have sufficient 
breadth of capabilities and 
depth of personnel to ensure 
that we can meet our 
strategic objectives.
  
Our strategy segments our 
operations into 'growth’ focused 
and ‘returns’ focused 
businesses to reflect the fact 
that they are at different stages 
of maturity. In order to achieve 
our goals, we must continue to 
attract, engage, retain and 
reward the right people.
Likelihood
Our people, organisation and 
planning processes ensure that 
we develop appropriate and 
significant strength and depth 
of talent across the Group and 
we have the ability to move 
people between markets, 
which reduces our exposure  
to critical roles being under-
resourced. During 2018, we will 
continue to develop, resource, 
retain and reward the 
right people.
Strategic people review 
processes (people and 
organisational planning) 
operate throughout the Group.
Group-wide personal 
development review process 
and continuous development 
through targeted 
leadership programmes.
Periodic employee and agent 
engagement surveys and 
improvement plans.
Focus on HR governance and 
maintenance of our employer 
value proposition across 
the Group.
Plan to introduce specific HR 
performance metrics in 2018.
Lead responsibility:  
Chief Executive Officer
Our people strategy focuses on 
building and maintaining a 
culture of high engagement 
and performance and we 
devote significant leadership 
time to identifying, developing 
and empowering our people.
We made structural changes  
in our European home credit 
business with the creation of  
the Northern Europe region  
and introduced a Group-wide 
functional matrix structure. These 
changes are further facilitating 
the sharing of best practice 
and collaboration.
We strengthened our Group-
level leadership team with the 
appointment of a new Group HR 
Director and Chief Legal Officer. 
6. Business 
continuity 
and information  
security
We suffer losses or fail to 
optimise profitable growth due 
to a failure of our systems, 
suppliers or processes or due to 
the loss, theft or corruption 
of information.
Objective
We aim to maintain adequate 
arrangements and controls that 
reduce the threat of service 
and business disruption and 
the risk of data loss to as low as 
is reasonably  
practicable.
  
Globally, we have 2.3 million 
customers and we record, 
update and maintain data for 
each of them on a regular 
basis, often weekly.
The availability of this data, and 
the continued operation of our 
systems and processes, is 
essential to the effective 
operation of our business and 
the security of our customer  
information.
Likelihood
While the external threat to our 
systems is increasing in the 
digital age, the tools in place 
reduce the likelihood of a 
significant failure or 
information loss.
Technology systems and 
services are designed for 
resilience and tested 
before launch.
Periodic ongoing testing and 
monitoring of security and 
recovery capability for 
technology and premises.
Lead responsibility:  
Chief Executive Officer
During 2017, we performed a 
number of tests of our 
information security and 
continue to work towards further 
improvement using expert  
advice.
In addition to periodic testing of 
technology, we perform regular 
tests and rehearsals of our 
communication processes and 
our plans for alternative 
worksites, where applicable.
We are working to ensure 
compliance in all our European 
markets with the new General 
Data Protection Regulation, 
which will be introduced 
25 May 2018.

7. Reputation 
We suffer financial or 
reputational damage due  
to our methods of operation, 
ill-informed comment 
or malpractice.
Objective
We aim to promote a positive 
reputation based on a mutual 
understanding of what we do 
that will help the Group deliver 
its strategic aims.
  
Our reputation can have an 
impact on both customer 
sentiment and the 
engagement of key 
stakeholders, impacting our 
ability to operate and serve our 
customer segment.
Likelihood
We maintain strong 
relationships with key 
stakeholders across the Group 
in order to develop their 
understanding of our business 
model and how we deliver 
services to our customers. This 
helps protect the business from 
unforeseen events that could 
damage our reputation.
Group Reputation and 
Regulation Committee.
Clearly defined corporate 
values and ethical standards 
are communicated throughout 
the organisation and all 
employees and agents are 
mandated to undertake 
annual ethics e-learning.
Regular monitoring of key 
reputation drivers.
Lead responsibility:  
Chief Executive Officer
Our home credit and digital 
businesses have achieved 
industry awards for the way we 
conduct our business and we 
have been recognised as a top 
employer and socially 
responsible business. We also 
undertake a range of corporate 
responsibility programmes. We 
take a proactive approach to 
reputation management and 
update the market on material 
challenges that we are required 
to disclose.
8. World economic  
environment
We suffer financial loss 
as a result of a failure 
to identify and adapt 
to changing economic 
conditions adequately.
Objective
We aim to have 
business processes 
that allow us to respond 
to changes in economic 
conditions and optimise 
business performance.
  
Changes in economic 
conditions have a direct 
impact on our customers’ 
ability to make repayments.
Likelihood
While we operate in numerous 
markets, the likelihood of a 
change in economic markets 
that we are unable to respond 
to, and that impacts our 
strategy, is minimised by our 
short-term lending business 
models. 
Treasury and credit committees 
review economic indicators.
Monitoring of economic, 
political and national 
news briefings.
Strong, personal customer 
relationships inform us of 
individual customer  
circumstances.
Lead responsibility:  
Chief Financial Officer
There were reasonably stable 
macroeconomic conditions in 
all our markets in 2017. Current 
indicators suggest our markets 
will deliver positive GDP growth, 
low but increasing inflation and 
subdued interest rates in 2018. 
We continue to monitor the 
impact of Brexit and other 
geopolitical events on financial 
markets and macroeconomic  
conditions.
9. Safety 
The risk of personal accident to, 
or assault on, our agents 
or employees.
Objective
We aim to maintain adequate 
arrangements that reduce the 
risks to as low as is reasonably  
practicable.
 
A significant element of our 
business model involves our 
agents and employees 
interacting with our customers 
in their homes or travelling to 
numerous locations daily. Their 
safety is paramount to us.
Likelihood
The likelihood of an individual 
incident depends on many 
factors, including the local 
environment. We strive to ensure 
that our agents and employees 
can carry out their work without 
risk of harm.
Group and market committees 
and annual safety survey.
Bi-annual risk mapping for 
each agency including 
mitigation planning and field 
safety training.
Annual self-certification 
of safety compliance by  
managers.
Quarterly branch 
safety meetings.
Role-specific training and 
competence matrix.
Safety management systems 
based on internationally 
recognised standards.
Lead responsibility:  
Chief Executive Officer
We continued to make progress 
in our safety management 
systems and maintained our 
Occupational Health and Safety 
Assessment Series (OHSAS) 
certification in all home 
credit businesses.
Safety continues to be a 
significant area of focus for 
the Group.

10. Credit 
The risk of the Group suffering 
financial loss if its customers fail 
to meet their contracted  
obligations.
Objective
We aim to maintain credit  
and collections policies  
and regularly monitor 
credit performance.
  
With the expansion of our IPF 
Digital and Mexico home credit 
businesses, it is important that 
we retain control of credit losses 
in order to achieve our 
intended returns. For the 
European home credit 
businesses we focus on writing 
profitable business to 
optimise returns.
Likelihood
Our control environment 
means that we will see issues 
quickly and the systems in 
place mean that we can 
change credit settings quickly, 
and therefore the likelihood of 
suffering large losses is low.
Weekly credit reporting on the 
quality of business at time of 
issue as well as the overall 
portfolio. This feeds into weekly 
performance calls between 
each business and the Group 
credit director. In addition, there 
are monthly local credit 
committees, a monthly Group 
credit committee and monthly 
performance calls between 
each business and the Group 
management team.
When a new change is 
introduced, the credit systems 
allow for a testing approach 
that gives direct comparison of 
the current ‘champion’ regime 
against the new ‘challenger’.
Lead responsibility:  
Chief Executive Officer
Credit risk in our European  
home credit markets is stable.
Our Mexico home credit 
business delivered improved 
growth during the first half of 
2017 but there was some 
instability from September 
following two earthquakes  
which hit the country. Improved 
performance returned in Q4. 
The credit risk environment in our 
established IPF Digital markets is 
generally stable with very low 
loss rates. In our new markets, 
there have been rapid changes 
and learnings applied to credit 
settings resulting in strongly 
improving credit quality. 
11. Funding, market 
and counterparty
The risk of insufficient 
availability of funding, 
unfavourable pricing, a breach 
of debt facility covenants,or 
that performance is 
significantly impacted by 
interest rate or currency 
movements, or failure of a 
banking counterparty.
Objective
We aim to maintain a robust 
funding position, and to limit 
the impact of interest rate and 
currency movements and 
exposure to financial  
counterparties.
  
Funding at appropriate cost 
and on appropriate terms, and 
management of financial 
market risk, is necessary for the 
future growth of the business.
Likelihood
Board-approved policies 
require us to maintain a resilient 
funding position with good 
headroom on undrawn bank 
facilities, appropriate hedging 
of market risk, and appropriate 
limits to counterparty risk.
Adherence to Board-approved 
policies monitored through the 
Treasury Committee, finance 
leadership team and regular 
Board reporting. 
Funding plans presented as 
part of budget planning. 
Strong relationships maintained 
with debt providers.
Lead responsibility:  
Chief Financial Officer
Our business has a strong 
funding position with good 
headroom on undrawn bank 
facilities and long-term funding 
in place. 
Hedging of market risk and limits 
on counterparty risk in line 
with policies.
Further detail on our funding 
position is included in the 
financial review on pages 31 
to 35.
Viability statement
The Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that  
the Group will continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due for three years from the date of this report. This assessment has 
been made with reference to the Group’ s current financial position, 
 its prospects, its strategy and its principal risks, as set out in the 
Strategic Report.
The Group undertakes an annual business planning and budgeting 
process that includes an update to strategic plans together with  
an assessment of expected performance, cash flows, funding 
requirements and covenant compliance. The plan is stress-tested in  
a variety of downside scenarios that reflect the crystallisation of the 
Group’ s principal risks with particular reference to regulatory , taxation 
and funding, market and counterparty risks as outlined on pages  
39, 40 and 43, respectively and the consequent impact on future 
performance, funding requirements and covenant compliance. 
Consideration has also been given to the availability of mitigating 
actions that could be taken to reduce the impact of the identified risks.
The Directors have determined that three years is an appropriate period 
over which to provide its viability statement because it aligns with the 
Group’ s business planning horizon. In making this statement, the 
Directors have assumed that both the wholesale funding markets 
remain accessible so as to allow the Group’ s existing arrangements to 
be refinanced and further funding put in place if necessary , and that 
the legal, taxation and regulatory framework allows for the provision of 
short-term credit to the markets in which the Group operates.
Approved by the Board.

Chief Executive Officer 
 
1 March 2018 Introduction to corporate governance
Good governance 
supports strategic delivery
The Board ensured that, despite a 
challenging external environment 
throughout 2017, the business remained 
true to its purpose and values of providing 
straightforward consumer finance 
responsibly and respectfully.
“Effectively navigating  
regulatory challenge remains  
a key focus for the Board.”
Dan O’Connor
Chairman
Dear shareholder,
The landscape within which the Board and its Committees worked 
during 2017 continued to be one of regulatory challenge, robust 
competition and evolving customer preferences. These factors 
underpinned Board discussions when reviewing and challenging  
the formulation and implementation of the Group's strategy.
Q. What was the focus of the Board in 2017?
Regulatory developments in Poland and Romania and corporation 
tax matters in Poland have been areas of particular focus. Board 
discussions have been informed by regular updates provided 
first-hand by David Parkinson and Botond Szirmák, Regional 
Managers for our Northern Europe and Southern Europe home 
credit businesses respectively.
The Board was assisted in its oversight of regulatory and tax matters 
by the Audit and Risk Committee, chaired by Richard Moat, through 
the Committee’s review of compliance testing and mitigation 
planning under the Group’s compliance and risk 
management frameworks.
Our values
Our values have remained constant since we listed on the 
London Stock Exchange in 2007 and they are embedded 
across our organisation irrespective of role or geographical 
location. They are the core principles that guide the way we 
build our business and serve our customers. Our values help 
differentiate our business and provide reassurance to our 
customers that they have made the right decision in choosing 
products and services from us.
We are 
respectful
Treating others as  
we would like to 
be treated
We are 
responsible
Being open and 
transparent in 
everything we do
We are 
straightforward
Taking due care in  
all our actions 
and decisions
44 Q. How did the Board provide oversight of 
operational issues in the business during 2017?
A key area of operational focus in 2017 was the continued growth 
momentum in our home credit business in Mexico in the first half of 
the year. This built on the improved performance we saw in the 
second half of 2016. Unfortunately, progress was understandably 
impeded by the earthquakes which hit Mexico in September that 
resulted in a contraction in credit issued and a weaker collections 
performance. First and foremost, the Board was keen to make 
certain that support was in place for all our employees and agents, 
and then to see the right actions were taken to enable the business 
to return to normal operations as quickly and safely as possible. I am 
pleased to say that the business recovered well from the disruption 
and trading improved from the second half of November 2017.
Q. How did the Board support the Group’s focus on 
efficiency through the use of technology in 2017?
Modernising the business through the use of technology remains key 
to delivering our long-term success. Assisted by the Technology 
Committee, chaired by John Mangelaars, the Board continued to 
support the drive to increase IPF’s technology-based capabilities in 
line with its broadening product range and channel choices. On 
behalf of the Board, the Committee also oversaw the centralisation 
of our IT function, further development of the MyProvi mobile 
handheld technology for agents and the appointment of the 
Group’s first Chief Data Officer as part of our drive to add value to 
the organisation through the use of advanced data and analytics.
Q. How does the Board ensure that IPF has the right 
people in place to deliver its strategic objectives?
An integral part of the Board's oversight role is to ensure that effective 
succession planning processes are in place together with initiatives 
to enhance the Group's leadership team. In February 2017, we were 
pleased to invite Justin Lockwood to join the Board as an executive 
director, and later in the year saw the strengthening of the senior 
executive team with the appointment of a new Group HR Director 
and Chief Legal Officer and Company Secretary. We also continued 
our search to find the right individual to take over the role of Senior 
Independent Director.
However, having the right people in place is not simply about 
identifying people with the right skills and experience. It is about 
creating a cohesive team with shared values and ethics. To this end, 
the Board supported work to embed the Company's ethical 
standards across the Group and to support our Aspire programme 
aimed at developing our pool of future leaders.

Committees in the pages that follow.

Board report
“Regulation and performance 
monitoring were at the heart of  
Board discussions in 2017.”
Dan O’Connor
Chairman
Dear shareholder,
During the year, the Board provided effective oversight in support 
of management’s navigation of tax matters in Poland, regulatory 
matters in Poland and Romania, and the improvement in the 
performance of our home credit business in Mexico. In addition, 
the Board oversaw the delivery of the Group's strategy, which is  
to provide a high level of service to customers and optimise 
returns generated by our European home credit businesses to 
reinvest in our growth businesses and deliver shareholder returns. 
As part of this, and following careful consideration, the Board 
approved the sale of our Bulgarian home credit business, which 
was completed in June. This disposal was undertaken to enable 
us to focus on our larger home credit businesses and IPF Digital.
In 2017, the Board and its Committees carried out an internal 
evaluation of its performance, facilitated by the Company Secretary. 
A summary of the Board evaluation feedback and its action plan is 
shown on page 49.
In progressing its 2017 objectives, the Board was supported by its 
Committees and I thank my colleagues for their steadfast support 
throughout the year. Further details of the work of the Board and 
its Committees can be found in the following pages.

Nomination Committee report
“The Nomination Committee 
recommended the appointment  
of a new Chief Financial Officer  
in 2017.”
Dan O’Connor
Committee Chairman
Dear shareholder,
During 2017, the Nomination Committee focused on ensuring 
that Board membership remained appropriate. In February 2017, 
we recommended to the Board the appointment of Justin 
Lockwood as an executive director and Chief Financial Officer. 
Our search for a new Senior Independent Director to replace 
Tony Hales also continued during the year. This is a role which  
the Committee considers critical for good governance and we 
are committed to finding a candidate with the appropriate 
skill-set, qualifications and capabilities to provide the breadth  
of experience and depth of insight that we have come to expect 
from Tony.
Additionally, Jayne Almond, one of our non-executive directors, 
has let us know that she will not be seeking re-election at the 
Company's upcoming Annual General Meeting (on 4 May 2018) 
and that she will step down with effect from the conclusion of the 
AGM. Jayne has served on the Company's Board since June 
2015 and in that time has provided valuable and insightful 
guidance and challenge. I would like to thank her for her 
excellent contribution and support. We have initiated a search 
for a new non-executive director to replace Jayne.
2017 objectives
• Appoint a successor for the Senior Independent 
Director role.
• Implement the action plan from the 2016 Board evaluation.
2017 progress

Corporate Governance Overview
Role
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on our website 
and some of the key responsibilities include: 
• reviewing the size, structure and composition of the Board;
• assisting the Board in selecting and appointing any new directors 
and recommending their appointment to the Board; and
• succession planning.
Composition
The Committee must have at least three members, the majority 
being independent non-executive directors. Members can also 
include the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. Three 
members form a quorum. Full biographical details of members, 
including qualifications, can be found on pages 46 and 47.
Boardroom diversity
We recognise and embrace the benefits of having a diverse Board, 
and see increasing diversity at Board level as an essential element  
in achieving our strategy. Our Board diversity policy, sets out our 
approach to ensuring we have a diverse Board and was last revised 
in June 2015. It is considered to remain appropriate.
In reviewing Board composition, the Committee considers the 
benefits of all aspects of diversity, including differences in skills, 
regional and industry experience, race, gender and other qualities 
of directors. These differences are considered in determining the 
optimum composition of the Board and, when possible, we believe 
should be balanced appropriately. All Board appointments are 
made on merit, in the context of the skills and experience the Board 
as a whole requires in order to be effective.
Currently, we consider non-executive candidates from a wide pool 
including those with little or no listed company board experience 
and review a long list of candidates, 50% of whom we aim to ensure 
are women. In addition, we only engage executive search firms, 
which have signed up to the voluntary code of conduct on gender 
diversity and best practice.
The policy was applied in our recruitment activities in 2017 and 
executive search firms asked to provide candidates in line with the 
above criteria.
The stated objective of our policy is to ensure that our Board includes 
at least two female directors, a diversity commitment we have 
continued to meet. However, this commitment will no longer be met 
when Jayne Almond steps down from the Board with effect from the 
conclusion of our 2018 AGM. It remains our objective to meet this 
commitment in the future.
Activities in 2017
Meetings
The Committee met twice during the year. Attendance at meetings 
can be found on page 49.
Board changes
As reported in our 2016 Annual Report and Financial Statements,  
the Committee recommended to the Board the appointment of 
Justin Lockwood as executive director and Chief Financial Officer.
Board composition and succession
The Committee keeps under review the size, structure and 
composition of the Board and its Committees, to ensure that they 
comprise individuals with a range of complementary skills. It also 
considered Board-level succession planning during the year. This was 
particularly relevant recognising that it is more than 10 years since 
Tony Hales was first appointed to the Board as a non-executive 
director. He has also served as Senior Independent Director since 
May 2010. The Committee continued the search for a new non-
executive director to fill this role. This is being carried out in 
conjunction with recruitment specialist, Egon Zehnder, and will 
continue in 2018. Egon Zehnder has no other connection with  
the Company. In the meantime, the Committee asked Tony to 
continue as a director with a view to stepping down when a suitable 
replacement is appointed. I am pleased to say that Tony has agreed 
and will put himself forward for re-election at our upcoming AGM.
Election and re-election of directors
Directors are appointed to the Board following a robust selection 
process and on the Committee’s recommendation. The performance 
of each director is assessed on an annual basis as part of the Board 
evaluation process. In addition, a review of the independence of 
each non-executive director is undertaken and consideration given 
to the attendance of each director at Board and Committee 
meetings. Based on these reviews, the Board recommends the 
re-election of all directors who are standing for election at the 
2018 AGM.
Tenure of directors
As noted above, it is more than 10 years since Tony Hales was first 
elected to the Board. Consideration was given to his independence 
as described on page 78. An analysis of the tenure of all current 
directors is shown on page 49 and their individual length of service  
is shown in their biographies on pages 46 and 47. 
Further activities
In December 2017, the Committee also reviewed and approved 
Board and Committee meeting attendance, which can be found on 
page 49.

Dear shareholder,
The Committee focused its attention throughout 2017 on

significant enhancements to the risk management process

identify and assess emerging risks. During 2018, the Committee

risk, particularly in our European markets.

optimising the value generated by our home credit

implementation plan.

Corporate Governance Case study: Cyber security
In common with most businesses our assessment was that the 
level of threat from the external environment increased this year 
and consequently the Audit and Risk Committee monitored the 
Company's response closely.
The annual internal audit plan included an in-depth evaluation 
of the adequacy of key cyber security controls over IT 
infrastructure, applications and data. This was an important 
review of the Cyber Security Framework, the state of its 
vulnerability management and the Company's ability to act 
upon indicators of compromise. We were encouraged with the 
results of this internal audit, particularly the validation of 
management's cyber security incident response plan.
However, we felt that we needed to go one step further and 
consequently we strongly supported management's initiative to 
commission an ethical hacking of the Company's physical and 
logical infrastructure by a prominent cyber security consultancy. 
This was a very successful test which gave us insights into our 
network which we had not previously seen and some very clear 
guidance as to how we can protect the business better. We will 
extend this approach across the business during 2018.
2018 objectives
• Ensure that the processing of personal data meets 
the requirements of the new General Data 
Protection Regulation.
• Review effectiveness of contingency plans to respond to 
unanticipated legal and regulatory changes.
• Confirm the Group’s financial control framework ensures 
reliable financial reporting.
• Monitor developments in field operational processes 
following introduction of agent technology.
• Assess the impact and effectiveness of organisational 
changes of Group oversight functions.
• Evaluate the effectiveness of assurance mechanisms to 
manage People risk.
• Review actions taken to improve cost-efficiency within 
the business.
• Evaluate progress made in the implementation of a new 
compliance monitoring framework.
• Continue to closely monitor effectiveness of the defences 
currently in place to prevent the Group becoming a victim of 
cyber crime.
• Ensure that the developing compliance framework identifies 
and addresses key areas of risk as they emerge.

Audit and Risk Committee report continued
Overview
Role
The objective of the Committee is to oversee the Group’s financial 
reporting, internal controls and risk management procedures, 
together with the work performed by the external auditor and the 
internal audit function. The Committee’s terms of reference are 
available on our website. Its main responsibilities are to: 
• monitor the Group’s systems of internal control, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management 
systems, and to perform an annual review of their effectiveness;
• monitor the integrity of the Financial Statements of the Company 
and the formal announcements relating to the Company’s 
financial performance, reviewing significant financial reporting 
judgments contained in them;
• provide advice to the Board on whether the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy;
• make recommendations to the Board, for the Board to put to 
shareholders in general meeting, in relation to the appointment, 
reappointment and removal of the external auditor and to 
approve its terms of appointment;
• review and monitor the objectivity and independence of the 
external auditor and the effectiveness of the external audit 
process, taking into consideration relevant UK professional and 
regulatory requirements;
• review and approve the internal audit programme for the year 
and monitor the effectiveness of the internal audit function in the 
delivery of its plan; and
• keep under review the Group Schedule of Key Risks and consider 
the principal risks (see pages 38 to 43) facing the Group and 
their mitigation.
Composition
The Committee comprises three independent non-executive 
directors and is chaired by Richard Moat, a Fellow of the Association 
of Chartered Certified Accountants, who has relevant and recent 
experience for the purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the ‘Code’). The other non-executive directors are Jayne Almond, 
who has over 20 years of experience in financial services, and Tony 
Hales, who has strong business expertise and extensive knowledge 
of our Group. Jayne Almond will cease to be a member of the 
Committee when she steps down from the Board with effect from the 
conclusion of our 2018 AGM. Full biographical details of members, 
including qualifications, can be found on pages 46 and 47.
The external auditor, Deloitte LLP, the Chief Executive Officer, the 
Chief Financial Officer, and the Head of Internal Audit are invited to 
attend all meetings. Periodically, senior management from across 
the Group is invited to present on specific aspects of the business. 
The Committee also meets from time to time with the external 
auditor, without an executive director or member of the Group’s 
senior management being present, to discuss the external 
audit process.
Functionally, the Head of Internal Audit reports directly to the 
Chairman of the Committee. For routine administrative matters, the 
Head of Internal Audit's principal contact is the Chief Financial 
Officer. The Head of Internal Audit operates within a clearly defined 
remit and has good linkage to the rest of the organisation.
The Committee has monitored the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function throughout the year.
54 Internal control and risk management
While the Board is responsible for the Group’s systems of internal 
control, including risk management, the review of its effectiveness is 
delegated to the Committee. It is recognised that any system can 
provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The Committee reviews and approves 
the Group Schedule of Key Risks, which describes the principal risks 
facing the business. The Board then formally considers the Schedule 
on a six-monthly basis and approves risk appetite annually. The 
internal control environments in place to mitigate the impact of 
each risk are monitored by the Committee on a regular basis, as are 
the principal actions being taken to improve them. The Committee 
requests additional presentations on key business areas as 
necessary to supplement its understanding of control environments 
in place. The areas covered by these in 2017 are referred to in the 
‘Training’ section on page 57. The internal controls in relation to the 
preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are outlined 
on page 85.
In particular, during 2017 the Committee monitored legal and 
regulatory compliance and tax issues. Specifically, the Committee 
focused on the progress of the Polish tax audits for 2008, 2009 and 
2010 together with the new Polish corporation tax law reform that 
became effective on 1 January 2018 and received, reviewed and 
challenged regular updates from management.
With regard to the proposals published by the Polish Ministry of 
Justice in December 2016 proposing a significant reduction to the 
cap on non-interest costs that may be charged on a customer loan 
agreement, the Committee received updates on the work being 
undertaken with various government ministries and relevant parties 
to encourage a solution that is good for both consumers and 
business. The Committee will continue to make this a focus 
throughout 2018. The Committee continued to monitor the project  
to implement IFRS 9, the new financial instruments accounting 
standard, which became effective from 1 January 2018, and 
received, reviewed and challenged reports from management 
on progress.
The Committee also continued to maintain its focus on the 
management of risks. The Committee is supported in its work by the 
Risk Advisory Group, which in 2017 comprised the Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal Officer, together with 
other members of the senior leadership team. The Risk Advisory 
Group meets four times a year. It reports to the Audit and Risk 
Committee and considers the risk assessments and risk registers 
produced in each country, and updates the Group Schedule of Key 
Risks. It also considers areas of specific risk and particular issues. 
The Committee has assessed the effectiveness of internal audit and 
satisfied itself that the quality, experience and expertise of the 
function are appropriate for the business.
An annual internal audit plan for 2017 was developed using a 
risk-based approach. The Committee provides oversight and 
direction to the internal audit plan to ensure that it provides 
independent assurance over the integrity of internal controls and  
the operational governance framework. In addition, the external 
auditor communicates to the Committee any control deficiencies  
in the internal control environment it observes as part of its audit 
procedures. During the year, Deloitte did not highlight any material 
control weaknesses.
Activities in 2017
Meetings
The Committee met six times during the year, twice to consider risk 
and four times to consider audit-related matters. Attendance at 
meetings can be found on page 49.
Financial reporting
The Committee reviewed and considered the following areas in 
respect of financial reporting and the preparation of the half-year 
and full-year Financial Statements:
• the appropriateness of accounting policies used;
• compliance with external and internal financial reporting 
standards and policies;
• significant judgements made by management;
• disclosures and presentations; and
• whether the Annual Report and Financial Statements are fair, 
balanced and understandable. 
In carrying out this review, the Committee considered the work and 
recommendations of management. In addition, the Committee 
received reports from the external auditor setting out its view on the 
accounting treatments and judgements underpinning the financial 
statements. The significant judgements considered by the 
Committee were: 
• Impairment of receivables: the key area of judgement in respect 
of impairment provisions made against customer receivables in 
the home credit division and in IPF Digital is the predictive 
accuracy of statistical models used to estimate future customer 
default rates and expected future timing of cash flows in respect 
of each portfolio. At both the half-year and full-year results, the 
Committee considered a paper prepared by management 
summarising the work performed to test the continued predictive 
capacity of these statistical models and to update them where 
appropriate. This paper also addressed the use of post-model 
overlays in instances where the predictive capacity testing 
indicated that they are required. The external auditor performed 
audit procedures on impairment provisioning and reported its 
findings to the Committee.
• Revenue recognition: the judgement in respect of revenue 
recognition is the methodology used to calculate the effective 
interest rate. The external auditor performed procedures to  
assess management’s calculations and assumptions used to 
calculate the effective interest rate and reported its findings to  
the Committee. 
• Provision for uncertain tax positions: IPF operates in multiple 
jurisdictions where the taxation treatment of transactions is not 
always certain. Management therefore is required to make 
judgements, based on internal expertise and external advice,  
on the methodology to be adopted for accounting for uncertain 
tax positions. A key area of focus in 2017 was the basis of the 
judgements taken relating to the accounting treatment adopted 
for the payments in respect of the Polish tax audits of the 2008 and 
2009 financial year. The external auditor performed procedures to 
assess management’s judgements and reported its findings to 
the Committee.
• Regulation: the business is subject to regulatory scrutiny in multiple 
jurisdictions and at times it is appropriate to make provision for 
potentially adverse rulings by regulatory authorities. The 
Committee received reports from the Group legal function 
outlining the various regulatory and other similar issues and 
management’s approach.
International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 55
Corporate Governance Audit and Risk Committee report continued
The Committee rigorously tracks the resolution of findings and 
recommendations raised in internal audit reports.
The internal audit function has also continued to monitor the 
effectiveness of the overall operational governance and oversight 
structure throughout 2017 and has made recommendations to 
ensure it properly reflects recent structural changes in the Group.
External auditor effectiveness and independence
The Committee considered the external auditor’s assessment of the 
significant risks in the Group’s Financial Statements set out in its audit 
plan and approved the scope of the external audit that addressed 
these risks. The Committee considered these risks and the associated 
work undertaken by the external auditor when forming its judgement 
on the Financial Statements.
The Committee monitored the effectiveness and conduct of the 
external auditor by reviewing:
• the experience and capabilities of the auditor and the calibre of 
the audit firm;
• the delivery of its audit work in accordance with the agreed 
plan; and 
• the quality of its report and communications to the Committee.
In order to confirm its independence and objectivity, the external 
auditor issued a formal statement of independence to the 
Committee. In addition, the Committee ensured compliance with 
the Group’s policy on the use of the external auditor for non-audit 
work. The key requirements of this policy are:
• the external auditor may not undertake certain prohibited services 
including internal audit, IT, remuneration, recruitment, valuation or 
general management consultancy; and
• the Committee Chairman must approve any individual non-audit 
service over a specific fee level. 
The policy of the Committee in respect of non-audit services is that 
the external auditor is only appointed to perform a non-audit service 
when doing so would be consistent with both the requirements and 
overarching principles of the Financial Reporting Council's Revised 
Ethical Standard (2016), and when its skills and experience make it 
the most suitable supplier.
The Committee believes that the Group receives a particular benefit 
from certain non-audit services where a detailed knowledge of its 
operations are important or where the auditor has very specific skills 
and experience. However, other large accountancy practices are 
Significant internal audits in 2017 were performed in the following areas:
Basic assurance 
Branch-level reviews:
• Management of administration, operational, financial and loss 
prevention oversight processes in home credit branches in 
Mexico where the branch network continues to expand.
Head office audits:
• Implementation of IFRS 9
• Cyber-attack readiness
• Strategy execution
• General Data Protection Regulation readiness
• Core controls over: 
• People risk
• Collections in the home credit markets
• Change management
Thematic audits 
• Regulation and compliance:
• Anticipating regulatory change
• Implementation of a Compliance Framework
• Compliance
 – with affordability legislation
 – with licensing regimes
 – with mis-selling legislation
• IT and Systems:
• Development of IPF Digital core IT system
• Single digital platform development
• IT strategy implementation
• IT key supplier roadmap
• MyCollections mobile app integrity
• Credit and collections:
• Credit and collections at IPF Digital
• Debt sales strategy execution
• Strategic:
• Mexico stabilisation
• Response to proposed changes to total cost of credit 
legislation in Poland
Internal audit
A firm basis for the opinion on the Group’s system of internal control (see page 57) was provided throughout the year by the Head of Internal 
Audit via the execution of the annual internal audit plan. PwC and KPMG were engaged to support specific thematic audits where specialist 
technical knowledge was required.
The plan was split between basic assurance audits, covering core controls across the business as defined in the Group Schedule of Key Risks, 
and thematic audits providing a deeper review of the mitigation of the specific principal risks facing the Group. The Committee assessed the 
effectiveness of the internal audit function throughout the year. It considered and approved the annual internal audit plan on the basis that it 
addressed the principal risks and uncertainties facing the business. The Committee reviewed the reports produced and closely monitored 
management's progress in implementing the actions agreed. The Committee is satisfied that the internal audit function has a clear remit 
and a good linkage with the organisation.
56 Committee effectiveness
The Committee has also undertaken a review of its effectiveness 
using an internal questionnaire to its members, executive directors, 
management and external advisors. The results were collated by the 
Company Secretary and reviewed and discussed by the Board who 
concluded that the Committee continues to be effective.
Review of the effectiveness of the systems of 
internal control
On behalf of the Board, the Committee has monitored the Group’s 
systems of internal control and its processes for managing principal 
risks throughout 2017 and performed an assessment of their 
effectiveness. In addition, the Committee, where appropriate, 
ensures that necessary actions have been or are being taken to 
remedy identified failings or weaknesses in the internal controls 
framework. These processes for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the principal risks faced by the Group were in place 
throughout 2017 and up to 1 March 2018.
Annual Report and Financial Statements
The Committee has reviewed and considered the Annual Report  
and Financial Statements, in line with other information the 
Committee has considered throughout the course of the year.  
It concluded, and recommended to the Board, that the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements 2017, taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
Richard Moat 
Chairman
also used to provide services where appropriate. During the year, the 
non-audit services carried out by Deloitte LLP were as follows.
Non-audit services carried out by Deloitte 
in 2017
Fee  
£’000
Taxation compliance services 9
Other assurance services 66
Total 75
During the year, the FRC’s Audit Quality Review team selected to 
review the audit of the 2016 International Personal Finance plc 
Financial Statements as part of their 2017 annual inspection of audit 
firms. The focus of the review and their reporting is on identifying 
areas where improvements are required rather than highlighting 
areas performed to or above the expected level. We welcome 
engagement with the FRC, and the Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committee received a full copy of the findings of the Audit Quality 
Review team and has discussed these with Deloitte. The Audit and 
Risk Committee confirms that there were three areas of potential 
improvement identified within the report. The Audit and Risk 
Committee is also satisfied that there is nothing within the report 
which might have a bearing on the audit appointment.
Audit tendering and auditor rotation
The Company’s policy is to undertake a formal tendering exercise  
of the audit contract at least once every 10 years. Following a tender 
process, Deloitte LLP has been the Group’s auditor since 2011. Peter 
Birch is the lead audit partner and has been since May 2017. The 
Company will be required to retender the audit for the financial year 
ended 2021 and plans to complete a competitive tender process  
by this time. In addition, the Committee will continue to consider the 
auditor’s performance on an annual basis. Having undertaken its 
review for this year, in the opinion of the Audit and Risk Committee, 
the relationship with the auditor works well and the Committee 
remains satisfied with its independence, objectivity and effectiveness. 
Therefore, at its February 2018 meeting the Committee 
recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP be reappointed  
as auditor at the 2018 Annual General Meeting.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, and up to the date of  
this report, the Company has complied with the provisions of the 
Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014. 
Training 
The Committee undertook a significant amount of training during 
2017. This included presentations on the following key 
business areas:
• Directors' obligations in relation to cyber security and response to 
data breach;
• General Data Protection Regulation central principles and 
primary requirements;
• the digital consumer lending market and our digital business;
• managing compliance risk;
• corporate governance including viability statement requirements; 
• new tax strategy regulations; and
• IFRS 9, and how the Company will apply the new accounting 
standard and its impact on our Financial Statements.
This training was complemented by a visit to the Group’s business in 
Poland, which included discussions with the management teams at 
Provident Polska and IPF Digital (see page 79 for more details).

Implementing our revised strategic approach to IT
The IT strategy approved by the Board in 2016 had four pillars:
• creating a single digital platform;
• restructuring IT into a centrally managed function;
• digitising the home credit business; and
• using data as a strategic asset.
2017 saw substantial progress on all four of these pillars.
1. Creating a single digital platform
We continued developments to deliver a single stack of technology 
components to allow IPF to seamlessly offer digital lending products 
across all our Group businesses. This takes a best of breed approach 
combining the latest third party products with our proprietary 
product and loan engines built in house. We have progressively 
brought development in-house, grown our technical capabilities 
and are moving towards deployment in our first home credit market 
in the first half of 2018.
2. Restructuring IT into a centrally managed function
At the start of 2017, we moved from a federated structure of 
in-country IT teams in home credit to a centralised IT organisation in 
Europe of over 300 IT professionals managed by a highly 
experienced management team. This new structure has allowed us 
to drive economies of scale from our IT operations and reinvest these 
savings in our new digital and data programmes. Governance has 
been improved to allow us to take a Group-wide, strategic view of 
technology investment and resource allocation. At the start of 2018, 
Mexico was also incorporated into the Group IT function.
3. Digitising the home credit business
Good progress has been made rolling out our mobile handheld 
technology for agents, which has been designed to modernise and 
digitise much of the processing in our home credit business. We 
completed the roll-out of the first two apps, which focus on 
collections and team management in Hungary and the Czech 
Republic. The collections app securely provides our agents with a list 
of customers to visit and enables entry of the loan repayments, and 
the team management app enables our field managers to delegate 
groups of customers to other agents when the main agent is 
unavailable. The solution will be deployed to Poland in the first half 
of 2018.
4. Using data as a strategic asset
We launched our data strategy in 2017 with the aim of improving  
our ability to use data as a strategic asset. We focused on the 
development of new reporting systems to support reporting and 
analysis under IFRS 9, the new financial instruments accounting 
standard that became effective from the start of 2018. In addition  
we have appointed a Chief Data Officer who is creating an analytics 
centre of excellence to focus on areas where advanced data and 
analytics can add value to the organisation.
Key priorities
In 2018, we will focus on completing the roll-out of our single digital 
platform into our first market, completing the deployment of the initial 
agent mobile handheld technology apps in all our European home 
credit markets, leveraging further efficiencies from the centralisation 
of IT and delivering value from our analytics centre of excellence.
John Mangelaars
Chairman
Case study: MyProvi – Rolling out our mobile 
technology applications
An important part of modernising and optimising our home 
credit business is the roll-out of our mobile handheld technology 
for agents, which is branded as MyProvi. This technology will 
support agent sales and collections, reduce administration 
costs and facilitate further efficiencies. It will also bring about 
improved compliance and data quality. It comprises four 
smartphone apps: MyCollections, to allow agents to collect 
customers' payments and record the transactions automatically 
on our internal system; MySales, to enable agents to credit 
score a customer; MyBalancing, which will allow agents to 
balance collections and sales and record this automatically  
on our internal system; and MyTeam, which will support field 
managers day-to-day work with agents and customers. In 2017, 
after establishing stability of the technology platform, we 
completed the roll-out of the MyCollections and MyTeam 
applications to more than 4,000 agents and field managers in 
Hungary and the Czech Republic. Our teams have also 
delivered training and communications to support our field 
teams. Progress made in 2017 is set out further in section 
3 below.

Business context – 2017 performance 
We delivered a solid financial and operational performance in 2017 
and profit before tax increased to £105.6 million against an external 
environment characterised by continued regulatory change and 
intense competition. The Committee has been robust in considering 
the improved performance of the business and in determining 
remuneration outcomes. The operational review and financial review 
for 2017 can be found on pages 24 to 30 and 31 to 35 respectively. 
These reports include some of the key financial metrics that we use 
to incentivise executive directors to deliver our strategy, including 
profit before tax, revenue less impairment and earnings per share 
(‘EPS’). Headlines include:
• group profit before tax from continuing operations of 
£105.6 million, an increase of £9.6 million including a £11.3 million 
positive FX benefit (Bonus targets were adjusted to exclude this  
FX benefit);
• revenue less impairment of £624.7 million being higher than 2016 
due to the larger receivables balance; and
• pre-exceptional tax EPS increased to 33.7 pence from 32.2 pence 
as a result of the increase in profit and partially offset by a higher 
effective tax rate.
Outcomes for 2017
In taking decisions on executive directors' remuneration the Committee 
has sought to ensure that the recommendations are appropriate 
from a 2017 Policy perspective and that they demonstrate clear 
alignment between the execution of our strategic priorities and our 
business performance over the financial year.
This is reflected in:
• a base pay award of 3% for our Chief Executive, the first award 
made since 2015, and one that aligns with the award given to the 
wider workforce in the UK;
• a base pay award of 7.7% for our Chief Financial Officer, in line 
with our intent (communicated in our 2016 Annual Remuneration 
Report) to achieve a level of base pay over time that is 
commensurate with the role (subject to performance); 
• bonus awards of 96.6% of maximum (vs 16% in 2016). These 
awards reflect the strong performance delivered against our 
strategic priorities, and the alignment between these priorities  
and our bonus awards. The Group achieved profit before tax of 
£105.6 million against a target of £96.6 million (adjusted to exclude 
the positive FX impact), double digit growth in credit issued in 
Mexico of 12.9% (against a target of 10%) and IPF Digital of 43.6% 
(against a target of 40%). In addition the Executive Directors 
successfully executed a number of demanding individual 
objectives, details of which can be found on page 70. 50% of  
the bonus earned will be deferred into shares for three years;
• 2018 Performance Share Plan ('PSP' award) of 190% of salary,  
in line with policy; and
• legacy 2015 awards that have vested at 0% due to none of the 
LTIP measures having been met, see page 71.
Careful consideration was given by the Committee to ensuring that 
these recommendations were not only appropriate from a ‘policy 
and performance’ perspective, but also against a backdrop of 
evolving regulation and investor sentiment. This was particularly 
evident in the discussions around Chief Financial Officer base  
pay, and our intent to align base pay with a level commensurate 
with the role. In doing so we carefully considered and discussed 
performance in the role, alongside appropriate internal and external 
pay benchmarks. 
More generally the Committee took into account the recovery  
in profitability demonstrated by the business over 2017 when 
compared with the regulatory challenges experienced in 2016,  
and the work undertaken by the senior management team in 
leading this recovery. To that end the Committee was pleased  
to approve bonus recommendations that reflected both our  
strong performance over the course of 2017, but also the ability  
of the annual bonus plan to recognise changes in year-on-year 
business performance appropriately. Alongside this the Committee 
has reviewed its own ways of working and terms of reference, to 
ensure that it continues to provide appropriate and proportionate 
oversight on pay, not only for executive directors, but also the wider 
IPF workforce. 
Shareholder engagement 
A full consultation was undertaken in 2016 in support of the 
introduction of the 2017 Policy. We have engaged shareholders in  
a manner which is consistent with the Committee's level of activity in 
a non-review year, but in line with our stated commitment to operate 
in an appropriately transparent fashion. To that end we set out the 
key decisions taken in a formal letter to major shareholders, and the 
supporting rationale behind those decisions.
How we ensure our pay is compliant 
The Committee recognises the increasingly important role regulation 
has to play in executive remuneration and is committed to ensuring 
that our application of remuneration policy is compliant with both 
the letter and the spirit of prevailing regulation and legislation to the 
greatest extent possible. As a Committee we achieve this through:
• timely dialogue and consultation with our major shareholders on 
remuneration policy (in policy review years) and the application  
of this policy, as appropriate;
• effective use of the support provided to us by our independent 
remuneration advisors, Willis Towers Watson, in understanding the 
changing regulatory landscape and how this should inform both 
our remuneration policy and its application; and
• an ongoing commitment (as a Committee) to placing regulatory 
and best practice considerations at the heart of the decisions 
taken by the Committee on remuneration matters. Directors’ Remuneration report continued

Base salary
To attract and retain talent 
capable of delivering the 
Group’s strategy.
Rewards executive directors for 
their performance in the role.
Base salary is paid in 12 equal 
monthly instalments during 
the year.
Salaries are normally reviewed 
annually and any changes are 
generally effective from 1 April.
Salary levels are set taking into 
account role, experience, 
responsibility and performance, 
both of the individual and the 
Company, and also taking into 
account market conditions and 
the salaries for comparable roles 
in similar companies.
Normally, salary increases take 
into account salary reviews 
across the Group and are usually 
in line with increases awarded to 
UK employees. By exception, 
higher awards may be made at 
the Committee’s discretion to 
reflect individual circumstances. 
For example:
• changes to role which 
increase scope and/
or responsibility;
• development and 
performance in the role; and
• responding to competitive 
market pressures.
There is no prescribed maximum 
increase as per the 2017 Policy.
None, although overall 
performance of the individual is 
considered by the Committee 
when setting and reviewing 
salaries annually.
Pension
To provide retirement funding. The Company operates a 
stakeholder scheme; at the 
discretion of the Committee, this 
may be paid as a cash 
allowance. 
The Company has closed its 
defined benefit scheme to new 
members and future accrual.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Introduction
The Committee presents the first full application of the 2017 Policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM in May 2017  
and applies to awards granted from that date. We also committed to honour all appropriate pre-2017 Policy remuneration obligations.
In addition, where the terms of any remuneration payment (including any payments for loss of office) were agreed before the 2017 Policy 
came into effect, or at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company, these remain eligible to be paid based on 
their original terms.
The intention of the Committee is that the 2017 Policy will remain in place for three years.
How pay is aligned to strategy
Our current executive director remuneration framework is intended to strike an appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay 
components and to provide a clear link between pay and our key strategic priorities. Executive director and senior management 
remuneration is structured so that individuals are only rewarded for the successful delivery of the key strategic priorities of the Company 
over the short and long-term.

Benefits
To provide market-competitive 
benefits that support the 
executive directors to undertake 
their role.
The Company pays the cost of 
providing the benefits on a 
monthly, annual or one-off basis.
All benefits are non-pensionable.
The standard benefits 
package includes:
• life assurance of 4x salary;
• car allowance;
• long-term disability cover;
• private medical cover for 
executive director and 
immediate family;
• annual medical; and
• ability to participate in The IPF 
Save As You Earn Plan (‘SAYE’) 
and any other all-employee 
share schemes on the same 
terms as other employees.
Additional benefits may also be 
provided in certain 
circumstances, which may 
include relocation expenses, 
housing allowance and school 
fees. Other benefits may be 
offered if considered appropriate 
and reasonable by the  
Committee.
None.
Annual bonus
To motivate and reward 
sustainable Group profit before 
tax and the achievement of 
specific personal objectives 
linked to the Company’s  
strategy.
Measures and targets are set 
annually and pay-out levels are 
determined by the Committee 
after the year end, based on 
performance against those  
targets.
The Committee may, in 
exceptional circumstances, 
amend the bonus pay-out should 
this not, in the view of the 
Committee, reflect overall business 
performance or individual  
contribution.
50% of the total bonus amount is 
deferred for three years in 
Company shares through the 
Deferred Share Plan ('DSP'). The 
remaining 50% is paid in cash. 
Payments are made around three 
months after the end of the 
financial year to which they relate.
There are provisions for clawback 
adjustments on the occurrence of 
certain events (see page 66 for 
details).
On-target opportunity: 65%  
of base salary.
Maximum opportunity: 100%  
of base salary.
Performance is measured over 
the financial year.
Performance is assessed using 
the following criteria:
• typically 80% is based on 
achievement of financial and 
strategic measures; and
• typically 20% is based on 
achievement of personal 
objectives linked to 
achievement of 
Company strategy.
Although each of the annual 
bonus metrics could pay out 
independently, the Committee 
will set a minimum threshold 
profit target before any other 
metrics are assessed. Directors’ Remuneration report continued

Deferred Share Plan 
(DSP)
To strengthen the link between 
short and longer-term incentives 
and the creation of sustainable 
long-term value.
50% of the total bonus amount is 
subject to compulsory deferral for 
three years in Company shares 
without any matching. The 
matching element will no longer 
be operated going forward.
Following the vesting of awards, 
executive directors receive an 
amount (in cash or shares) in 
respect of the dividends paid or 
payable between the date of 
grant and the vesting of the 
award on the number of shares 
that have vested.
The DSP has provision for malus 
and clawback adjustments on 
the occurrence of certain events 
(see page 66 for details).
Awards may also be adjusted in 
the event of a variation of capital, 
in accordance with the 
plan rules.

Performance Share Plan 
(PSP)
To motivate and reward 
longer-term performance, and 
support shareholder alignment 
through incentivising absolute 
shareholder value creation.
Annual grant of awards, 
generally made as nil-cost 
options over a specific number  
of shares subject to meeting 
specified performance targets.
The Committee has discretion  
to decide whether and to what 
extent targets have been met, 
and if an event occurs that 
causes the Committee to 
consider that the targets are no 
longer appropriate, the 
Committee may adjust them so 
long as the adjustment does not 
make them materially less difficult 
to satisfy.
Awards may also be adjusted in 
the event of a variation of capital, 
in accordance with the plan  
rules.
Executive directors will be 
required to hold any shares 
acquired on vesting (net of any 
shares that may need to be sold 
to cover taxes) for a two-year 
period starting on the date 
of vesting.
The PSP has provisions for malus 
and clawback adjustments on 
the occurrence of certain events 
(see page 66 for details).
In normal circumstances, annual 
award levels for executive 
directors shall be equivalent to 
190% of base salary at the time 
of grant.
The rules of the PSP plan permit 
annual grants up to an individual 
limit of 250%. Although the 
Committee shall retain discretion 
to make awards up to this level,  
it would expect to consult with 
significant shareholders, if awards 
were routinely made above 
normal levels and would, in all 
cases, make a comprehensive 
retrospective disclosure outlining 
the Committee’s rationale in the 
Annual Remuneration Report.
Vesting of PSP awards is 
dependent on service and 
performance conditions.
25% of the award vests at 
threshold performance in respect 
of the performance conditions, 
with straight-line vesting 
to maximum.
Service and performance 
conditions must be met over 
three-year periods.
Performance is assessed 
against three independently 
measured metrics that are 
weighted as follows:
• 1/2 absolute 
TSR performance;
• 1/4 cumulative EPS 
growth; and
• 1/4 growth in revenue 
less impairment.
The Committee will compare 
the Company’s absolute TSR 
performance to comparator 
groups considered appropriate 
at the point of vesting.
The targets are set by the 
Committee, and targets will  
be set out in the Annual 
Remuneration Report of the 
relevant year.
A six-month averaging period is 
used for calculating TSR.
2017 Policy table – executive directors continued Non-executive directors
The Board reviews non-executive directors’ fees periodically in the light of fees payable in comparable companies and the importance 
attached to the retention and attraction of high-calibre individuals as non-executive directors. Non-executive directors receive no other 
benefits and take no part in any discussion or decision concerning their own fees. The Committee reviews the Chairman’s fees. Fees were 
increased last on 1 October 2013 for the of the Chairman and 1 January 2014 for the non-executive directors. No increases to fees are 
proposed for the Chairman or non-executive directors in 2018.

Element Purpose Operation
Fees
To attract and retain a high-
calibre Chairman and non-
executive directors by offering 
market competitive fees.
Fees are paid on a per annum basis and are not varied for the number of 
days worked.
The level of the Chairman’s fee is reviewed periodically by the Committee  
(in the absence of the Chairman) and the executive directors.
The Chairman and executive directors review non-executive directors’ fees 
periodically in the light of fees payable in comparable companies or to reflect 
changes in scope of role and/or responsibility.
As approved at the 2014 AGM, the maximum annual aggregate fee level  
for all non-executive directors allowed by the Company’s Articles of Association  
is £650,000.
The senior independent non-executive director and Chairs of the Board 
Committees are paid an additional fee to reflect their extra responsibilities.
Any non-executive director who performs services which, in the opinion of the 
Board, go beyond the ordinary duties of a director may be paid such additional 
remuneration as the Board may authorise.
Fees are paid on a quarterly basis.
Shareholding 
requirement
To support shareholder 
alignment by encouraging our 
non-executive directors to align

Notes to the 2017 Policy table
Performance measures and targets
The Committee selects annual bonus performance conditions that 
are central to the achievement of the Company’s key strategic 
priorities for the year and reflect both financial and non-financial 
objectives. To balance this, the performance conditions for the PSP 
are linked to long-term value creation: TSR aligns with our focus on 
shareholder value creation; EPS provides a measure of profitability 
and supports our long-term strategy; and revenue less impairment 
supports our focus on sustainable growth. The performance targets 
are determined annually by the Committee and are set typically at  
a level that is stretching and achievable, taking into account our 
strategic priorities and the economic environment in which we 
operate. Targets are normally set with reference to a range of data 
points, including the budget, sell-side analyst forecasts, historical 
performance, environment, social and governance ('ESG') risks and 
incentive performance ranges at the Company’s comparators, 
where disclosed.
The Board is of the opinion that the performance measures and 
targets for the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and that it 
would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose 
them during the financial year. This is particularly so because the 
majority of our competitors are unlisted. However, the Committee 
commits to making a comprehensive retrospective disclosure in 
respect of performance against the targets set where the disclosure 
of that information is no longer deemed commercially sensitive.
Malus and clawback
The circumstances when malus and clawback may apply include 
(but are not limited to) where:
• the financial statements of the Company or of any member of the 
Group are required to be restated due to discovery of a 
misstatement in the relevant financial statements resulting in 
shares vesting to a greater degree than would have been the 
case if that misstatement had not been made; or
• the discovery that an assessment of performance connected to 
the award (including relating to the original bonus amount for the 
DSP) was based on misleading or inaccurate information; or
• there has been fraud or gross misconduct, or circumstance 
which, in the opinion of the Committee, would entitle the 
Company or any other member of the Group to summarily dismiss 
the individual; or
• the Committee decides circumstances exist which justify the 
operation of malus or clawback.
The clawback period for the PSP normally runs for two years from the 
date of vesting and from the date of payment in the case of the 
cash portion of annual bonus awards. For deferred awards under 
the DSP, malus will apply for the duration of the deferral period. 
Discretions
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan, PSP and DSP 
according to their respective rules and in accordance with the 
Listing Rules where relevant. The Committee retains discretion, 
consistent with market practice, in a number of regards relating  
to the operation and administration of these plans. These include, 
but are not limited to, the following in relation to the PSP and DSP:
• the participants;
• the timing of grant of an award;
• the size of an award;
• the determination of vesting;
• discretion required when dealing with a change of control or 
restructuring of the Group;
• determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the 
plan and the appropriate treatment chosen;
• adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, 
corporate restructuring events and special dividends); and
• the annual review of performance measures and weighting, and 
targets for the PSP from year to year.
In relation to the annual bonus plan, the Committee retains 
discretion over:
• the participants;
• the timing of grant of an award/payment;
• the determination of the bonus payment;
• dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Group;
• determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the 
plan and the appropriate treatment chosen; and
• the annual review of performance measures and weighting, and 
targets for the annual bonus plan from year to year.
In relation to both the Company’s PSP and annual bonus plan, the 
Committee retains the ability to adjust the performance targets if 
events occur which cause it to determine that the targets are no 
longer appropriate (e.g. material acquisition and/or divestment of a 
Group business), so long as the amendment will not make the target 
materially less difficult to satisfy. Any use of this discretion would be 
explained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report and may be the 
subject of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.
The use of discretion in relation to the Company’s SAYE will be in line 
with the governing UK Legislation, HMRC rules and the Listing Rules.
Illustrations of total remuneration opportunity
We have set out an illustration of the 2017 Policy as outlined in the 
table on pages 62 to 65.
The charts on page 67 provide an illustration of the proportion of  
total remuneration made up by each component of the 2017 Policy, 
together with the value of each. Benefits are calculated as per  
the single figure of remuneration and three scenarios have been 
illustrated: ‘Fixed’, ‘On-target’ and ‘Maximum’.
The charts are indicative, as share price movement and dividend 
accrual have been excluded. Assumptions made for each scenario 
are as follows:
• Fixed: fixed remuneration only (i.e. latest known salary, benefits 
and pension).
• On-target: fixed remuneration plus on-target annual bonus (65%) 
plus threshold (25%) PSP shares.
• Maximum: fixed remuneration plus full pay-out of all incentives  
(i.e. 100% of salary in annual bonus, 190% of salary in PSP). International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 67
Corporate Governance
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay  
no more than is necessary to attract appropriate candidates to the 
role. Starting salary will be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy, based on a combination of market information, 
internal relativities and individual experience. Thereafter, salary 
progression will depend on the initial agreed base salary and the 
normal review process.
The maximum level and structure of ongoing variable remuneration 
will be in accordance with the approved remuneration policy, i.e. at 
an aggregate maximum of up to 100% in respect of annual bonus 
and, if necessary, 250% in respect of the PSP and/or cash awards  
at equivalent value. For the avoidance of doubt, these limits shall  
not apply to any replacement awards which the Committee may 
determine it necessary to make in order to secure the services of  
a preferred candidate.
For external appointments, it may be necessary to buyout an 
individual’s awards from a previous employer. The Committee will 
seek to minimise the need for such arrangements and will aim to 
recruit executive directors subject to the policy maximum defined 
above. However, to be able to attract the required calibre of talent, 
we may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements when 
we consider these to be in the best interests of the Company. 
In doing so, the Committee would ensure that any such payments 
have a fair value no higher than that of the awards forgone including 
payments for any benefits in kind, pension and other similar 
allowances, and reflect the delivery mechanism (i.e. cash, shares 
and/or options), time horizons and expected value (i.e. likelihood of 
meeting any existing performance criteria). Replacement share 
awards, if used, will be granted using existing share plans. Wherever 
possible, any new arrangements will be tied into the achievement of 
Group targets in either the annual performance bonus or long-term 
incentives, or both. Full details will be disclosed in the next Directors’ 
Remuneration Report following the date of recruitment, which will 
provide explanations in relation to the amount and delivery structure 
of the awards made for the purposes of recruitment.

As shares under the PSP will not normally be released for up to three 
years with a further two-year holding period for executive directors, 
some cash-based interim long-term arrangement may be provided, 
but the level will not be more than would otherwise have been paid. 
For internal appointments, any variable pay elements awarded in 
respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to the 
terms of the scheme, adjusted as relevant to take account of the 
new appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
As noted in the 2017 Policy table on pages 62, any new executive 
director will be subject to a new maximum annual pension 
contribution from the Company of 15% of base salary.
For both internal and external appointments, the Committee may 
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses 
as appropriate.
Directors’ service agreements and letters 
of appointment
In 2014, the Committee adopted a policy in relation to service 
agreements for newly appointed executive directors of six months’ 
notice. Gerard Ryan remains an exception to this, having been 
appointed on a 12-month rolling contract prior to this change in 
policy. Justin Lockwood has been appointed on a 6-month 
rolling contract.
All non-executive directors are appointed for three years, subject to 
re-election by shareholders. The initial three-year period may be 
extended. The Company can terminate the appointment on three 
months’ notice.
Our Articles of Association require that all directors retire from office  
if they have not retired at either of the preceding two AGMs. In any 
event, at the 2018 AGM, all directors will be standing for re-election  
in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. Service 
agreements are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office. Service agreements and letters of appointment  
are not reissued when base salaries or fees are changed.
The date of service agreements of directors who served during the 
year and their letters of appointment are:

Loss of office payments
Our policy is to limit severance payments on termination to pre-
established contractual arrangements. In the event that the 
employment of an executive director is terminated, any 
compensation payable will be determined having regard to the 
terms of the service contract between the Company and the 
employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans. Except in 
circumstances of gross misconduct or voluntary termination, the 
Company retains discretion to make ex-gratia payments where 
considered reasonable and fair in the Committee’s opinion, and  
to cover costs solely relating to termination of employment by the 
Company. Example costs may include legal, tax and outplacement 
services subject to such fees being de minimis in nature and in the 
best interests of the Company.
Under normal circumstances, good leavers who do not serve notice 
are eligible to receive termination payments in lieu of notice based 
on base salary and contractual benefits.
Normally, we expect executive directors to mitigate their loss upon 
departure. In any specific case that may arise, the Committee will 
consider carefully any compensatory payments, having regard to 
performance, service, health or other circumstances that may 
be relevant.
In the event an executive director leaves for reasons of injury, 
disability, change of control of the Company, or any other reason 
which the Committee in its absolute discretion permits (including 
death in service), any unvested PSP awards will normally vest at the 
normal time following the end of the performance period and be 
pro-rated for time. Performance conditions would apply. However, 
awards will vest early on death and the Committee has the discretion 
to allow the award to vest early on cessation of employment. In this 
event, the Committee will determine whether the performance 
conditions are, or will be, met over such period as the Committee 
determines appropriate, although the award will normally be 
reduced on a pro-rata basis. PSP awards that have vested at the  
time of leaving will be retained and exercisable for a limited period 
following leaving. The Committee may determine that the holding 
period will no longer apply if the director leaves for one of the reasons 
specified above. When determining the treatment of outstanding 
awards for exiting directors, the Committee will take into account the 
executive director’s level of performance and any contribution to  
a transition. 
For all other leavers, outstanding PSP awards will lapse. 
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees
All employees are entitled to base salary and benefits appropriate to 
the market in which they are employed. The maximum opportunity 
available is based on the seniority and responsibility of the role.
PSP awards are only currently available to senior management 
and directors.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere 
in the Company
In making remuneration decisions, the Committee also considers  
the general increases in base salaries taking place within the Group. 
While the Company does not consult directly with employees as part 
of the process of reviewing executive director pay, the Committee 
does receive and take account of employee engagement results  
as part of the overall assessment of executive director performance.

Additional disclosures for single figure of total 
remuneration table
Base salary
The base salary for the Chief Executive Officer will be increased by 
3% from April 2018, in line with the wider IPF UK base salary award. 
This award reflects the continued strong contribution of the Chief 
Executive Officer to the performance of the business, coupled with 
the need to ensure (following three years without any adjustment) 
that appropriate periodic adjustments are made to base salary in 
line with inflation and other relevant factors. The base salary for the 
Chief Financial Officer will be increased by 7.7% from April 2018, 
reflecting the need (as highlighted in the 2016 Annual Remuneration 
Report) to review the CFO’s salary in the coming years, and consider 
increases beyond those typically granted to the wider workforce to 
achieve the desired salary level commensurate with the role, subject 
to performance. 
Benefits
The benefits provided to the executive directors in 2017 included: 
private healthcare, life assurance, annual medical, long-term 
disability cover and a cash allowance in lieu of a company car. 
Neither of the executive directors received total taxable benefits 
exceeding 8% of salary in 2017, and it is not anticipated that the cost 
of benefits provided will exceed this level materially during the period 
in which the 2017 Policy shall apply.
Determination of 2017 annual bonus
The maximum opportunity for both the Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer was 100% of salary (65% for on-target 
performance with no payout for below target performance). During 
2017, a balanced scorecard approach was used to ascertain the 
annual bonus where 60% of total bonus opportunity in 2017 was 
subject to achieving against the profit before tax target, with a 
further 10% contingent on achieving against the credit issued growth 
target in Mexico, and a further 10% contingent on achieving against 
the IPF Digital credit issued growth target. The remaining 20% of the 
Annual Remuneration Report
The Remuneration Committee reviews the senior management remuneration framework annually and considers whether the existing 
incentive arrangements remain appropriately challenging in the context of the business strategy, current external guidelines and a range  
of internal factors including the 2017 Policy and pay arrangements throughout the rest of the Group. The table below shows the performance 
measures used in current incentive schemes and how these align with the key performance indicators detailed on pages 18 to 19.

been valued according to an estimate based on expected vesting and the 1-month average share price to 31 January 2018. These estimated figures will be 
updated and based on the actual values of the awards for the relevant dates in next year’s report. Further information about the level of vesting is provided in 
the additional disclosures section below.
3. The value of awards included in the table for 2016 has been revised to reflect the actual value of awards vesting (an estimate of the value of these awards

Capital and 
funding
Maintain the Group’s capital position in the short 
to medium term, and develop a longer-term 
funding strategy.
New or extended bank funding lines are in place, and bond 
markets have been accessed successfully.
Resource 
allocation and 
driving returns
Embed Returns on Assets (‘ROA’) and internal 
rates of return (‘IRR’) as key performance 
measures, and deploy processes to place these 
measures at the heart of our decision making 
around the deployment of resources.
‘Managing for returns’ strategy introduced across the  
business with ROA and IRR being used in capital allocation 
 and decision making.
Strategy delivery Manage the European home credit businesses for 
returns, return Mexico to profitable growth and 
deliver on potential for IPF Digital.
'Managing for returns' embedded in the European home credit 
businesses. Mexico delivered a strong improvement in operational 
performance albeit one that was impacted by two earthquakes. 
IPF Digital made good progress against strategic objectives.
Regulatory and 
taxation
Effective implementation of IFRS 9, and effective 
management of significant tax exposures in Poland.
The implementation of IFRS 9 and the Group’s significant tax 
exposures were managed effectively.
People Continue to strengthen and develop the finance 
leadership team.
Further strengthened the finance leadership team with the 
recruitment of a number of senior hires and internal promotions 
across the Group. 
scheme outcome (from a maximum of 100% of base salary) is 
subject to the achievement of personal objectives and is conditional 
upon the achievement of these financial measures. The bonus 
outcome in respect of personal performance is determined by a 
performance rating assigned by the Committee having taken into 
account the stretch associated with the objectives set and 
performance against them. Each rating acts as a multiplier against 
the 20% of the scheme subject to personal performance as follows:
Performance rating Effective Extremely effective Outstanding
% multiplier 65 82.5 100
% of scheme outcome 
(20%) 13 16.5 20
Group bonus targets
Group bonus targets were set taking into account the Company's 
operating budget and external forecasts for the sector. Targets were 
designed to be stretching in order to drive desired behaviours and 
increase motivation and focus. The Group bonus targets for 2017 
were as follows:
Threshold Target Maximum Achievement Bonus payout
Group profit  
before tax £90.8M £96.6M £102.3M £105.6M 60.0%
Mexico credit 
issued growth – 10.0% 14.0% 12.9% 9.0%
IPF Digital credit 
issued growth – 40.0% 52.0% 43.6% 7.6%
Bonus targets were adjusted to exclude FX benefit.
Performance against the Group profit before tax targets (adjusted  
to exclude the positive FX impact) reflected the strong performance 
in 2017. Mexico credit issued grew by 12.9% despite the impact of 
two earthquakes that hit Mexico in September. The Committee 
considered the impact of these events on the targets set but 
decided not to make any adjustment to the targets or exercise 
discretion in respect of performance outcomes. Growth in IPF Digital 
credit issued of 43.6% reflects the continued momentum of this 
business, and the key growth opportunity it offers the Group. 50%  
of the bonus earned will be deferred into shares for three years. International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 71
Corporate Governance
Having reviewed the executive directors' performance against their personal objectives and in the context of the challenges faced by the 
business in 2017, the Committee determined that the Executive Directors met their personal objectives. Consequently the bonus pay-out in 
respect of personal objectives is 20% calculated as follows:
• Maximum available (20%) 
• Application of outstanding rating multiplier (100%) 
• Bonus pay-out for personal objectives = 20% (20% x 100%)
Bonus outcome for 2017
The Committee awarded bonuses to the executive directors of the amounts shown below for the year ended 31 December 2017.

The bonus is payable as 50% in cash, and 50% in deferred shares, which will vest at the end of a three-year period, subject to the executive 
director not being dismissed for misconduct. There are also provisions for clawback, with respect to the cash element of the bonus and 
malus with respect to the deferred elements of the bonus, as detailed on page 66.
Pension
The Company has two pension schemes, the International Personal Finance plc Pension Scheme (‘the Pension Scheme’) and the 
International Personal Finance Stakeholder Pension Scheme (‘the Stakeholder Scheme’). New employees are eligible to join the Stakeholder 
Scheme. The rate of Company pension contribution for the Chief Executive Officer is 20% of base salary and for the Chief Financial Officer is 
15% of base salary.
At the discretion of the Committee, this may be paid wholly or, in part, as a cash allowance.
The Company’s contributions in respect of Gerard Ryan during 2017 amounted to £88,752, all of which was paid as a cash allowance.
The Company’s contributions in respect of Justin Lockwood during 2017 amounted to £31,087, £12,914 of which was paid as a

social security contributions) must be retained until the requirement is met. Executive directors’ current holdings against the guideline are 
disclosed on page 74.  Directors’ Remuneration report continued

on a one-for-one or a one-for-three basis. There are no further performance conditions attached to the vesting of the deferred shares.
The matching awards will vest only to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied, being the same three measures as set out in 
the LTIP section above. The following table sets out details of awards of nil-cost options made during the year under the DSP:

Management Team ('CMT') is the selected comparator group (currently 11 individuals with complete 2016 and 2017 service as CMT 
members, and 13 individuals in total), due to the structure of their remuneration package, and the ability to make a meaningful comparison 
between the pay of the Chief Executive Officer and the comparator group.

The interests of each person who has served as a director of the Company during the year as at 31 December 2017 (together with interests 
held by his or her persons closely associated) are shown in the table below. A number of non-executive directors are below the shareholding 
requirement, which they are expected to build up within three years of appointment to the Board. Jayne Almond and John Mangelaars are 
currently within this three year time period. When both Cathryn Riley and Richard Moat bought shares they bought sufficient to meet the 
shareholding requirement. Executive directors are required to retain half of any vested Company share scheme options until the 
shareholding requirement is met.

Corporate Governance
Statement of implementation
Directors’ remuneration policy in the following 
financial year
The base salary for the Chief Executive Officer will be set at £520,000 
for 2018.
The base salary for the Chief Financial Officer will be set at £280,000 
for 2018.
Pension and benefits are in line with benefits stated in the 2017 
Policy table.
Under the 2017 Policy the maximum opportunity is 100% of base 
salary and the on-target opportunity is 65% of base salary. The 
performance measures are 80% on financial and strategic 
objectives and 20% on personal objectives, as per the 2017 Policy 
rules. Targets are not disclosed on a forward-looking basis because 
they are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive and 
will continue to be disclosed retrospectively to ensure transparency. 
The Committee expects to make 2018 LTIP awards in accordance 
with the 2017 Policy, but at the time of publishing the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements the awards and associated targets had 
not yet been tabled at the Committee for approval. The 2018 LTIP 
awards made, and the associated targets, will be disclosed at the 
latest in next year's Directors' Remuneration report.
It is expected that the LTIP (PSP and DSP matching shares) awards 
granted to the executive directors during 2015 will not vest in 2018. 
Consideration by the directors of matters 
relating to directors’ remuneration
The following directors were members of the Remuneration 
Committee when matters relating to the directors’ remuneration for 
the year were being discussed and are considered to 
be independent:
• Cathryn Riley (Chair) • Jayne Almond
• Tony Hales • Richard Moat
The Committee received assistance from the senior management 
team and Neil Robson (Group Head of Reward). Other members of 
management may attend meetings by invitation except when 
matters relating to their own remuneration are being discussed.
Advisor to the Committee
Willis Towers Watson, which was appointed in April 2016, provides 
independent remuneration advice to the Committee. During 2017 
total fees in respect of advice to the Committee (based on time and 
materials) totalled £70,000 (excluding VAT). Willis Towers Watson is a 
founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group  
and signatory to, and abides by, the Remuneration Consultants 
Group Code of Conduct. Further details can be found at  
www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. The Committee is satisfied 
that the advice it receives is objective and independent, and that 
Willis Towers Watson does not have any connections with the 
Company that may impair its independence.

Directors’ report
Compliance with  
the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
“Faced with a challenging 
external environment, we 
remain resolutely steadfast in 
maintaining our high standards 
of internal governance.”
Dan O'Connor
Chairman
A: Leadership
A.1: The role of the Board
The Board is responsible for the long-term success of the business 
and for ensuring that the business operates in the best interests  
of all its stakeholders. The Board report on pages 48 to 50 gives 
details of the Board's role and work in 2017 and forms part of this 
Directors' report. The Board meets regularly throughout the year 
providing leadership and strategic direction. Our strategy can be 
found on pages 12 and 13 and our business model on pages 8 
and 9. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved specifically 
for decision by the Board, published at www.ipfin.co.uk. Other 
matters are delegated specifically to six principal Board 
Committees. The Chairman of each Committee briefs the Board 
at each meeting on the principal items that were discussed, 
decisions made and key issues. Their terms of reference are also 
available at www.ipfin.co.uk and from the Company Secretary.
The day-to-day running of the business is delegated to the 
Executive Committee. In 2017, this comprised the Chief Executive 
Officer, the Interim Chief Financial Officer (until 23 February 2017) 
and the Chief Financial Officer (from 23 February 2017). The 
Executive Committee met frequently during the year to consider  
a wide range of matters.
The Disclosure Committee met as required to consider 
announcement obligations to the London and Warsaw Stock 
Exchanges. During 2017, it comprised the Chief Executive Officer, 
the Interim Chief Financial Officer (until 23 February 2017) and the 
Chief Financial Officer thereafter, and the Company Secretary.  
It met 10 times.
For our statement of overall compliance  
see page 45
Our governance framework extends to operational activities, with 
decision-making and oversight responsibilities delegated to a series 
of Group governance committees, as shown in ‘Our governance 
and oversight structure’ at www.ipfin.co.uk.
A.2: Division of responsibilities
The Board has approved a statement of the division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman (see A.3 below), the Senior Independent 
Director (see A.4 below) and the Chief Executive Officer.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for developing and 
implementing the strategy agreed by the Board and for all executive 
matters (apart from those reserved to the Board and the Board 
Committees) and delegates accordingly.
A.3: The Chairman
The Chairman is responsible for chairing Board meetings and 
monitoring their effectiveness, and chairing the AGM and 
Nomination Committee. The Chairman was independent on 
appointment. The ongoing test of independence does not apply  
to the Chairman.
A.4: Non-executive directors
The independent non-executive directors have been appointed for  
a fixed period of three years, subject to re-election by shareholders. 
The initial period may be extended for a further period. Their letters  
of appointment may be inspected at our registered office and  
are available from the Company Secretary. Jayne Almond, a 
non-executive director, has advised the Board that she will not be 
seeking re-election at the Company's 2018 AGM.
Each of the non-executive directors has been formally determined 
by the Board to be independent for the purposes of the Code. In the 
case of Tony Hales, the Board is cognisant of the fact that he will 
have served than 10 years as a director at the time of the next AGM. 
The Board has considered his position carefully in light of his tenure, 
and is of the view that he continues to be fully independent in 
character and judgment, and that his experience remains 
invaluable to the Company.
Tony Hales is the Senior Independent Director. He is available to 
shareholders should they have concerns which contact through  
the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer has failed to address or for which such contact is 
inappropriate. The Senior Independent Director will review the 
performance of the Chairman on an annual basis. In carrying out 
this review, the Senior Independent Director will consult with other  International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 79
Corporate Governance
Board members and consider the relationship between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive Officer.
The Chairman has held a number of sessions with the non-executive 
directors without executive directors present, and the non-executive 
directors have met without the Chairman.
Where directors have concerns about the running of the Company, 
which cannot be resolved, these are recorded in the Board minutes. 
No such concerns have been raised during the period under review.
B: Effectiveness
B.1: The composition of the Board
At 31 December 2017, the Board comprised five non-executive 
directors, two executive directors and the Chairman. Biographical 
details and committee membership are shown on pages 46 and 47. 
Details of our diversity policy can be found in the Nomination 
Committee report on page 52.
B.2: Appointments to the Board
Justin Lockwood, our Chief Financial Officer, was appointed to the 
Board on 23 February 2017. Further detail relating to the recruitment 
process under way to find a new Senior Independent Director can 
be found in the Nomination Committee report on pages 51 and 52.
B.3: Commitment
Our policy is that the Chairman and the non-executive directors 
should have sufficient time to fulfil their duties, including chairing 
a Board Committee as appropriate. A non-executive director 
should not hold more than four other material non-executive 
directorships. If he/she holds an executive role in a FTSE 350 
company, he/she should not hold more than two other material 
non-executive directorships.
The Board has approved a policy on other directorships; any request 
for an exception to this is considered on its merits. An executive 
director will be permitted to hold one non-executive directorship 
(and to retain the fees from that appointment) provided that the 
Board considers this will not affect his/her executive 
responsibilities adversely.
The external commitments of the Chairman, Senior Independent 
Director and non-executive directors have been reviewed and the 
Board is satisfied that these do not conflict with the commitment 
required of them to the Company.
B.4: Development
Our policy is to provide appropriate training to directors. Training 
takes into account each individual’s qualifications and experience 
and includes environmental, social and governance training as 
appropriate. Training needs are reviewed annually following the 
outcome of the Board evaluation process. Training also covers 
generic and specific business topics and in 2017 included 
presentations to the Board on subjects including cyber security  
and the General Data Protection Regulation. A comprehensive, 
individually tailored induction plan is prepared for new directors.  
The Board also visited Poland and received updates from the home 
credit and IPF Digital management teams in this market.
Case study: Meeting our teams in Poland –  
a personal perspective
"As a long-standing member of the Board, I have regularly 
visited our markets over the years and benefited greatly from the 
time spent discussing the business directly with our teams and 
visiting customers in their homes with our agents. Understanding 
at first-hand from those on the ground has never been more 
important than in 2017 when, together with the rest of the Board, 
I visited Poland and spent two full days both being briefed and 
in turn constructively challenging the management teams from 
our home credit and IPF Digital businesses.
In our discussions with the home credit team, we focused 
particularly on tax and other regulatory matters. I was 
particularly impressed by the energy, enthusiasm and sheer 
resilience displayed by the team as they navigate the 
complexities these bring. Their detailed understanding of the 
issues they face and determination to find solutions was great to 
see. It was also good to be able to convey face to face the level 
of support they have from myself and the rest of the Board in 
addressing these additional business complexities.
I was similarly impressed with the drive shown by our IPF Digital 
team as they develop and grow this increasingly important part 
of the business. I saw an agile and creative group of people, 
committed to opening up new channels and product 
opportunities to both new and existing customers where 
balancing growth with appropriate risk management is critical."
Tony Hales
Senior Independent Director
B.5: Information and support
All directors are able to consult with the Company Secretary, who 
also updates the Board on developments relating to governance as 
appropriate. The appointment and removal of the Company 
Secretary is a matter for the Board. Ben Murphy, the former Group 
Legal Director and Company Secretary, was Company Secretary 
until he left IPF on 20 January 2017. The role of Company Secretary 
was then undertaken on an interim basis by Trudy Ellis until the 
appointment of James Ormrod as Chief Legal Officer and Company 
Secretary on 7 June 2017. The Company Secretary is secretary to the 
Board Committees. Any director may take independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense relating to the performance of 
his/her duties.
The team in Poland present to the Board during their two day visit. 80
B.6: Board and Committee evaluation
In 2017, the Board and its Committees carried out an internal 
evaluation of their performance facilitated by the Company 
Secretary. Directors and Committee members completed a 
questionnaire, the results of which were collated and presented for 
discussion at the December 2017 Board meeting. Details of the 
principal outcomes relating to the Board can be found on page 49.
An external evaluation is required by the Code at least every three 
years. Externally facilitated evaluation was last undertaken in late 
2016, led by David Mensley of EquityCommunications Limited, who 
has no other connection with IPF. We intend to carry out our next 
externally facilitated evaluation in 2019.
B.7: Election/re-election
Under our Articles of Association, each director must offer himself/
herself for re-election every three years. Jayne Almond, a  
non-executive director, has advised the Board that she will not be 
seeking re-election at the Company's 2018 AGM. After nine years,  
a director, other than an executive director, must offer himself/herself 
for re-election annually. A director who is appointed initially by the 
Board is subject to election at the next AGM. Consequently, the 
Chief Financial Officer, Justin Lockwood, stood for election at our 
AGM in 2017. In accordance with best corporate governance 
practice, all directors will offer themselves for re-election again at  
our AGM on 4 May 2018. Details of the directors, including their  
key strengths and contributions, are shown on pages 46 and 47.
C: Accountability
C.1: Financial and business reporting
A statement of the directors’ responsibilities in relation to the 
Financial Statements and the Group’s status as a going concern  
is on page 35. The Group’s strategy and business model, key 
performance indicators and relevant risks are on pages 8 and 9,  
12 and 13, 18 and 19 and 38 to 43. A statement confirming that the 
Board considers that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, 
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy  
is on page 88.
C.2: Risk management and internal control
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Company, including those that would threaten our 
business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. Details can 
be found on pages 36 to 43. The Board determines the Company’s 
risk appetite and has established risk management procedures and 
systems of internal control. On behalf of the Board, the Audit and Risk 
Committee has monitored the Group’s systems of internal control 
and its processes for managing principal risks throughout 2017.
C.3: Audit Committee and auditors
The report of the Audit and Risk Committee is set out on pages 53 to 
57. This details its composition, role and responsibilities, work during 
2017, interactions with the external auditor and our policy regarding 
external auditor tendering and rotation. The Committee’s terms of 
reference are available at www.ipfin.co.uk.
D: Remuneration
D.1: The level and components of remuneration
Full details of the Company’s policy on remuneration are contained 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 77.
Directors’ report continued
D.2: Procedure
Development of the policy on executive remuneration is delegated 
to the Remuneration Committee. Details are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. No director is involved in deciding his/her 
own remuneration.
E: Relations with shareholders
E.1: Dialogue with shareholders
The executive directors communicate with institutional shareholders 
regularly. The Chairman and Senior Independent Director also meet 
with shareholders from time to time. The Chairman is responsible for 
ensuring that appropriate channels of communication are 
established between the executive directors and shareholders and 
for ensuring that the views of major shareholders are made known  
to the Board. A programme of investor engagement is in place and 
the Board is updated on a regular basis. The Board is also briefed 
regularly on shareholdings and, twice a year, we seek feedback 
from major shareholders on their views on strategy, performance 
and management.
The Board seeks to present IPF’s position and prospects clearly.  
The Annual Report and Financial Statements, circulars and 
announcements made to the London and Warsaw Stock Exchanges 
are posted on our website: www.ipfin.co.uk.
Shareholders, whatever the size of their shareholding, are able to 
express their views via email or telephone to the Investor 
Relations Manager.
The Investors section of our website gives shareholders and potential 
investors access to a wealth of Company information.
Case study: Investor engagement
As a publicly listed company, we are required to provide fair, 
balanced and understandable information to enable investors 
to understand our business fully so that they may make an 
informed investment decision. In 2017, we continued our 
investor engagement programme undertaking a range of 
meetings, conference calls, webcasts, roadshows, a 
Chairman’s lunch and results presentations. The main areas of 
interest were performance, regulation, the potential impact of 
tax matters, funding and our digital lending strategy. One of the 
key communication challenges of the year was to educate 
investors, analysts and debt providers on the impact of the new 
accounting standard IFRS 9, which became effective on 
1 January 2018. Around 30 investor relations stakeholders 
attended a technical briefing hosted by CFO Justin Lockwood 
and Sue Taylor, (Group Financial Controller) in November 2017 
and we continue to support investors and analysts with 
guidance as they redevelop their IPF financial models to take 
into account the new standard. Further information on IFRS 9 
can be found in the Financial review on pages 33 and 34.
Around 30 people attended our IFRS 9 technical briefing. International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 81
Corporate Governance
E.2: Constructive use of general meetings
We give at least 20 working days’ notice of the AGM. Our policy is 
that the Chairman of each of the Board Committees will be available 
to answer questions from shareholders and there is an opportunity 
for shareholders to ask questions on each resolution proposed. 
Details of proxy votes are made available to shareholders and other 
interested parties by means of an announcement to the London 
Stock Exchange, the Warsaw Stock Exchange and on our website.
Case study: An opportunity to meet  
shareholders at our 2017 AGM
Our last AGM took place on 3 May 2017 at our UK head office in 
Leeds. This gave shareholders the opportunity to meet our Board 
face to face and to ask questions. Twenty-two resolutions were 
put to shareholders and all were passed. One of the main items 
of business was a resolution to approve our new Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, the previous policy having reached its 
renewal point. Over 99% of shareholders who registered their 
vote voted in favour of the new policy. The approved policy, 
which is set out on pages 62 to 68, was revised to align our 
executive reward structure with our evolved strategy, taking into 
account investor feedback received during a consultation 
process. It is important for us to have the right incentives in place 
to motivate everyone to deliver our strategy. It was, therefore, 
pleasing that shareholders also overwhelmingly approved new 
rules for equity incentive schemes, which cover a broad range 
of employees in the organisation. Details of these can be found 
on page 84, We look forward to meeting shareholders again at 
our 2018 AGM and hope that you will be able to join us in Leeds 
on Friday 4 May 2018.
Shareholders are invited each year to the AGM. Our 2018 AGM will 
be held at 10.30am on Friday 4 May 2018 at International Personal 
Finance plc, Number Three Leeds City Office Park, Meadow Lane, 
Leeds LS11 5BD. An explanation of the items of business will be 
contained in the Notice of Annual General Meeting 2018 to be sent 
to shareholders and dated 20 March 2018.

Secretary or from Companies House in the UK.
Share capital
Details of our share capital are shown in note 27. On 
31 December 2017, there were 234,244,437 ordinary shares of 10 
pence each in issue. No shares were issued during the year. None 
were bought back, transferred to treasury or cancelled. The ordinary 
shares can be held in certificated or uncertificated form.
Appointment and removal of directors
The Board may appoint any person as a director of the Company to 
hold office until the next AGM, when they may stand for election by 
shareholders. Under the Articles, directors retire by rotation on a 
three-yearly basis. However, in line with the Code, all directors of the 
Company stand for re-election annually.
Directors’ powers
Authority to purchase shares
At the 2017 AGM, we received shareholder authority to buy back up 
to 22,258,133 of our own shares until the earlier of the conclusion of 
the 2018 AGM or 2 August 2018. Any ordinary shares so purchased 
could be cancelled or held in treasury. This authority was not 
exercised in 2017. A further authority to purchase our own shares will 
be sought at the 2018 AGM.
Power to allot securities and pre-emptive rights
As at 31 December 2017, the directors had authority to allot further 
securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of £7,419,000 and, 
broadly, up to a further £7,419,000 for a rights issue. Further 
authorities will be sought at the 2018 AGM including the 
disapplication of pre-emption rights in certain circumstances.
Borrowing powers and other restrictions
The directors are responsible for the management of the Company 
and may exercise all the powers of the Company, subject to the 
provisions of the relevant statutes and our Articles. For example, our 
Articles contain specific provisions and restrictions regarding IPF’s 
powers to borrow money; provisions relating to the appointment of 
directors, subject to subsequent shareholder approval; delegation of 
powers to a director or committees; and, subject to certain 
exceptions, a director shall not vote on or be counted in a quorum in 
relation to any resolution of the Board in respect of any contract in 
which he/she has an interest which he/she knows is material.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
To take account of the Companies Act 2006, the directors adopted 
a policy on conflicts of interest and established a register of conflicts. 
The directors consider that these procedures have operated 
effectively in 2017 and up to 1 March 2018.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
Our Articles permit us to indemnify our directors (or those of any 
associated company) in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
However, no qualifying indemnity provisions were in force in 2017 or 
at any time up to 1 March 2018 other than under the International 
Personal Finance plc Pension Scheme (the ‘Pension Scheme’). 
Under the deed establishing the Pension Scheme, we grant an 
indemnity to the trustee and the directors of the trustee. Two of these 
directors are directors of subsidiaries of IPF. We have appropriate 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in place.
Shareholders
Shareholders’ rights and obligations
The full rights and obligations attached to the Company’s ordinary 
shares, in addition to those conferred on their holders by law, are set 
out in our Articles. A summary of those rights and obligations can be 
found below.
Restrictions on shareholders’ rights 
Subject to any rights attached to existing shares, any share may be 
issued with or have attached to it such rights and restrictions as the 
Company may decide by ordinary resolution or, if no such resolution 
has been passed or so far as the resolution does not make specific 
provision, as the Board may decide. Such rights and restrictions shall 
apply to the relevant shares as if the same were set out in 
the Articles.
Restrictions on holding securities
No person shall be recognised by the Company as holding any 
share upon any trust.
Transfer
There are no restrictions on the transfer (including requirements for 
prior approval of any transfers) or limitations on the holding of 
ordinary shares save that the Board may refuse to register the 
transfer of:
• a partly-paid share;
• an uncertificated share in the circumstances set out in the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001; and
• a certificated share if a duly executed transfer is not provided 
together with any necessary document of authority.
Voting
There are no restrictions on voting rights except as set out in the 
Articles (in circumstances where the shareholder has not complied 
with a statutory notice or paid up what is due on the shares).
Alteration of share capital and variation of rights
Sub-division: any resolution authorising the Company to sub-divide its 
shares, or any of them, may determine that, as between the shares 
resulting from the sub-division, any of them may have any 
preference or advantage or be subject to any restriction as 
compared with the others.
Fractions: whenever as a result of a consolidation and sub-division or 
sub-division of shares any holders would become entitled to fractions 
of a share, the Board may deal with the fractions as it thinks fit 
including by aggregating and selling them or by dealing with them 
in some other way. 
Variation of rights: subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, all 
or any of the rights attached to any existing class of shares may from 
time to time be varied either with the consent in writing of the holders 
of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares 
of that class (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury 
shares) or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a 
separate general meeting of the holders of those shares. International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 83

Agreements on change of control
We do not have any agreements with any director or employee that 
would provide compensation for loss of office or employment 
resulting from a takeover.
We are not party to any significant agreements that would take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control following a 
takeover bid, apart from:
• our bank facility agreements, which provide for a negotiation 
period following a change of control and the ability of a lender to 
cancel its commitment and for outstanding amounts to become 
due and payable;
• our Euro Medium Term Note 
1
 programme, which entitles any 
holder of a Note to require us to redeem such holder’s Notes if 
there is a change of control and, following such change of 
control, the Notes are downgraded;
• our Polish Medium Term Note 
2
 programme, which entitles any 
holder of a Note to require the issuer to redeem such holder’s 
Notes if there is a change of control and, following such change 
of control, the Euro Medium Term Notes are then downgraded (or 
if no such Notes are then outstanding, in certain other 
circumstances); and
• provisions in our share incentive plans may cause awards granted 
to directors and employees to vest on a takeover.
1. The Euro Medium Term Note programme was established in 2010. The 
following Notes (listed on the London or Irish Stock Exchanges) have been 
issued under the programme and are outstanding as at the date of this 
report: Hungarian forint 4 billion issued in January 2013 with a five-year term 
and an 11.0% coupon; sterling 101.5 million issued in May 2013 and 
November 2013 with a seven-year term and a 6.125% coupon; Czech crown 
250 million issued in November 2013 with a five-year term and a 5.25% 
coupon; euro 300.0 million issued in April 2014 with a seven-year term and a 
5.75% coupon; euro 28.25 million issued in May 2014 with a four-year term 
and a 4.25% coupon; euro 100 million ‘tap’ of our existing Eurobond issued 
in April 2015 with a six-year maturity and a 5.75% coupon; Czech crown 
200 million issued in December 2015 with a three-year term and a 5.5% 
coupon; Romanian lei 43.5 million and 22.0 million bonds issued in 
December 2015 with a three-year term and a 7.0% coupon; Romanian lei 
79.5 million bond issued in December 2016 with a three-year term and a 
8.0% coupon (listed on the Irish Stock Exchange); and euro 12 million ‘tap’ 
of our existing Eurobond issued in December 2017 with a three-and-a-half 
year maturity and a 5.75% coupon.
2. Under the Polish Medium Term Note programme, a subsidiary company, IPF 
Investments Polska Sp. z o.o., issued 200 million Polish zloty Notes which are 
listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange; they mature on 3 June 2020 and the 
coupon is a floating rate of six-month WIBOR plus a margin of 425 
basis points.
Financial instruments
Information on financial instruments is given on pages 34 and 35 
and in notes 20, 21 and 22 to the Financial Statements on pages 117 
to 124.
Profit and dividends
Our policy is to adopt a progressive dividend policy, reflecting the 
profitability of the Group’s businesses together with its capital and 
cash flow requirements, to target a pay-out ratio of 35% of earnings. 
Details of the proposed final dividend for 2017 payable in 2018 can 
be found on page 33. Details of past dividend payments can be 
found on page 137.
Employees
Employee engagement and communication
Employee engagement is key to our people strategy. In 2017, a 
number of markets surveyed their employees locally to understand 
their views and measure engagement. Engagement continues to be 
a strong focus and it is planned that we conduct a Group-wide 
survey in 2018.
We update employees on matters that concern them via staff 
meetings and our intranet and, where appropriate, seek feedback 
on decisions that affect their interests. Our ‘Ask Gerard/Tell Gerard’ 
process gives employees a direct communication channel with our 
CEO. We also update employees on financial and economic factors 
impacting the Company and management promotes a culture 
where two-way communication is encouraged.  84

Employee benefit trust
We operate an employee trust with an independent trustee, Link 
Trustees (Jersey) Limited, to hold shares pending employees 
becoming entitled to them under our equity incentive schemes. On 
31 December 2017, the trustees held 518,008 shares in International 
Personal Finance plc. The trust waives its dividend entitlement and 
abstains from voting at general meetings. Shares to be acquired 
through our share plans rank pari passu with the shares in issue and 
have no special rights. In addition, initial shares purchased by 
overseas employees in The International Personal Finance plc Have 
Your Share Plan are held in an employee trust operated by Link 
Market Services Trustees (Nominees) Limited pending maturity of 
the plan.
Employment policies
Equal opportunities
The Group is an equal opportunities employer. It is our policy that no 
job applicant, member of staff or agent will receive less favourable 
treatment because of race, colour, nationality, ethnic or other 
national origin, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, age, 
disability or religion. The aim of this policy is to ensure that recruitment 
and progression opportunities are open to all and are based purely 
on merit,with all employees having the same access to training and 
career development.
Human rights, diversity and modern slavery
Our approach to human rights and diversity is outlined on page 23. 
Information on the gender split across the Group at 31 December 2017 
is shown on page 23. Our Board diversity policy is described on page 
52. Our statement on the Modern Slavery Act 2015 is available on 
our website at www.ipfin.co.uk.
Whistle-blowing service
We have a third-party whistle-blowing service in operation. This allows 
employees to raise issues of concern about possible improprieties in 
matters of financial reporting or otherwise on a confidential and, if 
preferred, anonymous basis. Reports are received on any matters 
raised through these services and we monitor their use throughout 
the Group.
Anti-bribery policy
The Group is committed to conducting its affairs so as to combat 
bribery and corruption. The Group’s trading activities must be 
conducted with honesty and integrity and in accordance with the 
law, ensuring that the Group is compliant with the anti-bribery and/
or anti-corruption legislation of any jurisdiction applicable from time 
to time to any Group company. The Group operates controls and 
procedures to ensure that no one acting on its behalf:
• offers, promises or gives a bribe;
• requests, agrees to accept or receives a bribe; nor
• bribes a public official to obtain or retain business or 
an advantage. International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 85
Corporate Governance
All companies, employees and agents are required to comply with 
the relevant anti-bribery and corruption legislation in their markets. In 
addition, because of the extra-territorial application of the UK Bribery 
Act 2010 to overseas subsidiaries, all employees and agents are also 
required to comply with the provisions of this Act.
Other external stakeholders
Supplier policy statement
We agree terms and conditions for our business transactions with 
suppliers and payment is made in accordance with them, subject to 
the terms and conditions being met by the supplier. International 
Personal Finance plc acts as a holding company and had no 
material trade creditors at 31 December 2017. The average number 
of days’ credit taken by the Group during the year was 33 days 
(2016: 27 days).
External oversight 
The Group’s activities in Mexico and Spain are subject to general 
trade licences only, as opposed to any licensing or supervision by a 
financial authority. A licensing regime was introduced in the Czech 
Republic in 2016 and the business there was granted a licence by 
the Czech National Bank in February 2018. In Poland, the Group’s 
home credit business, Provident Polska s.a,, and the Group’s digital 
business, IPF Polska sp. z o.o., are registered in the special register  
of the Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego (‘KNF’) (the Polish Financial 
Supervision Authority). In Lithuania, the business is included in a 
register of credit providers maintained by the National Bank and in 
Finland by the Regional State Administrative Agency of South 
Finland. As reported in our Q3 2017 trading update, there were 
further regulatory changes in Romania, which will mean that from 
early March 2018 we expect our business there to be supervised  
by the National Bank of Romania for the first time. The Group’s 
operation in Hungary is subject to an operating licence issued by  
the National Bank, in Estonia to a licence issued by the Financial 
Supervision Authority, and in Latvia to a licence from the Consumer 
Rights Protection Centre. The business in Australia holds a credit 
licence issued by the Australia Securities and Investment 
Commission (Australia). Following the wind-down of the business in 
Slovakia, its operating licence was surrendered in January 2018.
Budgetary process and financial reporting
The Board approves a detailed budget each year (usually in 
December) for the year ahead. Actual performance against budget 
is monitored regularly and reported monthly for review by the 
directors. The Board requires its subsidiaries to operate in 
accordance with corporate policies.
The financial statements for the Group are prepared by aggregating 
submissions from each statutory entity. Prior to submission to  
the Group reporting team, each country submission is reviewed  
and approved by the Finance Director of the relevant country.  
When the submissions have been aggregated and consolidation 
adjustments made to remove intercompany transactions, the 
consolidated result is reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer. The 
results are compared with the budget and prior year figures, and 
any significant variances are clarified. Checklists are completed by 
each statutory entity and by the Group reporting team to confirm 
that all required controls, such as key reconciliations, have been 
performed and reviewed.
The financial statements, which are agreed directly to the 
consolidation of the Group results, are prepared by the Group 
reporting team and reviewed by the Group Head of Finance and  
the Chief Financial Officer. The supporting notes to the financial 
statements are prepared by aggregating submission templates from 
each market and combining them with central information where 
applicable. The financial statements and all supporting notes are 
reviewed and approved by the Chief Financial Officer and they are 
signed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. 86
Directors’ report continued
Case study: Business ethics –  
finding the right way
During 2017, we continued to strengthen our business ethics 
programme. We introduced an ethics board game which is 
tailored to our business and allows home credit employees in the 
field to discuss and explore our Code of Ethics within the context  
of their everyday roles. The game encourages interactive ethical 
reflection and helps to empower employees with the skills and 
tools they need to make ethical decisions and to challenge any 
behaviour they believe to be unethical. Overall, 98% of employees 
and 91% of agents completed business ethics training successfully 
in 2017.
Once again, we ran a business-wide ethics event in 2017, which 
included a live webcast with Gerard Ryan and other senior 
business leaders. During the event, employees had the chance to 
ask questions and give their opinions through a smartphone app.
Report on environment, social and governance 
(‘ESG’) matters
The Board takes regular account of the significance of ESG matters 
to the Group and has identified and assessed the significance of 
ESG risks to the Company’s short and long-term value as part of the 
risk management process. It recognises that a proactive programme 
of reputation management through a range of progressive, 
responsible business initiatives adds to the sustainable long-term 
value of the Company. Responsibility for this area rests with the Chief 
Executive Officer who sits on the Reputation and Regulation 
Committee, which sets guidance, provides direction and oversees 
policies and progress on ESG matters. There is a range of 
appropriate corporate standards, policies and governance 
structures covering all operations.
Key ESG issues that impact our stakeholders are: business ethics; 
public perception and ensuring that work with communities is 
relevant; social and financial exclusion; health and safety; and 
attracting and retaining skilled and well-motivated people.
Employees in the Czech Republic debate ethical issues using the IPF ethics 
board game.
Corporate affairs activity, health and safety, people management, 
responsible lending and business ethics issues were all discussed at 
Board meetings in 2017. The Board has received adequate 
information to make an assessment against ESG risks.
We view the health and safety of our employees, agents and other 
people who may be affected by our activities as a key strategic 
priority. Our arrangements for safety have been independently 
assessed against OHSAS 18001 and our home credit markets, 
including Group head office, were certified as compliant. An update 
on the framework is reported annually to the Board. Each subsidiary 
board is responsible for the implementation of its own health and 
safety policy and health and safety is considered regularly at Group 
board meetings. We provide helplines in all home credit markets to 
provide support and guidance for agents and staff concerned 
about their safety or wellbeing.
No political donations were made.
Community investment 
Community investment activity is focused on the needs of the communities we serve and we utilise London Benchmarking Group 
(‘LBG’) methodology to measure this investment.
£680,000
invested in local communities across the Group (2016: £488,878)
3,056
hours volunteered by employees in Company time (2016: 3,545) 
and a further 1,935 hours in their own time
£114,000

When setting incentives, the Remuneration Committee takes 
account of all implications, including the need to avoid motivating 
inappropriate behaviour inadvertently. In setting performance 
targets, account is taken of ESG risks. Details of the bonus scheme 
are set out in the bonus section of the statement of the Company’s 
policy on directors’ remuneration in the Directors’ Remuneration 
report on pages 63 and 71. ESG matters are also taken into account 
in the training of directors.
Full information on specific ESG matters, and how these are 
managed, can be found in the sustainability section of the 
Company’s website (www.ipfin.co.uk).

Carbon reporting
We have reported on all of the carbon emissions sources required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013. Our emissions data has been calculated in line with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard, and we have used emissions factors from the UK Government’s Greenhouse Gas Conversion Factor Repository. The 
emissions data covers:
• our UK head office;
• home credit operations in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico and Romania; and
• IPF Digital operations in Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Spain, Mexico and Australia.
These sources fall within our Consolidated Financial Statements. Where available data is incomplete we have extrapolated data.
In 2017, our GHG emissions for scope 1 and 2 decreased by 5.6%. When normalised by customer number our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
increased by 5.0%. In 2017, we have reported a greater proportion of gas data due to being able to obtain this data from landlords in Poland 
and Hungary for the first time. We have used this data to make an approximation of the full extent of data for 2013-2016 and are restating this 
data from previous reporting.
The decrease in business travel by car can be explained by a reduction in car fleet in some of our European established businesses as well 
as the closure of our operations in Slovakia, Lithuania and Bulgaria.
We aim to reduce our environmental impact where possible and our MyProvi programme is set to deliver resource efficiencies for the 
business. During 2018, we hope to realise paper savings through the reduction of administrative paper use in the field. By the end of the year, 
we expect to see digital collecting lists and receipting across our home credit operations in Europe. A full environmental policy statement 
can be found in the sustainability section of the Company’s website (www.ipfin.co.uk).

Directors’ statements
Annual Report and Financial Statements
International Personal Finance plc presents its own annual report 
and its Consolidated Annual Report as a single Annual Report.
Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the 
financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Financial Statements 
for each financial year. Under that law, the directors are required to 
prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the International Accounting 
Standard (‘IAS’) Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the 
Parent Company Financial Statements under IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union. Under company law, the directors must not 
approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and the Company 
for that period. In preparing these Financial Statements, IAS 1 
requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and

Report on the audit of the financial statements 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
• the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 
December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
• the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
• the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
We have audited the Financial Statements of International Personal 
Finance plc (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the 
‘Group’) which comprise: 
• the Group and Company income statement; 
• the Group and Company statement of comprehensive income; 
• the Group and Company balance sheets; 
• the Group and Company cash flow statements; 
• the Group and Company statements of changes in equity; 
• the Statement of accounting policies; and 
• the related notes 1 to 31. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and, as regards the Parent Company Financial Statements,  
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies  
Act 2006. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of  
our report.  
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in 
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the Financial Statements in the UK, including the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services 
prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the 
Group or the Parent Company. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going 
concern and viability statement 
Going concern 
We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 35 of the 
Financial Statements about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them 
and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s 
and company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 
12 months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements. 
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add 
or draw attention to in relation to that statement required by Listing 
Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the st atement is materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge obtained in the audit. 
We confirm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw 
attention to in respect of these matters. 
 
Summary of our audit approach 
Key audit matters 
The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were: 
• impairment of receivables  
• revenue recognition and calculation of the effective interest rate 
• accounting for the Polish tax audit challenge 
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with      and any key audit matters which are the same as 
the prior year identified with 
Materiality 
The materiality that we used in the current year was £5.0 million which was determined on the basis of 5% of profit 
before tax. The Parent Company materiality that we used in the current year was £2.5 million which was determined 
on the basis of 3% of net assets and capped at 50% of Group materiality. 
Scoping 
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide 
controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
Significant changes  
in our approach 
There have been no significant changes in our audit appro ach from the prior period ot her than the changes in key 
audit matters explained on page 90.  90

Principal risks and viability statement 
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering 
whether they were consistent with the knowledge we obtained in the 
course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the 
evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required 
to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention 
to in relation to: 
• the disclosures on pages 36-43 that describe the principal risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated; 
• the directors’ confirmation on page 36 that they have carried out 
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity; or 
• the directors’ explanation on page 43 as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have 
done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, 
and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to 
any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement 
relating to the prospects of the Group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R 
(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in  
the audit. 
We confirm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw 
attention to in respect of these matters. 
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matte rs that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial 
Statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
that we identified. These matters included those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the  
engagement team. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on  
these matters. 
In 2016, regulatory and legal risk was included as a key audit matter 
which was focused on the judgement required in relation to whether 
any provisions are required for customer remediation. The level of 
provisioning relating to legal and regulatory matters has not been 
material in recent years, however continued regulatory volatility may 
impact the future profitability of individual components. As such we 
consider the impact of regulatory changes within our going concern 
assessment. In addition going concern is not a key audit matter, and 
has therefore been considered above. 
 
Key audit matter description  How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter  Key observations 
Impairment of receivables  
Determining impairment provisions 
against customer receivables is highly 
judgemental, requiring estimates to be 
made of the likely loss within the lending 
portfolios. As detailed in note 16, net 
customer receivables amounted to 
£1,056.9 million as of 31 December 2017 
(2016: £939.9 million). 
We have identified the key impairment 
risks as being the estimation of future 
customer default rates for customers in 
arrears, and hence expected future cash 
flows for each portfolio.  
In addition, there is a risk that post model 
overlays made to account for emerging 
risks not yet observed in historical 
collection curves are inappropriate, with 
a specific focus on the impact of the 
Mexican earthquake and hurricanes in 
the current year. 
There is a potential risk of fraud inherent in 
the application of the post model overlay 
due to its judgemental nature and 
material impact on the final impairment 
figure and therefore profit for the year. 
The key audit matter is described further 
by the Audit and Risk Committee on 
page 55 and within the key assumptions 
and estimates on page 106. Please also 
see note 21 for further information. 
 
We evaluated the design, and tested the operating 
effectiveness of controls over the provisioning process, including 
the use of IT specialists within the audit team to test the key IT 
controls over the systems in which the source customer 
receivable data is maintained, and reviewing minutes from key 
management forums. 
Where necessary, we also tested the completeness and 
accuracy of information used by management to operate key 
lending controls, by extraction of source data from the core 
lending systems and independent recalculation of the  
relevant information.  
To test mechanical accuracy of provisioning we recalculated a 
sample of portfolio carrying values in accordance with the 
approved impairment provisioning policy and tested the 
accuracy of the arrears status of individual loan receivables on 
a sample basis to gain comfort over the accuracy of the 
impairment provision balance. We also assessed the 
implications of the above work on the accuracy and predictive 
nature of the cash forecasting curves. 
We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s key 
assumptions used in the impairment calculations for customer 
receivables, including the estimation of customer default rates 
and expected future cash flows for each portfolio. This involved 
assessing management’s tests of historical forecasting 
accuracy, and re-performing a sample of these tests using 
independent extracts of customer receivable collections data. 
We also challenged the appropriateness of historical data used 
to predict future collections performance by reference to 
internal and external factors affecting the business. 
Finally we reviewed and challenged the completeness and 
accuracy of management’s provisioning overlays, by reference 
to analysis of recent collections performance, other identified 
potential impairment risks and analysis of internal and  
external data.  
As a result of our audit  
testing we found that the 
assumptions used in the 
model to value customer 
receivables were 
appropriately applied,  
and that the impairment 
provision is considered to  
be reasonable. 
The rationale for the post-
model overlay proposed by 
Management is appropriate 
and the valuation is within an 
acceptable range.

Key audit matter description  How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter  Key observations 
Revenue recognition and the 
calculation of the effective interest 
rate 
The recognition of revenue on loans using an 
effective interest rate (“EIR”) method requires 
significant judgement by management to 
determine key assumptions, in particular the 
expected life of each loan and related cash flows.  
There is a risk around the accuracy and 
completeness of the cash flows that are included in 
Management’s calculation of the “EIR” for products 
issued, whilst additionally ensuring any evidence of 
early settlement behaviour has been considered.  
The key audit matter is described further by the 
Audit and Risk Committee on page 55 and within 
the key assumptions and estimates on page 106.  
We evaluated the design, and tested the operating 
effectiveness of controls in relation to revenue 
recognition, and the mechanical accuracy of the 
models used to calculate the effective interest rates. 
This involved the recalculation of a sample of product 
and cohort effective interest rates based upon an 
independent extract of source data from the core 
lending system. We also tested the completeness  
and accuracy of cash flow information included 
within the models. 
We assessed the appropriateness of management’s 
key assumptions used to calculate the effective 
interest rate by reference to the impact of recently 
observable early redemption behaviour on the 
average lives of loan receivables.  
We also confirmed that the revenue recognition 
policies applied to the material loan types offered by 
the Group were appropriate in accordance with IAS 
18 Revenue and applicable accounting standards.  
As a result of our audit  
testing, we found that the 
methodology used for the 
calculation of the EIR is 
materially accurate in the 
context of the accounting 
policies, and the requirements 
of the relevant accounting 
standards. 
Accounting for the Polish tax audit
challenge 
IPF Poland is subject to a corporation tax inspection 
covering the 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 tax years. 
In relation to the 2008 and 2009 tax years, the 
Group paid £37 million of tax and interest in 
January 2017, to allow an appeal process to begin. 
This amount is recognised as a debtor in line with 
IAS 12 Income Taxes. The case was listed to be 
heard by the District Administrative Court (“DAC”) 
on 22 November 2017 but following the instigation 
of Mutual Agreement Proceedings (“MAP”), the 
DAC stayed the hearings. The cases are not now 
expected to be heard until after the MAP process  
is concluded.  
Our key audit matter is focused on the recoverability 
of the tax debtor, the likelihood of any outflow of 
economic benefit in relation to 2010 and beyond, 
and hence the need for contingent liability 
disclosure or provision recognition requirements.  
The key audit matter is described further by the 
Audit and Risk Committee on page 55 and within 
the key assumptions and estimates on page 106. 
We evaluated the design, and tested the 
implementation of internal controls over accounting 
for the Polish tax audit challenge. This included 
reviewing minutes from key management review 
forums, and evaluating the process by which 
management commissioned and evaluated reports 
received from external tax advisers. 
Utilising tax specialists within the group and 
component audit teams, we have challenged 
management’s assessment of the ultimate exposure 
under the Polish tax enquiry by reference to 
correspondence with the relevant tax authorities, 
external specialist advice commissioned by 
management, our independent assessment of the 
exposures in the context of extant tax law, and our 
knowledge of similar scenarios. This work included 
sensitising the key assumptions made by 
management in the context of the eventual outcome 
of the case, and considering the implications in terms 
of whether provision was required against the tax 
debtor, or the potential exposure on subsequent  
tax years. 
 
Our independent analysis of 
the potential outcomes of the 
Polish tax audits indicated 
that management’s 
assumptions applied in 
assessing the exposure were 
reasonable and supportable.

Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
Financial Statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.  
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for 
the Financial Statements as a whole as follows: 
 
Group Financial  
Statements 
Parent Company Financial 
Statements 
Materiality £5.0 million (2016: £4.6 
million) 
£2.5 million (2016: £2.8 
million) 
Basis for 
determining 
materiality 
5% (2016: 5%) of forecast 
profit before tax 
3% (2016: 3%) of net assets, 
capped at 50% of Group 
materiality 
Rationale 
for the 
benchmark 
applied 
The accumulation of  
profits is critical to an 
investor and in allowing  
the Group to invest in  
the business. We have 
therefore selected profit 
before tax as the 
benchmark for 
determining materiality. 
The main operations of the 
Parent Company are to 
obtain external finance, 
with the main balances 
being the investments held 
in the subsidiaries and the 
external loan balances. We 
have therefore selected net 
assets as the benchmark 
for determining materiality. 
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would  
report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.25 
million (2016: £0.1 million) for the Group and £0.1 million (2016: £0.05 
million) for the Parent Company, as well as differences below that 
threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. The increase to our reporting threshold is due to a Deloitte 
methodology change from 2% to 5% of materiality. We also report  
to the Audit and Risk Committee on disclosure matters that we 
identified when assessing the overall presentation of the  
Financial Statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level. Based 
on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on 
the audit work at five locations, which were subject to a full audit, 
and one location which involved the testing of specified balances. 
The locations were based across Central Europe with the exception 
of Mexico. Together with the Group functions in the UK, which were 
also subject to a full audit, these seven locations represent the 
principal business units and account for 96% (2016: 96%) of the 
Group’s net assets, 95% (2016: 99%) of the Group’s revenue, 99% 
(2016: 96%) of the Group’s profit before tax and 95% (2016: 64%)  
of the losses before tax generated by components.  
They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for 
undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement 
identified above. Our audit work at the seven locations was 
executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity 
which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from £2.0 
million to £2.9 million (2016: £0.2 million to £2.8 million). 
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process 
and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the 
aggregated financial information of the remaining components not 
subject to audit or audit of specified account balances. 
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned 
visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor visit 
each of the locations where the group audit scope was focused at 
least once every three years. In years when we do not visit a 
significant component we will include the component audit partner 
and team in our team briefing, discuss their risk assessment, and 
review documentation of the findings from their work. In the current 
year the Senior Statutory Auditor visited Poland. 
Other information 
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the annual report 
including the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s 
Review, the Strategic Report, Principal Risks and Uncertainties, the 
Directors’ Report, the Corporate Governance Report, the Audit and 
Risk Committee Report and the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
other than the Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the  
other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly  
stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with 
the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a 
material misstatement in the Financial Statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. 
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to 
you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information 
include where we conclude that: 
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the 
directors that they consider the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or 
• Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the 
audit committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the audit committee; or 
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code – the parts of the directors’ statement required 
under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions 
specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.10R (2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Responsibilities of directors 
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement,  
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial 
Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, 
and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the Financial Statements, the directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group 
or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial 
Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is  
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these  
Financial Statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
Financial Statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditor’s report. 
Use of our report 
This report is made solely to th e Company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no ot her purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members  
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed. 
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 
Opinions on other matters prescribed  
by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of  
the audit: 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the Financial Statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Financial Statements; and 
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report have been prepared 
in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the 
strategic report or the directors’ report. 
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting 
records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion: 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent Company Financial Statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we ar e also required to report if  
in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have  
not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report  
to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records  
and returns. 
Other matters 
Auditor tenure 
Following the recommendation of the Board, we were appointed by 
the members of International Personal Finance on 11 May 2011 to 
audit the Financial Statements for the year ending 31 December 
2011 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total 
uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and 
reappointments of the firm is seven years, covering the years ending 
31 December 2011 to 31 December 2017. 
Consistency of the audit report with the additional 
report to the audit committee 
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit 
committee we are required to provide in accordance with ISAs (UK).

impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements will depend on the financial instruments that the Gr oup has 
during 2018 as well as on economic conditions and judgements made as at the year end. The Group has performed a preliminary 
assessment of the potential impact of adopting IFRS 9 based on the financial instruments and hedging relationships as at the da te of initial 
application of IFRS 9 (1 January 2018). 
Classification and measurement 
With respect to the classification and measurement of financial assets, the number of categories of financial assets under IFRS 9 has been 
reduced compared to IAS 39. Under IFRS 9 the classification of financial assets is based both on the business model within whic h the asset is 
held and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three principal classification categories for financ ial assets that are 
debt instruments: (i) amortised cost, (ii) fair value through ot her comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and (iii) fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL). Equity instruments in the scope of IFRS 9 are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised in profit or los s unless an 
irrevocable election is made to recognise gain s or losses in other comprehensive income.  
There will be no impact on the classification and measurement of the following financial assets held by the Group: derivative f inancial 
instruments; cash and cash equivalents; other receivables and current tax assets. 
There will be no change in the accounting for any financial liabilities. 
Impairment 
The impairment model under IFRS 9 reflects expected credit losses , as opposed to only incurred credit losses under IAS 39. Unde r the 
impairment approach in IFRS 9, it is not necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Ins tead, an entity 
always accounts for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit losses sh ould be 
updated at each reporting date. The new impairment model will apply to the Group’s financial assets that are measured at amorti sed costs. 
The Group expects to apply the simplified approach to recognise li fetime expected credit losses for amounts receivable from cus tomers as 
required or permitted for IFRS 9. The Group’s preliminary calcul ation of the loss allowance for these assets as at 1 January 20 18 is around 11 - 
13% million greater compared to IAS 
Determining an increase in credit risk since initial recognition 
IFRS 9 requires the recognition of 12 month expected credit losses (the expected credit losses from default events that are expected within  
12 months of the reporting date) if credit risk has not signific antly increased since initial recognition (stage 1) and lifetim e expected credit  100

100 
losses for financial instruments for which the credit risk has in creased significantly since initial recognition (stage 2) or w hich are credit 
impaired (stage 3). 
When determining whether the risk of default has increased sign ificantly since initial recognition the Group considers both qua ntitative and 
qualitative information based on the Group’s historical experience. 
The approach to identifying significant increases in credit risk is consistent across the Group’s products. In addition, as a backstop, the Group 
considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs when an asset is more than 30 days past due. 
Financial instruments are moved back to stage 1 once they no longer meet the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk . 
Definition of default and credit impaired assets 
The Group defines a financial instrument as in default, which is fully-aligned with the definition of credit-impaired, when it meets one or more 
of the following criteria: 
• Quantitative criteria: the customer is more than 90 days past due on their contractual payments; 
• Qualitative criteria: indication that there is a measurable movement in the estimated future cash flows from a group of financi al assets.  
For example, if prospective legislative changes are considered to impact the collections performance of customers. 
The default definition has been applied consistently to model th e probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and lo ss given default 
(LGD) throughout the Group’s expected credit loss calculations. 
An instrument is considered to no longer be in default (i.e. to have cured) when it no longer meets any of the default criteria . 
Forward-looking information 
Under IFRS 9 macroeconomic overlays are required to include forward-looking information when calculating expected credit losses .  
The short-term nature of our lending means that the portfolio turns over quickly, and as a result, any changes in the macroecon omic 
environment will have very little impact on our amounts receivable from customers. 
Where extreme macroeconomic scenarios are experienced, we will use management judgement to identify, quantify and apply any 
required approach. We have not applied any overlays in the calculation of the loss allowance at 1 January 2018. 
Modelling techniques 
We have calculated PD, EAD, LGD and cash flow projections based on the most recent collections performance, including managemen t 
overlays where we deem that historic performance is not representative of future collections performance.  
The most recent LGD performance is not deemed to be representative of future collections performance due to operational changes 
implemented in 2017. As such, an overlay has been applied to the LGD parameters resulting in an increase in LGDs. 
Hedge accounting 
On initial application of IFRS 9, an entity may choose, as its accounting policy, to continue to apply the hedge accounting req uirements of 
IAS 39 instead of the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9. The Group has elected to apply the IAS 39 hedge accounting requi rements.  
IFRS16 Leases 
IFRS16, which has not yet been endorsed by the EU, introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangement s and 
accounting treatments for both lessors and lessees. IFRS 16 will supersede the current lease guidance including IAS 17 Leases and the related 
interpretations when it becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group expects to ado pt IFRS 16 
for the year ending 31 December 2019. No decision has been made about whether to use any of the transitional options in IFRS 16 . 
IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer. Dis tinctions of 
operating leases (off balance sheet) and finance leases (on balance sheet) are removed for lessee accounting, and is replaced b y a 
model where a right-of-use asset and a corres ponding liability have to be recognised fo r all leases by lessees (i.e. all on bal ance sheet) 
except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets. 
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subseque ntly measured at cost (subject to certain exceptions) less acc umulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially mea sured at the 
present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that da te. Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted for interest and lease 
payments, as well as the impact of lease modifications, amongst others. Furthermore, the classification of cash flows will also be affected 
because operating leases under IAS 17 are presented as operating cash flows, whereas under the IFRS 16 model, the lease payment s will be 
split into a principal and interest portion which will be presented as operating and financing cash flows respectively. 
Furthermore, extensive disclosures are required by IFRS 16. 
As at 31 December 2017, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £33.0 million. IAS 17 does not require the 
recognition of any right-of-use asset or liability for future payments for these leases; instead, certain information is disclo sed as operating lease 
commitments in note 29. A preliminary assessment indicates that these arrangements will meet the definition of a lease under IF RS 16, 
although some of them will qualify as low value or short-term le ases upon the application of IFRS 16. The Group is in the proce ss of assessing 
the impact of recognising a right-of-use as set and a related lease liability in the Group Financial Statements. It is not pract icable to provide a 
reasonable estimate of the financial effect until this review has been completed.

Alternative Performance Measures 
In reporting financial information, the Group presents alternat ive performance measures, ‘APMs’ which are not defined or specif ied under  
the requirements of IFRS. 
The Group believes that these APMs, which are not considered to be a substitute for or superior to IFRS measures, provide stake holders with 
additional helpful information on the performance of the business. The APMs are consistent with how the business performance is planned 
and reported within the internal management reporting to the Board. Some of these measures are also used for the purpose of set ting 
remuneration targets. 
Each of the APMs, used by the Group are set out on pages 133-13 6 including explanations of how they are calculated and how they can be 
reconciled to a statutory measure where relevant. 
The Group reports percentage change figures for all performance me asures, other than profit or lo ss before taxation and earnings per share, 
after restating prior year figures at a constant exchange rate. The constant exchange rate, which is an APM, retranslates the previous year 
measures at the average actual periodic exchange rates used in the current financial year. These measures are presented as a me ans of 
eliminating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the year-on-year reported results. 
The Group makes certain adjustments to the statutory measures in order to derive APMs where relevant. The Group’s policy is to exclude 
items that are considered to be significant in both nature and/or quantum and where treatment as an adjusted item provides stak eholders 
with additional useful information to assess the year-on-year trading performance of the Group. 
Accounting convention 
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation o f  
derivative financial instruments at fair value. The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, are se t out in the  
following paragraphs. 
Going concern 
The directors have, at the time of approving the Financial Statem ents, a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going conce rn basis of 
accounting in the Financial Statements. Further detail is contained in the Financial review on page 35. 
Basis of consolidation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and the entities controlled by the Co mpany 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved when the Company: 
• has the power over the investee; 
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and 
• has the ability to use its power to affects its returns. 
All intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between Group companie s are 
eliminated on consolidation. 
The accounting policies of the subsidiaries are consistent with the accounting policies of the Group. 
Finance costs 
Finance costs comprise the interest on external borrowings which are recognised on an effective interest rate (‘EIR’) basis, an d gains or losses 
on derivative contracts taken to the income statement. 
Segment reporting 
The Group’s operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of operating s egments, 
has been identified as the Board. This information is by busine ss line – home credit and Digital; and by geographic region with in the home 
credit business. In order to further simplify our financial reporting in alignment with our strategy, we have decided to consol idate all European 
home credit businesses into one reporting segment. Accordingly, in 2018 our segmented reporting will comprise European home cre dit, 
Mexico and IPF Digital. A business line is a component of the Gr oup that operates within a particular economic environment and that is 
subject to risks and returns that are different from those of components operating in other economic environments. 
Revenue 
Revenue, which excludes value added tax and intra-Group transactio ns, comprises revenue earned on amounts receivable from customers. 
Revenue on customer receivables is calculated using an effectiv e interest rate (‘EIR’). All fees, being interest and non-interest fees are 
included within the EIR calculation. The EIR is calculated us ing estimated cash flows, being contractual payments adjusted for the impact of 
customers paying early but excluding the anticipated impact of customers paying late or not paying at all. 
Directly attributable issue costs are also taken into account in calculating the EIR. Interest income continues to be accrued o n impaired 
receivables using the original EIR applied to the loan’s carrying value.

Revenue continued  
Commissions in respect of insurance products intermediated by the Group are recognised when the underlying insurance goes on-ri sk if  
no further service obligations are identified. Insurance premiums payable by the customer are capitalised as part of the custom er loan 
receivable and accounted for on an amortised cost basis. These amounts do not make up a signif icant part of the revenue of the Group. 
The accounting for amounts receivable from customers is considered further below. 
Leases 
The leases entered into by the Group are solely operating leases. Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the incom e statement 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Leases are classified as operating leases whenever the terms of the lease do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewar ds of ownership  
to the Group. 
Other operating costs 
Other operating costs include agents’ commission, marketing costs and foreign exchange gains and losses. All other costs are in cluded in 
administrative expenses. 
Share-based payments 
The cost of providing share-based payments to employees is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the award . The 
corresponding credit is made to retained earnings. The cost is based on the fair value of awards granted, which is determined u sing both a 
Monte Carlo simulation and Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of  
non market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement such  
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves. 
In the Parent Company Financial Statements, the fair value of providing share-based payments to employees of subsidiary compani es is 
treated as an increase in the investment in subsidiaries. 
Exceptional items 
The Group classifies as exceptional those significant items that are one-off in nature and do not reflect the underlying perfor mance  
of the Group. 
Financial instruments 
Amounts receivable from customers 
All customer receivables are recognised initially at the amount lo aned to the customer plus directly attributable incremental i ssue costs.  
After initial recognition, customer receivables are measured subsequently at amortised cost. Amortised cost is the amount of th e customer 
receivable at initial recognition less customer repayments, plus revenue earned calculated using the EIR, less any deduction fo r impairment. 
Customer receivables are classified as loans and receivables in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement’. 
In home credit customer receivables are assessed for impairment each week. Customer accounts that are in arrears are deemed to have 
demonstrated evidence of impairment and are subject to an impairment review. Impairment is calculated using actuarial models wh ich use 
historical payment performance to generate the estimated amount an d timing of future cash flows from each arrears stage. These 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to a present value using the original EIR and this figure is compared with the balan ce sheet value.  
In IPF Digital receivables are assessed for impairment on a mont hly basis to reflect the repayment frequency. Evidence of defau lt is deemed 
to have been demonstrated when accounts are passed to an extern al debt collection agency although an incurred but not reported 
provision is created before this based on probability of default and loss given default factors. Impairment provisions reflect the amount and 
timing of cash flows through loss given default factors. 
Impairment charges in respect of customer receivables are charged to the income statement. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand. Cash also includes those balances held by agents for operational 
purposes. Bank overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balance s.

Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally in terest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward currency contracts , to manage 
the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s underlying business operations. No transactions of a speculative nature  
are undertaken. 
All derivative financial instruments are assessed against the hedge accounting criteria set out in IAS 39. The majority of the Group’s 
derivatives are cash flow hedges of highly probable forecast tr ansactions and meet the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. 
Derivatives are recognised initially at the fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are remeasured sub sequently at 
each reporting date at their fair value. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, movements in their fair value a re recognised 
immediately within the income statement.  
For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges and where the hedge accounting criteria are met, the effective portion of changes 
in the fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to th e ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
the income statement as part of finance costs. Amounts accumulated in equity are recognised in the income statement when the in come 
or expense on the hedged item is recognised in the income statement. 
The Group discontinues hedge accounting when: 
• it is evident from testing that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge; 
• the derivative expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised; or 
• the underlying hedged item matures or is sold or repaid. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of any transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are stated 
subsequently at amortised cost; any difference between proceeds ne t of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the 
income statement over the expected life of the borrowings using the EIR. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unles s the Group has 
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liabil ity for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subseque ntly measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is pr obable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of th e consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet 
date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net a ssets of the 
acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is su bsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losse s. Goodwill is 
held in the currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing rate at each end of reporting period date. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment is tested by comparing the carrying value of goodwill to 
the net present value of latest forecast cashflows from the legacy MCB business cash generating unit. Any impairment is recogni sed 
immediately in the income statement. Subsequent reversals of impairment losses for goodwill are not recognised. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets comprise computer software and customer relati onships acquired on the acquisition of MCB Finance. Computer so ftware is 
capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire or develop the specific software and bring it into use. 
Customer relationships are stated at fair value less accumulated amortisation. 
Intangible assets are amortised (within administrative expenses) on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives which are 
generally estimated to be five years. The residual values and economic lives are reviewed by management at each balance sheet d ate, 
and any shortfall recognised as impairment. 
Investments in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, where cost is equal to the fair value of the consideration used to acquire the asset. Investments 
are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An 
impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the investment carrying value exceeds the higher of the asset’s value in use or its fair 
value less costs to sell. 
   104
Accounting policies continued 
 
104 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent de preciation and impairment. Cost represents invoiced cost plus any other 
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 
Depreciation is calculated to write down assets to their estimated realisable value over their useful economic lives. The follo wing are the 
principal bases used: 
Category  Depreciation rate Method
Fixtures and fittings  10%  Straight–line
Equipment (including computer hardware)  20% to 33.3%  Straight–line
Motor vehicles  25%  Reducing balance
The residual value and useful economic life of all assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date . All items of 
property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised through the income statement for the amount by which the asset’s carry ing value 
exceeds the higher of the asset’s value in use or its fair value less costs to sell. 
Share capital 
International Personal Finance plc has only ordinary share capita l. These shares, with a nominal value of 10 pence per share, a re classified  
as equity. 
Shares held in treasury and by employee trust 
The net amount paid to acquire shares is held in a separate reserve and shown as a reduction in equity. 
Foreign currency translation 
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary e conomic 
environment in which the subsidiary operates (‘the functional currency’). The Group’s financial information is presented in ste rling. 
Transactions that are not denominated in an entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the dat e of  
the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the r ates of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Differences arising on translation are charged or credited to the income statement, except 
when deferred in other comprehensive in come as qualifying cash flow hedges. 
The income statements of the Group’s subsidiaries (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a f unctional 
currency different from sterling are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate and the balance sheets are translate d at the 
exchange rates ruling at each balance sheet date. 
Upon consolidation, exchange differences arising from the transl ation of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, and of bor rowings and 
other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to other comprehensive income.  
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
Current tax 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year . Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the in come statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is ca lculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabili ties in the 
Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in th e computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally re cognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred ta x assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable prof its will be available against which deductible temporary differen ces can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goo dwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other as sets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the ta xable profit nor the 
accounting profit.

Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent de preciation and impairment. Cost represents invoiced cost plus any other 
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 
Depreciation is calculated to write down assets to their estimated realisable value over their useful economic lives. The follo wing are the 
principal bases used: 
Category  Depreciation rate Method
Fixtures and fittings  10%  Straight–line
Equipment (including computer hardware)  20% to 33.3%  Straight–line
Motor vehicles  25%  Reducing balance
The residual value and useful economic life of all assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date . All items of 
property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised through the income statement for the amount by which the asset’s carry ing value 
exceeds the higher of the asset’s value in use or its fair value less costs to sell. 
Share capital 
International Personal Finance plc has only ordinary share capita l. These shares, with a nominal value of 10 pence per share, a re classified  
as equity. 
Shares held in treasury and by employee trust 
The net amount paid to acquire shares is held in a separate reserve and shown as a reduction in equity. 
Foreign currency translation 
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary e conomic 
environment in which the subsidiary operates (‘the functional currency’). The Group’s financial information is presented in ste rling. 
Transactions that are not denominated in an entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the dat e of  
the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the r ates of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Differences arising on translation are charged or credited to the income statement, except 
when deferred in other comprehensive in come as qualifying cash flow hedges. 
The income statements of the Group’s subsidiaries (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a f unctional 
currency different from sterling are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate and the balance sheets are translate d at the 
exchange rates ruling at each balance sheet date. 
Upon consolidation, exchange differences arising from the transl ation of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, and of bor rowings and 
other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to other comprehensive income.  
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
Current tax 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year . Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the in come statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is ca lculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabili ties in the 
Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in th e computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally re cognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred ta x assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable prof its will be available against which deductible temporary differen ces can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goo dwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other as sets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the ta xable profit nor the 
accounting profit.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary di fferences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates , and interests in 
joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reve rsal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associ ated with such 
investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise 
the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each ba lance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longe r probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on 
tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group 
expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxat ion authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax asse ts and 
liabilities on a net basis. 
Current tax and deferred tax for the year 
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other compre hensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and defe rred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises fr om the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax e ffect is included in 
the accounting for the business combination. 
Employee benefits 
Defined benefit pension scheme 
The charge or credit in the income statement in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme comprises the actuarially assesse d current 
service cost of working employees together with the interest charge on pension liabilities offset by the expected return on pen sion scheme 
assets. As there are no working employees that are members of the defined benefit pension scheme, there are no current service costs. All 
charges or credits are allocated to administrative expenses. 
The asset or obligation recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the fair value of t he scheme’s 
assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date. 
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The pres ent value of 
the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-qua lity corporate 
bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adj ustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised 
immediately in other comprehensive income. 
The Parent Company share of the defined benefit retirement obligation is based on the proportion of total Group contributions m ade by  
the Parent Company. 
Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement on an accruals basis. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements (other than those involvin g estimations) 
that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised and to make estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of as sets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on histori cal 
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future p eriods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods. 
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that the directors have made in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements.

Revenue recognition 
The judgement used in respect of revenue recognition is the methodology used to calculate the EIR. In order to determine the EI R applicable 
to loans an estimate must be made of the expected life of each loan and hence the cash flows relating thereto. These estimates are based 
in historical data and are reviewed regularly. Based on a 1% va riation in the EIR, it is estimated that the amounts receivable from customers 
would be higher/lower by £3.1 million (2016: £3.1 million). Th is sensitivity is based on historic fluctuations in EIRs. 
Amounts receivable from customers 
The Group reviews its portfolio of customer loans and receivable s for impairment on a weekly or monthly basis. The Group makes judgements  
to determine whether there is objective evidence which indicates that there has been an adverse effect on expected future cash flows. 
In home credit, for the purposes of assessing the impairment of customer loans and receivables, customers are categorised into arrears 
stages as this is considered to be the most reliable predictor of future payment performance. The level of impairment is calcul ated using 
actuarial models which use historical payment performance to generate the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows from each 
arrears stage of each product.  
In IPF Digital, the default trigger occurs when customers are pass ed to collections, which averages at around 60 days past due, although an  
incurred but not recorded provision is created before this base d on probability of default and loss given default factors that are based on 
historical performance.  
In home credit, the impairment models are monitored regularly to test their continued capability to predict the timing and quan tum of 
customer repayments in the context of the current economic environment and recent customer payment performance. The models used 
typically have a strong predictive capability reflecting the rela tively stable nature of the business and therefore the actual performance does 
not usually vary significantly from the estimated performance. Th e models are updated periodically if they cease to have a stro ng predictive 
capability. However, on the basis that the payment performance of customers could be different from the assumptions used in est imating 
the future cash flows, an adjustment to the amounts receivable from customers may be required. To the extent the estimated cash flows 
differ by +/-2%, it is estimated that amounts receivable from ho me credit customers would be £17.3 million higher/lower (2016: £16.5 million 
higher/lower). This level of estimated impact is based on historic fluctuations in performance compared to the models and is su bject to 
impairment overlay provisions. 
In IPF Digital, probability of default and loss given default par ameters are updated on a regular basis using recent customer r epayment 
information, which is considered to be a good indicator of future performance. In the event that loss rates could be different from these 
assumptions by +/- 10%, it is estimated that the amounts receivable from IPF Digital customers would be £1.2 million higher/lower (2016: £0.6 
million higher/lower). The levels of estimated impacts are based on typical customer loss rate fluctuations. 
IAS 39 requires that all of the cash flows directly associated with financial instruments held at amortised cost must be recogn ised in the 
income statement using the EIR method. When this approach is applie d to a customer loan portfolio, judgements must be made to e stimate 
the average life of that portfolio. These judgements are applie d, taking into account factors including the terms of the partic ular products 
and historical repayment data. These estimates are considered and updated as required in each reporting period to reflect the c ustomer 
loan portfolio’s expected performance. 
Tax 
Judgement must be exercised in the calculation of the Group’s tax provision, in particular with regard to the existence and ext ent of tax risks. 
This exercise of judgement with regards to the ongoing Polish tax audits which are disclosed on page 35 could have a significan t effect on 
the Financial Statements, as there are significant uncertainties in relation to the amount and timing of associated cash flows.  
In respect of deferred tax assets, which arise largely from timing differences between the accounting and tax treatments of rev enue and 
impairment transactions, judgements must be made regarding the ex tent to which the timing differences will reverse and a tax de duction 
will be obtained in future periods.

The Group is currently subject to a tax audit with respect to Provident Polska for the years 2008-2011. Audits of 2010 and 2011 are ongoing, 
whilst for 2008 and 2009, decisions were received in January 2017 and have been appealed. Further details regarding these decis ions are set 
out in the Financial Review on page 35. The Group is also subject to audits in Mexico (regarding 2015) and Slovakia (regarding 2014-2015), 
all of which are still at the information gathering stage. 
In late 2017 the European Commission opened a state aid investig ation into the Group Financing Exemption contained in the UK co ntrolled 
foreign currency rules, which was introduced in 2013. The UK authorities do not accept that the rules constitute state aid. In common with 
other UK-based international companies whose arrangements are in line with current controlled foreign company rules, the Group may be 
affected by the outcome of this investigation. The Group is monitoring developments.

6. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) from continuing operations is ca lculated by dividing the earnings attributable to shareholders of £45.0 million 
(2016: £71.2 million) by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period of 222.4 million (2016: 221.2 million ) which has 
been adjusted to exclude the weighted average number of shares held in treasury and by the employee trust. 
Adjusted earnings per share (‘EPS’) from continuing operations ex cluding the exceptional tax charge is calculated by dividing the earnings 
attributable to shareholders of £75.0 million (2016: £71.2 million) by the weighted average number of shares in issue during th e period of 
222.4 million (2016: 221.2 million) which has been adjusted to exclude the weighted average number of shares held in treasury a nd by the 
employee trust. 
Basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) including discontinued operations is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to share holders of  
£36.6 million (2016: £66.9 million) by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period of 222.4 million (2016: 221.2 million) 
which has been adjusted to exclude the weighted average number of shares held in treasury and by the employee trust. 
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of IPF plc ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all diluti ve potential 
ordinary share options relating to employees of the Group.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable 
amount is determined from a value in use calculation. The key a ssumptions used in the value in use calculation relate to the di scount rates 
and growth rates adopted. We adopt discount rates which reflect the time value of money and the risks specific to the legacy MC B business. 
The cash flow forecasts are based on the most recent financial budgets approved by the Group Board for the next three years. Th e rate used 
to discount the forecast cash flows is 10% (2016: 10%). No reas onably foreseeable reduction in the assumptions would give rise to 
impairment, and therefore no further sensitivity analysis has been presented.

IPF plc acquired the international businesses of the Provident Financial plc Group on 16 July 2007 by issuing one IPF plc share to the 
shareholders of Provident Financial plc for each Provident Financial plc share held by them. The fair value of the consideratio n issued in 
exchange for the investment in these international businesses was £663.6 million and this amount was therefore capitalised as a cost of 
investment. A further £13.2 million (2016: £12.5 million) has been added to the cost of investment representing the fair value of the share-
based payment awards over IPF plc shares made to employees of su bsidiary companies of IPF plc. The corresponding credit has bee n taken 
to reserves. 
On 6 February 2015 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of MCB Finance Group plc (‘MCB’), a profitable digital c onsumer 
finance provider established in 2006, for a cash consideration of £23.2 million. 
During the year, as a result of the Group net asset position and the market capitalisation of the Company being lower than the carrying 
value of the investment in subsidiaries, we carried out a review of the recoverable amount of the carrying value of the investm ent. This review 
confirmed that no impairment of the investment is required.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax lo sses and other temporary timing differences (principally relating to recognition  
of revenue and impairment) to the extent that it is probable th at these assets will be utilised against future taxable profits. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group has unused tax losses of £47.6 million (2016: £76.0 million) available for offset against future profits. A 
deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £28.9 million (2016: £45.7 million) of these losses. No deferred tax has b een recognised 
in respect of the remaining £18.7 million (2016: £30.3 million) as it is not considered probable that there will be future taxa ble profits available 
against which these losses can be offset. None of the unrecognised losses are subject to an expiry date.  
At 31 December 2017, there is £nil (2016: £nil) amount of tempor ary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which deferred 
tax liabilities have not been recognised.

Amounts receivable from customers are held at amortised cost and are equal to the expected future cash flows receivable discoun ted at  
the average EIR of 99% (2016: 105%). All amou nts receivable from customers are at fixed interest rates. The average period to m aturity of  
the amounts receivable from customers is 9.1 months (2016: 7.8 months). 
No collateral is held in respect of any cu stomer receivables. Home credit does not use an impairment provision account for reco rding 
impairment losses and, therefore, no analysis of gross customer receivables less provision for impairment is presented. Digital holds an 
impaired but not reported provision for re ceivables which have not yet been passe d to a third-party collection agency.

16. Amounts receivable from customers continued 
Revenue recognised on amounts receivable from customers which have been impaired was £429.6 million (2016: £437.0 million). 
Management monitor credit quality using two key metrics: impair ment as a percentage of revenue and gross cash loss (‘GCL’) 
development. Commentary on impairment as a percentage of revenue is set out in the operational review at both Group and segment 
level. GCL represents the expected total value of contractual cash flows that will not be collected and will ultimately be writ ten off for any loan 
or group of loans. Until collections on an y group of receivables are complete, the GCL forecast is a composite of actual and ex pected cash 
flows. This represents a leading edge measure of credit quality with forecasts based on the actual performance of previous lend ing. At 31 
December 2017 our preliminary GCL forecast for home credit for 2018 was 14.5% of total amount payable; the outturn for 2016 len ding as at 
31 December 2017 was 15.2% of total amount payable. At 31 December 2017 our preliminary loss rate forecast for 2018 for digital established 
markets was 2.7% and for digital new markets was 11.0% of receiv ables (2016: digital established markets was 6% and digital new markets 
was 13% of receivables). 
The Company has no amounts receivable from customers.

21. Risks arising from financial instruments 
Risk management 
Treasury related risks 
The Board approves treasury policies and the treasury function manages the day-to-day operations. The Board delegates certain 
responsibilities to the Treasury Committee. The Treasury Committee is empowered to take decisions within that delegated authori ty. Treasury 
activities and compliance with treasury policies are reported to the Board on a regular basis and are subject to periodic indep endent 
reviews and audits, both internal and external. Treasury policies are designed to manage the main financial risks faced by the Group in 
relation to funding and liquidity risk; interest rate risk; currency risk; and counterparty risk. This is to ensure that the Gr oup is properly funded; 
that interest rate and currency risk are managed within set limits; and that financial counterparties are of appropriate credit quality. Policies 
also set out the specific instruments that can be used for risk management. 
The treasury function enters into derivative transactions, prin cipally interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward currency contracts.  
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s underlying busines s operations.  
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken and writte n options may only be used when matched by purchased options. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group is subject to the risk that it will not have sufficient borrowing facilities to fund its existing business and its fu ture plans for growth.  
The short-term nature of the Group’s business means that the majo rity of amounts receivable from customers are receivable within 12 months 
with an average period to maturity of around nine months. The risk of not having sufficient liquid resources is therefore low. The treasury policy 
adopted by the Group serves to reduce this risk further by sett ing a specific policy parameter that there are sufficient commit ted debt 
facilities to cover forecast borrowings plus an appropriate leve l of operational headroom on a ro lling basis. Further, the aim is to ensure that 
there is a balanced refinancing profile with phased maturity date s; that there is diversification of debt funding sources; that there is no over-
reliance on a single or small group of lenders; and that debt facilities and hedging capacity are sufficient for the currency r equirements of 
each country. At 31 December 2017, the Group’s bonds and committed borrowing facilities had an average period to maturity of 2. 6 years 
(2016: 3.3 years).  
As shown in note 20, total undrawn facilities as at 31 December 2017 were £189.3 million (2016: £152.4 million). 
As outlined in the Financial Review on page 35, the Group’s home credit company in Poland, Provident Polska, has been subject t o tax 
audits in respect of the Company’s 2008 an d 2009 financial years. The 2010 and 2011 financial years are currently being audited by the tax 
authorities in Poland, and all subsequent years up to and includin g 2017 remain open to future audit. Provident Polska has appealed the 
decisions made by the Polish Tax Chamber, to the District Administrative Court, for the 2008 and 2009 financial years and has p aid the 
amounts assessed of approximately £37 million (comprising tax and associated interest) which was necessary in order to make the appeals. 
As noted on page 35, the 2008 and 2009 tax audit decisions are the subject of a process involving the UK tax authority aimed at ensuring 
that the intra-group arrangement is taxed in accordance with international tax principles and as a result the court hearings ha ve been 
stayed. In order to appeal any potential future decisions for 2010 and subsequent years, further payments may be required. Ther e are 
significant uncertainties in relation to the amount and timing of such cash outflows. However, in the event that audits are ope ned, and similar 
decisions are reached for each of these subsequent financial year s, further amounts of up to c. £123 million may be required to be funded 
(including approximately £44 million for the 2010 and 2011 years on which audits have commenced). 
As at 31 December 2017, in the IPF Digital business there are £46.4 million (2016: £21.3 million) of undrawn credit lines.

The analysis above includes the contractual cash flow for borrowings and the total amount of interest payable over the life of the loan. Where 
borrowings are subject to a floating interest rate, an estimate of interest payable is taken. The rate is derived from interest rate yield curves at 
the balance sheet date. 
The following analysis shows the gross non-discounted contractual cash flows in respect of foreign currency contract derivative assets and

21. Risks arising from financial instruments continued 
Interest rate risk 
The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising on chan ges in interest rates in each of its countries of operation and, therefore, seeks  
to limit this net exposure. This is achieved by the use of techniques to fix interest costs, including fixed rate funding (pred ominantly longer-term 
bond funding); forward currency contracts used for non-functional currency funding; bank borrowing loan draw-down periods; and interest 
rate hedging instruments. These techniques are used to hedge the interest costs on a proportion of borrowings over a certain pe riod of time, 
up to five years, although most hedging is for up to two years. 
Interest costs are a relatively low proporti on of the Group’s revenue (6.7% in 2017; 6.2% in 2016) and therefore the risk of a material impact on 
profitability arising from a change in interest rates is low. If interest rates across all markets increased by 200 basis points this would have the 
following impact, net of existing hedging arrangements.

This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: 
• the change in the market interest rate occurs in all countries where the Group has borrowings and/or derivative financial instr uments; 
• where financial liabilities are subject to fixed interest rates or have their interest rate fixed by hedging instruments it is assumed that there is  
no impact from a change in interest rates; and 
• changes in market interest rate affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments. 
Currency risk 
The Group is subject to three types of currency risk: net asset exposure; cash flow exposure; and income statement exposure. 
Net asset exposure 
The majority of the Group’s net assets are denominated in currencies other than sterling. The balance sheet is reported in ster ling and this 
means that there is a risk that a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates will have a material impact on the net assets of the Gr oup. The impact 
in 2017 is an increase in net assets of £51.3 million (2016: increase of £65.1 million). The Group aims to minimise the value o f net assets 
denominated in each foreign currency by funding overseas receivables with borrowings in local currency, where possible. 
Cash flow exposure 
The Group is subject to currency risk in respect of future cash flows which are denominated in foreign currency. The policy of the Group is to 
hedge a large proportion of this currency risk in respect of cash flows which are expected to arise in the following 12 months. Where forward 
foreign exchange contracts have been entered into, they are desi gnated as cash flow hedges on specific future transactions. 
Income statement exposure 
As with net assets, the majority of the Group’s profit is denominated in currencies other than sterling but translated into ste rling for reporting 
purposes. The result for the period is translated into sterling at the average exchange rate. A risk therefore arises that a fl uctuation in the 
exchange rates in the countries in which the Group operates will have a material impact on the consolidated result for the peri od. 
The following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the impact on equit y of a 5% strengthening or weakening of sterling against all exchange rates  
for the countries in which the Group operates:

Hungarian forint, Mexican peso, Romanian leu, and Australian dollar); and 
• there is no impact on retained earnings or equity arising from those items which are naturally hedged (where the currency asset is exactly 
equal to the currency liability).

Counterparty risk 
The Group is subject to counterparty risk in respect of the cash and cash equivalents held on deposit with banks; and foreign c urrency and 
derivative financial instruments. 
The Group only deposits cash, and only undertakes currency and derivative transactions, generally with highly rated banks and s ets strict  
limits in respect of the amount of exposure to any one institutio n. Institutions with lower credit ratings can only be used wit h Board approval. 
No collateral or credit enhancements are held in respect of any financial assets. The maximum exposure to counterparty risk is as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents  27.4 43.4
Derivative financial assets  10.4 15.4
Total  37.8 58.8
The table above represents a worst case scenario of the counterparty risk that the Group is exposed to at the year end. An anal ysis of the 
cash and cash equivalents by geographical segment is presented in note 17. 
Cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments ar e neither past due nor impaired. Credit quality of these assets is good and  
the cash and cash equivalents are spread over a number of banks, each of which meets the criteria set out in our treasury polic ies, to ensure  
the risk of loss is minimised. 
Credit risk 
The Group is subject to credit risk in resp ect of amounts receivable from customers. 
Amounts receivable from customers 
The Group lends small amounts over short-term periods to a large and diverse group of customers across the countries in which i t operates. 
Nevertheless, the Group is subject to a risk of material unexpected credit losses in respect of amounts receivable from customers. This risk is 
minimised by the use of credit scoring techniques which are designed to ensure the Group lends only to those customers who we b elieve 
can afford the repayments. The amount loaned to each customer an d the repayment period agreed are dependent upon the risk categ ory 
the customer is assigned to as part of the credit scoring process. The level of expected future losses is generated on a weekly or monthly 
basis by business line and geographical segment. These outputs are reviewed by management to ensure that appropriate action can be 
taken if results differ from management expectations.

The table above represents the maximum exposure to credit risk of the Group at the year end. An analysis of the amounts receiva ble from 
customers by geographical segment is presented in note 16. 
Amounts receivable from customers are stated at amortised cost an d calculated in accordance with the Group’s accounting policie s.  
Those amounts receivable from customers th at are neither past due nor impaired repres ent loans where no customer payments have  
been missed and there is, therefore, no evidence to suggest that the credit quality is anything other than adequate. 
Amounts receivable from customers include £3.5 million that is past due but not impaire d (2016: £4.6 million). This is in relat ion to the first four 
weeks of loans for home credit new customers, an d allows a repayment pattern to be established. 
An analysis of the amounts receivable from customers that are in dividually determined to be impaired is set out by geographical  
segment below:

Bulgaria – 2.5 – 5.3
 452.3 365.5 604.6 574.4
This analysis includes all loans that have been subject to impairment. The impairment charge is based on the average expected l oss for 
each arrears stage of customer receivables and this average expected loss is applied to the entire arrears stage. This results in a significant 
proportion of the amounts receivable from customers attracting an impairment charge. For each segment the amount by which an as set is 
impaired depends on the type of product, the recent payment perf ormance and the number of weeks since the loan was issued. Ther e will, 
therefore, be a large amount of receivab les which are classed as impaired but where the carrying value is still a large proport ion of the 
contractual amount recoverable. In IPF Digital the default trigger occurs when customers are passed to collections, however an incurred but 
not reported provision is held in respect of these balances.

Capital risk 
The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the business. The Group is not required  
to hold regulatory capital. 
The Group aims to maintain appropriate capital to ensure that it has a strong balance sheet but at the same time is providing a good return 
on equity to its shareholders. The Group’s long-term aim is to ensure that the capital structure results in an optimal ratio of debt and equity 
finance. 
Capital is monitored by considering the ratio of equity to rece ivables and the gearing ratio. The equity of the Group and these ratios are

• inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3). 
Where fair values are disclosed for financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value, all such assets are classed as level 1, with the

The fair value of derivative financial instruments has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using interest rate yield 
curves and forward foreign exchange rates prevailing at 31 December. 
Cash flow hedges 
The Group uses foreign currency contracts (‘cash flow hedges’) to hedge those foreign currency cash flows that are highly proba ble to 
occur within 12 months of the balance sheet date and interest rate swaps (‘cash flow hedges’) to hedge those interest cash flow s that are 
expected to occur within two years of the balance sheet date. The effect on the income statement will also be within these peri ods. An 
amount of £2.5 million has been charged to eq uity for the Group in the period in respec t of cash flow hedges (2016: £1.5 millio n credited to 
equity), Company: £1.5 million charge (2016: £0.4 million credit). 
Foreign currency contracts 
The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contract s that the Group is committed to at 31 December 2017 is £462. 5 million  
(2016: £427.2 million). These comprise: 
• foreign currency contracts to buy or sell operational currencies against the euro for a total notional amount of £173.0 million (2016: £223.4 
million). These contracts have various maturity dates up to Octo ber 2020 (2016: October 2020). These contracts have been design ated 
and are effective as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity; and 
• foreign currency contracts to buy or sell sterling for a tota l notional amount of £289.5 million (2016: £203.8 million). These contracts have 
various maturity dates up to December 2018 (2016: December 2018). These contracts have been designated and are effective as cas h  
flow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity. 
£0.3 million credit (2016: £nil) has been made to the income statement in the year representing the movement in the fair value of the 
Mexican cross currency swap. 
The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contract s that the Company is committed to at 31 December 2017 is £57.1 million 
(2016: £34.2 million). These comprise: 
• foreign currency contracts to buy or sell operational currencies against the euro for a total notional amount of £2.3 million ( 2016: £3.3 
million). All of these contracts are held with external provider s to buy and sell currency and have equal and offsetting contra cts with other 
Group companies to buy and sell the same amounts of currency. This leaves the Company with no re sidual risk and ensures the relevant  
subsidiary company has an effective foreign currency contract in its books; and 
• foreign currency contracts to buy or sell sterling for a total notional amount of £54.8 million (2016: £30.9 million). These co ntracts have 
various maturity dates up to November 2018 (2016: November 2018). These contracts have been designated and are effective as cas h 
flow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity. 
Interest rate swaps 
The total notional principal of outstanding interest rate swaps that the Group is committed to is £43.0 million (2016: £62.2 mi llion). In 2017,  
these interest rate swaps cover the current borrowings relating to the floating rate Polish bond.

Interest rate swaps in place at the balance sheet date are design ated, and are effective under IAS 39, as cash flow hedges, and the fair 
value thereof has been deferred in equity within the hedging reserve. A charge of £nil (2016: £nil) has been made to the income statement 
in the year representing the movement in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps and the income st atement charge 
relating to the closure of interest rate swaps.

Current tax liabilities  7.4 7.4 16.5 16.5
 813.4 835.6 683.0 767.2
The fair value of amounts receivable from customers has been deri ved by discounting expected future cash flows (as used to calc ulate  
the carrying value of amounts due from customers), net of collection costs, at the Group’s weighted average cost of capital whi ch we 
estimate to be 10% (2016: 10%) which is assumed to be a proxy for the discount rate that a market participant would use to pric e the asset. 
Under IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’, receivables are classed as level 3 as their fair value is calculated using future cash flows that are 
unobservable inputs. 
The fair value of the bonds has been calculated by reference to their market value where market prices are available. 
The carrying value of bank borrowings is deemed to be a good appr oximation of their fair value. Bank borrowings can be repaid w ithin six 
months if the Group decides not to roll over for further period s up to the contractual repayment date. The impact of discountin g would 
therefore be negligible. 
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value which is equal to the expected future cash flows arising as a result of the  
derivative transaction. 
For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature, the carrying value is a reasonable approximatio n of their fair value. 
25. Retirement benefit asset/obligation 
Pension schemes – defined benefit 
With effect from 1 March 2010, the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme was cl osed to further accrual of defined benefit obli gations. 
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at 31 December 2017. The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 
Group and Company 
2017 
%
2016 
%
Price inflation (‘CPI’)  2.1 2.4
Rate of increase to pensions in payment  2.9 3.2
Discount rate  2.6 2.7
The expected return on scheme assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the c urrent 
investment policy. Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet d ate. 
Expected returns on equity investments reflect long-term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.

25. Retirement benefit asset/obligation continued 
The mortality assumptions are based on standard tables which allow for future mortality improvements. Different assumptions are used for 
different groups of members. Most members have not yet retired. On average, we ex pect a male retiring in the future at age 65 to live for a 
further 25 years. On average, we expect a female retiring in the future at age 65 to live for a further 26 years. If life expec tancies had been 
assumed to be one year greater for all members, the defined benefit obligation would increase by approximately £1.6 million. 
If the discount rate was 25 basis points higher/(lower), the defined benefit asset would decrease by £2.3 million/(increase by £2.4 million). 
If the price inflation rate was 25 basis points higher/(lower), the defined benefit asset would increase by £1.2 million/(decre ase by  
£1.1 million). 
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation, as i t is unlikely that 
the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Pension schemes – defined contribution 
The defined benefit pension scheme is no longer open to further accrual. All eligible UK employees are invited to join stakehol der pension 
schemes into which the Group contributes between 8% and 20% of members’ pensionable earnings, provided the employee contributes a 
minimum of 5%. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group. The pension charge in the income statement 
represents contributions payable by the Group in respect of the scheme and amounted to £0.8 million for the year ended 31 Decem ber 2017 
(2016: £0.8 million). £nil contributions were payable to the scheme at the year-end (2016: £nil). 
In addition, an amount of £nil (2016: £nil) has been charged to the income statement in respect of contributions into personal pension 
arrangements for certain directors and employees. 
26. Share-based payments 
The Group currently operates six categories of share schemes: The International Personal Finance plc Performance Share Plan (‘t he 
Performance Share Plan’); The International Personal Finance plc Approved Company Share Option Plan (‘the CSOP’); The Internati onal 
Personal Finance plc Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (‘the SAYE scheme’); The International Personal Finance plc D eferred 
Share Plan (‘the Deferred Share Plan’); The International Personal Finance plc Have Your Share Plan (‘the HYS Plan’); and The I nternational 
Personal Finance plc Discretionary Award Plan (‘the Discretionary Award Plan’). A number of awards have been granted under thes e 
schemes during the period under review. No awards have been gr anted under the CSOP, the Discretionary Award Plan, or the HYS Pl an  
in 2017. 
Options granted under the Performance Share Plans and CSOPs may be subject to a total shareholder return (‘TSR’) performance target 
and/or earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth; net revenue growth; customer numbers growth; agent turn over; and earnings before interest and 
tax (‘EBIT’) performance targets. The income statement charge in respect of the Performance Share Plan and the CSOP has been ca lculated 
using both a Monte Carlo simulation (for TSR) and Black-Scholes model (for the other non-market related conditions) as these sc hemes 
include performance targets. There are no performance conditions associated with the HYS plan; if an employee purchases a numbe r of 
shares (subject to a maximum), the Company grants a nil cost opti on over four times the number of shares initially purchased. The only 
criterion associated with this option is that the employee must remain in employment for three years following the initial gran t date. The 
income statement charge in respect of this scheme is calculated using the share price at the date of grant. There are no perfor mance 
conditions associated with the Discretionary Award Plan, the income statement charge in respect of this scheme is calculated using the 
share price at the date of grant. 
The income statement charge in respect of the SAYE scheme is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model, however, no TSR t argets 
are assigned. The Deferred Share Plan comprises deferred awards with matching awards. There are no additional performance crite ria 
attached to the deferred awards, therefore, the income statement charge is calculated using the actual share price at the date the award is 
granted. The matching awards are subject to the same criteria as the Performance Share Plan.  
The total income statement credit in respect of these share-based payments is £0.2 million (2016: charge of £3.5 million).

30. Contingent liabilities 
The Group’s home credit company in Poland, Provident Polska, has been subject to tax audits in respect of the company’s 2008 an d 2009 
financial years. During these audits the Polish tax authorities have challenged an intra-group arrangement with a UK entity, an d the timing of 
the taxation of home collection fee revenues.  
These audits culminated with decisions being received from the Polish Tax Chamber (the upper tier of the Polish tax authority) on 5 January 
2017 in relation to the 2008 financial year, and on 23 January 2017 in respect of the 2009 financial year. Provident Polska has appealed these 
decisions to the District Administrative Court, but has had to pay the amounts assessed totalling approximately £37 million (co mprising tax 
and associated interest) in order to make the appeals. As note d on page 35, the 2008 and 2009 tax audit decisions are the subje ct of a 
process involving the UK tax authority aimed at ensuring that the intra-group arrangement is taxed in accordance with internati onal tax 
principles and as a result the court hearings have been stayed.  
The directors have received strong external legal advice, and note that during a previous tax audit by the same tax authority, the Company’s 
treatment of these matters was accepted as correct. 
Therefore the payments of the sums outlined above are not a reflection of the directors’ view on the merits of the case, and ac cordingly the 
payments made in January 2017 have been recognised as a non-current financial asset in these Financial Statements given the 
uncertainties in relation to the timing of any repayment of such amounts. 
The 2010 and 2011 financial years are currently being audited by the tax authorities in Poland. In the event that the Polish ta x authorities were 
to issue decisions following the same reasoning as for 2008 an d 2009 around a further £44 millio n would become payable. In addition, all 
subsequent years remain open to future audit, meaning that there are further significant uncertainties in relation to the amoun t and timing of 
potential additional future payments in relation to these periods. In the event that audits are opened in respect of some or al l of these open 
periods, and similar decisions are reached, further amounts may be required to be paid, the timing of which would be dependent upon the 
timing of decisions made by the Polish tax authorities for these later periods. Further details on this are set out in note 21.  
The Company has a contingent liability for guarantees given in re spect of the borrowings of certain other Group companies to a maximum 
of £243.3 million (2016: £211.5 million). At 31 December 2017, the fixed and floating rate borrowings under these facilities am ounted to £99.9 
million (2016: £96.5 million). The directors do not expect any loss to arise. These guarantees are defined as financial guarant ees under IAS 39 
and their fair value at 31 December 2017 was £nil (2016: £nil). 
At 31 December 2017, in the IPF Digital business there are £46.4 million (2016: £21.3 million) of undrawn credit lines.

Alternative performance measures
This Annual Report and Financial Statements provides alternative performance measures (APMs) which are not defined or specified under 
the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards. We believe these APMs provide readers with important additional 
information on our business. To support this we have included a reconciliation of the APMs we use, where relevant, and a glossary indicating 
the APMs that we use, an explanation of how they are calculated and why we use them.

Income statement 
measures
Credit issued growth 
(%)
None Not applicable Credit issued is the principal value of loans advanced to customers and is an 
important measure of the level of lending in the business. Credit issued 
growth is the period-on-period change in this metric which is calculated by 
retranslating the previous year’s credit issued at the average actual 
exchange rates used in the current financial year. This ensures that the 
measure is presented having eliminated the effects of exchange rate 
fluctuations on the period-on-period reported results.
Average net 
receivables (£M)
None Not applicable Average net receivables are the average amounts receivable from customers 
translated at the average monthly actual exchange rate. This measure is 
presented to illustrate the change in amounts receivable from customers on 
a consistent basis with revenue growth. 
Average net 
receivables growth at 
constant exchange 
rates (%)
None Not applicable Average net receivables growth is the period-on-period change in average 
net receivables which is calculated by retranslating the previous year’s 
average net receivables at the average actual exchange rates used in the 
current financial year. This ensures that the measure is presented having 
eliminated the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the period-on-period 
reported results.
Revenue growth at 
constant exchange 
rates (%)
None Not applicable The period-on-period change in revenue which is calculated by retranslating 
the previous year’s revenue at the average actual exchange rates used in 
the current financial year. This measure is presented as a means of 
eliminating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the period-on-period 
reported results.
Revenue yield (%) None Not applicable Revenue yield is reported revenue divided by average net receivables and is 
an indicator of the gross return being generated from average net 
receivables.
Impairment as a 
percentage of 
revenue (%)
None Not applicable Impairment as a percentage of revenue is reported impairment divided by 
reported revenue and represents a measure of credit quality that is used 
across the business. This measure is reported on a rolling annual basis 
(annualised).
Cost-income ratio (%) None Not applicable The cost-income ratio is other costs divided by reported revenue. Other costs 
represent all operating costs with the exception of amounts paid to agents as 
collecting commission. This measure is reported on a rolling annual basis 
(annualised).This is useful for comparing performance across markets.
Pre-exceptional profit 
before tax (£M)
Profit before 
tax
Exceptional 
items
Profit before tax and exceptional items. This is considered to be an important 
measure where exceptional items distort the operating performance of the 
business.
Effective tax rate 
before exceptional 
items (%)
Effective tax 
rate
Exceptional 
items and their 
tax impact
Total tax expense for the Group excluding exceptional tax items divided by 
profit before tax and exceptional items. This measure is an indicator of the 
ongoing tax rate for the Group.
Pre-exceptional 
earnings per share 
(pence)
Earnings per 
share
Items 
identified as 
exceptional 
items
Earnings per share before the impact of exceptional items. This is considered 
to be an important measure where exceptional items distort the operating 
performance of the business.
Like-for-like profit 
growth or contraction 
(£M)
None Not applicable The period-on-period change in profit adjusted for the impact of exchange 
rates and, where appropriate, investment in new business development 
opportunities. The impact of exchange rates is calculated by retranslating the 
previous period’s profit at the current year’s average exchange rate. This 
measure is presented as a means of reporting like-for-like profit movements. 134

Balance sheet and returns 
measures
Return on assets ('ROA')
(%)
None Not applicable Calculated as profit before interest and exceptional items less tax at 
the effective tax rate before exceptional items divided by average 
net receivables. We believe that ROA is a good measure of the 
financial performance of our businesses, showing the ongoing return 
on the total equity and debt capital invested in average net 
receivables of our operating segments and the Group.
Return on equity (‘ROE’) 
(%)
None Not applicable Calculated as profit after tax (adjusted for exceptional items) divided 
by average opening and closing equity. It is used as a measure of 
overall shareholder returns adjusted for exceptional items. 
Equity to receivables ratio 
(%)
None Not applicable Total equity divided by amounts receivable from customers. This is a 
measure of balance sheet strength and the Group targets a ratio of 
around 40%.
Headroom (£M) Undrawn 
external bank 
facilities
None
Headroom is an alternative term for undrawn external bank facilities.
Other measures
Customers None Not applicable Customers that are being served by our agents or through our 
money transfer product in the home credit business and customers 
that are not in default in our digital business.
Customer retention (%) None Not applicable The proportion of customers that are retained for their third or 
subsequent loan. Our ability to retain customers is central to 
achieving our strategy and is an indicator of the quality of our 
customer service. We do not retain customers who have a poor 
payment history as it can create a continuing impairment risk and 
runs counter to our responsible lending commitments.
Employees and Agents Employee 
information
Not applicable Agents are self-employed individuals who represent the Group’s 
subsidiaries and are engaged under civil contracts with the 
exception of Hungary and Romania where they are employees 
engaged under employment contracts due to local regulatory 
reasons.
Agent and employee 
retention (%)
None Not applicable This measure represents the proportion of our employees and agents 
that have been working for or representing the Group for more than 
12 months. Experienced people help us to achieve and sustain 
strong customer relationships and a high quality service, both of 
which are central to achieving good customer retention. Good 
agent and employee retention also helps reduce costs of 
recruitment and training, enabling more investment in people 
development.  International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 135

Payment of dividends
We can pay dividends directly into a shareholder’s bank account. 
This ensures secure delivery and means that cleared funds are 
received on the payment date. For shareholders resident outside  
the UK, we offer dividend payments via Link’s International Payment 
Service to a number of countries which are paid in local currency.  
To receive more information or to change your preferred dividend 
payment method, please contact the Company’s registrar, Link 
Asset Services.
