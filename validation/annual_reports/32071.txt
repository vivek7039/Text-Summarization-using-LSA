ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At a Glance
PPG is a holding Company with subsidiaries and investments focused 
on the development and operation of flexible energy generation facilities, 
which play a crucial role in the changing UK energy mix as renewable 
generation replaces carbon intensive generation.
WHAT WE DO
Our 20MW ‘FlexGen’ sites – which can 
generate power within 30 seconds of 
being switched on remotely – provide 
a vital, low cost solution to assist in 
balancing the UK’s energy supply on a 
moment by moment basis. 
Since the introduction of intermittent, 
renewable power to the UK’s energy 
mix as legacy carbon intensive capacity 
is retired, the National Grid has faced 
increasing risks of brownouts and 
blackouts. UK power prices have seen 
recent peaks above £1,500 per MW 
hour due to outage and generation 
imbalances; there is therefore a need 
for a reliable source of power that can 
be accessed quickly and flexibly during 
periods when demand exceeds available 
supply. 
HOW WE OPERATE
Our facilities use established, reliable 
technology based on containerised 
generators, fired with renewable green 
fuel or gas – either mains or Liquidified 
Natural Gas (LNG).
Nine green fuel projects have been 
financed with a combination of debt and 
£35m of equity by Rockpool Investments 
LLP in individual companies established 
for this purpose. Plutus PowerGen has a 
44.5% stake in each company, and earns 
fees of £150,000 per site per year from 
management contracts. 
Other facilities, which will be gas-
powered, will be held in dedicated 
subsidiary companies as part of a non-
dilutive investment model in which we 
will seek to obtain a majority interest. We 
maintain complete flexibility in financing 
options for both the equity portion and 
the asset finance and maintain dialogue 
with many providers of finance. During 
the year we received an offer from a ‘Big 
Six’ multinational utility company to fund 
up to 20% of our flexible energy projects. 
Indeed, we have also just announced 
Heads of Terms agreement with JCB 
Power Products Broadcrown Limited, 
a part of the JCB Group, to provide, 
install, maintain and finance generators 
for existing and future projects, which 
may be through JCB Finance Limited or 
asset finance, where appropriate. JCB 
Finance Limited is part of the Royal Bank 
of Scotland Group plc.
Our model is built upon the ability to 
earn revenue from multiple markets for 
flexible power, as well as from secured 
management contracts read more on 
pages 14 to 17:
• Short Term Operating Reserve (STOR)
• Firm Frequency Response (FFR)
• Triad
• Merchant power sales
• Capacity Market – on 15 year 
contracts
Finally, we have begun to develop battery 
projects through our partnership with 
London & Devonshire Trust (LDT), which 
represents c.80MW in our pipeline.
WHERE WE OPERATE
The projects in our pipeline are located in 
various regions of the UK. Our first site, in 
Plymouth, has traded successfully since 
it began operations in November 2016; 
a further eight renewable green diesel 
20MW projects and a further four 20MW 
gas projects are in various stages of 
development. Our unmanned generators 
are connected to the local, low voltage 
distribution network and are therefore 
classified as embedded generation.
02
PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Standalone FlexGen 
sites – green diesel 
powered
Our initial portfolio 
comprises nine Rockpool-
funded investee company 
sites (or 180MW). Focusing 
on these projects has 
allowed the Company to 
quickly establish a solid 
revenue and investment 
base. 
Standalone FlexGen 
sites – gas powered
To diversify our project 
portfolio, we have expanded 
our activities into gas 
powered generators, using 
both mains gas as well 
as LNG, which provides 
locational flexibility. These 
projects will allow us to take 
advantage of new markets 
and the anticipated power 
price volatility, as they are 
able to run for longer hours 
at a lower strike price.
Co-located SolarFlex 
sites
One of our strategic 
priorities is to establish 
SolarFlex sites, where 
our generators are co-
located – and share grid 
connections – with solar 
farms. The technologies are 
highly complementary, since 
our generators would use 
the connections when not 
required by the solar farms, 
and would therefore allow 
greater utilisation of the 
connections. By providing 
an additional return to the 
solar farm operators, we 
would help to accelerate 
the development of solar 
farms without the need for 
subsidy.
Battery Sites
These will generally be 
stand-alone but may be 
used in conjunction with 
Gas or SolarFlex and 
our stand-alone battery 
projects are currently being 
developed in partnership 
with LDT.
OUR PIPELINE
We have a total pipeline of over 700MW, and will have 120MW of capacity in operation for this 
winter with a further 140MW at the post-planning stage by the end of 2017.
We aim to develop the following types of projects, and are actively working with a company 
to explore ‘front-ending’ each site using exhaustible (i.e. non-firm) power from batteries or 
capacitors to allow us to compete in additional balancing markets as well as be more price 
competitive in existing markets:

PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 KEY AREAS OF FOCUS 
With the commissioning of our inaugural project 
in Plymouth in November 2016, I am delighted 
to report that we generated a maiden profit at 
the half year and a trading profit at the year end, 
before write offs with regard to irrecoverable 
disbursements for sites that are not going ahead 
for various reasons. Such reasons include planning 
permission not being achieved, overly expensive 
or impractical connections for a variety of reasons 
such as location expense or likely construction 
difficulties. Nevertheless, at the time of writing we 
now have all nine sites with Rockpool in various 
stages of development; one of which is operating, 
a further five are currently being built and should 
be operating by the New Year, with the balance to 
be built out in 2018. Our primary operational focus 
has therefore been on the continued execution and 
delivery of the nine sites equity funded by Rockpool 
Investments LLP of which we have a 44.5% interest 
in each. 
As a complement to our green diesel projects, the 
group is now diversifying into gas fuelled power 
generation and battery powered energy storage 
projects, which may also be used in conjunction 
with SolarFlex and gas-powered generation sites. 
The management team has been working to 
develop and progress a pipeline of gas powered 
sites in which we intend to hold majority stakes 
of typically 80% but may also be joint ventures. 
We retain complete flexibility in financing projects 
going forward but aim to ensure that all future 
gas sites operated via new companies, typically 
holding 20MW each as before, are able to be 
consolidated in our accounts. With this in mind, we 
recently launched a £50 million bond advised by 
Bedford Row Capital, to be listed in Frankfurt, that 
is about to be marketed to investors. The bond is 
to fund the ‘equity’ portion of each site; each site 
has a typical capacity of 20MW, is held in a special 
purpose vehicle, and will normally have 20-40% 
of equity, with the balance funded with asset or 
project finance. 
MARKET CONTEXT
There has been some uncertainty in the market 
on account of regulatory reviews from DEFRA 
and Ofgem (read more in the Market Overview on 
pages 12 and 13). 
In light of these reviews and the proposed phasing 
out of Triad payments over the next three years, 
we have remodelled the existing businesses and 
future gas operated sites. We are still able to 
achieve a reasonable IRR for FlexGen projects 
and a very good IRR (well in excess of 20%) for all 
gas projects, which will likely operate for a longer 
number of hours per annum.
The underlying drivers of overall supply and demand 
for power have not changed, however, and we 
believe that the markets for STOR and FFR, for 
example, will firm over the coming years. The power 
supply mix to the National Grid will also mean that 
there will be many opportunities to trade electrons in 
future, due to the peaks and troughs in the market. 
Over winter 2016/17, Attune Energy Ltd (our site 
in Plymouth) could have earned c.£1.5-£1.8m by 
taking advantage of market prices when these 
spiked. Because of commitments to FFR, Triad 
and STOR, we have not always been able to take 
advantage of such fluctuations, but expect to be in 
a better position to do so with gas powered sites. 
Attune Energy operated very successfully during last 
winter with an above budget operating profit.
Chairman’s Statement

to report our maiden trading profits

STRATEGY
In addition to our planned focus on installing gas 
engine capacity and the bond to finance this, 
we are looking at the use of power storage, i.e. 
batteries or capacitor technologies, in conjunction 
with our gas sites, which will open up FFR markets 
and other fast response tariffs to gas. Our strategy 
with respect to the green diesel sites is – alongside 
Rockpool – to either sell these after the end of the 
EIS qualification period or to make an offer for the 
55.5% we do not already own. Our relationship 
with a leading Big Six multinational utility company 
to fund up to 20% of any 20MW renewable fuel or 
gas powered flexible energy projects going forward 
fits ideally with the Company’s strategy to deliver 
projects in which it holds an 80% interest, and this 
relationship is envisaged to provide sufficient equity 
to allow PPG to develop majority owned assets 
while maintaining its policy of limiting dilution to 
shareholders as far as possible. It also gives us 
additional flexibility in funding our various project 
types going forward including Gas, SolarFlex and 
Battery Power Storage. 
DIVIDEND
We do not propose to pay a dividend as we plan 
to reinvest all internally generated funds for the 
foreseeable future.
OUTLOOK 
At the end of a busy and productive year, I wish 
to thank the staff and Directors for their valued 
contributions, as well as our partners and advisors, 
who provide invaluable support in developing our 
operations. In February 2017, we appointed Cantor 
Fitzgerald Europe as Nominated Advisor and Broker 
to the Company with whom we also look forward to 
a long and fruitful relationship. 
We have a robust pipeline, with 240MW in the active 
pipeline (building, planned and expected planning) 
and a total pipeline of all types of generation and 
storage of around 700MW. In light of the foregoing, 
we view the year ahead with confidence, and look 
forward to securing planning permission on our 
pipeline of gas and battery sites and building out 
that portfolio over the coming years.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
07 Chief Executive’ s Review
We continue to roll out our model, which is designed to address  
fundamental market drivers and to be resilient in the face of  
current regulatory uncertainty.
HIGHLIGHTS
The last year saw the achievement of two related 
milestones for Plutus Powergen. Our first site 
- Attune Energy in Plymouth – came online in 
November 2016 and, as a result of meeting the three 
Triad periods, the site was profitable over the small 
number of hours it generated. Secondly, as a result 
of securing access to planning for the Rockpool 
sites, the Company was pleased to be able to 
report achieving our maiden trading profit before 
development site write offs at the year end.
We have made good progress with the installation 
of power generation projects, and will have 6 
operational facilities representing 120MW of capacity 
by the end of 2017. We have the remaining three 
Rockpool sites with planning and anticipate having 
these built in time for next winter. 
Further sites will be based on gas powered engines 
(see Strategy, below). We have submitted planning 
applications for 80MW of gas capacity, and have a 
total pipeline of gas, (mains and LNG), and battery 
sites of 700MW.
In last December’s capacity auction, we were 
awarded Capacity Mechanism contracts for three 
20MW sites and have entered a further eight sites 
for the next auction in February 2018.
MARKET CONTEXT
There remains regulatory uncertainty in the market. 
In March 2017, Ofgem published a ‘minded to’ 
decision, which it confirmed recently. From the 
winter of 2020/21, this would reduce the embedded 
benefits received by distribution connected 
generators such as PPG to the residual charge. 
While this change settles down, there is concern 
among industry participants that price volatility will 
increase, which in turn will lead to higher energy 
prices. Additionally, third party analysis indicates  
that generators generating for the Triad market  
have acted to depress volatility over the winter –  
or peak demand – months. The effect of increased 
volatility over the winter months, when demand is 
high, increases the risk that energy prices will spike.  
While there is a price cap of £1,500/MWh, there are 
plans in place for this to be raised to £3,000 initially 
and then to £6,000 per MWh. This cost must either 
be absorbed by suppliers or passed on to  
the consumer, but we may be able to benefit  
from such spikes.
Despite Ofgem’s decision, our returns are still 
anticipated to be at or above our base case 
projections. Any loss of Triad income is expected to 
be offset by firmer prices in the balancing markets 
as National Grid seeks to physically balance the grid 
and the market for flexible power as suppliers seek 
to balance their retail power books and mitigate 
energy price volatility.
The outcome of DEFRA’s consultation on lower 
emissions limits was delayed by the general election 
until just recently, but we are confident of being able 
to comply with the proposed new rules without any 
material impact on investor returns. The proposed 
outcomes in relation to the transposition into UK 
law of the Medium Combustion Plant Directive 
(MCPD) will require us to fit selective catalytic 
reduction (SCR) or other measures to reduce the 
NOx from our green fuel fleet, but the cost of this 
is manageable. We continue to monitor and be 
involved in the consultation process.
08
PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 National Grid launched a review in June of all 
markets which seeks to make the balancing markets 
in which we compete more dynamic and closer to 
real-time. Over the next 18 months National Grid 
plans to rationalise the number of markets they 
operate for balancing, and also be more transparent 
with the data and the way that they balance. They 
also want to make the markets more real time: a 
day ahead FFR market and STOR, and an in-day 
trading market around frequency response. They 
are consulting about shifting the market away from 
auctions to a traded market, to trade capacity in the 
same way as the market trades electrons. These 
changes will cement the role of local, reliable, flexible 
generation in the UK energy mix.
Notwithstanding this uncertainty and likely changes 
to the way that value will be distributed in the 
market, the fundamental drivers remain the same. 
Insufficient base load power generation capacity 
is being installed. No large gas power stations are 
being built, and still no nuclear, yet demand for 
energy is increasing and becoming more reliant 
on renewable sources to meet it. The proposed 
withdrawal of new petrol and diesel cars from the 
roads by 2040 will further increase demand for 
power for charging electric vehicles.
A key indicator of the importance of flexible 
generation is that energy suppliers are finding 
ever more inventive ways to access that capacity.  
These solutions range from innovative procurement 
arrangements, through to co-investment.  
Additionally, some suppliers are starting to develop 
innovative solutions, such as using existing energy 
market contracts to hypothecate or match up 
demand and supply, so consumers can be more 
certain of the price in a highly volatile market. This 
is a good thing for big power consumers or local 
communities that are a little off grid or can organise 
to capitalise on such opportunities, but the net effect 
is that the remaining market may become even more 
volatile, resulting in further separation between the 
energy rich and energy poor. 
OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY
Our original objective was to have 200MW of 
generating capacity within three years. By the end 
of this calendar year we will have 120MW installed 
and operational, and the remaining three renewable 
diesel sites operational in time for next winter. This 
means we will have achieved 180MW of renewable 
diesel sites – or 90% of our target – after four  
years, through some very challenging times from  
a regulatory and financing perspective.
Our most significant strategic shift is our decision 
to diversify into gas powered engines. We started 
this process in the new year, and now have 80MW 
of projects in planning and a further 120MW in the 
pre-planning stage. This means that we are aiming 
for around 200MW of gas-fired generation over the 
next two to three years, and we continue develop 
our overall pipeline of 700MW further.
There are several factors that favour gas for use in 
flexible generation: 
• More hours of running
• Lower levels of pollution, in terms of NOx, CO
2
 
and CO, and SOx;
• Negligible soot and particulate emissions, and no 
smoke or odour in exhaust gases;
• Similar levels of efficiency as green fuel engines;
• Greater reliability, allowing higher maintenance 
intervals and thus reducing costs as well as 
waste oil;
• Reduced noise and vibration;
• The ability to operate on a wide range of gaseous 
fuels, from mains gas and LNG through to 
digester gas derived from the anaerobic digestion 
of sewage and other organic wastes.
Each gas powered site, which will take approximately 
eight months to construct, is anticipated to generate 
an EBITDA of up to £3m per year when Capacity 
Mechanism payments commence.
OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
09
PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Chief Executive’s Review continued
With gas engines, the economics are such that they 
are able to run merchant to take advantage of peak 
prices as well as assist suppliers in managing volatility 
in their retail power books. Looking back over history, 
peak energy prices suggest these facilities would 
need to run in the range of 1200-1400 hours per 
year. Since volatility drives peak energy prices, these 
numbers may well increase.  
We are beginning to look at hybrid technologies 
whereby both the gas and green fuel sites would 
be fitted with a storage (or exhaustible) capability, 
such as batteries. Combining firm and exhaustible 
generation on the same site allows us to compete 
in more real-time markets, which is the strategic 
direction in which National Grid is consulting to 
implement these markets. We will be piloting these 
technologies on our sites once we have established 
the economic and technical cases.
SolarFlex, which seeks to co-locate firm generation 
and intermittent generation sources, and investigate 
installing exhaustible generation to build ‘real-world’ 
operational data sets, remains part of our strategy 
however has been slower to come to fruition as 
prospective partners have not yet decided their 
preferred approach. We continue to explore this 
approach and remain confident we can demonstrate 
the value to solar operators as our hybrid sites 
establish themselves.
OUTLOOK 
We have a healthy pipeline, and will continue to 
progress with our strategy to develop, build, own 
and operate flexible generation capacity. The 
renewable green diesel sites for Rockpool are 
secured, with five to be connected by the end of 
the year and the remaining three by the end of next. 
We are beginning our gas journey with 80MW in 
planning with the aim to meet our initial target of 
200MW. Although we are closing the chapter on 
renewable diesel fuel, we will seek to make those 
assets more valuable by retrofitting appropriate 
storage technology as it becomes economic. 
Despite some regulatory question marks, we remain 
confident that our FlexGen model is a key part of the 
solution to the challenges ahead as a result of the 
structural changes to the UK’s energy mix.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Sustainability
Our flexible, standby sites 
facilitate the UK’s increasing 
reliance on renewable energy.
By plugging intermittency gaps from renewable 
energy power generation in a cost-effective 
manner, our sites will assist in enabling further 
decarbonisation of the UK energy sector.
Our flexgen facilities are anticipated to run for no 
more than 150 hours per year in 60 minute blocks 
of time during peak demand, and may not exceed 
300 hours as a result of the commitments made in 
the planning permission process. Despite providing 
valuable standby generating capacity, each facility 
is expected to be switched off for more than 97% 
of the time, ensuring that annualised emissions are 
minimal. Our facilities will conform to all UK and EU 
air quality standards.
Our Rockpool co-investment power generation 
sites are fired with green renewable fuel from HVO 
(hydrogenated vegetable oil), which reduces the 
environmental impact and also stimulates the 
development of such fuels by providing a proven 
market. Relative to conventional diesel, this fuel 
eliminates sulphur oxides (SOx), reduces nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) by c.30% and reduces particulates.
We also continually evaluate other types of green 
fuel and look at technology to add to our generators 
to comply with the more stringent requirements 
associated with the incoming Medium Combustion 
Plant Directive.
OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
11
PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Despite a considerable degree of regulatory uncertainty, the fundamental 
drivers of demand for flexible electricity generation remain, on account of 
structural changes to the UK’s power generation mix.
Our Market
INCREASING VOLATILITY
As high carbon sources of energy continue to be 
retired, renewable power generation has come to 
account for close to 30% of the UK’s energy supply. 
With the Government’s commitment to closing all 
coal-fired power stations by 2025, and with new 
gas or nuclear power stations at least 10 to 15 years 
away from coming online, reliance on diverse and 
intermittent sources of energy embedded within 
the distribution network (notably wind and solar) 
is set to increase. The lower proportion of energy 
generated from reliable ‘baseload’ sources has led 
to increasing challenges in the balancing of supply 
and demand. As the energy mix changes, there 
is reduced availability of flexibility in the Balancing 
Mechanism, and/or this is becoming more costly to 
access.
CONTINUING TIGHT CAPACITY 
MARGINS
Capacity margins – the difference between peak 
electricity demand and the capacity available to 
meet this – have become tighter in recent years. 
For winter 2016/17, National Grid continue to warn 
of tight margins and the volume procured in the 
Capacity Market remains sizeable. The scheduled 
closure of coal power stations, coupled with 
uncertainty and delays in respect of nuclear and gas 
sites, are likely only to exacerbate these issues.
CHANGING NEED FOR BALANCING 
SERVICES
As system operator, National Grid is responsible for 
ensuring that the UK electricity system has sufficient 
supply to match demand, and operates balancing 
services to continuously match supply to demand to 
avoid frequency distortions, brownouts or blackouts.
The current markets are complex, unclear and not 
future-proof, and not accessible to all potential 
providers. The changing energy mix and the 
increasing need for cost-effective flexibility means a 
review of the current markets is required.
As outlined in its System Needs and Product 
Strategy (SNAPS) proposal in June 2017, National 
Grid aims to have in place, by 2021, a smart, flexible 
system that harnesses all available energy sources 
– a simple, transparent marketplace for new and 
established providers and technology types. By 
simplifying balancing services and improving the 
sharing of information, the objective is to remove 
barriers to allow better use to be made of distributed 
energy sources. 
National Grid also recently introduced an Enhanced 
Frequency Response market, for very rapid 
response such as could be provided by battery 
storage units. Battery storage remains markedly 
higher cost than other short-term generation 
solutions and has technological limitations. As a 
result, this new market is likely to complement, 
rather than remove demand from existing frequency 
response markets.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 MARKET DRIVERS FAVOUR FLEXIBLE POWER GENERATION
In the context of the structural changes to the UK energy sector outlined above and the resulting challenges, flexible power 
generation plays a vital role in supporting the pillars of the UK’s energy strategy, as summarised in the table below.
Keeping the lights on Network support
• Improve operational capability by lowering demands on the network
• Support the distribution system and provide an important tool to accommodate intermittency of 
renewable sources
Frequency control 
• Maintain system frequency within operating parameters by generating very quickly, 
supporting local balancing
System inertia improvement
• Lower the risk of failure by increasing the inertia on the system
Short run back up capacity
• Add small scale capacity that can run when larger assets fail
Affordable Best value to the consumer
• Derive all revenue through market-delivered processes
• Provide opportunity for reduced connection costs by sharing Grid  
connections with solar
Low carbon A system that allows the wider decarbonisation of energy
• Provide operational ‘cover’ for renewables
• Give network operators fine tuning capability rather than large scale capacity
Unlike large power stations, which connect 
to the high voltage transmission grid, most 
flexible generating assets connect directly to 
local distribution networks. This is known as 
embedded generation, and confers several 
advantages that result in lower consumer bills, 
as well as generators earning a premium over 
wholesale electricity prices:
• Reduced charges: Although embedded 
generation providers are subject to local 
distribution network fees, they avoid 
charges relating to transmission use, 
distribution system use and system 
balancing. Embedded generation also 
reduces the need for investment in the 
transmission and distribution networks, 
and saves costs associated with operating 
and maintaining existing infrastructure.
• Reduced thermal losses;
• Reduced regulation: embedded generation 
is not subject to regulatory burdens such as 
the Carbon Price Floor and Climate Change 
Levy.
Embedded generation also generally reduces 
the volume from balancing energy and hence 
can reduce the cost of balancing the system 
on a half hourly basis. Controllable plants such 
as generators also facilitate management of 
intermittency at a local level, allowing greater 
deployment of renewable generation assets 
than would otherwise be viable.
The operational benefits and cost efficiencies 
in the form of avoided charges are typically 
shared between suppliers and the local 
producers they contract with, and ultimately 
benefit consumers through reduced  
energy bills.

PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 WHAT WE DO
We are applying our management 
expertise to the establishment of a group 
of subsidiaries and investments active 
in the development, construction and 
operation of stand-by flexible electricity 
generation sites in the UK.
We sell power to energy suppliers and 
the National Grid via several mechanisms, 
and our sites are expected to operate 
during periods of peak electricity demand 
or grid instability.
HOW WE OPERATE
Proven, modular generation tech-
nology
We use established, reliable technology 
based on containerised generators, 
fired with renewable green fuel and 
– going forward – gas, and possibly 
in conjunction with battery storage or 
independent battery storage projects. 
Treated as embedded generation, our 
unmanned gensets supply the local 
low voltage distribution network and 
are switched on remotely, reaching full 
output, depending on generation power 
type, within 10–150 seconds. Each plant 
generally has a maximum generating 
capacity of 20MW. This is optimal for two 
reasons:
• The planning thresholds – and 
therefore construction timescales – 
are reduced; and
• The emissions fall below a European 
threshold, thereby reducing 
compliance costs and risk.
Non-dilutive finance model
By setting up a dedicated entity for 
each site, we have limited medium-term 
dilution to existing holding Company 
shareholders. The first nine sites have 
been financed with equity from clients of 
Rockpool in each of the nine investment 
entities established for this purpose, 
and have advance assurance from Her 
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to 
benefit from EIS-related tax benefits. 
PPG has a 44.5% stake in each of these 
entities, and currently derives revenue 
from a management contract with 
each site. From November 2015, EIS 
was closed off to new standby power 
generation projects. Future projects 
will be held in separate subsidiary 
companies, in which PPG will seek to 
obtain an interest of 80%, however PPG 
may enter into joint ventures or other 
flexible financing options, the principle 
generally being that the accounts of each 
vehicle will be capable of consolidation 
into the group accounts.
Our multi-revenue stream model is founded upon the development of  
20MW flexible generation facilities, funded through a combination of equity 
and asset finance via dedicated investments and subsidiaries.

opportunities to provide development 
capital for management contracts.
Banks: we have strong relationships with 
a number of banks and other financial 
institutions to provide debt financing, 
including JCB.
Third party investors: we continue to 
work with other potential and credible 
investors, including a ‘Big 6’ utility group 
with whom we agreed an indicative 
partnership to fund 20% of future 
projects.
Investors: PPG was readmitted to 
AIM in August 2014 to capitalise on the 
opportunity in flexible power generation 
and intends to raise further funding 
from a £50m bond issue to enable us to 
develop further sites.
Connections and Contracts
National Grid: we will secure STOR 
and FFR contracts with National Grid 
for our facilities, and we have secured 
Capacity Market contracts for five sites 
and are applying for a further eight 
sites in the Capacity Market Auction in

PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 HOW WE CREATE VALUE
Our model is based upon multiple revenue streams. The current mechanisms for generating revenue from power sales are 
outlined in the table below. Although the precise mechanisms are subject to review as part of National Grid’s consultation into 
Systems Needs and Product Strategy, the strategic importance of flexible generation means that the outcome is thought unlikely 
to be unfavourable to embedded power generators. The consultation is scheduled for completion by the end of 2018. 
Aside from earning revenue from the supply energy, we have a management contract with each Rockpool investor-funded  
site, which generates revenue of £150,000 per site per year. Under the terms of these contracts, we manage the asset, from 
identifying the site, obtaining planning permission, to managing the connection, construction and operation of the plant.
Sources of revenue from energy supply
Mechanism Overview Counterparty
STOR The Short Term Operating Reserve is a mechanism used by National Grid to balance 
the UK’s power supply at short notice. The STOR allows required electricity supply to be 
decreased (by incentivising major consumers to reduce demand) or increased, by calling 
on a pool of stand-by power generators.
Under the terms of two-year contracts, National Grid pays STOR providers for making 
their capacity available, as well as for delivery of electricity.
National Grid
Firm Frequency 
Response (FFR)
FFR is a service procured by National Grid to manage system frequency, the system-
wide signal that indicates whether energy supply exceeds demand or vice versa. FFR 
allows a provider to supply a service to reduce demand or increase generation, when 
instructed by National Grid.
FFR is procured via monthly tender. To take part, generators must be able to deliver a 
minimum of 10MW, and be capable of responding within 30 seconds and for sufficient 
duration. Similar to STOR, providers are paid for availability as well as for utilisation. PPG 
will compete in the static market, whereby energy change occurs at a pre-set frequency 
and remains at a set level. 
The addition of exhaustible (battery) power to PPG’s generators would allow access to 
the dynamic FFR market, where energy changes in line with system frequency.
National Grid
Triad Triad is the scheme under which the National Grid charges energy suppliers significant 
sums according to their use of the high voltage transmission network during Triad 
periods – the three half-hour periods of highest demand in a year, identified after the 
winter. The principal means for National Grid to cover its costs, Triad also serves to 
incentivise users to limit consumption during peak periods, thereby easing the need for 
investment in the transmission system. Through the PPA, energy supply companies pay 
flexible generators of electricity to supply power to local distribution networks during 
anticipated peak periods (both for the power generated and for Triad avoidance), as their 
generation reduces demand on the transmission network.
Generators must operate during each of the Triad periods to be eligible for payments.
Ofgem’s ‘minded to’ decision of June 2017 will see Triad benefits earned by small 
embedded generators such as PPG reduced to close to zero by the winter of 2020/21, 
effectively reducing over four years as to 100%, 66%, 33% and zero. There are likely, 
however, to be residual payments which could amount to up to 20% of the original 
Triad which will still make it a worthwhile income stream. This is not budgeted for in our 
remodelled projections post the ‘minded to’ decision.
Energy Suppliers
Our Business Model continued
16
PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Mechanism Overview Counterparty
Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPA)
This is simply sales of generated power; when operating with an objective of Triad 
avoidance, power is sold under a PPA, typically to a large UK energy supplier.
PPAs are typically of a 5+ year duration.
Energy Suppliers
Capacity Market To ensure long-term security of supply, the Capacity Market provides financial incentives 
to bring forward new investment while maximising existing generation capabilities. The 
structure of CM ensures technology neutrality, meaning that the lowest cost technologies 
that will guarantee capacity will be awarded 1, 3 and 15-year contracts, depending on 
the level of capex incurred. These capacity contracts are procured through a reverse 
auction, run by National Grid. Generators who are successful in the auction will benefit 
from a regular, predictable and index-linked revenue stream for every hour they are 
available. The capacity obligation means providers must be available to deliver energy 
when needed or face penalties.

the fast evolving market in which we operate and 
the evolution of our business model towards gas

Bring online standalone FlexGen sites Green Fuel
–  Nine Rockpool-funded investee  
company green diesel sites
The facility in Plymouth came online in November 2016. By the end of 2017 we will have 120MW 
of operational capacity, and the remaining three sites already have secured planning permission.
Rockpool have indicated that they will realise their investment in the nine FlexGen sites when 
the EIS qualification period expires. This will give us the opportunity to make an offer for the 
shares we do not own or sell our shares in each site alongside Rockpool
–  Majority-owned (non-EIS)  
gas powered sites
Gas
80MW of gas powered sites are at the planning stage, and we have a further 160MW  
in the pipeline.
Our goal is to develop at least four sites per year.
Derive revenue from  
multiple sources
As well as from the secured management contracts for each Rockpool site, we generate 
income in our investments from different markets for flexible power, although the precise nature 
of these may be subject to regulatory change.
Triad: Our Plymouth site earned attractive returns by hitting three Triad periods since 
becoming operational in November 2016. If Ofgem’s ‘minded to’ decision is implemented, this 
would reduce the Triad benefit received by small embedded generators such as PPG to close 
to zero from the winter of 2020/21.
Capacity Market: PPG has been awarded a total of five Capacity market contracts for 15 
years and one annual contract to date. This year the Company is applying for eight 15 year 
contracts (four FlexGen and four Gas) and six one year contracts
Power Purchase Agreement: We have Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with two 
national suppliers and are in detailed negotiations with a third.
FFR: Via our subsidiaries and investee companies, we intend to build power generation units 
which reach full response within 30 seconds and can sustain supply for 30 minutes, allowing us 
to compete in the static FFR market. STOR and FFR are mutually exclusive, although PPG may 
bid for both types and run FFR outside STOR hours.
Management contracts: PPG has been granted nine management contracts by the entities 
financed with equity from clients of Rockpool Investments. Under these agreements, PPG 
receives monthly payments equivalent to £150,000 per annum for each investee company.
STOR: We intend to secure STOR contracts with National Grid for our facilities.
Continue to pursue our limited dilution 
investment model, holding majority 
stakes in non-EIS funded, standalone 
flexible generation sites with outside 
investors where attractive
We intend to own majority stakes (typically 80%) in individual entities for future development 
sites. With that objective, we are in the process of raising £50 million gross through the issue of 
a 7% five year bond issue to be listed in Frankfurt. The net proceeds of this will – in conjunction 
with our existing cash resources and asset finance – be used to assist in the development of 
ten 20MW gas powered flexible generation sites.
Explore viability of battery, capacitor or 
inertial energy storage
Over the medium to longer-term, our strategy is to explore commercialisation of storage 
technologies on our green fuel, SolarFlex and gas sites, to compete in more real-time markets 
and allow us to access potentially more attractive returns.
Progress SolarFlex sites (co-located 
solar and FlexGen facilities)
We have held promising talks with several solar farm operators to establish SolarFlex sites (with 
shared connections for solar and non-intermittent generators) and are awaiting their response.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Financial Review
The year ended 30 April 2017 is our second full year of operations in the business of the development and 
operation of flexible energy generation projects, which play a crucial role in the changing UK energy mix as 
renewable generation replaces carbon intensive generation. 2017 has been a year of continued progress for 
the Group in the execution of its business plan. Throughout the year we had nine management contracts 
in place with Rockpool investee companies, each generating £150,000 per annum of fee income which 
represented an annualised fee income of £1,350,000 for the year ended 30 April 2017. 
In addition to the nine Rockpool companies, we continue to make progress towards the Company’s plan to 
add further capacity in the form of gas powered generation sites, with 80MW in planning, a further 120-
150MW of viable gas sites in the pipeline for next year and  circa 80MW of battery storage schemes in 
conjunction with LDT. Each site will be a subsidiary of the Company and will ordinarily hold up to 20MW of 
generating capacity. The Company will also seek to introduce outside investors so as to maintain its anti-
dilution funding model in the Holding Company and will normally seek to maintain a shareholding of at least 
80%. Our relationship with a leading Big Six multinational utility company to fund up to 20% of any 20MW 
renewable fuel or gas powered flexible energy projects going forward fits ideally with the Company’s strategy 
to deliver projects and will provide us with extra financing flexibility. Such sites will have the ability to be fully 
consolidated in the Group’s accounts, which will see a strengthening of the Group’s balance sheet and the 
earnings of each subsidiary will be consolidated into the profit and loss account of the Group.
The Company has recently launched a £50 million (gross) five year 7% bond, listed in Frankfurt, to give 
maximum flexibility to the suite of funding options available to it. The bond, once fully funded, will enable the 
Company to build up to a further ten new majority owned sites, which together with the Big Six multinational 
utility company, assists in maximising our financing capability and flexibility. We will be in a good financial 
position to develop the majority owned portfolio of gas powered, solarflex and battery storage sites.
During the year under review the Group increased its revenue to £1,350,000 (2016: £887 ,500), a rise of 52%, 
from the award of management contracts from the Rockpool investee companies. These fees are expected 
to continue under current management contracts at an annualised rate of £1.35 million in future periods. 
Plutus Energy Limited, our 100% owned operating subsidiary, will earn management fees from all future 
sites, in addition to our existing portfolio. Administrative expenses have increased marginally to £1,292,700 
(2016: £1,187 ,998). There are other operating expenses of £236,164 (2016: £79,590) in the year under review. 
These relate to write offs of expenses disbursed for sites not going forward for various reasons. There will be 
no further write offs with regard to Rockpool co-investee companies as all nine sites are now allocated and 
are in various stages of construction and development. Sites may continue to be pursued which do not go 
forward for various reasons but we expect to be able to minimise such write offs in the future. Because of 
these write offs the Group has made a loss after taxation of £201,501 (2016: £407 ,776) and consequently the 
basic and diluted loss per share from continuing operations was 0.03p (2016: 0.07p). However, if we discount 
the other non-recurring operating expenses attributable to site construction not proceeding, the Group would 
have made a maiden profit for the year ended 30 April 2017 of £34,663 (2016: Loss of £328,186), a positive 
turnaround in pro forma net profits of £362,849.
After the year end, James Longley and Charles Tatnall each exercised 10,000,000 warrants in the Company 
with a net cash benefit of £180,000. In addition, a new Group share option scheme was implemented after the 
financial year end. The 2017 Share Option Scheme is designed to incentivise the Directors as Plutus changes 
direction towards gas, solarflex and battery powered flexgen projects, of which the Company has an overall 
700MW pipeline. This is the first share option scheme to be implemented since the reverse acquisition of 
Plutus Energy Limited in August 2014. Since then, minimal shareholder dilution has been incurred as a result of 
external equity financing as the Company has ensured that the ongoing development of the Rockpool funded 
portfolio of 180MW of FlexGen sites have been financed entirely through external equity and debt thus far.
Post year end, the Company  granted an aggregate of 60,000,000 share options with an exercise price of 
1.485p pursuant to the 2017 Share Option Scheme, all vesting in three equal annual instalments. 15,000,000 
Options were granted to each of Paul Lazarevic, James Longley, Phil Stephens and Charles Tatnall on 18 
The Group has achieved considerable growth in fees received  
during the year, contributing materially to substantially reduced 
losses and attributable losses per share.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 May 2017. Charles Tatnall and James Longley also each hold 4,770,000 existing share options, which were 
awarded prior to the reverse acquisition of Plutus Energy. All of the Directors have indicated that they will not 
sell any shares that they hold for at least the next eighteen months. Following the issue of options and exercise 
of warrants, there are a total of 69,540,000 options in the Company outstanding, representing approximately 
9.8% of the Company’s issued share capital.
Cash was £71,609 at the year-end (2016: £22,608). Trade and other payables increased to £229,635 (2016: 
£166,288), due largely to the increased level of activity, particularly with regard to the site planning, lease and 
connection processes. Our ongoing overheads will be covered by management fees. In addition to which we 
will have the proceeds from the bond raise coming in to fund new sites and generate further management 
fees together with the consolidated operations. Overall, the Company is in a good situation financially and will 
continue to manage cash flow, accounts receivable and accounts payable in a fair and reasonable manner 
within the Group resources.
Group net assets at the year-end were £995,864 (2016: £1,166,089), a decrease of £170,225 (14.6%) due to 
net losses in the year generated from other operating costs from site costs written off.

appropriate.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Financial risk management objectives and policies of the Company are set out in note 24 to the financial 
statements.
GOING CONCERN
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the financial statements, the Directors are required to 
consider whether the Company can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group 
had cash and cash equivalents of £71,609 and net current liabilities of £89,288 as at 30 April 2017, and 
incurred a loss of £201,501 for the year then ended.
The Directors have based their opinions on a cash flow forecast, which assumes that sufficient revenue will 
be generated for working capital purposes and that operating costs will be kept to a minimum until adequate 
revenue streams are secured. In addition future plans for the Group will be funded externally through a mix 
of debt and equity financing. So the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Company 
was unable to continue as a going concern.

PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Risk Potential Impact Mitigation
Availability of 
suitable sites
Our ability to build flexible power generation projects 
depends upon our ability to source suitable sites and to 
secure these on commercially attractive terms. Should 
there be a lack of suitable sites or the cost of running the 
sites be excessive, this would have a material adverse 
effect on our operations and financial performance.
Our relationships with land owners and 
developers, and partnership with Reliance Energy 
underpin our strong pipeline of land, with over 
700MW of capacity under review or in progress.
Securing 
of planning 
permission
Failure to obtain permits, consents or approvals from 
third parties in connection with the development of 
stand-by power generation projects may affect our 
ability to complete projects. The planning process can 
be lengthy and delays often occur such that the process 
may span several accounting periods. Accordingly, there 
may be delays in realising value from projects.
Our strategy to focus on sites with a maximum 
20MW of generating capacity facilitates the 
planning permission process and limits emissions 
to below European thresholds.
The use of green fuel and gas also eases the 
planning process where local authorities have 
policies that favour low carbon power generation.
Ability to tender 
and win contracts
Our success is dependent on our ability to tender for 
and win contracts to supply flexible power. While we 
believe we have a good chance of successfully tendering 
for such contracts, should competition in the market 
increase or for any other reason we be unsuccessful in 
winning contracts to supply flexible power, this would 
have a material adverse effect on operations and financial 
performance.
Management’s track record, coupled with our 
success in securing contracts across diverse 
revenue streams, give us confidence that we will 
continue to be awarded contracts.
Volatility of 
electricity prices
Our activities and the viability of future energy generation 
projects are subject to changes in demand and prices 
for power. Energy prices fluctuate widely, influenced 
by diverse factors including supply and demand, 
political and economic conditions, speculative activities, 
expectations of inflation, interest rates and currency 
exchange rates.
A significant reduction in global demand for power, 
leading to a fall in prices, could lead to abandonment 
of one or more of our projects, should these prove 
uneconomical to operate, and impact the profitability  
of existing sites.
Margins are sufficiently attractive to allow us to 
be able to withstand a certain degree of price 
fluctuations, and our different revenue streams 
and contracts also serve to mitigate this risk. 
The shift towards rewarding capacity rather 
than simply energy – evidenced in the Capacity 
Market, with its 15-year contracts – also cushions 
us from energy price fluctuations.
Volatility presents opportunities for us to  
capitalise on high energy prices.
We have identified the principal risks to the Group achieving its  
objectives, and risk management is regularly on the agenda of the  
Board, Audit Committee and other senior management meetings.

PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Risk Potential Impact Mitigation
Political risk The flexible power generation sector is subject to 
national and regional regulatory oversight, spanning 
building codes, safety, environmental protection, utility 
interconnection and metering, and other matters relating 
to embedded generation.
Changes in Government policy could affect the return 
on investment and may result in changes in tax rates  
or reliefs.
Key near-term uncertainties relate to the outcome of 
Ofgem’s review of embedded benefits, DEFRA’s review of 
air quality and National Grid’s review of balancing markets.
The underlying need for flexible stand-by 
generation is growing, and policymakers are 
thought to recognise that such assets will have 
to be rewarded in one way or another in order to 
maintain security of supply.
Ofgem’s ‘minded to’ decision, if implemented, 
would reduce the Triad benefit received by small 
embedded generators to close to zero, from the 
winter of 2020/21. The multiple revenue streams 
of each site mean that financial returns, even 
excluding Triad will remain attractive.
Ability to raise 
further funds
Our business model depends on our ability to raise debt 
and/or equity funding for the entities we create for stand-
by generation projects.
There can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise 
funds on terms that are commercially viable in the 
context of our business model.
The attractive financial characteristics of  
our projects underpin our success to date in 
raising funds.
Each 20MW gas project requires capex of circa 
£12.5m, and will be placed in a newly formed 
company. We will fund the equity portion with the 
proceeds of a bond issue and possibly external 
equity. Each site pays a monthly management fee 
to PPG. The highly cash generative nature of each 
site is expected to be sufficient to repay the bond 
after five years, amongst other repayment options.

PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the report of the Directors and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The Directors are required by the 
AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange to prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and have also elected to prepare the Company financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
• The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Company cash flow statements, and the related notes.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by 
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed. 
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF 
DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 30, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
(APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group and Company’s affairs as at 30 April 
2017 and of the Group and Company’s loss for the year 
then ended; 
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; 
and
• the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies  
Act 2006.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTER PRESCRIBED BY 
THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit, the information given in the strategic report 
and the report of the directors for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements. No material 
misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Director’s 
Report have been identified.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO 
REPORT BY EXCEPTION
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.

PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Notes to the Financial Statements
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Plutus PowerGen plc is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of 
the registered office is given on page 53. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 8 to 23, Directors’ Report on pages 28 and 29, and in the Chairman’s Statement on pages 6 and 7.
These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the Group operates.
2. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The financial statements comply with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The following new and revised Standards and 
Interpretations have been adopted in the current period by the Group for the first time and do not have a material impact on 
the Group.
IFRS 12  Disclosures of interests in other entities
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective and 
not early adopted. None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements of the Group.
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Plutus PowerGen plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the European Union 
(“EU”) applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
IFRS is subject to amendment and interpretation by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and the 
International Financial Standards Interpretations Committee (“IFRS IC”) and there is an ongoing process of review and 
endorsement by the European Commission. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments 
that are measured at amortised cost, as explained in the accounting policies below.
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Plutus PowerGen plc (the “Company”) 
and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. 
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing 
whether the Group controls another entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from 
the date that control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Profits 
and losses resulting from inter-company transactions that are recognised in assets are also eliminated. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into 
line with those used by the Group.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the year end date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and 
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each year end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged 
or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the 
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and where they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Revenue is derived from the provision of management services which are invoiced on a monthly basis and are recognised in the 
period to which they relate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: ‘available for sale investments’, ‘loans and receivables’ and 
‘cash and cash equivalents’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at 
the time of initial recognition.
Available for sale investments
Investments are designated as available-for-sale financial assets if they do not have fixed maturities and fixed or determinable 
payments, and management intends to hold them for the medium to long-term. Financial assets that are not classified into any of 
the other categories are also included in the available-for-sale category.
38
PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Investments are initially measured at fair value plus incidental acquisition costs. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value 
in accordance with IAS 39. In respect of quoted investments, this is either the bid price at the period end date or the last 
traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted, with no deduction for any 
estimated future selling cost. Unquoted investments are valued by the Directors using primary valuation techniques such as 
recent transactions, last price or net asset value.
Gains and losses on measurement are recognised in other comprehensive income except for impairment losses and foreign 
exchange gains and losses on monetary items denominated in a foreign currency, which are recognised directly in profit or 
loss. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in 
other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss.
The Group assesses at each period end date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets classified as available-for-sale has been impaired. An impairment loss is recognised if there is objective 
evidence that an event or events since initial recognition of the asset have adversely affected the amount or timing of future 
cash flows from the asset. A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a security below its cost shall be considered in 
determining whether the asset is impaired.
When a decline in the fair value of a financial asset classified as available-for-sale has been previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss is removed from other 
comprehensive income and recognised in profit or loss. The loss is measured as the difference between the cost of the 
financial asset and its current fair value less any previous impairment.
Fair Value Measurements:
The Group holds investments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period using the IFRS 7 fair value 
hierarchy as set out below. 
Level 1 – valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 – valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1. 
Level 3 – valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by 
applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it 
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group 
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, 
the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise 
the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
The share capital account represents the amount subscribed for shares at nominal value. 
The share premium account represents premiums received on the initial issuing of the share capital. Any transaction costs 
associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from share premium, net of any related income tax benefits.
The share option reserve represents the fair value, calculated at the date of grant, of options unexercised at the balance sheet date.
The loan note equity reserve represents the fair value, calculated at issuance of the loan notes.
Retained losses include all current and prior period results as disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income.
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument. All interest related charges are recognised as an expense in finance cost in the income statement using the 
effective interest rate method. 
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and borrowings.
Trade payables are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less settlement payments.
Borrowings represent convertible loans that are accounted for as compound instruments. The fair value of the liability portion of 
the convertible loan notes is determined using a market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible loan note. This amount is 
recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the loan notes. The remainder of 
the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option, which is recognised and included in shareholders’ equity, net of tax effects, 
and is not subsequently re-measured.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group 
will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to 
settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’.
The Group issues equity-settled share based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and 
adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are 
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period; or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
(i) Going concern
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the financial statements, the Directors are required to consider whether 
the Company can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group had cash and cash equivalents of 
£71,609 and net current liabilities of £89,228 as at 30 April 2017, and incurred a loss of £201,501 for the year then ended. 
The Directors have based their opinions on a cash flow forecast, which assumes that sufficient revenue will be generated for 
working capital purposes and that operating costs will be kept to a minimum until adequate revenue streams are secured. In 
addition future plans for the Group will be funded externally through a mix of debt and equity financing, which at the time of 
signing the accounts had not yet been completed. So whilst there are uncertainties, the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result 
if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.
(ii) Classification of investments as available for sale
Note 11 describes the investments in nine operating companies where the Group’s shareholdings exceed 20% as ‘Available 
for Sale Investments’. Based on the contractual agreements between the Group and other investors, the Group does not 
have any power to appoint or remove board of directors members of the investees. Therefore the Directors of the Company 
concluded that the Group does not have significant influence over these companies.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year, are set out below.
(i) Share options
In order to calculate the charge for share-options as required by IFRS 2, the Group makes estimates principally relating to the 
assumptions used in its Black-Scholes option pricing model as set out in note 23.
(i) Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired required an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the directors to estimate the future cash flows expected 
to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Where the future cash 
flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss may arise.
5. BUSINESS SEGMENTS
In accordance with IFRS 8, the Group is required to define its operating segments based on the internal reports presented to its 
Chief Operating decision maker in order to allocate resources and assess performance. The Chief Operating decision maker is 
the Chief Executive. There is only one continuing class of business, being the investment in the natural resources sector. 
Given that there is only one continuing class of business, operating within the UK, no further segmental information has 
been provided.

Deferred tax assets of approximately £494,000 (2016: £458,000) have not been recognised as the Directors consider there to 
be insufficient evidence that the assets will be recovered. 
10. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
In order to calculate diluted loss per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue was adjusted to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares according to IAS 33. Dilutive potential ordinary shares include share options 
granted to employees and Directors where the exercise price (adjusted according to IAS 33) is less than the average market 
price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year.
IAS 33 ‘Earnings per share’ requires presentation of diluted earnings per share when a company could be called upon to 
issue shares that would decrease net profit or increase net loss per share. Only options that are ‘in the money’ are treated as 
dilutive and net loss per share would not be increased by the exercise of such options.

Goodwill arises on acquisition of a 100% of the equity of Plutus Energy Limited (“PEL ”).
The recoverable amount is determined based on value-in-use calculations which uses cash flow projections based on 
financial budgets approved by the Directors covering a five-year period, and a discount rate of 12% per annum.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates of 10% which is based on the 
average growth for 5 years covered by the projections. The Directors believe that any reasonably possible change in key 
assumptions on which recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.
The Directors have reviewed the carrying value of goodwill as at 30 April 2017 and consider that no impairment provision 
is required. 
The Directors continue to review goodwill on an on-going basis and where necessary in future periods will request external 
valuations to further support the valuation basis.

17. BORROWINGS
Group and Company
Convertible loans
On 22 December 2014 the Company issued £200,000 convertible loan notes, repayable on 18 December 2016 if not converted 
into shares prior to that date, and bearing interest at 8% p.a, payable quarterly in arrears. In December 2016 the terms of the loan 
were amended so that the loan notes are repayable on demand.
The net proceeds from the issue of the loan notes have been split between the liability element and an equity component, 
representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Company as follows:
The Directors estimate the fair value of the liability component of the loan notes at 30 April 2017 to be approximately £200,000 
(2016: £193,363). This fair value has been calculated by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate of 8%.

Options
On 8 March 2013, options over, in aggregate, 14,310,000 ordinary shares of 0.1 pence were granted to the Directors of the 
Company. Each option carries the right to subscribe to one new Ordinary Share in the capital of the Company at a price of 0.675p 
per Ordinary Share, being the closing mid-market price of the Company’s ordinary shares on 8 March 2013. These options 
vest over a period of three years from the date of the Grant, with a third of the options vesting on the first, second and third 
anniversaries of the Grant respectively. These options are exercisable for a period of ten years from the date of the Grant subject 
to the vesting conditions. 
The fair value of the options was calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the Group recognised total expenses of £nil

25. RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group’s finance function monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group. These risks 
include credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks, in accordance with the Group’s policies approved by the Board of 
Directors, which provide written principles on interest rate risk, credit risk and the investment of excess liquidity. The Group  
does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for any purpose.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it continues to provide returns and benefits 
for shareholders;
• to support the Group’s growth; and
• to provide capital for the purpose of strengthening the Group’s risk management capability.
The Group actively and regularly reviews and manages its capital structure to ensure an optimal capital structure and 
equity holder returns, taking into consideration the future capital requirements of the Group and capital efficiency, 
prevailing and projected profitability, projected operating cash flows, projected capital expenditures and projected strategic 
investment opportunities. The capital structure consists of capital and reserves and convertible loan notes, for capital 
management purposes.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the interest payable on the convertible unsecured loan notes, which are 
at fixed rates of interest.

25. RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and other receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international 
credit rating agencies.
Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group manages liquidity risk by 
maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the 
maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
