The Property Franchise Group PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
We provide responsive local lettings 
and sales services nationally through 
recognised property brands
What we do
Lettings and property management
We are one of the largest managing agents  
in the UK of residential properties with a deep 
understanding of lettings and a clear view of 
how to develop value in the long term from  
a portfolio. Our franchisees are fully insured 
members of professional bodies, supported 
by specialist software, who know their  
local rental market and manage all  
properties locally.
Estate Agency
We operate on a no sale no fee basis. We 
cater both for the majority of sellers who 
prefer to instruct an agent operating from 
high street premises and for the growing 
segment of sellers who choose to use an 
agent without a high street office. Two of our 
brands have been engaged in estate agency 
for more than 150 years.
How we do it
We rely on the motive power of local people 
who are committed to operating franchises 
under our brands to the highest levels of 
professionalism and service. Our brands are 
household names in their local communities, 
regions and nationally. Whilst the majority  
of franchisees operate through high street 
offices and have been with us for many years,  
a growing number of new franchisees choose 
to offer a 24/7 online service though 
EweMove.
Our success
We are a multi-award winning group with 
recent successes including gold for EweMove 
for best franchise estate agency at the  
Sunday Times awards in 2016 and silver for 
best franchise at the 2017 Negotiator awards. 
Just as importantly we have grown the 
revenue of our network of franchises through 
joint effort and support year on year  
since 2005.
Where we focus 
The Group has a strong 
presence in lettings and 
currently manages 52,000 
properties on behalf of 
landlords which amounts 
to a town the size of 
Gateshead. It also has a 
growing presence in 
estate agency.

National brands
Regional brands
Whitegates has been trading  
in the Midlands and North  
of England since 1978 and 
celebrates its 40 year 
anniversary this year. Its network 
has grown again this year with 
the addition of 6 further offices 
(12 in the last 2 years).
Ellis & Co has 19 high street 
offices, 18 within London. It 
shares complimentary 
branding with Martin & Co 
offices in London and the two 
brands, with a combined 
strength of 42 offices, work 
together to serve London.
Established in 1948 and 
celebrating 70 years of 
delivering exceptional service, 
Parkers has 13 high street 
offices located along the M4 
corridor west of Maidenhead 
with a strong presence around 
Reading.
CJ Hole was established in 
1867. An award winning brand 
with strong local brand 
heritage operated through  
19 high street offices in Avon, 
Somerset and Gloucestershire.
Martin & Co was established in 1986 and has 186 high street 
offices serving England, Wales and Scotland with offices from 
Falmouth to Aberdeen. It is one of the major residential letting 
agents in the UK with over 37,000 properties under management, 
deriving 87% of its management service fees from lettings 
services. A multi-award winning agency, it specialises in residential 
lettings, property management, property investment and sales.

Serving London 
since 1850
Launched in late 2013, EweMove has rapidly grown to a network  
of 120 franchises at the year end. The EweMove franchise model 
combines the recruitment of local property experts (“LPEs”), 
typically serving micro territories of 20,000 households through a 
centralised 24/7 technology platform, with the traditional features 
of a full estate agency service and a consumer fee predicated  
on completed sales, rather than listings. It has been the UK’s  
“No 1 Most Trusted Agent” on Trustpilot since 2016.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strong progress despite  
market headwinds
All of our brands increased revenues year-on-year.  
This growth was supported by the “assisted acquisitions” 
programme , which assisted our lettings agents both 
operationally and financially to purchase independent 
competitors’ lettings businesses. In the first full year of 
the programme we added 2,012 tenanted managed 
properties. I’m delighted to report that this was matched 
by an almost identical increase in our managed portfolio 
through organic growth. 
Tenant fee ban
The Government has provided a degree of clarity on its 
intention to ban tenant fees in England & Wales. A ban  
in Scotland has been in existence since 2012.
The intention appears to be an outright ban, rather than 
a cap, on landlords and their letting agents charging any 
type of pre-tenancy fee. It’s not clear whether certain 
in-tenancy fees will be allowed.
The timing of the implementation of the ban appears  
to be Q1 2019 which means that the Group’s trading for 
2018 would be unaffected by the ban. The Group is 
already taking action to mitigate the effects of the ban 
which is expected to put at risk 16% of our franchisees’ 
lettings revenue, and at a Group level 9% of total 
revenue, if annualised*. Mitigation factors include; 
through organic means and by acquisition, accelerating 
the size of the tenanted managed portfolio, developing 
income from financial services & conveyancing referrals. 
The Group will continue to closely monitor any 
developments associated with the Tenant Fee Ban  
and the associated potential impact.
Brand website redevelopment
One of our objectives when we purchased EweMove was 
to translate some of its digital marketing capabilities into 
better performance for our traditional brands. During 
2017 we re-developed each of our five traditional brand 
websites, starting with Whitegates. Although the 
technology platform is common, the look and feel of 
each site is different, to reflect the heritage and values of 
the particular brand. There is divergence on functionality, 
with Whitegates embracing all of the tried & tested 
EweMove concepts such as web pages optimised for 
lead conversion, Google “pay-per-click”, “live chat”, 
downloadable property valuations and functionality  
to book a valuation appointment. Overall, the website 
project generated nearly 17,000 new business leads  
at an average cost to our franchisees of £24 per lead.  
The Board believes that the new websites delivered  
a competitive advantage in H2 2017.
Name change
On 16 March 2017 the Company changed its name from 
MartinCo PLC to The Property Franchise Group PLC.  
It was time to recognise the transformation from a single 
franchisor to a multi-franchisor of residential agents.
Outlook
The Group’s intention is to be well-positioned for all 
eventualities and developments in the estate agency  
and letting agency space. Despite the market challenges, 
the Group delivered another strong set of results in this, 
its fourth full year on AIM.
My thanks go to the executives, their teams and my 
fellow Board members for their outstanding efforts over 
the last year.
I am delighted to announce that the Board has 
recommended an increased final dividend of 5.4p  
per ordinary share for 2017.

Chairman 
The Property Franchise Group PLC
* Both percentages quoted based on 2017 trading.
The consensus view of the residential property 
market was that 2017 was a disappointing year 
compared to 2016. However, 2017 was a strong  
year of growth for The Property Franchise Group, 
demonstrating the resilience of its business model 
in a challenging market.

Benefits of a genuine multi-brand 
strategy in a changing industry 
landscape
After our acquisition of Xperience Franchising and 
Whitegates in 2014, we focused on consolidation, driving 
out duplicate costs and leveraging economies of scale. 
By 2016 we had reaped the fruits of that approach; the 
combined businesses delivered £1.0m of after tax 
earnings against a net cash consideration of £5.1m.
However, EweMove is a very different proposition. It is  
a fully-functioning franchisor with its own proprietary 
technology “EweReka” sitting on an industrial scale 
platform. Its HQ staff are based in Cleckheaton,  
Bradford and culturally, it is very different from our 
traditional high street brands. Consequently, our 
intention was always to keep EweMove separate from  
our existing brands and benefit from some of its digital 
marketing expertise, without needing to fold it into  
our traditional support infrastructure.
The key to success with EweMove is to drive the numbers 
of “local representatives”, to continue to recruit 
franchisees at current levels, to encourage more 
experienced estate agents to join the brand and to 
reduce its franchisee attrition rate.
 
EweMove incurred losses in H1 trading. However with the 
departure of the founders at the end of June 2017, and 
the arrival of the new Managing Director, the business 
returned to profit in H2 trading, and, pleasingly, the 
number of franchises rose to 120 by year end. 
The online or hybrid space is very topical in the property 
industry. It has been estimated that circa £250m has 
been raised by our competitors since they launched,  
with a number of the top players becoming increasingly 
high profile.
Unlike those companies where the customer proposition 
is focused on saving commission, EweMove’s promise is 
above all to get the customer’s property sold. However, 
EweMove does share several characteristics with the 
best-known brands; it is nationally recognised, does  
not rely on high street offices, and operates 24/7 for 
customer convenience. 
A genuine multi-brand strategy is more than just a 
collection of brands. EweMove shows the clarity of our 
thinking as it gives us an exciting play in the online, 
hybrid space and hedges against deterioration in trading 
conditions for our traditional high street model. We have 
crystallised the price we paid for EweMove, which is 
relatively modest compared to the sums invested in 
competing businesses, and have management in place 
to see us through the next growth phase.
As well as progressing with EweMove we achieved 
satisfying network revenue growth at all of our traditional 
brands, Whitegates leading with 14%, CJ Hole 9%, 
Parkers 6%, Martin & Co 5% and Ellis & Co 3%. 
In 2017 we concentrated on further development  
of the six property brands which we already own, 
continuing to build upon our genuine multi-brand 
strategy which sees us invested in competing 
businesses. An important part of this was to recruit 
a new brand leadership team to see us through the 
next growth phase, which we achieved this year.

Growing and developing our  
hybrid network
EweMove provides estate agency and lettings 
services 24/7 through an integrated platform  
and a franchised network of local property experts. 
Change
2017 saw the active recruitment of experienced estate agents for 
the first time (15 recruited). At the mid-year Nick Neill took the helm 
as MD following the founders’ departure. Nick was one of the first 
franchisees and was running one of the most successful franchises. 
Not all franchisees accepted the changes but the flow of new 
franchisees attracted by the technology and ethos continued.
Progress
We have focused on the core activities, refining what worked and 
creating operational efficiencies. Losses in H1 were significantly 
offset by profits in H2; net loss £0.1m. Renewed vigour saw  
the franchise network increase to 120 franchises by year end.  
The 2 key areas of focus moving ahead are accelerated growth in  
the national footprint of local property experts and enhancing 
franchise performance.
Number of franchises
120
+25% (2016: 96)
These figures are not quoted on a “like-for-like” basis.  
In all 178 traditional brand offices grew their revenue 
year-on-year and 105 offices had static or shrinking 
revenue. We had 3 franchisees managing 800+ 
properties, 21 franchisees managing 500+ and 59 
franchisees managing 300+. The overall pattern was of 
pleasing revenue growth, in a marketplace where many 
competitors were reportedly in reverse gear. However, 
we cannot be complacent. Whilst our best franchisees 
made good progress, other franchisees found trading 
conditions difficult. Management are alive to the 
possibility that there will be both opportunities for our 
franchisees to act as consolidators at their local level, 
buying up competitor’s letting portfolios, but there will 
also be consolidation opportunities within the Group, 
with strong and capable franchisees buying out their 
weaker neighbours.

Improved use of digital marketing and 
support for franchisee acquisitions 
delivers increased profits
In a flat housing market environment (fourth year at circa 
1.2m** transactions) and with challenges for the lettings 
market starting to crystalise we focused on winning more 
sales instructions (up 23%), growing our managed 
properties portfolio (up 8%) and putting EweMove  
on a sustainable profit path.

Revenue
Group revenue for the financial year to 31 December 
2017 was £10.2m (2016: £8.3m), an increase of £1.9m (23%) 
over the prior year. The first full year of EweMove 
contributed £1.5m (79%) of this increase.
Management Service Fees (“MSF”) increased 20% from 
£6.9m to £8.3m and represented 81% (2016: 83%) of 
Group revenue with the remainder being from franchise 
sales and ancillary services to support MSF generation.
Lettings contributed 70% of MSF (2016: 74%), sales 
contributed 29% of MSF (2016: 25%) and financial 
services contributed 1% of MSF (2016: 1%). Lettings MSF 
grew by 13% in the year and sales MSF grew by 47%.
Operating profit
Operating profit before exceptional items and share 
based payment charges (“Adjusted operating profit”) 
increased from £3.5m to £3.8m (8%) and the margin 
decreased from 42% to 37%. 
Administration expenses, including the first full year of 
EweMove, increased by £1.1m. EweMove’s administration 
expenses contributed all of this increase.
EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was £4.4m (2016: £3.9m)  
an increase of £0.5m (14%) over the prior year. The 
traditional brands contributed all of this increase mainly 
through growth in turnover of £0.4m.
Exceptional items
The net exceptional gain for 2017 was £0.7m (2016: 
exceptional cost £0.3m) and relates entirely to EweMove 
being the reduction in deferred consideration payable  
of £1.2m and an impairment charge of £0.5m against the 
master franchise agreement (2016: acquisition costs for 
EweMove and redundancy payments). For further details 
of the impairment please see note 16 to the financial 
statements.
Profit before tax
The profit before tax was £4.3m for 2017, an increase of 
£1.1m (33%) over the prior year of which the net 
exceptional gain contributed £0.7m.
Taxation
The effective rate of corporation tax for the year was 
19.25% (2016: 20%). The total tax charge for 2017 was 
£0.6m (2016: £0.2m). The increase of £0.4m is due to  
the growth in profits from ordinary activities which 
contributed £0.2m and the reduction in relief on share 
based payments of £0.2m. Management exercised 
options over 979,200 ordinary shares in FY16 generating 
a notional gain of £1.5m and tax relief of £0.3m whereas 
in 2017 they exercised options over 522,000 ordinary 
shares generating a notional gain of £0.7m and tax relief  
of £0.1m.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share for the year was 14.2p (2016: 13.0p),  
an increase of 9%. The profit attributable to owners 
increased to £3.7m (2016: £3.0m).
Focus on key areas for improvement has delivered 
growth in operating profit, EBITDA and PBT.

Key performance indicators
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 5.4p per 
share for 2017 which, together with the interim dividend 
of 2.1p per share paid to shareholders on 6 October 2017, 
equates to a total dividend for the financial year of 7.5p 
(2016: 6.5p) an increase of 15%. If approved, it will be paid 
on 21 May 2018 to all shareholders on the register on  
20 April 2018. Our shares will be marked ex-dividend  
on 19 April 2018.
Cash flow
The Group is strongly operationally cash generative.
The net cash inflow from operating activities in 2017 was 
£4.4m (2016: £2.4m) as the Group continues to generate 
strong operating cash inflows.
The net cash outflow from investing activities was £1.4m 
(2016: outflow £4.8m) due to £1.0m of consideration paid 
to the founders of EweMove in return for them forgoing 
any rights to deferred consideration, £0.2m invested in 
new websites and £0.2m paid to acquire rights to income 
from customer lists (2016: acquisition of EweMove).
Loan repayments totaling £0.9m (2016: £0.6m) plus 
interest payments of £0.1m (2016: £0.1m) were made on 
the Santander UK plc loans during 2017 leaving £2.5m 
(2016: £3.4m) outstanding. Dividend payments were 
£1.7m (2016: £1.4m).
Liquidity
The Group had cash balances of £2.6m at 31 December 
2017 (2016: £2.0m).
Financial position
The balance sheet remains strong with total assets of 
£20m (2016: £20m) and a reduction of £2.5m in liabilities 
during the year. This reduction in liabilities was due to 
repayments of bank debt totaling £0.9m, a £2.2m 
reduction in deferred consideration as a result of the 
settlement reached with the founders of EweMove, an 
increase in tax payable of £0.4m partly due to increased 
profitability but also due to lower tax deductions for 
options exercised and an increase in other payables of 
£0.2m of which deferred income accounted for £0.1m.
The Group finished the year with the total equity 
attributable to owners of £14.3m an increase of £2.1m or 
17% over FY16.  
The Group is strongly operationally cash generative 
which, together with the undrawn facility from Santander 
UK plc of £2.5m, puts it in a strong position to continue  
to fulfil its strategy as set out on page 12 and its future 
developments as detailed in the Directors’ report on 
page 26.

Our understanding of  
the macro-economic drivers
The powerful success story of the private rented sector, rising from 9% 
of total UK housing stock in the early 1990s to an estimated 20% today, 
is driven by private landlords.
* Savills Research (Autumn 17) * Standard Life * Mortgage Brain ** UK Finance (Nov 17)  
*** Savills Research (Autumn 17)
* Totally Money (Nov 17) **Savills research (Jan 18) * ONS Quarterly Report (Feb 2018) * HMRC UK Property Transactions (Feb 18)
Key macro-economic factors
Stored equity 
 
There is an estimated £2.5 trillion of 
equity stored in UK housing stock 
unencumbered by mortgages, with the 
over 65s owning £1.5 trillion* of it. The 
majority of rental properties are bought 
wholly from cash resources. Cash buyers 
now account for 34% of all house 
purchases and 45%* of all sums spent on 
house purchases. They and first time 
buyers are forecast to be the growth 
drivers of residential property purchases 
over the next 5 years.
Pension reform 
Pension reform has enabled the over 55s 
to access retirement funds which can be 
used to purchase outright or as a deposit 
on a buy-to-let property. Its forecast that 
this group will be responsible for 3 million 
property deals. Larger pension pots are 
being used to create regular incomes.  
Far fewer annuities are being purchased*.
Property deals
3.0m
Buy-to-let mortgage  
availability
An additional 721 products were 
introduced into the UK buy-to-let market 
during 2017, representing a 32% rise in 
overall product availability to 2,959*. Low 
interest rates and longer terms continue 
to stimulate demand with Q3 2017 
showing 2% growth over Q3 2016**.
Evidence suggests buy-to-let mortgage 
activity may have accounted for 6% of  
all market transactions in 2017***.

Independent research we commissioned 
showed the total returns from buy-to-let 
as an asset class ranged from 6.4% to 
13.2% per annum, depending on the 
region, over the 10 years to 2014. Such 
yields are still available, the top 25 
postcodes returning 7.3% to 12.63%*. 
Recent research show average returns  
of 6.1% in the UK**.

Net migration  
remains high
Net migration for the year to September 
2017 was 244,000* against a prior year of 
273,000. The level of net migration is 
similar to early 2014. In 4 years to 
September 2017 net migration has totaled 
1.1m. The foreign-born UK population has 
lower home ownership rates and is almost 
3 times as likely to be in the private  
rented sector.

Brexit
 
Whilst property remains a fundamentally 
safe asset class, the uncertainty about 
what Brexit means for individual 
households wealth is making UK buyers 
more cautious. Despite this, UK house 
sales of 1.2m* have been a consistent 
theme over the last 4 years. The market  
is proving more resilient than some 
commentators thought.

Key market opportunities
Growing private  
rented sector
The private rented sector has grown from 
a low of 9% to almost 20% of UK stock, 
overtaking the social housing sector, with 
5.4 million privately rented homes in 2014 
expected to reach 7.2 million by 2025*.  
In England alone 25% or 5.6 million of all 
households are forecast to be privately 
renting by 2021**.
Privately rented homes
5.4m
Increased regulation
The Government is trying to 
professionalise the property rental sector. 
One way has been increasing regulation 
on landlords. Deposits must be 
registered, new health and safety rules for 
rented homes, checks on a tenant’s “right 
to rent” in the UK, landlord licensing, and 
EPCs for rented properties. These 
changes favour agents.
Multiple brands
Five of our brands have an established 
track record. We believe each of these is 
capable of further expansion – witness 
the growth in Whitegates to 46 offices 
from 34 in 2015. The sixth, EweMove,  
has grown rapidly in 4 years to 120 
franchises at the year end. Its micro 
territory model, technology and appeal 
to new franchisees means it may well have 
the highest number of franchisees of any 
of our brands within a few years.

There are now 5 listed property

Clear strategy
to deliver growth
The Property Franchise Group PLC intends 
to develop both the depth and breadth of  
its network and, by importing digital and 
marketing techniques, grow the local market 
share of its franchisees.
Strategy
Buy & Build
The Group continues to investigate possible acquisitions 
either of property franchisors or complementary businesses 
whilst at the same time assisting franchisees with acquisitions 
and on boarding independent property businesses into  
the Group.
Operational Efficiency
We have been developing relationships with key suppliers in 
our sector being one of the major purchasers. At the same 
time we have been transferring our brands onto common 
operating platforms, making operational investments, 
eliminating duplicate resources and developing our digital 
marketing capabilities.
Income Diversification
We aim to increase our earnings from property sales and 
financial services by leveraging the estate agency credentials 
acquired with Xperience together with the know-how 
acquired through the acquisition of EweMove. However, the 
Group’s core focus will continue to be its lettings business.
Franchisee Recruitment/
Expansion
The recruitment of franchisees for new territories and for 
resales of existing territories is central to maintaining the 
health and vitality of the network as well as achieving our 
network aims. At the same time we are assisting franchisees 
to expand through acquisitions in existing territories and  
to grow into new territories.

Adding value
Shareholders
We are committed to retaining our resilience to the sales cycle 
volatility through maintaining and developing our significant 
interests in lettings whilst at the same time diversifying further so as 
to continue our record of growing earnings (up from 3.5p per share 
in 2013 to 14.2p per share in 2017) and a progressive dividend.
Franchisees
We partner our franchisees to develop long-term value in their 
businesses. This involves us in training/coaching/mentoring our 
franchisees to diversify their income streams, embrace digital 
marketing, be available when customers want them, acquire 
portfolios of managed lets, adopt the highest professional 
standards and leverage the reputations and goodwill of our  
brand stable.
Landlords
We are one of the largest managing agents in the UK of residential 
properties with a deep understanding of lettings and a clear 
view of how to develop value in the long term from a portfolio. 
Our franchisees are members of professional bodies. They have 
all received training from us and have access to continuing 
professional development. Franchisees live locally to their 
businesses and manage all properties locally. They are supported 
by specialist operational software to responsibly deliver a 
professional lettings service.
Tenants
Our reputation in lettings, our local service and our extensive 
landlord relationships means we have a greater chance of having 
the property a tenant is looking for. Our franchisees work to 
professional standards, carry out our required procedures refined 
from many years of experience, hold the necessary insurances to 
protect our tenants and are members of a redress scheme,  
The Property Ombudsman.
Vendors
Some of our brands are household names in their local 
communities and regions, known for providing professional sales 
services, run by local people who are engaged in the community 
and know their territories. Indeed, one of our brands has been 
selling houses for 168 years, evolving as the market and practices 
have evolved.

How we help franchise owners 
develop and the brands  
they represent grow 
If our franchises grow we grow. Their owners are busy delivering service. 
Our role is to provide the infrastructure, opportunities, support and 
stimulus for growth.
  EweMove
EweMove operates a hybrid agency franchise system.  
A franchise owner has all the benefits of 24/7 technology 
and customer support at his fingertips without the need 
for high street premises.
As in Martin & Co, the majority of franchise owners have 
no prior experience of our sector. Having spent 30 years 
growing Martin & Co we know that development support 
is essential in the early years of a franchise’s life. We 
immediately transferred in 2 experienced development 
managers, followed by a trainer and now run intensive 
“boot” camps.
With aspirations to be a national sales brand, we need 
national representation and listings. We have seen what 
good sales agency looks like through the acquisition of 
Xperience. So we decided to change the recruitment 
drive to actively recruit estate agents. In 2017, from a 
standing start, half our recruits were experienced estate 
agents. As expected, they quickly won instructions and 
thereby spread experience/awareness of the brand.
A fear existed that the brand would no longer be so 
highly rated for customer service through this change 
but, to date, EweMove remains the No 1 most trusted 
estate agent on Trustpilot.
One change more than any has altered the landscape. 
In having to appoint a new MD, a process in which many 
suitable candidates presented themselves from our 
sector, our franchisees have one of their most successful 
franchisees in charge, Nick Neill. 
  Traditional Brands 
Our brands have long established histories that we 
and our franchise owners are rightly proud of. Many 
independent agents have come and gone through the 
economic cycles but these brands have survived and 
prospered.
They operate in a sector which has been slow to recognise 
the impacts of changing customer requirements and to 
take advantage of new technology and digital marketing.
EweMove showed us that you can generate leads 
through pay per click (“PPC”) relatively cheaply and, of 
course, we had access to their partner. To progress PPC it 
meant recruiting a marketing director with the necessary 
skills and experience which we achieved at the half-year.  
It meant developing new websites which we completed 
in 2017. It meant persuading national marketing 
committees to back PPC which they did. 
The brands’ websites went live between May and 
December 2017. In this time period they delivered a 294% 
increase in website conversion rates, a 730% increase in the 
PPC conversion rate, 16,622 PPC enquiries were generated 
and there was an 88% reduction in the cost per lead.
  Acquisitions
For the last few years we have been explaining the 
tangible benefits of acquiring portfolios of managed 
properties and independent agents’ businesses to our 
franchisees with the help of those franchisees who have 
followed that path.
Market pressures imply that there may be more 
independent operators of lettings and sales businesses 
looking to exit our sector. So we decided to increase 
our efforts in this area at the start of 2017 including 
incentivising franchisees with cash back and financial 
support for office rebranding.
Assisting franchisees with acquisitions brings together 
many functions in the franchisor to help with valuing  
the business, the legal process, due diligence, funding 
and integration but it also requires support from our 
partners. As we were looking to increase our activity,  
we supplemented our internal resources and we retained 
the services of one of the most experienced acquisition 
managers in our sector. In 2017 we achieved a 253% 
increase in the number of managed properties  
acquired by our franchisees. They acquired 2,012 
managed properties.
With a franchise you 
get the benefit of an 
established brand and 
ongoing training.”

Acquisition success for our  
franchises in Plymouth and Leicester
When an opportunity 
arose to purchase 
one of the city’s most 
established agents, we 
absolutely jumped at it!”
Chris and Merolyn Whitaker
Franchise Owner 
Plymouth
Husband and wife team, Chris and 
Merolyn Whitaker, joined The Property 
Franchise Group in 2015 following 16 years 
serving in the Army’s Intelligence Corps. 
Just 2 years later, the couple completed on 
one of the network’s largest ever single 
office acquisitions.
How did the journey start?
Having made the decision to take the 
plunge and purchase a property business, 
we took the first steps and agreed on 
location. We had existing roots in the 
South West and, with Plymouth the largest 
city in the UK without a Martin & Co 
presence at the time, we were naturally 
eager to secure the territory and we did.
How The Property Franchise Group helped
Our role was to capitalise on the enthusiasm 
and drive by supporting the launch of their 
franchise as efficiently and effectively as we 
could. We have a tried and tested launch 
plan. At the core of everything is the need 
to win those first instructions and then keep 
the momentum going which we did with 
regular contact and visits.
It did not stop there, in 2017, having set 
their sights on expansion; an opportunity 
arose to buy a successful competitor in 
Plymouth. They could grow their presence, 
their team and their skill base so as to be 
able to offer a comprehensive lettings and 
sales service of scale. The timing was right 
as the Group had resourced up to facilitate 
such ambition.
Our acquisitions consultant liaised with the 
broker and negotiated on the sale price. 
Then we helped define and refine a deal 
structure that worked for all parties. 
Further assistance was supplied in the 
form of due diligence work, legal support 
with a complicated structure and, finally, 
the handover by the seller. 
Result
Two years later Chris and Merolyn had 
moved their franchise up to 8th by income 
in the Martin & Co network. Income had 
quadrupled, the number of managed 
properties had increased 650% and their 
sales business was showing signs of good 
growth.
“We would never have got to where we 
are now if it wasn’t for those around us 
supporting our every step, and guiding 
us in the right direction. The support of 
other Martin & Co franchisees across the 
whole network has been – and remains 
– invaluable. Everyone is in exactly the 
same boat and we have benefited hugely 
from the continual sharing of ideas and 
experiences along our entire journey to 
date. The encouragement,
acknowledgement, and inspiration 
we receive from our peers has been 
instrumental to our success.”

Acquiring Taylors, 
an agency with such 
heritage in my local 
area, was a perfect fit 
for my existing business 
and it was a significant 
investment.”
Mitul Gadhia
Franchise Owner  
Leicester
Mitul Gadhia demonstrated his 
entrepreneurial spirit at an early age,  
when upon moving to Leicestershire in  
his late teens, he soon started to invest in 
property – and had very quickly developed 
his own portfolio, with properties across 
the length and breadth of the UK.
How did the journey start?
So, Mitul’s journey as a business owner 
began when he opened the doors to his 
Martin & Co office in Loughborough in 
2012 – becoming one of The Property 
Franchise Group’s youngest ever 
franchisees. In August 2017, still in his 
mid-20s, Mitul purchased one of 
Leicestershire’s most well-established 
estate and lettings agencies consisting  
of 5 offices across Leicester and 
Loughborough with a plan to trade under 
the Whitegates’ brand.
How The Property Franchise Group helped
Mitul was supported throughout by us.  
A core aspect was our assistance with his 
business plan for the enlarged group of 
offices under his ownership which included 
analysis of how the local markets traded 
and how to optimise coverage to retain 
and win business by our Head of Business 
Intelligence. Post-acquisition we assisted 
with helping to define roles and 
responsibilities for staff, commission 
schemes, the setting of targets and  
the systems.
Result
This move saw Mitul become the Group’s 
largest franchisee in terms of office 
numbers, with a total of 8 to his name.
“Not only did the purchase see me acquire 
a portfolio of 480 managed properties, 
but it saw my team grow by an additional 
35 members of staff – all of whom were 
brought into the existing operation under 
the Whitegates brand.”
And if this phenomenal success wasn’t 
enough, Mitul is also proud to have a 
number of industry accolades to his name 
– including the title of “Young Achiever”  
in the Business & Enterprise category of 
the Leicester Mercury Awards and silver 
winner of “Rising Star of the Year” award  
at the 2015 Negotiator awards.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Effective management with regular 
reviews, evaluations and prioritising  
of risks
The Board considers that the risks detailed below represent the key risks to achieving the Group’s strategy 
and objectives. There could be additional risks and uncertainties which are not known to the Board and 
there are risks and uncertainties which are currently deemed to be less material, which may adversely 
impact on the achievement of the Group’s strategy and objectives.
Risk area Potential impact
No guarantee of growth
There is no certainty that the Group will be successful in executing  
its strategy for growth.
Our network of existing franchisees needs to grow its revenue on 
average at 7% or more to achieve our growth plan.
EweMove may not achieve sufficient franchisee recruitment or fail  
to win sufficient instructions.
Reduced growth in Management Service Fees.
Reduced market share and representation.
Poor or no profit growth from the franchise model.
Market conditions
The residential property market is influenced by economic and 
political factors on a regular basis. The outcomes of both Brexit  
and Government policy/intervention in the housing market are 
uncertain. This can cause short-term changes in the behaviour of  
our clients and long-term changes in the way our sector develops.
The sales market is forecast to decline slightly in 2018. A series of 
government measures may hamper growth in the lettings sector.
As a result franchisees income may reduce or grow more slowly with 
a knock-on effect on the Group’s income from Management Service 
Fees.
Competition for property portfolios
The Group plans to expand by finding and buying portfolios in 
partnership with franchisees. We are not the only franchisor in our 
sector pursuing this strategy and we also face competition from 
well-known estate agents.
We may not be able to secure acquisitions at the values that meet 
our criteria. We may not be able to secure the external resource to 
assist us, leaving senior management spending more time than 
intended on finding and completing acquisitions.
We pay more for acquisitions than we would have ideally intended 
to.
Our payback period increases.
Reduced operating profit from acquired portfolios.
Ability to find, recruit, retain and scale up skilled franchisees
An inability of the Group to attract new franchisees with the 
necessary skills, expertise and resources to purchase resales of 
existing territories and “cold start” in new territories.
Existing franchisees decide to scale back.
Slower growth through inability to increase market representation 
or a decline in market representation.
Not achieving the uplift in revenue seen in the first year of a resale.
Lower franchise resale fees.
Reputational risk to our brand
A strong brand is key to being successful in the sector as it is for  
many other sectors and central to that is the reputation of the 
Group and its franchisees. As you grow there is an increased  
chance of the actions of one franchisee causing greater damage  
to the Group.
Failure by the franchisees to meet the expectations of landlords, 
and tenants or to fall short of the standards set by the Group may 
have a material impact on reputation.
Loss of landlords and inability to recruit new franchisees.
Mitigation Actual performance
EweMove acquisition achieved providing additional revenue and providing revenue generating opportunities for 
our traditional brands.
Seven Business Development Managers to support and develop franchisee’s growth.
Experienced and long-serving management team with a track record of growth now supplemented  
by 2 managing directors for our brands (soon to be 3) and a marketing director.
Comprehensive training made available to franchisees and regular regional business meetings/briefings.
Group revenue has 
increased from £4.1m 
in 2013 to £10.2m in 
2017. For 2017, Group 
revenue increased  
by 23%.
Monthly management data collected from franchisees assists us in predicting future trends and developing 
mitigating actions.
The Board cut costs midway through 2017 to try to align performance more closely with market expectations and 
to prepare for the increase costs of the enhanced management team.
The Board is looking at more resource efficient/effective ways to interact with customers, generate leads and 
support franchisees.
Market data obtained from third parties assists us in predicting future trends and developing mitigating actions.
Group MSF has 
increased from 
£3.5m in 2013 to 
£8.3m in 2017. It 
increased by 21%  
in 2017.
A process exists internally for finding and completing on acquisitions supported by very experienced external 
resource which was enhanced in 2017. The incentives provided to franchisees for expanding have been increased 
in 2017.
There is estimated to be 25,000 agents in the UK all with potential portfolios to buy, so there should be  
sufficient supply.
The impending tenant fee ban is forecast to increase the number of acquisition opportunities as independent 
agents decide the time is right to sell.
Prices have softened a little as a few competitors scaled back. 
Supportive UK banks.
The acquisition  
in 2017 of 2,012 
managed properties 
by franchisees, an 
increase of 253% 
over FY16.
Experienced franchise recruitment department. EweMove has been one of the only and certainly the fastest 
growing “cold start” franchisee recruiters in our sector for the last 4 years. 
Strong demand for resales.
A strong offering and one of the lowest rates of Management Service Fees amongst our competitors with 
increased incentives in place in 2017 for experienced franchisees to grow their representation in existing and new 
territories.
Supportive UK banks.
Franchisee 
recruitment 
increased 131%  
in 2017.
Whitegates 
increased from 40  
to 46 offices in 2017.
The Group strives to make sure that its franchisees achieve the service levels set down for them and remain 
compliant with the law by regular auditing and training.
The recruitment of 7 Business Development Managers to monitor and enforce brand compliance.
All franchisees are required to be members of trade bodies and the Property Ombudsman Service.
PR agencies are retained to monitor, assist with and advise on strategies to minimise these risks.
The Brands are being positioned to make it clear where their expertise lies, what each brand stands for and the 
experience a customer can expect. EweMove has net promoter scores to identify high achievers and under 
performers who need assistance.
88 audits of 
franchisees’ offices 
completed in 2017

Going concern
The Group and Company’s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group has produced detailed budgets, 
projections and cash flow forecasts. The Directors have concluded after reviewing these budgets, projections and forecasts and making 
appropriate enquiries of the business that the Group and Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence, and 
execute its plan for acquisition growth, for the foreseeable future.
In October 2014, the Group agreed a £5m loan facility with Santander UK plc of which £2.5m remains unutilised and available to the Group at 
31 December 2017 for development and expansion of operations.
For these reasons, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Auditor
In accordance with section 489 of the Companies Act 2006; a resolution to appoint BDO LLP will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
to replace the retiring Auditors RSM UK Audit LLP .
The Directors confirm that:
 ¡ so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group and Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 ¡ the Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year. The Directors are required 
by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and have elected under company law to prepare the Company financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the Group and the 
Company and the financial performance of the Group. The Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial statements that 
references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair 
presentation.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing the Group and Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 ¡ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 ¡ make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 ¡ state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the EU; and
 ¡ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the Company and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.

Remuneration Committee
The remuneration of each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee. It is chaired by Paul Latham and its other 
member is Phil Crooks.
Policy on remuneration of Directors
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for determining, within agreed terms of reference, the Group’s policy on the remuneration 
of senior executives and specific remuneration packages for Executive Directors including pension payments and compensation rights. It is 
also responsible for making recommendations for grants of options under the Share Option Plan.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the Board. It consists of fees for their services in connection with Board and 
Committee meetings. No Director may be involved in any discussions as to their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Policy is designed to shape the Company’s remuneration strategy for an anticipated 3 years, ensuring that the structure 
and levels of executive remuneration continue to remain appropriate for the Company. The policy aims to:-
 ¡ Pay competitive salaries to aid recruitment, retention and motivation being reflective of the executive’s experience and importance to the 
Group.
 ¡ Pay annual bonuses to incentivise the delivery of stretching short-term business targets whilst maintaining an element of variability 
allowing flexible control of the cost base and being able to respond to market conditions.
 ¡ Provide long-term share incentive plans designed to incentivise long-term value creation, reward execution of strategy, align directors’ 
interests with the long-term interests of investors and promote retention.
The main remuneration components are:
Basic salary or fees
Basic salary or fees for each Director are determined taking into account the performance of the individual and information from 
independent sources on the rates of salary and fees for similar posts. The salaries and fees paid to Directors by the Group were £390k  
(2016: £340k).
Annual bonus
The Company has a formal bonus scheme which was effective for the Executive Directors from 18 December 2013. Bonuses were paid to  
the Directors by the Group of £263k (2016: £221k).
Pension
Contributions made to Directors’ pensions in the year were £385 (2016: £370).
Share options
On 9 June 2017 options over 1,000,000 and 500,000 new ordinary shares of the Company were granted to Ian Wilson and David Raggett, 
respectively, under a new Property Franchise Group 2017 share scheme. The options have an exercise price of 1 pence per share. The awards 
are conditional on the achievement of an adjusted earnings per share target as measured at 31 December 2019 (adjusted earnings per share 
being basic earnings per share excluding exceptional income/costs and share-based payments). Adjusted EPS growth of 15% between 
inception and 31 December 2019 will be required for threshold vesting of the awards, with adjusted EPS growth of 44% or higher required for 
all the awards to vest. There is a straight line sliding scale between these two points. No share options were granted to the Directors in the 
previous year.
Company policy on contracts of service
The Executive Directors of the Company do not have a notice period in excess of 12 months under the terms of their service contracts.  
Their service contracts contain no provisions for pre-determined compensation on termination, which exceeds 12 months’ salary and 
benefits in kind. Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company, but have letters of appointment which can be 
terminated on 3 months’ notice.
Termination date
Richard Martin 3 months’ notice
Ian Wilson 12 months’ notice
David Raggett 12 months’ notice
Paul Latham 3 months’ notice
Phil Crooks 3 months’ notice
Company policy on external appointments
The Company recognises that its Directors are likely to be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that exposure 
to such non-executive duties can broaden their experience and knowledge, which will benefit the Group. Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors are therefore, subject to approval of the Company’s Board, allowed to accept non-executive appointments, as long as these are 
not with competing companies and are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest. Executive and Non-Executive Directors are allowed to retain 
the fees paid.

Compliance
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance and intend to comply with the 
Corporate Governance Guidelines, to the extent appropriate for a Company of its nature and size.
The Corporate Governance Guidelines were devised by the Quoted Companies Alliance (“QCA”), in consultation with a number of 
significant institutional small company investors, as an alternative corporate governance code applicable to AIM companies. An alternative 
code was proposed because the QCA considers the UK Corporate Governance Code to be inappropriate for many AIM companies.
The Corporate Governance Guidelines state that, “The purpose of good corporate governance is to ensure that the Company is managed in 
an efficient, effective and entrepreneurial manner for the benefit of all shareholders over the longer term”.
The Board of Directors meets at least 9 times a year to review the Group’s strategy and oversee the Group’s progress towards its goals.  
The Board has established an Audit and Risk Committee and a Remuneration committee.
The Board
The Board comprises the non-independent Non-Executive Chairman, 2 independent Non-Executive Directors and 2 Executive Directors 
who are the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
The Board is responsible for the overall performance of the Group, which includes the broad strategic direction, development and control of 
the Group. The policies and strategies of the Group are formulated by the Board and the detailed considerations about the day-to-day 
operations are delegated to an executive team under the leadership of the Executive Directors.
The Board regularly monitors the implementation of strategy and policy decisions to ensure that the operation of the Group is at all times in 
line with the Group’s objectives.
The Board has regular contact with its advisers to keep up to date with corporate governance matters. The Company Secretary ensures that 
Board procedures are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with. The Group purchases appropriate insurance 
cover in respect of legal action against its Directors.
The Chairman’s main function is to manage the Board so that the Group is run in the best interests of its stakeholders. It is also the 
Chairman’s responsibility to ensure the Board’s integrity and effectiveness.
The Chief Executive is responsible for the running of the Group’s businesses. There is a schedule of matters specifically reserved for the 
Board’s decision to ensure that the management and direction of the Company are under its control. Each Executive Director has his own 
sphere of responsibility. Decisions relating to strategy, major contracts, acquisitions, internal controls for example are taken at Board level.
Non-Executive Directors/Board independence
The Company has two independent Non-Executive Directors, Paul Latham and Phil Crooks, who provide an important contribution to its 
strategic development. Paul Latham and Phil Crooks both meet the independence criteria which are set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code.
Board Committees
The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to the Audit & Risk and Remuneration Committees. The Board considers that all the 
members of each committee have the appropriate experience. All Board Committees have their own terms of reference which are available 
on request.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Paul Latham and its other member is Phil Crooks. It met three times in 2017 and will continue to 
meet at least twice a year. It is responsible for advising on the remuneration policy for Directors only.
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for determining, within agreed terms of reference, the Group’s policy on the remuneration 
of senior executives and specific remuneration packages for Executive Directors including pension payments and compensation rights. It is 
also responsible for making recommendations for grants of options under the Share Option Plans.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the Board. No Director may be involved in any discussions as to their  
own remuneration.
Details of the level and composition of the Directors’ remuneration are disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 28 to 29.
Audit and Risk Committee
Phil Crooks is the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee. Paul Latham is its other member. It met 3 times in 2017 and will continue to meet at 
least twice a year.
The Audit and Risk Committee has the primary responsibility for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly measured, 
reported on and monitored. In the financial year ended 31 December 2017 it discharged its responsibilities by reviewing:
Corporate Governance statement 31
The Property Franchise Group PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Financial statements Governance
 ¡ the Group’s draft financial statements and interim results statement prior to Board approval and reviewing the external auditor’s detailed 
reports thereon;
 ¡ the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting policies;
 ¡ the potential impact on the Group’s financial statements of certain events and risks;
 ¡ the external auditor’s plan for the audit of the Group’s accounts, which included key areas of audit focus, key risks, the proposed audit fee 
and approving the terms of engagement for the audit;
 ¡ internal assurance reporting;
 ¡ non-audit services;
 ¡ the dividend policy;
 ¡ the processes for identifying the risks to the business and managing those risks; and
 ¡ its terms of reference.
The Audit and Risk Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external 
auditor. In making the recommendation on the annual re-appointment of the external auditor, it monitors the relationship to assess 
independence, objectivity and cost effectiveness of the external auditor. It is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate relationship 
between the Group and the external auditors is maintained, including reviewing non-audit services and fees. The Audit and Risk Committee 
put the audit out to tender in 2017 given the forthcoming rotation of the partner and a resolution to appoint BDO LLP will be proposed at  
the Annual General Meeting to replace the retiring Auditors RSM UK Audit LLP .
The Board will include a resolution at the next AGM authorising the Board to determine the audit fee.
The directors meet regularly with the external auditor for the purpose of discussing matters relating to the financial reporting and internal 
controls of the Group. Furthermore, the Audit and Risk Committee’s Chairman meets the external auditors to discuss matters relating to the 
Committee’s remit and any issues arising from the audit.

Internal control
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has established clear operating procedures and responsibility structures. These procedures include:
 ¡ monthly financial reporting against budget and the prior year;
 ¡ day-to-day financial control of operations;
 ¡ annual budgeting and quarterly forecasting;
 ¡ the monitoring and assessment of risk;
 ¡ performance monitoring and the taking of remedial action; and
 ¡ planning, reviewing, approving and monitoring major projects.
Relations with shareholders
The Board is committed to maintaining good communications with shareholders and the website propertyfranchise.co.uk provides  
up-to-date information on the Group.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of 
The Property Franchise Group PLC
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of The Property Franchise Group PLC (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for 
the year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise of the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, Consolidated statement of 
financial position, Company statement of financial position, Consolidated statement of changes in equity, Company statement of changes in 
equity, Consolidated statement of cash flows, Company statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements, including a summary 
of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards to the parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2016.
In our opinion:
 ¡ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and 
of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
 ¡ the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 ¡ the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 ¡ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We 
are independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, 
including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to SME listed entities and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
 ¡ the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
 ¡ the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the 
group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months 
from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements  
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, 
including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts  
of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Risk
The Group has completed a number of acquisitions, the most significant of which was in relation to Ewemove Sales and Lettings LTD  
in September 2016. The recoverability of the goodwill and other intangibles arising on these acquisitions is dependent on the future 
performance of the cash generating units to which the goodwill and other intangibles are allocated. Due to the significant management 
judgement in forecasting the cash flows and selecting an appropriate discount rate there is a high level of estimation uncertainty which 
results in there being a significant risk associated with determining whether goodwill and/or other intangibles are impaired. 
As a result of its value in use calculations, the group has impaired the master franchise agreements held in intangible assets by £500k. Refer to 
note 16 to the financial statements for the disclosures relating to the goodwill and other intangibles and the related impairment calculations. 
Our response:
Our audit procedures included testing of the discounted cash flow model, including the split of forecast cash generation between the 
separable intangibles, challenging the judgements and assumptions used by management in the calculation and performing sensitivity 
analysis on the cash flow model.
We considered the historical accuracy of key assumptions by comparing the accuracy of the previous estimates of profitability and related cash 
flows to the actual amounts realised. We assessed management’s sensitivity of key assumptions, including the revenue growth forecasts and 
the discount rate and considered whether the disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to reasonably 
possible changes in key assumptions were adequate and properly reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill and other intangibles. 
We audited management’s impairment of the master franchise agreements held in intangible assets, consulting with our valuations expert 
and challenging the assumptions and basis of impairment charge. We have also audited management’s estimation of the useful life of 
intangible assets acquired on business combinations and the revisions made in respect of these. 
Our application of materiality
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we set certain thresholds which help us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures and to evaluate the effects of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. During planning we 
determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judge would be material for the financial statements as a whole (FSM). 
During planning FSM was calculated as £242,000, which was updated to £316,000 during our audit work. We agreed with the Audit 
Committee that we would report to them all unadjusted differences in excess of £5,000, as well as differences below those thresholds that,  
in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.  33

Strategic report Financial statements Governance
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its control environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement. The financial statements were audited on a consolidated basis using Group materiality.  
The scope of our audit covered 100% of both consolidated profit before tax and consolidated net assets.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other 
than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information 
and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 ¡ the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 ¡ the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
 ¡ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 ¡ the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 ¡ certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 ¡ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 27, the directors are responsible for the preparation of  
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Governance Financial statements Strategic report
1. General information
The principal activity of The Property Franchise Group PLC and its Subsidiaries is that of a UK residential property franchise business. The 
Group operates in the UK. The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK and listed on AIM. The address 
of its head office and registered office is 2 St Stephen’s Court, St Stephen’s Road, Bournemouth, Dorset, UK.
2. Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in 
note 5.
The presentational currency of the financial statements is in British pounds and amounts are rounded to the nearest pound.
Going Concern
The Group has produced detailed budgets, projections and cash flow forecasts. The Directors have concluded after reviewing these 
budgets, projections and forecasts, making appropriate enquiries of the business and having considered uncertainties under the current 
economic environment, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
New standards, amendments and interpretations issued
The following new or amended standards are mandatory for the first time for the period beginning 1 January 2017:
Standard Key requirements Effective date 
Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure initiatives 1 January 2017
Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses 1 January 2017
Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities 1 January 2017
The following relevant new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the financial 
year beginning on 1 January 2017, and endorsed by the European Union, and have not been early adopted:
Standard Key requirements Effective date as adopted by the EU
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018
Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and measurement of share-based payments 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”
IFRS 9 will supersede IAS 39 in its entirety, and is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. Any changes to 
recognition and measurement will be applied retrospectively by adjusting the opening balance sheet at that time. 
The core areas addressed within IFRS 9 are as follows: 
 ¡ Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.
 ¡ Impairment of financial assets.
 ¡ Hedge accounting.
The Group does not expect any material changes in relation to the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities, nor the 
impairment of financial assets, nor for hedge accounting.
IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”
IFRS 15 will be effective for the Group from 1 January 2018, replacing IAS 18 “Revenue”, IAS 11 “Construction contracts” and related 
interpretations. Any changes to the recognition and measurement will be applied retrospectively by adjusting the opening balance sheet at 
that time.  
The standard establishes a principles-based approach for revenue recognition and is based on the concept of recognising revenue for 
obligations only when they are satisfied and the control of goods and services is transferred. It applies to all contracts with customers,  
except those in the scope of other standards.

2. Basis of preparation continued
The Group has performed an assessment which has highlighted that the new standard will impact on franchise sales revenue recognition but 
not Management Service Fee recognition or the recognition of other income. Franchise sales revenue currently consists of 4 elements:
1. A fee to buy a new franchise territory which is recognised upon the earlier of receipt of funds or signing of the franchise agreement.
2. A fee to buy a franchise territory that is being sold through the exit of the current franchisee which is recognised upon the earlier of 
receipt of funds or signing of the franchise agreement.
3. A fee paid by the seller of the franchise which is recognised in the month that a contract for the resale of a franchise is signed.
4. A fee paid upfront by franchisees for the first 12 months use of its systems which is deferred and released over the first 12 months as the 
obligations are discharged. 
For the fees described at points 1 and 2 above the franchisors have some initial obligations that extend beyond the receipt of funds and the 
signing of a franchise agreement. It is likely that some of the revenue will be deferred and released as the Group discharges its initial 
obligations to new franchisees, including the provision of training and initial support. Current estimates are that the period of release will be 
between 1 to 4 months with the majority released by month 2. From the work performed to date the Group believes that the adoption of 
IFRS 15 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 16 “Leases”
IFRS 16 requires that almost all leases will be brought onto lessees’ balance sheets under a single model (except leases of less than 12 months 
and leases of low-value assets), eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. The Directors anticipate that IFRS 16 will be 
adopted in the Group’s consolidated financial statements when it becomes mandatory. Currently, the Group holds some non-cancellable 
operating leases but no finance leases. For the Group’s non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £0.1m as at 31 December 2017 
(note 25), a preliminary assessment indicates that these arrangements will continue to meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16. Thus, the 
Group will have to recognise a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability in respect of all these leases – unless they qualify for low-value 
or short-term leases upon the application of IFRS 16. The Group believes that the adoption of IFRS 16 will not have a material impact on the 
consolidated financial statements. 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
 
3. Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include those of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries, drawn up to 31 December 2017. Subsidiaries are all 
entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a 
subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests 
issued by the Group. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are 
also eliminated. When necessary amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform to the Group’s accounting policies.
4. Significant accounting policies
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents income, net of VAT, from the sale of franchise agreements, resale fees and management service fees levied to 
franchisees monthly based on their turnover, and other income being the provision of training and ongoing support to franchisees.
Traditional brands: Fees from the sale of franchise agreements are not refundable and are recognised upon the earlier of the receipt of funds 
or the signing of the franchise agreement. These fees are for the use of the brand along with initial training and support and promotion 
during the opening phase of the new office. Resale fees are recognised in the month that a contract for the resale of a franchise is signed. 
Management service fees are recognised on a monthly basis and other income is recognised when the training and support is provided to 
the franchisee.
EweMove: Fees from the sale of franchise agreements for the EweMove brand are treated differently to the other brands, because an 
element of the initial fee is deferred and released over the first 12 months of trading of the franchise, where no monthly license fees are 
payable. Management service fees consist of monthly license fees and completion fees. License fees are recognised on a monthly basis, 
completion fees are recognised when sales or lettings transactions complete and other income is recognised when the training and support 
is provided to the franchisee.

Operating profit
Profit from operations is stated before finance income, finance costs and tax expense.
Business combinations
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities unless the fair 
value cannot be measured reliably in which case the value is subsumed into goodwill. Where the fair values of acquired contingent liabilities 
cannot be measured reliably, the assumed contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the same manner as other 
contingent liabilities.
Goodwill is the difference between the fair value of the consideration and the fair value of identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill arising on 
acquisitions is capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there is an indication that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets with a finite life are carried at cost less amortisation and any impairment losses. Intangible assets represent items which 
meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38, in that it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow to the entity and 
the cost can be measured reliably.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is deemed to have a cost to the 
Group of its fair value at the acquisition date. The fair value of the intangible asset reflects market expectations about the probability that the 
future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the Group.
Amortisation charges are included in administrative expenses in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Amortisation begins when the 
intangible asset is first available for use and is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of each intangible asset over its expected 
useful life, on a straight line basis, as follows:
Brands – CJ Hole, Parkers, Ellis & Co Indefinite life
Brands – EweMove 21 years
Customer lists including cashback 5 years
Master franchise agreements – Whitegates, CJ Hole, Parkers, Ellis & Co 25 years
Master franchise agreements – EweMove 15 years
Technology – EweReka 5 years
Technology – Websites 3 years
Acquired trade names are identified as separate intangible assets where they can be reliably measured by valuation of future cash flows. The 
trade names CJ Hole, Parkers and Ellis & Co are assessed as having indefinite lives due to their long trading histories.
Acquired customer lists are identified as a separate intangible asset as they are separable and can be reliably measured by valuation of 
future cash flows. This valuation also assesses the life of the particular relationship. The life of the relationship is assessed annually. Cashback 
given to franchisees who have made an eligible acquisition is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over 5 years, being the typical 
length of a franchise agreement.
Customer lists are being written off over a remaining life of 5 years.
Acquired master franchise agreements are identified as a separate intangible asset as they are separable and can be reliably measured by 
valuation of future cash flows. The life of the relationship is assessed annually. Master franchise agreements are being written off over a 
remaining life of 15–25 years as historical analyses shows that, on average, 4%–10% of franchises will change ownership per annum.
The cost of the new brand websites launched in 2017 have been capitalised and are being amortised over 3 years from launch date, being the 
expected period over which the websites are expected to generate economic benefit.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-current assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events and changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated.
In respect of goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful lives, management are required to assess whether the recoverable 
amount of each exceeds their respective carrying values at the end of each accounting period. 
In respect of intangible assets with definite lives, management are required to assess whether the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying 
value where an indicator of impairment exists at the end of each accounting period. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 46
The Property Franchise Group PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
4. Significant accounting policies continued
Impairment losses represent the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount; they are recognised in profit or loss. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated
to the cash generating unit and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis. Where an indicator of 
impairment exists against a definite life asset and a subsequent valuation determines there to be impairment, the intangible asset to which it 
relates is impaired by the amount determined. 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a 
change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Investment in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the Parent Company’s balance sheet at cost less any provisions for impairments.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation 
is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives on the following bases:
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment 15% reducing balance
Computer equipment over 3 years
Short leasehold improvements over the lease term
Income taxes
Income tax currently payable is calculated using the tax rates in force or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Taxable profit differs 
from accounting profit either because some income and expenses are never taxable or deductible, or because the time pattern that they are 
taxable or deductible differs between tax law and their accounting treatment.
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except if it arises from transactions or 
events that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Deferred tax
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences, at the tax rate that is substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax 
bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless 
the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other 
income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that  
the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets  
and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense 
in the income statement. For share based payments the deferred tax credit is recognised in the income statement to the extent that it offsets 
the share based charge, with any remaining element after offset being shown in the statement of changes in equity. 
Operating lease commitments
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged to 
profit/loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash balances in hand and in the bank (including short-term cash deposits).
Financial assets
The Group and Company only have financial assets classified as loans and receivables. The loans and receivables comprise trade and other 
receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Cash and cash equivalents (which exclude 
any client account monies) include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks.
Impairment of financial assets
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms 
receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future 
expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.
For trade receivables and loans to franchisees, which are reported net of provisions, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision 
account with the loss being recognised within other operating costs in the income statement. On confirmation that the trade receivable will 
not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance Financial statements Strategic report
Loans and receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise 
principally through the provision of services to franchisees (eg. trade receivables), but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary 
asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are 
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms of the 
receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future 
expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a 
separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the income statement. On confirmation that 
the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are comprised of trade and other payables, borrowings and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are recognised at 
amortised cost.
Trade payables, other payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period 
of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or 
all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is 
probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over 
the period of the facility to which it relates.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at 
the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments are amortised through the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period of the options, together with a corresponding increase in equity, 
based upon the Company’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model taking into account the following inputs:
 ¡ the exercise price of the option;
 ¡ the life of the option;
 ¡ the market price on the date of the grant of the option;
 ¡ the expected volatility of the share price;
 ¡ the dividends expected on the shares; and
 ¡ the risk-free interest rate for the life of the option.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the 
non-market conditions and recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity.
Deferred consideration
A provision is recognised in the Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in finance costs.
5. Critical accounting estimates and judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The Company makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on 
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. 48
The Property Franchise Group PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Impairment of intangible assets
The Group is required to test, where indicators of impairment exist, whether intangibles assets have suffered any impairment. The 
recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows 
and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. Key assumptions for the value in use calculation  
are described in note 16. The result of these calculations was that for EweMove, whilst the value in use exceeded the carrying value of the 
intangible assets it had reduced by £0.5m over the original calculation at acquisition. This reduction was traced to a reduction in the value  
in use of the master franchise agreement. Accordingly, an impairment of £0.5m was made against the carrying value of the master franchise 
agreement of EweMove.
Valuation of separable intangibles on acquisition
When valuing the intangibles acquired in a business combination, management estimate the expected future cash flows from the asset and 
choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Separable intangibles valued on acquisitions 
made in year were £nil (2016: £5.2m) as detailed further in note 16.
Share-based payment charge
The aggregate fair value expense of each grant is determined through using the Black-Scholes model detailed above and an estimate for the 
attainment of the non-market based performance condition in FY19. The estimate of earnings per share, the non-market based performance 
measure, relies on the assumptions regarding the achievement of the current year’s budget and a projection of earnings for FY19, taking into 
account available market data and performance trends. At this juncture it’s estimated that 26.5% of the non-market based performance 
condition will be met.
6. Segmental reporting
The Board of Directors, as the chief operating decision-making body, review financial information for and make decisions about the Group’s 
overall franchising business and have identified a single operating segment, that of property franchising.
7. Revenue
The Directors believe there to be three material income streams relevant to property franchising which are split as follows:

There were options over 2,204,800 ordinary shares outstanding at 31 December 2017; 2,140,000 had not yet vested and have performance 
conditions which will determine whether they vest or not in the future. The remaining option over 64,800 ordinary shares was exercisable at 
31 December 2017 but the average share price during the year ended 31 December 2017 was below the exercise price. For these reasons in 
2017 there is no dilutive effect of share options on the earnings per share calculation.
In 2016 all options outstanding at 31 December 2016 had met their vesting conditions, therefore there was a dilutive effect of all share 
options on the earnings per share calculation.

The carrying amount of goodwill relates to 4 (2016: 4) cash generating units, and reflects the difference between the fair value of 
consideration transferred and the fair value of assets and liabilities purchased. 52

Business combinations acquired October 2014
Goodwill is assessed for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the value in use calculations. The value in use of the goodwill arising 
on the acquisitions of Xperience Franchising Limited (“XFL ") and Whitegates Estate Agency Limited (“WEAL ") is based on the cash flows 
derived from the actual revenues and operating margins for 2017 and projections through to 31 December 2019. Thereafter projected 
revenue growth was assumed to decline linearly to a long-term growth rate of 2.2%.
The cash flows arising were discounted by the weighted average cost of capital which included a small companies’ risk premium to allow for 
factors such as illiquidity in the shares. These discount rates were 13.5% for XFL and 15.0% for WEAL, the latter higher rate reflecting WEAL's 
smaller size and more volatile earnings. This resulted in a total value for each company of the identifiable intangibles assets that exceeded 
the carrying values of the respective companies’ goodwill.
The Directors do not consider goodwill to be impaired. The Directors believe that no reasonably possible change in assumptions at the year 
end will cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value and hence impair the goodwill.
The master franchise agreements are being amortised over 25 years. The period of amortisation remaining at 31 December 2017 was 21 years 
10 months.
The brand names under which XFL trades of C J Hole, Parkers and Ellis & Co have been in existence for between 70 years and 168 years. 
Management see them as strong brands with significant future value and has deemed them to have indefinite useful lives as there is no 
foreseeable limit to the period over which the assets are expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group. As a consequence, 
management annually assess whether the carrying value of these brands have been impaired.
The Relief-from-Royalty-Method was used to value the brand names. Looking at independent research of royalty rates, management 
selected pre-tax royalty rates of between 3% and 5% for the above brand names.
The after tax royalty rates were then applied to the projected cash flows of each brand. The projected cash flows being the forecast growth 
in current revenues using market data through to 31 December 2019. Thereafter projected revenue growth was assumed to decline linearly to 
a long-term growth rate of 2.2%. The after tax cash flows determined through this process were then discounted at 13.5% to determine a 
value for each brand name. This discount rate approximated the company’s WACC as the risk profile of the brand names was seen as 
commensurate with that of the overall company. The values derived exceeded their carrying values.
The Directors believe that no reasonably possible change in assumptions at the year end will cause the value in use of the brands names CJ 
Hole, Parkers and Ellis & Co to fall below their carrying values and hence impair their intangible values.
The Whitegates brand was valued in a similar manner and deemed to have an immaterial value when the acquisition was made principally 
due to its lack of profitability over preceding years. It is therefore not recognised separately.
Business combination acquired September 2016
Goodwill is assessed for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the value in use calculations. The value in use of the goodwill arising 
on the acquisition of EweMove Sales & Lettings Ltd (“ESL ") is based on the cash flows derived from the actual revenues and operating 
margins for 2017 and projections through to 31 December 2024. Thereafter projected revenue growth was assumed to 2.2% per annum. 
A period of projected cash flows exceeding 5 years was deemed appropriate because the business has only been operating for 4 years, is 
continuing to recruit relatively high levels of new franchisees, each new franchisee should grow significantly in the first 5 years of operation 
and it has yet to develop the operational efficiencies of a mature franchisor.
Various events since acquisition, notably the founders deciding to leave the business, the decision to actively recruit experienced estate 
agents and the decision to change the licence fee, have caused a higher than originally projected attrition rate of franchisees who existed at 
acquisition. There has also been more development support required for franchisees without experience of the sector than was originally 
expected. As a result the business failed to achieve the projected EBITDA of £0.8m (achieved negative EBITDA of £0.1m). The revenue growth 
rates used in the valuation have been reduced and now range from 47% in FY18 to 5% in FY24.
The cash flows arising were discounted by the weighted average cost of capital being 16.39% which included a small companies’ risk 
premium to allow for factors such as illiquidity in the shares. This resulted in the value in use exceeding the carrying value of the goodwill and 
separately identifiable intangible assets. However, the calculations did indicate that the enterprise’s overall value had reduced by £0.5m 
compared to the value at acquisition.
The above events and the reduction in the enterprise’s value suggested that the value of the master franchise agreement may have reduced. 
A revaluation was performed. This used the:
a. projections of revenue decline until no franchisees, existing at acquisition, remain; and
b. projections of operating margin until 2024 where thereafter they remain unaltered. 
As these revenue streams represent the return from all the assets employed in generating those revenues, the fair value and expected rate 
of return of these other assets, known as the contributory asset charge, was determined and deducted. A discount rate of 16.39% was 
then applied.

The resulting value of the master franchise agreement was £0.5m lower than the carrying value. As a result an impairment of £0.5m has been 
charged to the master franchise agreement’s carrying value. 
The recent attrition rate of franchisees existing at acquisition implies that the remaining useful life of the master franchise agreement may be 
shorter than that originally assumed of 21 years. For this reason, the remaining useful life of the master franchise agreement has been 
reduced to 15 years. The period of amortisation remaining at 31 December 2017 was 13 years 8 months.
The remaining useful life of the brand name was also reviewed. It continues to attract and recruit the same level of franchisees as in previous 
years and to attract higher numbers of customers. Given these 2 factors the remaining useful life of the brand was considered to be unaltered 
at 21 years. The period of amortisation remaining at 31 December 2017 was 19 years and 8 months. 
The following table reflects the level of movements required in revenue or costs which could result in a potential impairment per the value in 
use calculation of goodwill. A further percentage (fall)/increase, of the magnitude indicated in the table below, in any one of the key 
assumptions set out above would result in a removal of the headroom in the value-in-use calculation for goodwill in 2017. Thus, if the discount 
rate increased by more than 14.5% to above 18.77%, an impairment change would result against goodwill, all other assumptions  
remaining unchanged.
Assumption Judgement Sensitivity
Discount rate As indicated above the rate used is 16.39% 14.5% 
Revenue – FY18 to FY24 The range of growth rates for FY18 to FY24 are stated above (18%)
Direct costs – all years Assumed to be 31% of revenue for all years 20%
Indirect costs – all years Assumed to be 46% of revenue in FY18 and then decline linearly to 29%  
of revenue in FY25 onwards 20%

Website Costs included in Technology
In 2017 new websites were launched for each of the 5 traditional brands. The costs associated with these websites have been capitalised as 
intangible assets as the purpose of the websites is to generate leads and revenue for the network. 
Cashback included in Customer lists
The additions in customer lists in 2017 represent sums provided to franchisees that have made qualifying acquisitions to grow their lettings 
portfolios. The sum provided is based on a calculation of the estimated increase in MSF as a result of the acquisition. In providing these sums 
the Group ensures that franchisees are contractually bound to the relevant franchisor for a period in excess of that required for the economic 
benefits to exceed the sums provided.

The Property Franchise Group PLC was incorporated on 7 October 2013. On 10 December 2013 a share for share exchange acquisition took 
place with Martin & Co (UK) Limited; 17,990,000 ordinary shares in The Property Franchise Group PLC were exchanged for 100% of the issued 
share capital in Martin & Co (UK) Limited.
On 31 October 2014 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Xperience Franchising Limited and Whitegates Estate Agency 
Limited for a consideration of £6,110,284.
On 5 September 2016 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of EweMove Sales & Lettings Ltd, and its dormant subsidiary 
Ewesheep Ltd, for a consideration of £8,000,000 plus £500,000 paid on 30 July 2017 and £500,000 paid on 31 December 2017 (see note 28).
Martin & Co (UK) Limited, Xperience Franchising Limited, Whitegates Estate Agency Limited, EweMove Sales & Lettings Ltd and Ewesheep 
Ltd are exempt from the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 relating to the audit of accounts under section 479A of the Companies 
Act 2006.
At the year-end The Property Franchise Group PLC has guaranteed all liabilities of Martin & Co (UK) Limited, Xperience Franchising Limited, 
Whitegates Estate Agency Limited, EweMove Sales & Lettings Ltd and Ewesheep Ltd. The value of the contingent liability resulting from this 
guarantee is unknown at the year-end.
The carrying value of the investment in EweMove has been considered for impairment through value in use calculations and it was 
determined that an impairment of £500,000 against the carrying value of the master franchise agreement was appropriate (see note 5 – 
Impairment of intangible assets), this has been accounted for in the year ended 31 December 2017.

The Group does not hold any collateral as security for its trade and other receivables. In the prior year a loan was made to a franchisee for 
£50k and is secured by way of a fixed and floating charge over their assets. At 31 December 2017 £20k (2016: £36k) was outstanding in 
relation to this loan. In a prior year a loan was made to another franchisee for £147k and £19k was outstanding at 31 December 2017 in relation 
to this loan.

Merger reserve
The acquisition of Martin & Co (UK) Limited by The Property Franchise Group PLC did not meet the definition of a business combination 
and therefore, falls outside of the scope of IFRS 3. This transaction was in 2013 and accounted for in accordance with the principles of 
merger accounting.
The consideration paid to the shareholders of the Subsidiary was £17,990,000 (the value of the investment). As these shares had a nominal 
value of £179,900, the merger reserve in the Company is £17,810,100.
On consolidation the investment value of £17,990,000 is eliminated so that the nominal value of the shares remaining is £179,900 and, as there 
is a difference between the Company value of the investment and the nominal value of the shares purchased in the Subsidiary of £100, this is 
also eliminated, to generate a merger reserve in the Group of £179,800.
Share-based payment reserve
The share-based payments reserve comprises charges made to the income statement in respect of share-based payments and related 
deferred tax impacts under the Group’s equity compensation scheme.

General objectives, policies and processes
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining 
ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective 
implementation of the objectives and policies to the finance function. The Board receives monthly reports from the finance function through 
which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s 
competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below:
Capital management policy
The Board considers capital to be the carrying amount of equity and debt. Its capital objective is to maintain a strong and efficient capital 
base to support the Group’s strategic objectives, provide progressive returns for shareholders and safeguard the Group’s status as a going 
concern. The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The Directors review and agree policies for 
managing each of these risks. These policies remain unchanged from previous years.
The Board monitors a broad range of financial metrics including growth in MSF, operating margin, EBITDA, return on capital employed and 
balance sheet gearing.
It manages the capital structure and makes changes in light of changes in economic conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital 
structure, it may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a franchisee or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. It is Group policy to assess the credit risk of new franchisees before entering contracts and to obtain credit information during 
the franchise agreement to highlight potential credit risks.
The highest risk exposure is in relation to loans to franchises and their ability to service their debt. The Directors have established a credit 
policy under which each franchisees are analysed for creditworthiness before a loan is offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings, 
when available, and in some cases bank references. The Group does not consider that it currently has significant concentration of credit risk 
with loans extended to franchisees of £20k.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt 
instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
In order to maintain liquidity to ensure that sufficient funds are available for ongoing operations and future development, the Group 
monitors forecast cash inflows and outflows on a monthly basis.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to changes in interest rate risk relates primarily to interest earning financial assets and interest bearing financial 
liabilities. Interest rate risk is managed by the Group on an ongoing basis with the primary objective of limiting the effect of an adverse 
movement in interest rates. Hence, the fixed rate of interest on one of its two bank loans. If LIBOR increased by 1%, this would cost the Group 
an extra £15k in interest for a full year. The Directors monitor movements in interest rates and believe that any reasonable fluctuation in 
LIBOR would not have a material impact on the Group.
Fair values of financial instruments
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is considered the same as the carrying values. 60

28. Deferred consideration
On 5 September 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of EweMove Sales & Lettings Ltd (“ESL ") and Ewesheep Ltd (“EL "). ESL is 
a franchisor of lettings and estate agents and EL is a dormant subsidiary of ESL. The initial consideration was £5m cash and £3m issue of 
ordinary shares. A further amount of up to £7m (“deferred consideration”) was due to the vendors upon approval of the financial results for 
the year ended 31 December 2018 and subject to various targets for Group financial performance being met. A renegotiation took place and 
the deferred consideration was reduced to £1m, of which £0.5m was paid on 31 July 2017 and £0.5m was paid 31 December 2017. No further 
payment is due for the acquisition of ESL.

Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) Share Option Scheme 2017
During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Company implemented an Enterprise Management Incentive scheme as part of the 
remuneration for all staff and granted options over 2,290,000 ordinary shares at an exercise price of £0.01 each. Since grant, an option 
has been forfeited over 150,000 shares following the departure of an employee. At 31 December 2017 options over 2,140,000 ordinary 
shares existed.
These options have a vesting condition based on Earnings Per Share (“EPS") targets for the year ended 31 December 2019.
The options over 2,290,000 ordinary shares were granted to different classes of employees at different times as follows:
1. Executive Directors were granted options over 1,500,000 ordinary shares on 9 June 2017 (“EMI – A").
2. Staff were granted options over 185,000 ordinary shares on 20 July 2017 (“EMI – B").
3. Leadership team recruits in FY17 were granted options over 605,000 ordinary shares on 14 September 2017 (“EMI – C").
The following principal assumptions were used in the valuation of each of the grants made in the year ended 31 December 2017 using the 
Black-Scholes option pricing model:
Assumptions EMI – A EMI – B EMI – C
Date of vesting 30/04/2020 30/04/2020 30/04/2020
Share price at grant £1.615 £1.620 £1.285
Exercise price £0.01 £0.01 £0.01
Risk-free rate 0.17% 0.32% 0.34%
Dividend yield 4.02% 4.01% 5.06%
Expected life 2.89 years 2.78 years 2.63 years
Share price volatility 28.60% 29.00% 29.00%
The weighted average contractual life remaining of these options is 2 years and 4 months.
Expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. The assumptions used in 
valuing each grant are based on the daily historical volatility of the share price over a period commensurate with the expected 
term assumption.
The risk-free rate of return is the implied yield at the date of grant for a zero coupon UK government bond with a remaining term equal to the 
expected term of the options.
It’s expected that with an exercise price of £0.01, should the EPS condition be met, all holders will exercise as soon as the options vest. The 
Group announces its results usually within the first 10 days of April. So it has been assumed that all options will be exercised on 30 April 2020.
EPS is measured as the basic earnings per share excluding any exceptional income/costs and any share-based payments charges. Further 
details can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 28 to 29.
Management has used the budget for FY18, the projections for FY19 and the market outlook to determine, at 31 December 2017, the 
achievement of the EPS condition.
