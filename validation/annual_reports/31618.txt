“I am pleased to report that ITE has posted like-for-like 
revenue growth of 5% after three years of difficult 
trading. On our top ten events we have driven like-for-
like top line growth of 15%. This growth in part reflects 
the successful roll out of the first phase of our TAG 
initiatives and our decision to focus on Core events 
that have the greatest capacity for growth. Whilst there 
have been challenging trading conditions in Russia 
outside of Moscow, Central Asia and in Turkey, we have 
seen the benefit of improved trading in Moscow. Our 
TAG programme is on track; during 2017 we have 
assembled the right team, structure and processes 
that we believe will lead to success. Even at this early 
stage, we are clearly seeing the benefits of our TAG 
initiatives, through growth in our Core events and 
forward bookings. 
ITE is well placed to realise its vision of creating the 
world’s leading portfolio of content-driven, must-attend 
events that deliver an outstanding experience and ROI 
for our customers. A fast pace has been set in the last 
year which we look forward to continuing into 2018  
and beyond.”

Chairman’s  
Statement
ITE	is	entering	a	period	in	the	
transformation	that	requires	dynamic	
change.	The	Group	has	embraced	the	
change	to	date	with	a	renewed	energy	
and	an	appetite	for	success,	which	is	
shared	by	the	Board.
I	am	pleased	to	introduce	to	shareholders	
the	Group’s	Annual	Report	for	the	year	
ended	30	September	2017.	These	results	
demonstrate	a	return	to	growth	in	a	year	of	
substantial	change.
A new vision for ITE
This	was	Mark	Shashoua’s	first	full	year	as	
Chief	Executive	Officer	and	Andrew	Beach	
joined	early	in	the	year	as	Chief	Financial	
Officer.	The	new	executive	team	and	the	
Board	have	undertaken	a	full	strategic	
review	of	the	business	to	identify	the	
optimum	way	forward	for	the	Group.	This	
review	involved	a	number	of	specialist	
advisors	working	together	with	the	senior	
management	team,	covering	every	aspect	
of	the	business	and	the	recommendations	
were	carefully	considered	by	the	Board.
The	result	of	the	review,	unveiled	in	May,	
is	an	evolved	strategy	for	the	Group	to	
generate	organic	growth	focussed	around	
our	market-leading	events.	This	will	involve	
significant	investment	in	event	content	
and	marketing	with	the	intention	to	make	
our	leading	shows	‘must-visit’	events	
in	their	market	sectors.	The	Group	has	
also	adopted	a	new	‘sales-led’	culture	
to drive revenue and has invested in a 
central	best	practice	team	to	ensure	that	
the	Group	is	consistent	in	delivering	a	
high-quality	experience	for	exhibitors	
and	visitors	alike	anywhere	in	the	world.
Our	TAG	programme,	which	will	see	the	
Group	invest	up	to	£20m	over	the	next	
three	years	with	anticipated	strong	return	
on	investment	by	2020,	was	presented	
to	a	number	of	shareholders	in	May	and	
we	were	pleased	with	the	support	it	
received.	You	will	find	more	detail	in	the	
Chief	Executive	Officer’s	Statement.
Performance
Revenue	was	£152.6m	(2016:	£134.4m),	
growth	of	5%	on	a	like-for-like	basis.	This	
is	the	first	year	of	like-for-like	revenue	
growth	for	four	years	and	a	pleasing	
result	from	the	implementation	of	the	first	
initiatives	of	the	Group’s	new	strategy.	
As	expected,	headline	profit	before	tax	
was	lower	at	£31.6m	(2016:	£36.5m)	after	
the	planned	investment	in	the	new	TAG	
programme.	Loss	before	tax	was	£3.2m	
(2016:	loss	of	£4.1m).	Net	debt	has	been	
reduced	by	16%	to	£49.7m	(2016:	£59.1m).	
In	Russia,	and	in	particular	in	Moscow,	
there	are	good	signs	that	the	economy	is	
improving	after	the	geopolitical	issues	of	
recent	years,	yet	we	are	still	experiencing	
challenges	in	many	of	our	other	markets.
Dividends
Full	year	dividend	cover	has	been	
maintained	at	more	than	two	times	
headline	earnings	per	share.	The	full	
year	dividend	per	share	is	proposed	
at	4.0p	(2016:	4.5p).	With	the	current	
lower	levels	of	Group	profit	and	the	
TAG	programme	investment	the	Board	
believes	this	to	be	in	the	long-term	
interests	of	shareholders.	The	final	
dividend	of	2.5p	is	proposed	for	payment	
on	5	February	2018	to	shareholders	
on	the	register	on	5	January	2018.
Board
The	Board	recognise	that	strong	
corporate	governance	is	at	the	heart	of	
a	good	business.	We	remain	focussed	
on	implementing	robust	processes	that	
identify	and	mitigate	risk	and	deliver	best	
practice	in	the	context	of	delivering	on	
our	promises	to	all	of	our	stakeholders.
After	five	years’	tenure,	Marco	Sodi	stepped	
down	from	the	Board	at	the	end	of	the	
financial	year,	having	stepped	down	as	
Company	Chairman	in	July	2017.	Marco	
led	the	business	through	a	difficult	period	
and	provided	invaluable	support	to	the	
management	team	through	the	design	and	
launch	of	ITE’s	new	strategy.	Marco	leaves	
with	the	Board’s	thanks	and	best	wishes.
A	search	is	underway	to	recruit	a	
new	Chairman	to	lead	the	business	
through	the	implementation	of	the	TAG	
programme	and	the	Board	intends	to	
further	strengthen	its	non-executive	
team	during	the	course	of	2018.
Sharon	Baylay	has	taken	over	as	
the	Chairman	of	the	Remuneration	
Committee	for	the	coming	year	to	
allow	Linda	Jensen	to	focus	on	her	role	
as	Senior	Independent	Director.
Our people
ITE	is	a	business	whose	success	is	
dependent	on	the	hard	work	and	loyalty	
of	all	of	its	employees.	It	has	been	a	
challenging	year	as	we	have	reviewed	
our	operations	and	introduced	new	
ways	of	working	in	many	areas	to	
position	the	Group	for	future	success.	
These	initiatives	have	been	fully	and	
positively	embraced	and,	on	behalf	
of	the	Board,	I	would	like	to	take	this	
opportunity	to	thank	all	of	our	1,374	
people	for	their	continued	commitment.
Outlook
We	have	allocated	a	significant	amount	
of	resource	to	the	Group’s	new	strategy	
and	have	recruited	a	substantial,	
knowledgeable	new	team	under	the	
leadership	of	Mark	Shashoua	to	implement	
this.	The	Board	are	pleased	with	the	early	
signs	as	we	seek	to	drive	sustainable	
growth	and	shareholder	value.
The	Group	enters	the	new	financial	
year	with	a	higher	level	of	visibility,	
with	forward	bookings	20%	ahead	
of	last	year	on	a	like-for-like	basis.
With	its	three	year	TAG	programme	well	
underway,	ITE	is	entering	a	period	in	the	
transformation	that	requires	dynamic	
change.	The	Group	has	embraced	the	
change	to	date	with	a	renewed	energy	and	
an	appetite	for	success,	which	is	shared	by	
the	Board.	With	the	potential	for	further	
improvement	in	both	the	geopolitical	and	
economic	markets	in	which	we	operate,	
the	Board	is	confident	for	the	future.

Strategic report
Chief Executive Officer’s  
Statement
ITE’s	performance	in	2017	reflects	a return	
to	revenue	growth	following implementation	
of	early	TAG	initiatives.
Revenues	for	the	year	were	£152.6m	
(2016:	£134.4m),	up	5%	on	a	like-for-like	
basis.	This	is	the	first	year	of	like-for-like	
revenue	growth	since	2013,	driven	by	
Russia,	and	in	particular	Moscow,	where	
many	of	our	Core	events	are	located.	
The	reported	loss	before	tax	of	£3.2m	
(2016:	loss	of	£4.1m),	was	after	including	
one-off	restructuring	costs	of	£5.0m	(2016:	
£nil),	£4.6m	of	which	were	incurred	as	part	
of	the	TAG	programme,	and	impairment	
charges	of	£14.3m	(2016:	£26.5m).
Headline	profit	before	tax	was	£31.6m	
(2016:	£36.5m)	and	headline	diluted	
EPS	was	8.1p	(2016:	10.7p).	Both	of	
these	measures	reflect	event	timing	
differences	and	are	after	incurring	costs	
associated	with	the	TAG	programme	
within	headline	results,	in	relation	to	the	
delivery	of	the	Group’s	new	strategy.
After	I	joined	the	business	on	1	September	
2016,	we	set	three	main	priorities	for	the	
year	ended	30	September	2017.	These	
were	to:
1.	 Complete	a	comprehensive	review	of	
the	business	in	order	to	develop	our	
future	strategy	and	vision;
2.	 Improve	our	trading	position;	and
3.	 Set	an	operating	rhythm	to	increase	the	
operational	rigour	and	breed	a	culture	
of	success.
I	am	pleased	to	report	clear	progress	has	
been	made	against	each	of	these	priorities	
and	a	firm	commitment	has	been	made	to	
invest	in	our	people,	systems	and	products	
so	we	can	deliver	better	experiences	for	
our	customers	and	accelerate	growth.
Strategic Review and  
evolution of our strategy
At	the	start	of	the	year	we	undertook	
a	thorough	and	detailed	review	of	
the	business,	which	included	reviews	
by	product,	geography,	structures,	
systems,	sales,	marketing,	IT	and	
finance.	The	outputs	of	this	review,	
unveiled	in	May	2017	resulted	in	an	
Headline	profit	before	tax
£31.6m
Mark Shashoua 
Chief	Executive	Officer
TAG	one-off	investment
£20.0m
evolved	strategy	and	the	introduction	
of	a	three	year	TAG	programme.
At	our	strategy	update	in	May,	our	new	
vision	for	the	Group	was	announced:	
“To create the world’s leading portfolio 
of content-driven, must-attend events 
delivering an outstanding experience 
and ROI for our customers”.
By	putting	exhibitors	and	visitors	at	the	
heart	of	everything	we	do,	we	plan	to	drive	
sustainable	growth	for	our	shareholders.	
ITE	strives	to	run	the	best	shows	and	
offer	the	best	service	to	its	customers	
throughout	the	world,	regardless	of	
location.	The	Group’s	focus	on	a	product-
led	strategy	will	see	ITE	focus	on	events	
that	are	market	leading	or	have	a	clear	path	
to	become	number	one	in	their	sector.
To	deliver	our	vision,	TAG	is	being	
implemented	across	the	Group	and	
comprises	three	pillars:
–	 Create	a	scalable	platform	to	generate	
real	organic	growth;
–	 Actively	managing	our	portfolio;	and
–	 Make	selective	product-led	acquisitions.
As	part	of	our	TAG	programme	we	are	
investing	up	to	£20m	across	the	next	
three	years,	which,	underpinned	by	a	
performance-led	culture,	will	accelerate	
organic	revenue	growth	as	follows:
Create a scalable platform
Transformational	levers	and	TAG	
investment	will	be	spread	across	five	
areas to:
–	 Create best practice functions 
and teams
• Deliver	best-in-class	processes	
implemented	globally	across	the	
Group,	greater	efficiency	via	
standardised	processes,	a	more	
structured	and	accountable	
leadership,	and	a	globally	consistent	
‘ITE	way’	driving	efficiency	and	
greater	attendee	experience.
–	 Invest in show operations
• Enhance	customer	retention	and	
exhibitor	reach,	obtain	enriched	data	
insights	and	improve	operational	
efficiency.
–	 Build capability and talent
• Attract	and	retain	talent,	develop	
internal	capabilities,	and	establish	
the	right	capabilities	to	drive	
business	and	adapt	to	market	
changes.
–	 Drive a performance culture
• Create	a	values-driven	organisation	
that	encourages	high	performance	
and	rewards	success	and	talent,	
building	a	winning	team	with	an	
aspirational	culture.
–	 Build and maintain fit for purpose 
IT infrastructure and systems
• Create	a	global	IT	function	and	
infrastructure	that	can	support	the	
requirements	of	a	flexible,	mobile	
and	highly	effective	workforce	that	
operates	globally,	but	delivers	locally,	
and	supports	and	enables	a	‘One	ITE	
way	of	working’.
As	part	of	creating	a	scalable	platform,	as	
a	result	of	the	above,	the	Group	will	move	
decisively	from	being	a	decentralised,	
geographically	structured	business	to	
one	that	is	more	centralised	and	product-
led	with	strong	regional	platforms.	The	
evolution	of	customer	expectations	
implies	that	every	local	market	now	
expects	events	of	a	truly	international	
quality.	Global	multinationals	are	starting	
to	choose	one	events	company	that	
will	cater	for	them	globally,	rather	than	
a	variety	in	different	markets	and	the	
trend	is	towards	a	one-stop	shop	that	
is	able	to	deliver	a	consistently	high	
standard	of	service	everywhere.
Early	progress	with	implementing	the	
strategy	has	been	good;	the	framework	
for	the	TAG	programme	has	been	
finalised,	based	around	the	five	areas	
noted	above.	The	governance	for	the	
programme	has	been	set,	the	TAG	
programme	team	created	and	heads	
of	best	practice	have	been	recruited.
Having	focussed	our	early	efforts	on	
sales	and	marketing	initiatives	in	
order	to	drive	trading	performance,	I	
am	pleased	to	report	we	have	started	
to	see	tangible	evidence	of	progress. Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Actively manage the portfolio
The	Group	will	continue	to	
implement	a	more	rigorous	
approach	to	allocation	of	capital.	
Having	deliberately	segmented	its	
business	into	Core	and	Non-Core,	this	
development	is	enabling	management	
to	increase	its	focus	on	events	that	
present	the	greatest	opportunities	whilst	
reducing	distraction	from	smaller	events.
The	Core	shows	are	of	strategic	importance	
to	our	future	and	include	the	Group’s	
largest	shows,	those	with	the	greatest	
potential	for	growth	and	a	number	of	
smaller	but	strategically	important	shows.	
The	Non-Core	shows	consist	of	smaller	
shows	with	less	potential	for	growth.	
As	part	of	the	Group’s	strategy,	a	top	
priority	remains	to	apply	a	full	suite	
of	transformational	levers	to	its	Core	
events	to	realise	their	full	potential.	This	
includes investing in content to drive 
great	customer	experience,	retention	
and	pricing.	Each	segment	of	the	Group’s	
portfolio	requires	a	different	degree	of	
focus	and	different	transformational	
levers	to	maximise	their	growth.
Our	international	sales	structures	have	
been	repositioned	to	focus	on	our	
Core	market-leading	events	and	this	
has	seen	strong	revenue	growth	which	
has	offset	the	cancellation	of	smaller,	
Non-Core,	low	yielding	events.	
During	the	year	we	discontinued	37	
unprofitable,	or	less	profitable,	shows.	
In	line	with	its	product-led	strategy,	the	
Group	will	continue	to	proactively	review	
its	portfolio	on	an	ongoing	basis.
Work	is	underway	to	develop	an	‘ITE	
way’,	creating	a	blueprint	to	run	events	
that	is	consistent	globally.	With	the	
‘Best	Practice’	team	now	established,	
the	Group	has	implemented	new	
performance	management	processes	
and	sales	incentive	schemes,	leading	to	
demonstrable	results	as	it	transitions	
towards	a	sales-led	performance	culture.
One	area	of	particular	focus	has	been	onsite	
rebooking	at	a	number	of	Core	events,	
and	this	has	been	successful	in	improving	
sales	visibility	into	the	next	financial	year.
Overall,	the	programme	is	progressing	
according	to	plan	with	implementation	
underway	and	progress	evidenced	
across	the	five	levers:
Product-led acquisitions
In	due	course	the	Group	will	look	to	
make	selective	product-led	acquisitions	
to	accelerate	growth	in	line	with	its	strict	
M&A	criteria.	Each	opportunity	will	be	
carefully	reviewed	but	will	not	be	limited	
to	any	particular	geography	as	the	Group	
aims	to	run	the	best	shows	in	the	best	
industries	anywhere	in	the	world.
Several	criteria	will	determine	what	
the	Group	will	consider.	Acquisitions	
are	likely	to	meet	most,	but	not	
necessarily	all,	of	the	following:
–	 Scalability	–	in	sectors	with	high	growth	
potential 
–	 A	distinct	customer	value	proposition	–	
serving	a	clear	part	of	an	industry	sector
–	 Position	in	attractive	markets	for	events	
–	serving	a	high	growth	underlying	
market	
–	 Evidence	of	strong	organic	revenue	
growth	and	profit	margins
–	 Potential	to	roll	out	internationally	–	
dependent on the product 
–	 Earnings	accretive	–	offering	a	good	
return on invested capital
The	Group	is	building	a	pipeline	of	
product-led	opportunities,	but	will	
only	proceed	if	such	opportunities	
meet	most	of	these	criteria.
Trading
Having	focussed	our	early	efforts	on	
sales	and	marketing	initiatives	in	order	to	
drive	trading	performance,	I	am	pleased	
to	report	we	have	started	to	see	tangible	
evidence	of	progress.	All	sales	people	
across	the	Group	have	been	set	monthly	
sales	targets	and	a	new	commission	
structure	has	been	rolled	out.	This	has	led	
to	monthly	sales	league	tables	which	are	
continually	reviewed	and	has	enhanced	
visibility.	We	have	also	announced	‘Club	
Elite’.	This	initiative	recognises	and	rewards	
our	top	sales	talent	on	a	quarterly	basis	
and	is	instilling	a	culture	of	success.	It	
has	proven	so	effective	that	we	have	
actively	rolled	this	out	across	the	Group	
to	incorporate	marketing,	content	and	
support	services,	enabling	us	to	embed	
and	reward	high	performing	talent.	
I	am	pleased	to	say	that	these	early	
initiatives	have	contributed	to	our	
performance,	as	the	Group	has	
posted	its	first	year	of	like-for-like	
revenue	growth	in	four	years.
Operating rhythm
Efforts	to	refocus	the	organisation	on	
organic	trading	in	the	last	year	and	
embed	a	culture	of	engagement	are	
well	underway.	For	example,	we	have	
introduced	weekly	trading	meetings,	weekly	
review	of	sales,	monthly	regional	boards,	
event	level	strategy	pre	and	post	show,	
and	new	global	communication	channels	
to	showcase	event	successes	globally,	
helping	staff	to	feel	part	of	‘One	ITE’. Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Statement

Philosophies
ITE’s	approach	is	based	on	a	view	
of	what	our	customers	want	–	and	
to	be	clear,	customers	include	both	
exhibitors	and	visitors.	Customer	
needs	are	continually	evolving.	
Return	on	Investment	(ROI)	is	now	a	key	
metric	for	exhibitors	and	an	increasing	
request	to	justify	spend	and	demonstrate	
return.	ROI	is	typically	best	delivered	
by	attending	the	main	event	in	any	
given	sector,	since	that	will	deliver	the	
largest	and	most	relevant	audience.
For	visitors,	Return	on	Time	(ROT)	is	
equally	important.	They	don’t	have	time	
to	visit	every	event	and	so	they	will	choose	
the	event	that	delivers	the	best	ROT.	
ROT	is	also	typically	best	delivered	by	
the	main	event,	with	the	largest	number	
of	exhibitors,	content,	networking	
opportunities	and	the	best	experience.
Running	market-leading	events	is	
therefore	critical,	and	it	is	becoming	
harder	and	harder	to	successfully	
run	second	tier	events,	since	they	
can’t	compete	on	ROI	or	ROT.	
In	response	to	this	we	are	making	content	
investment	a	priority.	Visitors	no	longer	
want	to	attend	events	that	act	just	as	
trading	platforms.	Good	quality	events	
have	become	places	to	learn,	network,	
discuss	and	debate;	they	act	as	an	
industry	platform,	bringing	a	business	
community	together	under	one	roof.
Visitors	use	events	to	gauge	what	their	
competitors	are	doing	and	where	their	
industry	is	going,	and	so	investing	in	
high	quality	content	–	from	distinguished	
keynote	speakers	to	detailed	technical	
seminars	–	is	critical	to	engage	and	
drive	high	quality	audiences	and	
senior	levels	of	participation.
New	technology	has	also	impacted	
the	industry.	People	once	thought	
that	technology	would	diminish	the	
need	for	face-to-face	events,	but	in	
reality	it	is	the	opposite.	Technology	
has	enabled	organisers	to	be	more	
efficient,	engage	better	with	our	
customers,	and	help	them	measure	
return	on	investment	more	effectively.	
New	technology	also	enables	organisers	
to	drive	retention	since	improving	events	
drives	increases	in	retention	rates	for	
exhibitors	and	increases	in	visitor	numbers.	
This	in	turn	attracts	new	business.
Retention	in	an	events	business	is	crucial.	
In	order	to	focus	on	retention	you	need	
detailed	customer	insight	and	data	analysis.
Market-leading	events	–	ROI	/	ROT Customer	insight	and	data
Content-led	–	high	on	relevance Customer	service
Retention-led	business	 
enabled	by	technology
Strong	sales	and	marketing	
performance-based	culture
This	ties	directly	into	customer	service,	
where	earlier	booking	of	exhibitors	
generally	improves	retention	by	helping	
them	to	prepare	for	a	successful	event.
Within	the	organisation	itself,	I	believe	
in	a	strong	performance-based	culture	
both	in	sales	and	marketing.	Training,	
monitoring,	managing	performance	
and	breeding	a	culture	of	success	by	
rewarding	achievement	is	the	basis	for	
strong	sustainable	organic	growth.
We	believe	that	a	strong	sales	and	
marketing	culture,	with	an	emphasis	
on	quality	of	events,	retention	and	
operational	efficiency	can	drive	sustainable	
growth	and	shareholder	value.
Priorities for 2018
The	Group	has	achieved	much	in	a	short	
space	of	time	since	we	announced	our	
evolved	strategy	and	TAG	programme.	
2017	has	put	in	place	the	building	
blocks	and	we	believe	that	we	have	the	
elements	in	place	to	succeed.	Now	it	is	
about	rigorous	attention	to	detail	and	
execution	of	our	plan.	In	the	year	ahead,	
our	main	focus	within	TAG	will	be	on	lead	
generation,	content	and	customer	service.	
Outlook
Whilst	we	continue	to	roll	out	the	TAG	
programme	across	our	Core	events,	we	
remain	focussed	on	trading	performance.	
The	stabilisation	of	trading	conditions	in	
Moscow	is	having	a	positive	impact	on	
the	outlook	for	next	year,	but	is	tempered	
by	challenging	trading	conditions	
elsewhere	in	the	markets	in	which	we	
operate.	As	at	24	November	2017,	the	
Group	has	contracted	£98m	of	revenues	
in	respect	of	2018	events,	compared	to	
£81m	at	this	stage	last	year	in	respect	
of	2017	events.	This	represents	an	
increase	of	20%	on	a	like-for-like	basis.	
The	Board	remains	confident	of	the	Group’s	
prospects	as	it	enters	the	new	financial	
year.	ITE	is	well	placed	to	realise	its	vision	
of	creating	the	world’s	leading	portfolio	of	
content-driven,	must-attend	events	that	
deliver	an	outstanding	experience	and	ROI	
for	our	customers.	A	fast	pace	has	been	
set	in	the	last	year	which	we	look	forward	
to	continuing	into	2018	and	beyond.

ITE	organises	high	quality	international	
business-to-business	events	globally,	
running	exhibitions	in	15	countries	in	2017.
We	have	been	operating	in	emerging	
markets	and	developing	economies	
for	over	20	years	and	have	developed	
extensive	experience	and	local	knowledge.	
As	a	Group	we	are	focussed	on	improving	
the	quality	of	the	events	we	operate	
and	are	pursuing	a	product-led	strategy,	
focussed	on	market-leading	events,	
irrespective	of	geographic	location	or	
industry	segment.	
We	hire	exhibition	space	from	local	venue	
owners	and	generate	our	revenues	
primarily	from	the	sale	of	exhibition	
space	at	our	events,	charging	exhibitors	
by	the	square	metre	for	space	sold.	Our	
exhibitors	use	our	exhibitions	as	sales	
and	marketing	events,	where	they	interact	
with	visitors,	promote	new	and	existing	
products,	generate	leads	and	ultimately	
make	sales.
Both	our	exhibitors’	and	visitors’	needs	are	
continually	evolving.	ROI	is	a	key	metric	for	
our	exhibitors,	while	ROT	is	becoming	a	
key	metric	for	visitors.	To	run	and	maintain	
market-leading	events	we	are	committed	
to	investing	in	content,	to	ensure	our	
events	are	places	to	learn,	network,	
discuss	and	debate.	Our	events	act	as	an	
industry	platform,	bringing	a	business	
community	together	under	one	roof.

This	represents	a	risk	to	achieving	the	Group’s	vision.
The	TAG	programme,	announced	in	May	
2017,	is	being	implemented	to	transform	
the	Group	and	position	it	to	achieve	its

set	out	opposite.	Each	of	these	has	been	
identified	with	the	Group’s	vision	in	mind.
Key	performance	indicators	(KPIs)

all	of	these	KPIs	–	this	will	come	with	
the	full	implementation	of	TAG	and	
the	roll-out	of	the	new	global	CRM	and

Chief Financial Officer’s  
Statement
We	delivered	like-for-like	growth	
for	the	first	time	since	2013,	up	
5%,	reflecting	the	successful	
roll-out	of	the	first	wave	of	our	
TAG	initiatives,	assisted	by	the	
stabilisation	of	Moscow.
Revenues	for	the	year	were	£152.6m	(2016:	
£134.4m),	as	we	delivered	like-for-like	
growth	for	the	first	time	since	2013,	up	5%.
Overview
This	growth	reflects	the	successful	roll-out	
of	the	first	wave	of	our	TAG	initiatives,	
such	as	a	new	sales	incentive	structure,	
assisted	by	the	stabilisation	of	Moscow	and	
in	spite	of	challenging	trading	conditions	
in	some	of	our	other	markets.	Our	focus	
has	been,	and	will	continue	to	be,	on	our	
Core	events	and	this	is	reflected	in	the	
growth	experienced	across	our	Core	events	
in	the	year,	which	grew	at	a	much	faster	
rate	than	our	Non-Core	events.	Looking	
ahead	the	TAG	initiatives	are	also	having	
a	positive	impact,	with	deferred	income	
at	30	September	2017	of	£82.6m	(2016:	
£61.9m),	with	a	significant	proportion	of	
the	increase	coming	from	the	introduction	
of	our	new	onsite	rebooking	initiative.
The	Group	reported	losses	before	tax	of	
£3.2m	against	a	prior	year	loss	before	tax	
of	£4.1m.	This	was	after	including	one-off	
restructuring	costs	of	£5.0m	(2016:	£nil),	
£4.6m	of	which	were	incurred	as	part	of	
the	TAG	programme,	and	impairment	
charges	of	£14.3m	(2016:	£26.5m).
Headline	profit	before	tax	is	a	non-
statutory	measure	of	performance	
used	by	the	Group	as	it	better	reflects	
underlying	trading	performance.	After	
excluding	adjusting	items,	detailed	below,	
headline	profit	before	tax	was	£31.6m	
(2016:	£36.5m).	Included	within	headline	
profits	were	£2.8m	of	costs	associated	
with	the	TAG	programme,	such	as	the	
best	practice	teams	and	the	impact	of	
changes	to	the	sales	commission	structure.	
On	a	like-for-like	basis	headline	profit	
before	tax	has	grown	by	2%,	reversing	
the	trend	reported	in	recent	years.
Basic	and	diluted	earnings	per	share	were	
(3.1)p	(2016:	(3.6)p).	The	Group	achieved	
headline	diluted	earnings	per	share	of	
8.1p	(2016:	10.7p),	with	the	decrease	
largely	due	to	the	reduction	in	headline	
profits	in	the	year	and	the	increase	in	
the	Group’s	effective	tax	rate,	which	
is	discussed	in	more	detail	below.
Group	operating	cash	conversion	for	the	
year	was	134%	(2016:	112%).	The	significant	
increase	is	largely	as	a	result	of	the	onsite	
rebooking	initiative,	which	has	brought	
our	cash	inflows	forward,	and	also	from	an	
increase	in	forward	bookings	for	next	year’s	
events	attributable	to	an	upturn	in	trading,	
particularly	across	our	Core	events.	Net	
debt	at	the	year-end	has	reduced	to	£49.7m	
from	£59.1m	at	30	September	2016	as	a	
result	of	strong	cash	flows	from	operations.	
The	Group’s	£6.7m	cash	investment	in	the	
new	TAG	programme,	£10.0m	of	previously	
committed	acquisition	and	transaction	
costs	and	£8.7m	of	dividend	payments	to	
shareholders	have	been	funded	entirely	
through	cash	flows	from	operations.

Statement
continued
A	refinancing	of	the	Group’s	external	
debt	facility	was	completed	in	November	
2017	and	gives	the	Group	access	to	a	
new	£100m	facility	from	a	syndicate	of	
four	banks,	HSBC,	Barclays,	Citibank	and	
Commerzbank.	The	facility	amortises	by	
£10m	each	year	and	expires	in	November	
2021,	giving	us	certainty	over	funding	
through	the	life	of	the	TAG	programme.	
The	facility	has	more	favourable	pricing	
and	more	appropriate	covenants,	including	
a	leverage	ratio	which	is	now	assessed	
on	a	net	debt	to	EBITDA	basis,	replacing	
the	gross	debt	covenant	in	place	under	
the	previous	facility.	The	facility	is	also	
structured	to	allow	the	flexibility	we	
require	to	achieve	our	plans,	including	
larger	acquisition	baskets	and	more	
flexible	use	of	disposal	proceeds.
Trading summary
In	2017	the	Group	ran	234	events	(2016:	252).	The	decrease	is	primarily	attributable	to	
cancellations	of	smaller,	less	profitable	events.	A	detailed	analysis	of	volumes	and	revenues

Refer	to	the	‘Divisional	trading	summary’	section	for	commentary	on	each	operating	
segment.
Other	income	relates	primarily	to	rental	income	from	sub-leasing	unused	office	space.
Central	costs	include	all	costs	that	are	
not	allocated	to	the	Group’s	operating	
segments	when	headline	profit	before	tax	
is	reported	to	the	Senior	Operating	Board	
for	the	purposes	of	allocating	resource	and	
making	strategic	decisions.	These	include	
the	Group’s	corporate	overheads	and	
other	central	costs	that	are	included	within	
cost	of	sales.	The	corporate	overheads	
are	the	costs	of	running	the	head	office	
in	London	and	are	primarily	comprised	of	
the	staff	costs,	which	include	the	Group’s	
Executive	and	Non-executive	Directors,	
depreciation	of	the	Group’s	centrally	held	
assets,	office	rent	and	professional	fees.	
The	other	central	costs	included	within	
cost	of	sales	include	digital	marketing	costs	
that	are	not	event-specific,	but	span	the	
Group’s	portfolio	of	events.	The	increase	
in	central	costs	in	2017	follows	higher	
bonus	payments	in	the	year,	an	element	
of	which	is	based	on	the	achievement	of	
target	Group	results	for	the	financial	year.
Central	costs	in	2017	include	£1.3m	of	
TAG	costs	and	£1.4m	of	central	structure	
costs.	Of	the	£2.8m	of	costs	associated	
with	the	TAG	programme	that	have	been	
included	within	headline	results,	£1.3m	
do	not	directly	relate	to	the	reportable	
segments	and	have	been	recognised	
within	central	costs.	The	central	structure	
costs represent costs in London that 
were	primarily	incurred	prior	to	the	
launch	of	the	TAG	programme	to	ensure	
that	we	were	positioned	appropriately	
to	determine	the	Group’s	new	strategic	
direction	and	ultimately	to	implement	it	
successfully.	These	include	the	staff	costs	
and	recruitment	costs	of	the	new	Strategy	
Team	and	the	CFO,	to	the	extent	that	there	
was	no	comparable	cost	in	the	prior	year.
The	foreign	exchange	gain	represents	
the	retranslation	of	monetary	assets	and	
liabilities	held	in	our	subsidiary	companies	
that	are	denominated	in	currencies	
other	than	the	functional	currencies	
of	the	subsidiaries.	See	the	‘Foreign	
exchange’	section	for	further	details.
Net	finance	costs	relate	to	the	
interest	payable	on	our	external	
banking	facility	and	bank	fees,	net	of	
interest	income	for	the	period.
Headline results
In	addition	to	the	statutory	results,	
headline	results	are	presented,	which	are	
the	statutory	results	after	excluding	a	
number	of	adjusting	items,	as	the	Board	
consider	this	to	be	the	most	appropriate	
way	to	measure	the	Group’s	underlying	
performance.	In	addition	to	providing	
a	more	comparable	set	of	results	year-
on-year,	this	is	also	in	line	with	similar	
adjusted	measures	used	by	our	peer	
companies	and	therefore	facilitates	
comparison	across	the	industry.
With	the	exception	of	restructuring	
costs,	the	adjusting	items	presented	are	
consistent	with	those	presented	in	the	
previous	year.	The	restructuring	costs	
have	been	presented	separately	in	order	
to	report	what	the	Board	consider	to	
be	the	most	appropriate	measure	of	
underlying	performance	of	the	Group	
and	to	provide	additional	information	
on	the	scale	and	progress	of	the	
Group’s	transformation	programme.

declined	in	the	year	as	a	result	of	a	number	of	our	historical	Russian	intangible	assets	
reaching	the	end	of	their	estimated	useful	lives,	offset	in	part	by	the	amortisation	on	
the	intangible	assets	recognised	on	completion	of	the	acquisition	of	Gehua	in	the	year.

Impairment of goodwill and 
intangible assets
In	the	year,	impairment	charges	were	
recognised	in	respect	of	our	India,	Turkey,	
and	Africa	Oil	Week	(AOW)	cash	generating	
units	(CGUs).	Recent	trading	in	these	CGUs	
has	improved.	However,	the	forecast	cash	
flows	include	an	increase	in	the	Central	
cost	allocation	following	our	move	to	a	
more	centralised	model	and	an	update	
to	the	discount	rate	methodology,	which,	
when	coupled	with	the	low	headroom	
of	these	CGUs,	results	in	the	value	in	
use	not	being	sufficient	to	support	the	
carrying	value	of	the	assets.	Prior	to	
these	changes,	the	Turkey	and	AOW	CGUs	
had	lower	headroom	as	a	result	of	the	
adverse	macro-economic	and	geopolitical	
conditions	faced	in	the	last	few	years	in	
Turkey	and	the	significant	downturn	in	the	
oil	price	in	2015,	which	has	affected	our	
AOW	oil	conference	in	South	Africa.	The	
India	CGU	had	lower	headroom	due	to	
the	write-down	of	the	assets	to	the	value	
in	use	of	the	CGU	in	the	prior	year.	As	well	
as	the	impairment	charge	recognised	at	
our	India	CGU	last	year,	the	prior	year	
charge	also	included	impairments	of	
our	South	East	Asia	and	Siberia	CGUs.
Impairment of investments in associates 
and joint ventures
The	current	year	charge	is	recognised	in	
respect	of	our	Indonesian	joint	venture,	
following	the	update	to	the	discount	
rate	methodology	in	determining	
value	in	use	discussed	above.	In	the	
prior	year	we	impaired	our	investment	
in	our	Malaysian	joint	venture.
Transaction costs on completed and 
pending acquisitions
Transaction	costs	on	completed	and	
pending	acquisitions	relates	principally	to	
costs	incurred	on	the	Gehua	acquisition	
completed	in	December	2016.
Loss on disposal of investments
During	the	year	the	Group	disposed	
of	its	investment	in	Gima	International	
Exhibition	Group	GmbH	&	Co	KG	
(GiMA),	a	sales	agency	business	based	
in	Germany.	As	a	result	of	the	disposal	
the	goodwill	held	on	the	balance	sheet	
from	the	original	acquisition	of	GiMA,	
over	a	decade	ago,	this	has	resulted	in	
the	recognition	of	a	loss	on	disposal.
Chief Financial Officer’s  
Statement

Restructuring costs, including TAG
Restructuring costs relate to costs incurred 
in	transforming	the	business,	and	largely	
relate	to	the	TAG	programme.	The	costs	
included	within	adjusting	items	are	the	one-
off	costs	of	designing	and	implementing	
the	Group’s	new	strategy.	The	most	
significant	of	these	costs	are	professional	
and	consultancy	fees	incurred	in	relation	to	
the	strategic	and	business	reviews	carried	
out	on	the	existing	business	and	underlying	
markets,	the	costs	of	designing	the	Group’s	
new	strategy	and	its	future	operating	
model,	and	the	costs	of	implementing	the	
new	strategic	initiatives	launched	to	date.
The	TAG	programme	has	led	to	certain	
costs,	such	as	those	associated	with	new	
best	practice	roles	and	changes	to	the	sales	
commission	structure,	that	are	expected	to	
remain	as	part	of	the	Group’s	new	operating	
model	post-transformation.	These	costs	have	
not	been	included	within	adjusting	items	
and	are	presented	within	headline	results.
Tax on income from associates and 
joint ventures
Statutory	reported	profits	from	associates	
and	joint	ventures	are	presented	post-
tax.	In	order	to	present	a	measure	of	
profit	before	tax	for	the	Group	that	is	
purely	pre-tax,	the	tax	on	associate	
and	joint	venture	profits	is	added	back.	
The	year-on-year	increase	reflects	the	
increase	in	profits	from	associates	and	
joint	ventures	this	year,	primarily	due	to	
strong	performance	from	Sinostar	and	
ITEMF,	as	discussed	further	below.
Revaluation of liabilities on 
completed acquisitions
A	number	of	the	Group’s	acquisitions	
completed	in	recent	years	have	future	earn-
out	commitments,	either	through	deferred	
or	contingent	consideration	payments	or	
through	equity	option	liabilities	to	increase	
our	current	shareholdings.	These	are	
held	on	the	balance	sheet	at	fair	value	
and	therefore	change	based	on	the	latest	
foreign	exchange	rates,	the	proximity	
of	the	settlement	date	and	the	latest	
expectation	of	the	settlement	value.	All	
such revaluations are presented outside 
of	adjusted	results	as	they	do	not	relate	to	
the	underlying	performance	of	the	Group.	
Revaluation	of	liabilities	on	completed	
acquisitions	include	the	revaluation	of	
the	equity	option	liabilities	in	respect	of	
ABEC	and	ITE	Ebseek	(“Fasteners”)	and	the	
revaluation	of	contingent	consideration	in	
respect	of	Gehua	and	Fasteners,	prior	to	the	
settlements	of	these	obligations	in	the	year.
Foreign exchange
As	a	result	of	the	territories	in	which	
we	operate,	we	are	exposed	to	
changes	in	foreign	exchange	rates	and	
significant	movements,	particularly	
in	the	Russian	ruble,	can	have	a	
significant	impact	on	our	results.
Translational FX
Each	month	our	subsidiary	company	
results	are	translated	into	sterling,	
from	the	functional	currencies	of	the	
subsidiary	companies,	on	consolidation,	
using	the	prevailing	foreign	exchange	
rates	for	the	month.	Changes	in	foreign	
exchange	rates	result	in	fluctuations	of	
the	level	of	profits	reported	for	the	Group.	
The	impact	of	the	changes	in	foreign	
exchange	rates	is	included	within	both	
the	statutory	and	adjusted	reported	
results,	within	the	relevant	lines	in	the	
Consolidated	Income	Statement.	To	aid	
comparability	of	trading	results,	when	
presenting	like-for-like	performance	
we	adjust	for	the	impact	of	changes	in	
foreign	exchange	rates	on	translation.
Largely	as	a	result	of	the	strengthening	
of	the	ruble	against	sterling,	the	reported	
results	were	higher	than	in	the	comparative	
period	by	£11.6m	for	revenue	and	
£2.4m	for	headline	profit	before	tax.
Transactional FX
As	well	as	translational	foreign	exchange	
movements	arising	on	consolidation,	the	
Group	results	are	impacted	by	changes	
in	foreign	exchange	rates	within	our	
subsidiary	company	results.	Where	
monetary	transactions	are	entered	into	
in	different	currencies	than	the	functional	
currency	of	the	entity	this	gives	rise	to	
revaluation	gains	and	losses	following	
changes	in	exchange	rates	between	the	
transaction	date,	month	end	and	the	
settlement	date.	Each	revaluation	of	the	
monetary	assets	and	liabilities	held	on	the	
balance	sheet	results	in	gains	and	losses,	
which	are	reported	within	the	Consolidated	
Income	Statement	within	the	‘Foreign	
exchange	gain	on	operating	activities’	line.
The	relative	stability	of	the	ruble	
throughout	2017,	when	compared	to	
2016,	has	contributed	to	the	smaller	gain	
recognised	of	£0.3m	(2016:	£2.0m).	As	
a	result	of	the	Uzbekistan	Government	
removing	the	som	peg	to	the	US	Dollar	in	
September,	a	gain	on	revaluation	of	£0.7m	
arose	in	the	month,	as	a	result	largely	of	
the	US	dollar	debtor	book	held	locally	in	
our	Uzbekistan	subsidiary	companies.
In	order	to	minimise	our	exposure	to	
changes	in	foreign	exchange	rates,	
particularly	on	euro-denominated	
cash	inflows	held	in	sterling	subsidiary	
companies,	which	accounts	for	
approximately	15–20%	of	total	
revenues,	the	Group	takes	out	foreign	
exchange	forward	contracts	to	provide	
certainty	over	the	future	euro	cash	
inflows.	The	gains	and	losses	on	the	
forward	contracts	are	deferred	and	
recognised	within	revenue	at	the	point	
at	which	the	revenue	is	recognised.
In	the	year,	a	loss	of	£0.7m	(2016:	profit	of	
£2.0m)	was	recognised	within	revenue	in	
respect	of	our	forward	contracts,	reflecting	
the	strengthening	of	the	euro	against	
sterling	in	the	year,	naturally	offsetting	the	
benefit	received	from	this	strengthening	
within	our	reported	revenues.
Foreign currency translation reserve
Finally,	our	results	are	impacted	
by	the	translation	of	the	subsidiary	
company	balance	sheets	each	month	
on	consolidation	into	sterling.	A	change	
in	foreign	exchange	rates	gives	rise	
to	a	movement	which	is	recognised	
within	reserves	in	the	foreign	currency	
translation	reserve.	This	is	on	translation	
of	the	company	balance	sheets	of	our	
subsidiary	companies,	which	are	reported	
in	their	functional	currencies	before	being	
translated	into	sterling	on	consolidation,	
at	the	prevailing	period	end	rates.
The	foreign	currency	translation	reserve	
increased	by	£3.0m,	largely	due	to	
the	weakening	of	the	Turkish	lira	and	
the	Uzbekistani	som	against	sterling	
between	the	beginning	and	the	end	of	
the	financial	year.	Due	to	the	considerable	
goodwill	and	intangible	assets	held	in	
Turkey,	as	well	as	the	dollar-denominated	
debtors	in	Uzbekistan,	the	value	of	
the	net	assets	within	the	consolidated	
statement	of	financial	position	have	
reduced.	This	was	offset	to	some	extent	
by	a	strengthening	of	the	ruble	and	
euro	but	these	movements	were	not	of	
sufficient	magnitude	to	prevent	a	loss	
being	recognised	within	equity	reserves.
Share of results of associates and 
joint ventures
Profits	after	taxation	for	the	financial	year	
arising	from	investments	in	joint	ventures	
and	associates	increased	by	£1.5m	to	
£5.1m	(2016:	£3.6m).	Sinostar	(our	50%	
owned	Chinese	joint	venture)	continues	to	
perform	well	whilst	ITEMF	(our	50%	owned	
joint	venture	in	Russia)	has	benefited	
from	the	stabilisation	in	Moscow	and	a	
strengthening	of	the	Russian	ruble.
Finance costs
Statutory	net	finance	costs	are	£1.0m	
(2016:	net	finance	income	of	£1.8m).	
On	a	headline	basis,	after	excluding	
the	revaluations	relating	to	liabilities	
on	completed	acquisitions,	net	finance	
costs	are	£3.1m	(2016:	£3.1m).	These	
represent	the	interest	cost	on	the	Group’s	
borrowings	of	£2.5m	(2016:	£2.4m)	and	
bank	charges	of	£1.3m	(2016:	£1.1m),	net	
of	interest	income	of	£0.7m	(2016:	£0.4m).
Tax charge
A	tax	charge	of	£3.3m	(2016:	£3.1m)	was	
recognised	in	the	year.	Tax	on	associate	and	
joint	venture	profits,	which	is	presented	
within	the	share	of	profit	from	associates	
and	joint	ventures,	was	£1.5m	(2016:	
£1.1m),	reflecting	the	higher	level	of	joint	
venture	profits	discussed	above.	The	total	
tax	charge	was	£4.8m	(2016:	£4.2m).
The	headline	tax	charge	for	the	period	was	
£8.3m	(2016:	£7.1m),	equating	to	a	headline	
effective	tax	rate	of	26%	(2016:	19%).	The	
increase	in	the	tax	rate	was	primarily	due	to	
an	increase	in	withholding	tax	on	dividends	
from	our	Russian	subsidiaries,	following	
the	stabilisation	of	trading	in	Moscow.
Profits attributable to non-controlling 
interests (NCIs)
NCI	profits	for	the	year	were	£1.8m	(2016:	
£2.2m),	down	£0.4m.	In	May	2016	we	
increased	our	interest	in	AOW	to	75%	
and	in	May	2017	to	100%,	reducing	the	
proportion	of	profits	attributable	to	NCI	
for	the	event	that	runs	each	October.	
This	was	offset	by	the	first-time	impact	
of	the	40%	of	ABEC’s	profits	that	were	
pre-acquisition	in	the	prior	year	and	the	
30%	of	the	post-acquisition	profits	from	
the	current	period	acquisition	of	Gehua.

Chief Financial Officer’s  
Statement
continued
Total non-current assets
Goodwill	and	intangible	assets	decreased	
during	the	year	due	to	the	impairments	
recognised	in	the	India,	Turkey	and	AOW	
CGUs,	the	annual	amortisation	charge	
in	respect	of	the	intangible	assets	and	
the	retranslation	of	overseas	balances	to	
Sterling	at	year	end	exchange	rates.	The	
movement	was	offset	to	some	extent	by	the	
acquisition	of	Gehua.	The	intangible	assets	
balance	represents	acquired	customer	
relationships,	trademarks	and	licences,	
visitor	databases	and	computer	software.	
Interests	in	associates	and	joint	ventures	
has	remained	flat,	with	strong	profitability	
in	the	larger	joint	ventures,	particularly	
Sinostar	and	ITEMF,	offset	by	the	payment	
of	dividends	from	these	entities	and	the	
impairment	of	the	Indonesian	joint	venture.
Other	non-current	assets	has	increased	
for	the	most	part	due	to	an	increase	in	
deferred	tax	asset	to	£5.4m	(2016:	£3.1m).
Total current assets
Trade	debtors	increased	compared	to	
the	prior	year	as	a	result	of	the	increase	
in	forward	bookings,	aided	by	our	new	
onsite	rebooking	initiative.	This	contributed	
to	trade	debtors	increasing	by	over	30%	
year-on-year.	Trade	debtor	recoverability	
remains	strong	and	cash	flow	from	
operations	and	cash	collection	have	been	
important	areas	of	focus	over	the	past	year.
Cash	balances	increased	to	£23.3m	
(2016:	£15.5m)	as	a	result	of	earlier	cash	
collection	following	the	onsite	rebooking	
initiative,	reduced	expenditure	on	
acquisitions	compared	to	previous	years	
and	the	strengthening	of	foreign	currencies	
against	Sterling	which	create	unrealised	
gains	when	translated	into	Sterling	on	
consolidation.	This	was	in	part	offset	by	
the	investment	in	TAG	during	the	year.
Other	current	assets,	comprising	
other	debtors,	prepayments	and	
tax	prepayments,	have	remained	
broadly	consistent	year-on-year.
Total liabilities
As	with	trade	debtors,	deferred	
income	grew	considerably	following	
the	introduction	of	our	onsite	
rebooking	initiative,	with	the	balance	
as	at	30	September	2017	being	£82.6m	
(2016:	£61.9m),	up	by	over	30%	year	on	
year.	This	represents	54%	of	the	total	
revenue	recognised	in	2017,	compared	
to	41%	of	the	2017	revenues	being	
contracted	at	this	stage	last	year.
The	bank	loan	balance	of	£73.0m	
(2016:	£74.6m)	is	broadly	flat	year-on-
year.	A	new	loan	facility	agreement	
was	entered	into	subsequent	to	the	
year	end	as	mentioned	previously.
Other	liabilities	decreased	to	£54.3m	(2016:	
£58.2m).	The	decline	is	primarily	in	respect	
of	equity	option	liabilities	and	deferred/
contingent	consideration,	following	the	
exercise	of	the	AOW	put	option	in	May	2017	
and	settlement	of	earn-out	obligations	
in	respect	of	ABEC	and	Fasteners.
Total equity
During	the	year	the	Company	issued	
7,140,601	(2016:	5,166,043)	ordinary	
shares	of	1p.	2,050,102	of	the	total	new	
issues	were	to	shareholders	who	elected	
to	receive	their	dividend	in	the	form	of	
new	ordinary	shares	as	part	of	the	scrip	
dividend	alternative	that	was	made	
available.	The	remaining	shares	issued	
were	consideration	for	the	exercise	of	
options	to	acquire	the	remaining	25%	
stake	in	AOW	(2,791,120)	not	previously	
held	and	the	element	of	the	Gehua	
consideration	settled	in	shares	(2,299,379).	
As	at	30	September	2017	the	Employee	
Share	Ownership	Trust	(ESOT)	held	
2,783,585	(1.0%)	of	the	Company’s	issued	
share	capital	(2016:	2,869,603	(1.1%)).	
The	movement	in	the	translation	
reserve	from	a	debit	balance	of	£42.3m	
to	£45.3m	represents	the	loss	on	the	
year-end	retranslation	of	the	Group’s	
overseas	assets	denominated	in	foreign	
currencies,	as	discussed	above.	This	is	
driven	primarily	by	movements	in	the	
Sterling/Lira	and	Sterling/Som	exchange	
rates.	The	decreases	in	the	put	option	
reserve	and	NCI	were	caused	by	the	
exercise	of	the	AOW	equity	option.	
The	Group’s	ability	to	pay	dividends	is	
secure,	with	distributable	reserves	in	the	
Parent	Company	accounts	of	£16.8m.
Venue arrangements
The	Group	has	long-term	arrangements	
with	its	principal	venues	in	its	main	
markets	setting	out	ITE’s	rights	over	
future	venue	use	and	pricing.
The	arrangements	can	take	the	form	of	a	
prepayment	of	future	venue	fees	(advance	
payment),	or	a	loan	which	can	be	repaid	in	
cash	or	by	offset	against	future	venue	fees	
(venue	loan).	Generally,	the	arrangements	
bring	rights	over	future	venue	use	and	
advantageous	pricing	arrangements	
through	long-term	agreements.	
Venue	advances	and	prepayments	
are	included	in	the	Consolidated	
Statement	of	Financial	Position	under	
non-current	and	current	assets.	
Portfolio management
On	9	December	2016,	the	Group	acquired	
a	70%	holding	in	ITE	Gehua	Exhibitions	
Co	Ltd	(Gehua),	a	company	incorporated	
in	China,	for	total	consideration	of	
£11.7m.	No	put	or	call	options	exist	over	
the	remaining	30%	stake.	The	acquired	
business	has	contributed	£3.0m	to	
Group	revenue	and	a	£1.0m	to	headline	
profit	before	tax	since	acquisition.
During	the	year,	£3.7m	was	paid	in	respect	
of	deferred	and	contingent	consideration	
obligations	in	respect	of	the	acquisitions	of	
ABEC	and	Fasteners	completed	in	previous	
years	and	of	Gehua	in	the	current	period.	
At	30	September	2017	there	remains	
an	outstanding	obligation	of	£1.0m	in	
respect	of	the	acquisition	of	ABEC.
One	equity	option	was	settled	during	the	
year,	in	respect	of	the	remaining	25%	in	
AOW,	discussed	above.	At	30	September	
2017,	equity	options	are	held	over	further	
interests	in	our	subsidiary	companies,	
ABEC,	Fasteners	and	Scoop,	and	our	joint	
venture	companies,	ECMI	and	Debindo.
As	part	of	our	ongoing	focus	
on	Core	events,	37	events	were	
cancelled	in	2017	which	had	in	2016	
contributed	£1.1m	to	Group	revenue	
and	£0.4m	to	headline	profit.
TAG overview
In	May	2017,	we	announced	our	intention	to	
invest	up	to	£20m	in	the	TAG	programme	
over	the	three-year	transformation	period.	
In	2017	we	invested	£5.0m,	comprised	
of	£4.6m	of	one-off	restructuring	costs,	
which	are	presented	within	adjusting	
items,	and	£0.4m	of	capital	expenditure.	
The	restructuring	costs	were	principally	in	
relation	to	the	design	and	implementation	
of	the	Group’s	new	strategy.	The	capital	
expenditure	largely	related	to	building	fit-
for-purpose	IT	infrastructure	and	systems.	
Having	invested	£5.0m	since	May,	we	
anticipate	investing	up	to	£10m	over	the	
coming	financial	year.	The	investment	will	
reflect	the	acceleration	of	our	systems,	
design	and	development	work	over	the	
coming	twelve	months	and	ultimately	
the	introduction	of	the	new	sales	and	
marketing	systems	that	will	help	us	create	
fit-for-purpose	IT	infrastructure	and	
systems.	We	remain	confident	of	delivering	
the	overall	TAG	programme	within	the	
£20m	one-off	investment	indicated.
During	2017,	£2.8m	of	costs	were	included	
within	our	statutory	and	headline	results	
in	relation	to	the	TAG	programme.	These	
represent	costs	that	are	associated	with	the	
TAG	programme,	in	relation	to	the	delivery	
of	the	Group’s	new	strategy,	rather	than	the	
costs	of	designing	and	implementing	the	
strategy.	These	are	costs	that	have	arisen	
following	changes	to	the	way	we	operate	
as	a	result	of	the	TAG	programme	and	are	
expected	to	continue	to	be	incurred	as	the	
Group’s	new	operating	model	becomes	
fully	embedded.	Of	the	£2.8m	incurred	in	
the	year,	£1.9m	was	included	within	cost	of	
sales	(£0.5m	of	which	was	included	within	
central	costs)	and	£0.9m	is	included	within	
overheads	(£0.8m	within	central	costs).	
The	cost	of	sales	represent	costs	incurred	
to date that are direct costs incurred to 
drive	revenue	growth,	to	date	principally	
in	future	periods.	Overhead	costs	are	
ongoing	costs	largely	incurred	in	relation	
to	creating	best	practice	functions	and	
teams	and	building	capability	and	talent.

On	a	like-for-like	basis	volume	sales	in	
Russia	increased	by	9%,	revenues	increased	
by	14%	and	headline	profits	before	tax	
increased	by	17%	from	the	prior	year
Divisional Trading Summary
Russia
During	the	year	ITE	held	96	events	in	
Russia	(2016:	110),	with	total	volume	
sales	of	274,400m
2
	(2016:	256,000m
2
).	
Revenue	of	£71.4m	was	38%	higher	than	
the	previous	year	and	headline	profit	
before	tax	of	£26.3m	was	33%	higher	
than	the	previous	year,	reflecting	early	
TAG	benefits,	stabilisation	of	the	trading	
environment	–	particularly	in	Moscow	–	and	
the	strengthening	of	the	Russian	Ruble.	On	
a	like-for-like	basis	volume	sales	in	Russia	
increased	by	9%,	revenues	increased	
by	14%	and	headline	profits	before	tax	
increased	by	17%	from	the	prior	year.
Moscow	is	ITE’s	largest	office	in	Russia	
with	events	accounting	for	around	
74%	of	the	region’s	revenues.	Volume	
sales	for	the	year	on	Moscow	events	
were	182,300m
2
	(2016:	164,100m
2
);	an	
increase	of	9%	on	a	like-for-like	basis.	
ITE’s	leading	events	in	Moscow	responded	
favourably	to	the	stabilisation	of	the	
trading	environment	and	benefited	
from	management’s	reallocation	of	
resources	to	focus	on	these	events.	
The	Moscow	International	Travel	and	
Tourism	exhibition	(MITT)	which	is	held	
annually	in	March	delivered	sales	of	
13,700m
2
	(2016: 11,700m
2
)	as	the	Russian	
international	tourism	sector	recovered	
confidence	and	relations	between	Turkey	
and	Russia	improved.	In	April,	Mosbuild	
(WorldBuild	Moscow)	saw	volumes	increase	
by	8%	to	34,500m
2
	(2016:	31,800m
2
)	
with	the	growth	being	led	by	domestic	
exhibitors	as	the	construction	sector	in	
Moscow	also	gained	confidence	from	
the	stabilisation	in	the	local	economy.	
The	packaging	event,	Rosupack,	also	
performed	strongly	with	volume	growth	of	
21%	from	9,400m
2
	to	11,400m
2
.	However,	
the	recovery	was	uneven	across	sectors	
with	the	logistics	event	TransRussia	and	
the	security	event	Securika	reporting	flat	
volumes	of	7,400m
2
	(2016:	7,200m
2
)	and	
10,400m
2
	(2016:	10,600m
2
)	respectively.	
The	previously	biennial	Moscow	
International	Oil	&	Gas	Exhibition	(MIOGE)	
annualised	and	changed	venues	to	better	
respond	to	a	competitive	launch	and	
met	expectations	in	delivering	volumes	
of	12,000m
2
	(2015	event:	18,500m
2
).	
WorldFood	Moscow	in	September	
also	grew	volumes	by	5%	to	21,300m
2
 
(2016:	20,200m
2
),	as	both	domestic	
exhibitors	and	international	suppliers	
increased	their	space	requirements.
The	Krasnodar	region	in	south	west	
Russia	is	one	of	the	most	prosperous	
outside	Moscow.	The	Group	is	the	anchor	
tenant	at	the	city’s	exhibition	centre	and	
runs	events	across	a	broad	range	of	
sectors.	The	single	largest	event	is	the	
agriculture	event,	Yugagro,	which	grew	
by	9%	to	31,700m
2
	(2016:	29,000m
2
).	
The	stabilisation	of	the	economic	
environment	in	Moscow	has	not	yet	
spread	to	all	regions.	The	Group’s	
events	in	St	Petersburg	delivered	
overall	volume	sales	of	9,400m
2
	(2016:	
9,500m
2
),	a	like-for-like	decline	of	7%.	
In	Novosibirsk,	Siberia,	ITE	is	the	anchor	
tenant	in	the	city’s	main	venue.	During	the	
year	management	reduced	the	number	
of	events	held	to	22	(2016:	34).	On	a	
like-for-like	basis,	which	excludes	these	
cancellations,	revenue	was	down	1%.

The	Group	benefited	from	another	
strong	performance	by	its	Sinostar	
joint	venture
Divisional Trading Summary
Asia
The	Group’s	operations	in	this	region	
are	based	in	India,	China	and	South	East	
Asia.	During	the	year,	the	Group	ran	35	
(2016:	27)	events	in	the	region.	Overall	the	
Group’s	majority-owned	businesses	in	
the	region	sold	160,000m
2
	in	2017	(2016:	
124,600m
2
),	reflecting	acquisitions	in	China	
offsetting	the	weaker	biennial	pattern	and	
the	challenging	trading	environment	in	
India.	The	Group	benefited	from	another	
strong	performance	by	its	Sinostar	
joint	venture,	which	is	not	included	in	
consolidated	revenues	but	is	included	in	
consolidated	headline	profits	before	tax	
for	the	region.	Therefore,	on	a	like-for-like	
basis,	the	region	reports	a	decrease	of	2%	
in	volumes	and	3%	in	revenues	but	a	16%	
increase	in	headline	profits	before	tax.
The	Group	operates	two	businesses	
in	India:	one	through	a	small	wholly-
owned	subsidiary,	ITE	India,	which	had	
its	weaker	biennial	year	in	2017	and	
the	other	through	ABEC,	India’s	largest	
private	exhibition	organiser	in	which	ITE	
has	a	60%	stake.	ABEC’s	portfolio	of	over	
20	exhibitions	across	different	industry	
sectors	includes	Acetech	–	India’s	leading	
construction	event.	Acetech	Mumbai	
in	October	2016	delivered	27,800m
2
 
(2016:	27,900m
2
),	despite	the	impact	of	
demonetisation,	although	the	impact	on	
the	rest	of	the	ABEC	portfolio	was	more	
pronounced	and	the	business	delivered	
like-for-like	volume	and	revenue	declines	
of	3%	and	4%	respectively,	reflecting	
the	challenges	faced	in	the	market.	
In	China	the	Group	has	offices	in	Beijing,	
Shanghai	and	Guangzhou	and	operates	
(through	its	Hong	Kong	headquartered	
50%	joint	venture	partner	Sinostar)	the	
Chinacoat/Surface	Finishing	China	event.	
The	November	2016	Chinacoat/Surface	
Finishing	China	event	in	Guangzhou	saw	
11%	growth	on	the	equivalent	event	
reporting	record	sales	of	over	37,800m
2
 
with	another	strong	performance	expected	
at	the	November	2017	event.	A	70%	stake	
in	Gehua	was	acquired	in	December	2016.	
It	has	a	small	portfolio	of	events,	of	which	
the	major	event	is	a	Food	event	which	ran	
in	August	2017	for	the	first	time	under	
ITE	ownership,	delivering	20,000m
2
.	The	
Group’s	Fasteners	event,	acquired	in	2016,	
grew	by	10%	to	16,300m
2
	(2016:	14,800m
2
).	
In	South	East	Asia	the	Group	operates	
through	three	organisations	based	
in	Indonesia	and	Malaysia.	In	Jakarta,	
Indonesia,	the	Group	owns	50%	of	PT	
Debindo,	which	runs	the	Indobuildtech	
series	of	construction	exhibitions,	the	
largest	of	which	takes	place	annually	
in	Jakarta.	After	moving	to	the	new	
International	Convention	and	Exhibition	
Centre	last	year	and	growing	to	over	
22,000m
2
,	this	year	the	event	focussed	on	
driving	yield	and	while	volumes	reduced	
slightly	to	18,700m
2
,	the	revenues	increased	
by	over	10%.	In	Kuala	Lumpur,	Malaysia,	the	
Group	owns	100%	of	Tradelink,	which	runs	
the	Metaltech	event,	serving	the	machine	
tool	technology	and	metal	fabrication	
industries.	The	event	takes	place	each	May	
in	Kuala	Lumpur	and	although	volumes	
reduced,	revenues	held	up	despite	local	
economic	uncertainty	impacting	on	the	
industry.	Also	based	in	Kuala	Lumpur	
is	the	Group’s	50%	joint	venture,	ECMI,	
a	pan-ASEAN	organiser	operating	in	
Malaysia,	Indonesia,	Vietnam	and	Myanmar,	
and	focussed	on	the	professional	
beauty	and	life-sciences	sectors.

The	fall	in	the	oil	price	and	the	Russian	
economic	recession	continue	to	have	a	
significant	impact	on	trading	conditions	
within	the	region
Divisional Trading Summary
Central	Asia
ITE’s	principal	offices	in	Central	Asia	are	in	
Kazakhstan,	Azerbaijan	and	Uzbekistan.	All	
of	the	economies	in	this	region	are	heavily	
dependent	on	oil	and	gas	for	their	overseas	
earnings	and	economic	wealth	and	in	the	
case	of	Kazakhstan	a	significant	level	of	
trade	with	Russia	as	well.	The	fall	in	the	oil	
price	and	the	Russian	economic	recession	
continue	to	have	a	significant	impact	on	
trading	conditions	within	the	region.	
This	year	ITE	organised	a	total	of	66	events	
(2016:	74)	across	these	territories	delivering	
total	volume	sales	of	64,000m
2
	(2016:	
70,400m
2
),	revenues	of	£21.7m	(2016:	
£22.0m)	and	headline	profits	before	tax	of	
£6.5m	(2016:	£7.0m).	Overall,	on	a	like-for-
like	basis,	volumes	decreased	by	9%	over	
the	previous	year	with	revenues	increasing	
by	5%	and	headline	profit	before	tax	
increasing	by	7%	as	Dollar	pricing	protected	
revenues	from	currency	fluctuations.	
Kazakhstan	is	the	Group’s	largest	
office	in	the	region,	selling	32,200m
2
 
(2016:	34,400m
2
).	The	largest	event	
in	the	region,	Kazakhstan	Oil	&	Gas	
Exhibition	(KIOGE),	which	took	place	in	
Almaty	in	October	2016,	was	smaller	
than	the	prior	edition	at	3,700m
2
	(2016:	
5,800m
2
).	However,	reflecting	the	
improvement	in	the	environment	during	
the	year,	Mining	World	Central	Asia	held	
in	September	2017	grew	volumes	by

Market
Overview
ITE	is	the	ninth	largest	organiser	by	revenue	
and	has	historically	had	strengths	in	a	
number	of	emerging	markets.	ITE	is	the	
dominant	exhibition	organiser	in	Russia	
and	although	the	Russian	market	has	
been	impacted	by	currency	factors	and	
an	economic	slowdown,	there	are	strong	
drivers	for	growth	in	the	medium	to	long	
term.	These	include	strong	prices,	a	highly	
internationalised	outlook	and	new	venue	
capacity.	ITE’s	position	in	Central	Asian	
markets	is	also	strong,	as	it	is	the	dominant	
international	exhibition	organiser.
The	distribution	of	the	world’s	exhibition	
businesses	highlights	that	developed	
markets	continue	to	account	for	the	
majority	of	the	global	market,	with	the	
US	alone	comprising	over	50%.	Emerging	
markets	have	a	22%	share	of	the	global	
market	(compared	to	circa	15%	six	years	
ago)	and	China	remains	the	second	
largest	exhibition	market	globally	having	
overtaken	Germany	in	2015.	After	a	year	
of	falling	volumes	and	revenues,	Russia,	
Turkey	and	the	CIS	countries	–	ITE’s	historic	
market	areas	–	account	for	approximately	
3%	of	the	global	market,	whilst	Asian	
markets	(China,	India	and	South	East

Governance
Environmental  
Impact
Corporate Social  
Responsibility
As a media services company, the Group 
acknowledges that its business has 
an impact on the environment, albeit 
relatively minor, and ITE follows current 
best practice in each of its markets by 
observing country legislation and leading 
industry practice. The Group is aware that 
this is an area of increasing concern to 
employees, shareholders and customers 
alike. By identifying environmental 
improvements, we expect to see increased 
efficiencies and, with that, reduced costs 
and the management of environmental 
issues is part of our business strategy to 
create long-term value for shareholders. 
Senior management level responsibility
The COO has direct responsibility 
for environmental matters and 
chairs the Environmental Matters 
Committee which monitors the Group’s 
emissions, considers and makes 
recommendations for improvements 
and mitigations of the Group’s 
environmental impact, and commissions 
and reviews external reporting of the 
Group’s environmental impact for 
regulatory or voluntary disclosure. 
The Group’s reporting protocol
The Group recognises that its operations 
have an impact on the environment 
primarily through the GHG (Greenhouse 
Gas) emissions. As a result, the Group 
continues to measure and report its 
material GHG emissions with the aim 
of minimising energy usage, improving 
environmental management across its 
offices and driving efficiencies, which 
in turn is expected to reduce costs and 
create long-term value for shareholders.
The scope of the Group’s reporting 
continues to cover GHG emissions 
at the global level covering all of the 
Group’s subsidiary offices. This is 
consistent with previous years.
Overview
The Board of ITE believes that corporate 
and social responsibility is an important 
part of the Group’s culture and that the 
adoption of good practice will have a 
positive impact on profits and increase 
the long-term value for shareholders. Due 
consideration is given to risks arising from 
social, ethical and environmental issues as 
part of an ongoing risk review process.
Employees 
The Board recognises the importance of 
diversity amongst its employees and is 
committed to ensuring that employees 
are selected and promoted on the 
basis of merit and ability, regardless 
of age, gender, race, religion, sexual 
orientation or disability. The gender split 
across the Group as at 30 September 
2017 is illustrated in the table below:

A global Group-wide biannual performance 
review process was introduced in 2017 
marking a major milestone in our drive to 
develop a high-performing culture and 
support employees’ career development. 
Sponsored training is provided where 
there is a benefit to both the individual 
and the Group and includes custom-
designed leadership and management 
development programmes. In the 
coming year, the Group is committed to 
building on its learning and development 
offering and investing in additional 
training to support the objectives of its 
Transformation and Growth programme.
To raise awareness of how to recognise 
and deal with mental health issues, 
headquarters held its first Wellness Week 
in 2017. This initiative is now expanding 
to include other offices in the Group.
The Group’s GHG Reporting Protocol, 
which was developed with the assistance 
of Carbon Smart, is based on DEFRA 
and World Resource Institute guidelines. 
The Group measures GHG emissions 
based on financial control boundaries 
– so operations which are consolidated 
as subsidiaries in the Group’s financial 
statements have been included in the 
measurement exercise. Associates and 
joint ventures of the Group have not been 
included as the Group does not exercise 
sole control over these operations. As the 
Group does not exercise financial control 
over the properties in which exhibitions 
are held, emissions arising from these 
properties have not been measured.
The Group does not manufacture or sell 
any tangible products and has identified 
the following key activities as being within 
the GHG reporting requirements: 
– Scope 1: Natural gas; Company cars; 
on-site fuel consumption and fugitive 
emissions (i.e. refrigerants). 
– Scope 2: Purchased electricity and heat 
and steam. 
At present, Scope 3 activities (e.g. 
business travel; waste; freight shipping) 
are excluded from the reporting scope. It 
is believed that at present the quality of 
the data would not be sufficiently robust 
for accurate reporting in these areas.
All senior staff are eligible to receive 
share options or awards under the 
Employee’s Performance Share Plan 
as the Board feels that it is important 
for them to take an active part in the 
success of the Group and to share in the 
long-term value they help to create.
The Board recognises the need to provide 
a safe working environment for employees, 
exhibitors and visitors at the Group’s 
events. Each office is responsible for 
ensuring that their business operates in 
compliance with Group policies and the 
relevant local health and safety legislation. 
Employees receive health and safety 
training appropriate to their role. Staff from 
all regions with lead responsibility for the 
operation of the Group’s exhibitions on-
site also attend regular training courses.
Social interaction
The Board is aware of both the benefits to 
its business of engaging with its various 
constituencies in a socially-responsible 
manner and the risks of failing to do so. 
As an operator of internationally-focussed 
businesses in emerging markets, the Group 
ensures that it is culturally sensitive in its 
dealings with the local community and 
that its employment and development 
policies are non-discriminatory and 
encourage the employment of local 
nationals at all levels in the Group. 
The Group actively supports its 
employees in their support of local 
community projects. Charitable 
donations across the Group totalled 
£25,292 in 2017 (2016: £27,240).
The Group has a strong record of 
supporting local charities in the countries 
in which it operates, particularly those 
which work to benefit children. During 
2017 this has continued to include 
providing direct financial funding as 
well as providing volunteers to assist 
on specific projects and workshops. 
Measurement of environmental impact 
in 2017
The Group has identified GHG emissions 
per employee as the most appropriate 
KPI. To measure this the Group collected 
data on a Group-wide basis from most 
of its offices on the activities identified 
for the year ended 30 April 2017. 
Results from similar offices have been 
extrapolated based on the number of 
employees to estimate total emissions. 
In some offices, where electricity and 
heat charges are included in office rental 
cost and the information is not provided 
by office landlords, an estimate has 
been calculated based on similar offices’ 
usage and office floor space data.
When compared to prior years the Group is 
pleased that it was able to reduce its total 
GHG emissions from 1,070 tonnes of CO
2
e 
to 1,021 tonnes of CO
2
e, largely as a result 
of a reduction in district heat emissions 
and electricity consumption. The Group’s 
emissions per staff member have also 
decreased from 0.86CO
2
e to 0.75CO
2
e. 
Over the next three years the Group 
will target to reduce its GHG emissions 
by 10% (excluding the impact of 
new UK conversion factors which 
are outside Group management’s 
direct control and acquisitions). 
In the UK, a fundraising campaign raised 
nearly £1,800 for Salusbury World, a 
charity local to ITE’s London headquarters 
that supports refugee and migrant 
children and families. A further £800 was 
raised for Red Nose Day, a nationwide 
fundraising event held by the charity 
Comic Relief, which works to alleviate 
poverty in the UK and around the world.
In Russia, our Moscow office held a 
collection of unwanted clothes, shoes, 
and accessories to be donated to those 
in need. More than 800 items of clothing 
were collected, with just under half sent 
to provide humanitarian aid and the 
rest either sorted and processed for 
textile recycling or selected for sale at 
one of three charity shops. The Moscow 
office also held a ‘Small Change, Big 
Difference’ charity event to fundraise 
for the Life Line Foundation, which 
provides treatment for sick children.
In China, the Beijing office took part in a 
charity sale and benefit concert for Alanah’s 
Home organised by China Children’s Hope 
Foundation. Staff contributed toys, plants, 
flowers, kitchenware and school supplies.
In Azerbaijan, the local office continued its 
close ties with Anglo-Azerbaijani Society 
by sponsoring a charity concert and 
dinner in aid of United Aid for Azerbaijan 
(UAFA), raising vital funds to maintain 
their work with children from the Saray 
and Shagan children’s homes. ITECA 
Caspian also became a partner for the 
BİR student volunteering programme in 
recognition of its active support for the 
volunteer movement in the country.
It is the Group’s aim to develop a 
global giving initiative linking charitable 
efforts across all offices in 2018.

Ethics and human rights issues
Integrity is core to the Group’s values 
which it actively promotes in its dealings 
with employees, shareholders, customers 
and suppliers and with the authorities 
of the countries in which it operates. 
The Group recognises that reputation 
is a valuable and fragile asset gained 
over a substantial period of time and is 
committed to good practice in respect 
of human rights. The leadership position 
of the Group’s exhibitions and the 
long-term growth of its core shows is a 
testament to the success of its practices.
All ITE staff are required to comply with the 
laws and regulations of the country in which 
the Group operates and with the Group’s 
Human Rights Policy. The Group promotes 
high ethical standards in carrying out its 
business activities and has clear guidelines 
for dealing with gifts, hospitality, corruption, 
fraud and the use of inside information. 
These, together with the Human Rights 
Policy, are made available to all staff.
The UK Bribery Act places obligations 
on the Group and senior management. 
Key management are required to 
complete an e-learning course, designed 
to train and test the individuals on the 
UK Bribery Act. The course covers the 
requirements of the Bribery Act along 
with example scenarios and implications 
of Act breaches. It is the Group’s intention 
during the coming year to review and, 
where appropriate, refresh its policies in 
the area of Anti-Bribery and Corruption.
The Group is a member of UFI (the 
Worldwide Exhibition Organisers 
Association) and through this, the 
attendance figures at our key exhibitions 
are audited by independent bodies. 
This helps to provide assurance to 
our exhibitors and visitors as to the 
standard of our exhibitions.
The Group aims to provide a high 
quality of service at all its events in all 
locations. The Group maintains strict 
minimum quality levels to ensure 
events are provided to exhibitors and 
visitors at appropriate standards, 
irrespective of where they are held.
The Group ensures that all advertising 
and public communications avoid 
untruths or overstatements.
ITE builds a relationship with 
suppliers based on mutual trust and 
undertakes to pay suppliers on time 
and in accordance with agreed terms of 
business. All information regarding the 
relationship between the Group and a 
supplier must remain confidential.

The Company is committed to high 
standards of corporate governance and 
supports the principles laid down in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code issued 
by the Financial Reporting Council in 
September 2012 (the Code). This statement 
describes how the principles of the Code 
are applied and reports on the Company’s 
compliance with the Code’s provisions. 
The Board considers that the Company 
has been in compliance with all the 
principles and provisions of the Code 
throughout the year ended 30 September 
2017 and to the date of this report. 
The Board
The Board of Directors (the Board) 
currently has six members, comprising of 
the Non-executive Chairman, the Chief 
Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer 
and three independent Non-executive 
Directors. There were two changes to 
the membership of the Board during the 
financial year. Firstly, Andrew Beach joined 
the Board as Chief Financial Officer on 
17 October 2016. Secondly, Marco Sodi 
resigned as Chairman on 13 July 2017 and 
retired from the Board on 11 October 2017. 
Neil England was appointed as Chairman on 
13 July 2017 and will serve in that role whilst 
the Board searches for a new Chairman. 
All of the Directors bring strong 
judgement to the Board’s deliberations. 
During the year the Board has been 
of sufficient size and diversity that 
the balance of skills and experience 
was considered to be appropriate for 
the requirements of the business. 
The Non-executive Directors, including 
the Chairman, are all independent of 
management and free from any business 
or other relationship, including those 
relationships and circumstances referred 
to in provision B.1.1 of the Code that could 
materially interfere with the exercise of 
independent and objective judgement. 
The Company considered that Marco Sodi 
was independent on his appointment 
as Chairman. Neil England had served 
for more than nine years when he was 
appointed as Chairman, however the 
Board believe he is the most appropriate 
member of the Board to chair the Company 
whilst a permanent successor is found. 
Role of the Board
The Board has overall responsibility to 
shareholders for the proper management 
of the Company. It met eight times during 
the financial year. It has a formal schedule 
of matters reserved to it for decision 
making, including responsibility for the 
overall management and performance 
of the Group. This includes development 
and approval of its strategy; long-term 
objectives and commercial initiatives; 
approval of annual and interim results; 
annual budgets; material acquisitions 
and disposals; material agreements and 
major capital commitments; approval 
of treasury policies and assessment 
of its going concern position. Board 
discussions are held in an open and 
collaborative atmosphere with sufficient 
time allowed for debate and challenge.
Board members receive appropriate 
documentation in advance of each Board 
or Committee meeting, which normally 
includes a formal agenda, a detailed report 
on current trading and full papers on 
matters where the Board will be required 
to make a decision or give approval. 
Updates from the Board Committees are 
also received at Board meetings. Board 
papers are delivered through an electronic 
platform, improving the efficiency of its 
communications and reducing paper usage.
There is an established procedure for the 
preparation and review, at least annually, 
by the Board of medium-term plans and 
the annual budget. Management accounts 
are circulated to the Board on a monthly 
basis and business performance and 
any significant variances to budget are 
formally reviewed at scheduled Board 
meetings. All major investment decisions 
are subject to post-completion reviews.
During the year the Chairman met with 
the Non-executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors present. The Non-
executive Directors also met without the 
Chairman or Executive Directors present.
The Directors
The biographical details of the Board 
members are set out on page 37. 
All of the Directors have occupied, or 
occupy, senior positions in UK and/
or international listed companies and 
have substantial experience in business. 
At all times at least half the Board, 
excluding the Chairman, has comprised 
independent Non-executive Directors. 
The Non-executive Directors were all 
appointed for an initial three-year term and 
(in common with the Executive Directors) 
are subject to re-election each year by 
shareholders at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting (AGM), and, as set out 
in the Code, the Board continues to be 
satisfied that they remain independent. 
At the AGM on 25 January 2018 all of the 
Directors will once again offer themselves 
for re-election in compliance with Code 
provision B.7.1. The Board believes that all 
of the Directors continue to be appropriate 
and effective in their role, and believes that 
the Company and its shareholders should 
support their re-election at the AGM. 
The Non-executive Directors do not 
participate in any of the Group’s pension 
schemes or in any of the Group’s bonus, 
share option or other incentive schemes.
The Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
The different roles of the Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer are 
acknowledged. A responsibility statement 
for each of those roles has been 
agreed and adopted by the Board. 
Senior Independent  
Non-executive Director
Linda Jensen was appointed as the 
Company’s Senior Independent Non-
executive Director (SID) in 2014. Her 
responsibilities include being available 
to liaise with shareholders who have 
concerns which are not able to be 
resolved through the normal channels, 
being a sounding board for the Chairman 
and leading the annual performance 
evaluation of the Chairman.
Board effectiveness review
The formal annual review of the 
performance of the Board, its Committees 
and the Directors was carried out during 
the year. This year the process consisted 
of an internally run exercise led by the 
Chairman and assisted by the Company 
Secretary. The appraisal questionnaire used 
as part of the process was wide ranging and 
included questions covering both Board 
and Committee performance. Individual 
performance was reviewed by the Chairman, 
who in turn, was appraised by the Senior 
Independent Director after consultation 
with both the other Non-executive 
Directors and the Executive Directors.  Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Governance
The appraisal confirmed that the Board 
and its Committees were operating 
effectively. The feedback was discussed 
with the Board and the Chairman. It was 
agreed that steps would be taken to 
strengthen the Non-executive team, once 
the new Chairman has been appointed, 
to ensure a correct balance of skills and 
abilities is maintained on the Board. 
Support and advice
The Board has access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary, who 
is responsible for ensuring that all Board 
procedures have been complied with. 
The Board has approved a procedure 
for all Directors to take independent 
legal and financial professional advice at 
the Company’s expense, if required to 
support the performance of their duties as 
Directors of the Company. No such advice 
was sought by any Director during the year. 
Training and development
An induction programme is arranged for 
newly-appointed Directors, which includes 
presentations on the business, current 
strategy and shareholder expectations. 
Guidance is also given on the duties, 
responsibilities and liabilities of a Director 
of a listed company and key Board policies 
and procedures. Business familiarisation 
involves Directors visiting exhibitions in 
markets in which the Group operates 
to gain a greater understanding of the 
Group’s activities and to meet senior 
managers throughout the business. 
Every Director has access to training as 
required and is encouraged to continue his or 
her own professional development through 
attendance at seminars and briefings. 
Conflicts of interest 
The Company’s Articles of Association, in 
line with the Companies Act 2006, allow the 
Board to authorise potential conflicts of 
interest that may arise and impose limits or 
conditions, as appropriate. The Company 
has established a procedure whereby 
any decision of the Board to authorise a 
conflict of interest is only effective if it is 
agreed without the conflicted Director(s) 
voting or without their votes being counted. 
In making such a decision, as always, 
the Directors must act in a way they 
consider in good faith will be most likely 
to promote the success of the Company. 
Board Committees 
There are a number of standing Committees of the Board to which various matters are 
delegated. They all have formal Terms of Reference approved by the Board which are 
available on the Group’s website (www.ite-exhibitions.com). The Committee reports are 
set out on pages 46 to 76.

Shareholder relations 
The Company is committed to ongoing engagement with shareholders and has an 
established cycle of communication based on the Group’s financial reporting calendar. 
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have dialogue with institutional 
shareholders and general presentations are given to analysts and investors covering the 
annual and interim results. The Board also received institutional and analysts’ feedback 
following both the interim and annual results roadshows. All shareholders will have the 
opportunity to ask questions at the Company’s AGM on 25 January 2018. At the AGM, the 
Chairman will give a statement on current trading conditions. The Chairmen of the 
Nomination, Remuneration, Audit and Risk Committees will be available to answer 
questions at the AGM. In addition, the Group’s website containing published information 
and press releases can be found at www.ite-exhibitions.com. 
The Strategic report set out on pages 1 to 35 details the financial performance of the 
Company. The key risks and uncertainties the Company identifies and monitors are laid out 
in the Risk Committee Report on pages 50 to 51. 
Whistleblowing arrangements
The Company has a policy which enables and encourages employees to report in 
confidence any possible improprieties in either financial reporting or other matters.
ASB guidance on narrative reporting
The Company considers that it is in compliance with the additional guidance on narrative 
reporting for UK companies published by the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) in January 
2008.
Anti-Corruption Policy and Modern Slavery Act 2015
As part of ITE’s commitment to preventing bribery and establishing a culture that does not 
tolerate corruption wherever and in whatever form it may be encountered, a formal 
Anti-Corruption Policy was approved by the Board in 2011 (and updated in 2017) and 
appropriate procedures put in place, in line with guidance provided by the Ministry of 
Justice to ensure compliance with current legislation and the Company’s policy and related 
procedures. The Group has considered the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and confirms to the 
best of its knowledge that there is no slavery or human trafficking within its supply chain.
The Directors have pleasure in submitting 
their Report and the audited financial 
statements for the year ended 
30 September 2017.
Principal activities and review of the 
business
The principal activities of the Group 
comprise the organisation of trade 
exhibitions and conferences. 
The main subsidiary and associate 
undertakings which affect the profits 
or net assets of the Group in the year 
are listed in note 18 to the financial 
statements of the Company and note 5 to 
the financial statements of the Group.
Details of the Group’s performance 
during the year and expected future 
developments are contained in the Chief 
Executive Officer’s Statement on pages 
8 to 13, the Chief Financial Officer’s 
Statement on pages 18 to 25, and in 
the Divisional Trading Summaries on 
pages 26 to 35. Details of the Group’s 
financial risk management policies 
are contained on pages 50 to 55.
Results and dividends
The audited accounts for the year ended 
30 September 2017 are set out on pages 
86 to 92. The Group loss for the year, after 
taxation, was £6.4m (2016: loss of £7.2m).
The Directors recommend a final dividend 
of 2.5p (2016: 3.0p). The total dividend 
for the year, including the proposed 
final dividend, is 4.0p (2016: 4.5p).
The Company operates a SCRIP Dividend 
Programme, which is available to the 
holders of ordinary shares in the capital 
of the Company from time to time. The 
Programme was approved at the Annual 
General Meeting held in 2016, and allows 
participants to receive ordinary shares in 
the capital of the Company for every cash 
dividend entitlement where the SCRIP is 
offered. The Directors retain the discretion 
Directors’  
Report
Corporate Governance  
Report
continued
to decide whether to offer a SCRIP dividend 
alternative in respect of each future 
dividend. The Board believes that, for those 
shareholders who would like to choose to 
take their dividend in shares rather than 
cash, the SCRIP Dividend Programme is an 
attractive alternative as UK shareholders 
who elect to take new shares in the 
Company under the Programme are able 
to increase their holdings without incurring 
stamp duty. It is the Directors’ current 
intention to offer the SCRIP alternative for 
each dividend paid. The full Terms and 
Conditions of the Programme is available 
on our website at www.ite-exhibitions.
com or from our Registrars, Equiniti. 
Capital structure
Details of the Company’s issued share 
capital and movements during the year 
are shown in note 9 to the financial 
statements of the Company. The Company 
has one class of ordinary shares which 
carry no right to fixed income. Each 
share carries the right to one vote at 
general meetings of the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on 
the size of a holding or on the transfer 
of shares, which are both governed by 
the general provisions of the Articles of 
Association and prevailing legislation. The 
Directors are not aware of any agreements 
between holders of the Company’s 
shares that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or on voting 
rights. No person has any special rights 
of control over the Company’s share 
capital and all shares are fully paid.
Details of employee share schemes are set 
out in note 28 to the financial statements 
of the Group. The Trustee of the ITE Group 
Share Trust is not permitted to vote on 
any unvested shares held in the Trust 
unless expressly directed to do so by the 
Company. A dividend waiver is in place in 
respect of the Trustee’s holding, apart from 
the shares which are held in the Trust as 
part of the Directors’ Deferred Bonus Plan. 
There are a number of agreements that 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control of the Company such 
as commercial contracts, bank facility 
agreements, property lease arrangements 
and employee share plans. None of these 
are considered to be significant in terms 
of their likely impact on the business of 
the Group as a whole. Furthermore, the 
Directors are not aware of any agreements 
between the Company and its Directors 
or employees that provide compensation 
for loss of office or employment that 
occurs because of a takeover bid.
Articles of Association 
The Company’s Articles of Association may 
be amended by a special resolution at a 
general meeting of the shareholders.

Authority to purchase the Company’s 
shares
At the AGM on 26 January 2017, 
shareholders authorised the Company 
to make one or more market purchases 
of up to 26,213,967 of the Company’s 
ordinary shares to be held in treasury at a 
price between 1p (exclusive of expenses) 
and 105% of the average closing middle 
market price of a share for the five business 
days immediately preceding the date 
on which the shares are purchased. 
No purchases were made during the year 
and the Directors propose to renew this 
authority at the 2018 AGM.
Charitable and political donations
The Group made £25,292 of charitable 
donations (2016: £27,240) during the year. 
No political donations were made 
(2016: £nil).
Employees
The Group’s human resources strategy 
is to attract and retain talented, high-
calibre employees focussed on achieving 
excellent results. The Remuneration Policy 
is designed to help achieve this aim.
The Group places great importance on 
the development of its staff to support the 
business in meeting its objectives. This is 
reflected in the training initiatives in place 
for staff, both internally and externally. 
The Group keeps employees informed on 
matters affecting them and on matters 
affecting the Group’s performance through 
emails, announcements, intranet, regular 
newsletters and through meetings, both 
formal and informal. Employees are able 
and are encouraged to move around 
the Group in order to experience the 
business environment in other offices. 
The Group actively encourages the 
participation of employees in activities of 
offices other than their own. The Group 
distributes long-term incentives widely to 
senior staff in all offices. At 30 September 
2017 approximately 41% of staff held 
long-term incentives in some form. As a 
result, the Group’s employees identify 
strongly with ITE’s overall objectives. 
It is the Group’s policy to consider fully 
applications for employment from anyone 
qualified to apply, regardless of their status, 
disability, age, gender, sexual orientation 
or belief. Subsequently, opportunities for 
advancement and development will be 
offered on merit and regardless of the 
factors noted above. The Group has family-
friendly policies for those with children and 
in the event of a member of staff becoming 
disabled, every effort would be made to 
ensure their continued employment and 
progression in the Group. It is Group policy 
that training, career development and 
promotion of disabled employees match 
that of other employees as far as possible.
Supplier payment policy
The Company’s policy, which is also applied 
to the Group, is to agree payment terms 
with suppliers when entering into each 
transaction to ensure that suppliers are 
made aware of the terms of payment 
and abide by the terms of payment. ITE 
Group plc has no trade creditors. Trade 
creditors of the Group (consolidated) 
at 30 September 2017 were equivalent 
to 9.8 days (2016: 9.9 days) purchases, 
based on the average daily amount 
invoiced by suppliers during the year.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Information on the Company’s 
greenhouse gas emissions is set out 
in the Environmental Impact section 
of the Annual Report on page 38.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice convening the AGM to be 
held at 12 noon on 25 January 2018 is 
contained in a circular sent to shareholders 
at the same time as this report. 
Auditors
Deloitte LLP have expressed their 
willingness to continue in office. A 
resolution to reappoint them as the 
Company’s auditors and to authorise the 
Directors to determine their remuneration 
will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM. 
Fair, balanced and understandable 
statement
Each of the Directors considers that 
the Annual Report taken as a whole is 
fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of 
information to auditors
Each Director of the Company at the date 
when this Report was approved confirms:
– so far as he/she is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information (as defined by 
the Companies Act 2006) of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
– he/she has taken all the steps that he/
she ought to have taken as a Director to 
make himself/herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given in accordance 
with section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Going concern and viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
2014 revision of the Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors have assessed the 
prospect of the Group over both a one and 
a three-year period. The one-year period 
has a greater level of certainty and is, 
therefore, used to set detailed budgetary 
targets at all levels across the Group. The 
three-year period offers less certainty 
but is aligned with the Board’s periodic 
strategic review, as well as the long-term 
incentives offered to management.
The Directors’ assessment considered 
a range of factors, including the Group’s 
expected trading performance based on 
approved budgets, risk-adjusted where 
appropriate, and the resulting cash flows, 
covenant compliance and other key ratios 
over the period. These metrics are subject 
to sensitivity analysis which evaluates 
the potential impact of the Group’s 
principal risks, as disclosed in the Risk 
Committee Report. The Group operates in 
territories that can be unpredictable and 
unexpected geopolitical and economic 
events such as acts of terrorism, sanctions, 
currency controls and exchange rate 
movements can have an impact on the 
Group’s reported trading performance. 
A significant deterioration in trading from 
the major markets (notably Russia and 
Turkey) could impact on certain banking 
covenants. However, the refinancing 
referred to on page 20 increases headroom 
and significantly reduces this risk. There 
are also a range of mitigating actions 
available and within the Group’s control. 
However, the Directors have a range of 
mitigating actions available and within 
their control. As the Group continues 
to implement the TAG programme, the 
appropriate funding arrangements 
for the Group will be considered.
Directors’  
Report
continued
On the basis of this and other matters 
considered and reviewed by the Board 
during the year, the Board has reasonable 
expectations that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the periods 
used for the assessment. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. 
In doing so, it is recognised that such 
future assessments are subject to a level 
of uncertainty that increases with time 
and, therefore, future outcomes cannot be 
guaranteed or predicted with certainty.

Governance
The Audit Committee (the Committee) was 
in place throughout the financial year and 
is chaired by Stephen Puckett. The Board 
considers that Stephen has the appropriate 
financial expertise, as required by Principle 
C3.1 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code), as Stephen is a Chartered 
Accountant, has held executive roles in 
financial positions in other companies, 
and chairs other listed companies’ Audit 
Committees. All members of the Committee 
are independent Non-executive Directors 
and they are considered to provide a 
wide range of international, financial and 
commercial expertise necessary to fulfil 
the Committee’s duties. Members of the 
Committee are appointed by the Board, on 
the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee in consultation with the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, for an 
initial period of three years, which can then 
be followed by an additional two further 
three-year periods. During the financial 
year all Committee members played an 
active role in all Committee meetings 
held throughout the year. During the 
year Linda Jensen joined the Committee. 
There were no other changes during the 
year to membership of the Committee.
The Chief Financial Officer is invited 
to attend meetings, unless he has a 
conflict of interest. The External Audit 
Partner, the Financial Controller and 
the Company Secretary are also invited 
to attend the Committee’s meetings, 
providing there is no conflict of interest. 
Other relevant people from the 
business were also invited to attend 
certain meetings or parts of meetings 
to provide a deeper level of insight into 
certain key issues and developments. 
To maximise effectiveness, meetings of 
the Committee generally take place just 
prior to a Company Board meeting. The 
Chairman of the Committee reports to 
the Board, as part of a separate agenda 
item, on the activity of the Committee 
and matters of particular relevance to 
the Board in the conduct of their work.
The Chairman of the Committee 
has also held individual meetings 
with the Chief Financial Officer and 
the External Audit Partner.
Terms of Reference
The Audit Committee’s Terms of Reference 
are available on the Group’s website (www.
ite-exhibitions.com) or can be obtained 
from the Company Secretary. The Terms 
of Reference are reviewed annually and 
presented to the Board for approval.

Audit Committee  
Report
Activities during the financial year 
Each of the Committee meetings held 
during the year has a particular specific 
focus. This year’s meetings focussed on: 
– the management letter from the external 
auditor following the prior year’s audit;
– the review of the external auditor’s 
interim review work and the interim 
financial statements;
– the external audit plan;
– the key areas of focus in advance of the 
commencement of the year-end audit;
– an update on the progress of the 
external audit, the results of the 
external audit and review of the annual 
financial statements and associated 
investor presentations.
During the year, the Committee 
focussed on the following areas:
– Alternative performance measures and 
ensuring an appropriate balance 
between the prominence given to 
statutory and headline results;
– Increasing the transparency of the 
alternative performance measures 
presented and reviewing the 
refinements made to the like-for-like 
definition presented;
– Adjusting items, in particular the 
inclusion of restructuring costs as an 
adjusting item in the year, and the 
appropriateness of the treatment and 
presentation of the costs incurred in 
developing and implementing the TAG 
programme;
– Changes made to the reportable 
segments and in particular the inclusion 
of Brands as a separate operating 
segment;
– The appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as 
internal auditor;
– The external auditor effectiveness review;
– Independent tax reviews; and
– An assessment of the appropriateness 
of the going concern and long-term 
viability statements.
In addition, every meeting reviews 
summaries of the latest internal 
audit reports, the update of the risk 
assessment, and any correspondence 
received by the Board which falls 
within the Committee’s remit.
In assessing the appropriateness of the 
financial statements the Committee 
concentrated on the following significant 
audit risks, which were agreed with Deloitte 
in advance of the audit and were the focus 
of their audit and on which the Committee 
received written reports from management 
and Deloitte as part of the audit process:
–  Impairment of goodwill, intangible 
assets and investments which involves 
measuring the carrying value of 
goodwill, intangible assets and 
investments against the value in use of 
each of the cash-generating units (CGUs) 
and investments. There are a number of 
judgements and estimates to consider 
in the valuation in use calculations, 
principally regarding the forecast cash 
flows, the discount rates used and the 
growth rates applied. Forecast cash 
flows are based on Board-approved 
budgets and plans. Discount rates are 
selected to reflect the risk-adjusted cost 
of capital for the respective territory. 
Growth rates reflect management’s view 
of the long-term forecast rates of 
growth (using third party sources such 
as the International Monetary Fund). In 
the year, impairment charges were 
recognised in respect of the India, 
Turkey, and Africa Oil Week (AOW) CGUs 
and the investment in the Indonesian 
joint venture. The Committee 
considered closely the recent trading 
improvements at the CGUs, the 
increased allocation of central costs 
following the move to a more centralised 
operating model and refinements to the 
discount rate methodology made in the 
year. The Committee agreed on the 
impairments in respect of the India, 
Turkey, and AOW CGUs and the 
Indonesian joint venture.
– Taxation which involves ensuring that 
that there is appropriate support for the 
key assumptions in the tax provisions, 
that deferred tax assets are deemed 
recoverable, and that provisions for 
international tax exposures are 
appropriate.  
 
 As the Group operates and derives 
profits from a range of international 
markets, it is subject to tax in a number 
of territories. Developments in 
international tax legislation in the period 
have been considered and 
management’s assessment of the 
impact of those developments on the 
Group presented to the Committee. 
Consideration has been given to the 
provisions held in respect of potential 
challenge to historical arrangements, in 
light of changes to tax rules and recent 
challenges made by tax authorities in 
the markets in which the Group 
operates. Where unused tax losses are 
available for offset against future profits, 
the appropriateness of future profit 
projections has been considered. The 
Committee agreed on the 
appropriateness of the tax provisions 
and deferred tax assets recognised. 
Internal control and risk management
The Group has a formal process 
of internal audit. During the year, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) were 
appointed to run the Group’s internal audit 
programme. PwC perform audits on a 
rolling basis across the Group’s operating 
units. The reports are made available in 
summary form to the Committee and 
in detailed form to the Chief Financial 
Officer, the Company Secretary, relevant 
operating management and the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The Committee reviews the reports 
and considers progress against the 
recommendations. The Group operates 
across a number of territories and the 
role of internal audit and the follow-
up process on the findings in internal 
reports are important parts of the 
Group’s overall control environment.
The effectiveness of the internal 
control process is assessed throughout 
the year through discussions with 
local management teams and others 
involved in the process. The Committee 
believes that the current internal audit 
process is operating effectively.
The Group’s risk management process 
is covered in detail in the report of the 
Risk Committee on pages 49 to 53.
The role and responsibilities of the 
Committee
The Audit Committee meets at least 
three times a year and as and when 
required. The Committee is responsible 
for monitoring the integrity of the financial 
statements of the Company, and for 
providing effective corporate governance 
over the appropriateness of the Group’s 
financial reporting. The Committee works 
closely with the Risk Committee and this 
ensures effective and sufficient coverage 
of financial reporting risks within the 
Group’s risk management processes.
Individual members of the Committee 
have visited a range of the Group’s offices 
and shows, and held meetings with local 
staff and, where appropriate, followed 
up on matters previously identified 
by external and internal audits.
Specific Committee responsibilities include:
– reviewing the financial results 
announcements and financial statements 
and monitoring compliance with relevant 
statutory and listing requirements;
– reporting to the Board on the 
appropriateness of the accounting 
policies and practices including critical 
accounting policies and practices;
– advising the Board on whether the 
Committee believes the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy;
– overseeing the relationship with the 
external auditor, advising the Board on 
the appointment of the external auditor, 
agreeing their audit scope and audit 
fees and assessing the effectiveness of 
the external audit process;
– considering and making recommendations 
to the Board on the nature and extent of 
the significant risks to which the Group is 
exposed and monitoring management’s 
mitigation plans;
– reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal controls and assessing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
audit process; and
– monitoring the Group’s whistleblowing, 
bribery prevention and fraud detection 
processes. Financial statements Governance Strategic report

External audit
The effectiveness of the external audit 
process is dependent on appropriate 
audit risk identification at the start of 
the audit cycle. A detailed audit plan is 
received from Deloitte, which sets out 
the key risks identified. For the financial 
year ended 30 September 2017, the 
primary risks were as set out on page 47.
Deloitte provided the Committee with 
their views on these issues at the 
Committee meeting held to consider the 
financial statements. In addition they 
provided the Committee with details 
of any identified matters greater than 
£55,000 and any other adjustments 
that were qualitatively significant which 
management had not corrected on 
the basis that the matters were not, 
individually or in aggregate, material.
Private meetings were held with 
Deloitte at both of the Audit Committee 
meetings which considered the financial 
statements (in November and May) 
to provide additional opportunity for 
open dialogue and feedback from the 
Committee and the auditors without 
management being present. Matters 
discussed were the preparedness and 
efficiency of management with respect to 
the audit, the strengths and any perceived 
weaknesses of the financial management 
team, confirmation that no restriction 
on scope had been placed on them by 
management and how they had exercised 
professional judgement. The Chairman 
of the Committee also meets with the 
external audit partner outside the formal 
Committee process through the year.
The effectiveness of the 2016 external 
audit process was formally assessed 
by the Committee at the beginning 
of 2017. Feedback was sought from 
various participants in the process 
(Audit Committee members, Executive 
Directors, members of the finance 
team and management of subsidiary 
units). The effectiveness of the audit 
partner, the audit team, their approach 
to audits, including planning and 
execution, communication, support and 
value were assessed and discussed.
Overall, the effectiveness of the 
external audit process was assessed 
to be performing as expected.
Appointment and independence of the 
external auditor
The Committee considers the 
reappointment of the external auditor, 
including the rotation of the Audit 
Partner, each year and also assesses their 
independence on an ongoing basis. The 
external auditor are required to rotate the 
Audit Partner responsible for the Group 
audit every five years. Mark Lee-Amies, 
the current Audit Partner, was appointed 
in 2013 and therefore 2017 is his final year 
end as Audit Partner. For 2018, Rob Knight 
has been appointed and was invited to the 
latest Audit Committee meeting to ensure 
a smooth and orderly transition. He was 
selected from a shortlist of three suitable 
and available partner candidates provided 
by Deloitte LLP, following interviews 
conducted separately by the Chief Financial 
Officer and the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. The Committee reviewed 
and endorsed their recommendation.
Deloitte LLP were first appointed by the 
Company in 2002. Whilst the Group has 
not formally tendered for the audit since 
then, the Committee has undertaken a 
review of the objectivity and effectiveness 
of the audit process each year. When 
considering the suitability of the external 
auditors, the Committee takes account 
of the ability of the auditors to deliver an 
audit across the geographies in which the 
Group operates. In addition, considerable 
importance is placed on the findings set 
out in the Public Report on the most recent 
inspections of Deloitte carried out by the 
Financial Reporting Council’s Audit Quality 
Review Team and their reports on all other 
auditors in its sample. The Committee 
notes the consistently good assessment 
of Deloitte against its peers. When 
considering suitable external auditors, 
the Committee also takes account of the 
ability of the auditors to add value through 
observations from the audit process and 
their interactions with management.
The Committee is cognisant of its 
responsibility under the revised Code 
to tender the audit every ten years and 
notes that this period can be extended 
to coincide with the period ending the 
current engagement partner’s rotation 
if longer. Under transition rules set out 
in the Competition & Markets Authority 
(CMA) final order in response to recent EU 
regulations, the Group has to mandatorily 
tender the audit by the Annual General 
Meeting held after 17 June 2023. The 
Committee will, nevertheless, review 
on an annual basis whether a tender 
process should be conducted sooner. 
For the year ending 30 September 
2018, the Committee has provided to 
the Board its recommendation to the 
shareholders on the reappointment of 
Deloitte LLP as the Group’s auditors.
During the year, Deloitte LLP and 
member firms of Deloitte LLP charged 
the Group £358,500 (2016: £364,600) 
for audit and audit-related services.
Non-audit services
To safeguard the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors 
from becoming compromised, the 
Committee has a formal policy governing 
the engagement of the external auditors 
to provide non-audit services. No material 
changes have been made to this policy 
during the year. In addition, non-audit 
fees on any specific project cannot 
exceed £50,000 without the express 
approval of the Committee Chairman, 
who must report to the Committee 
on the use of this delegated authority 
at the next Committee meeting.
Our policy ensures that the Committee 
challenges the decision to use Deloitte 
LLP where suitable, practical and 
reasonably priced alternatives exist. 
In addition, the Committee considers 
the overall level of non-audit fees and 
would not expect these fees to be in 
aggregate greater than the audit fee. Full 
details of the split between audit and 
non-audit fees can be found in note 4 to 
the financial statements of the Group.

Terms of Reference
The Risk Committee’s Terms of Reference are available on the Group’s website (www.
ite-exhibitions.com) or can be obtained from the Company Secretary. The Terms of 
Reference are reviewed annually and presented to the Board for approval. 
The role and responsibilities of the Committee
The Company Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s risk management framework. 
The Board regularly reviews the Group’s key risks and to support the discharge of this 
responsibility, in addition to the Audit Committee, the Board established the Risk 
Committee in 2014. 
The purpose of the Risk Committee (the Committee) is to identify, measure, track, mitigate, 
and manage risks faced by the Group over time with the intention of exposing threats to be 
mitigated and opportunities to be exploited. The Committee works closely with the Audit 
Committee, which remains responsible for risks arising in financial reporting. The Group’s 
Key Risk Matrix, containing an estimated financial impact, is regularly shared with the Board 
and discussed. 
The Committee’s work is primarily driven by the assessment of its principal risks and 
uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are the output of a series of risk registers, 
which are developed across the Group, and then are accumulated and reviewed by the 
Committee. After the accumulation of the main risk register it is shared with the Board twice 
a year. The Committee reviews these assessments and makes adjustments to the overall 
risk plan as appropriate.
Risk Committee  
Report
Activities during the financial year
The Committee met twice during the  
year. During the first meeting the 
Committee reviewed and discussed  
health and safety across the Group, use  
of risk monitoring tools, viability reporting 
and scenario planning.
The second meeting launched the newly 
constituted Committee. It was agreed how 
the Committee would operate, and agreed 
to focus on implementation and review of a 
more thorough risk register, and to begin 
the roll-out of business continuity plans for 
offices and core events.
During the year we launched a Global 
Authority Matrix, which sets out the key 
business decisions and the level of approval 
that is required for those decisions. The 
Regional Directors and Regional Finance 
Directors are required to certify compliance 
with the matrix on a quarterly basis. 
Assessment of the Group’s risk profile
The key risks identified and monitored 
by the Group, as identified by the 
Risk Committee prior to the recent 
reconstitution, are set out in the 
following section, with an assessment 
of how the potential impact of the 
individual risk has changed compared 
to the previous financial year. 
The Committee is currently in the process 
of thoroughly reviewing the key risks and 
will present an update in the next Annual 
Report. The Committee is clear that the 
identification and appropriate management 
of the identified key risks is vital for the 
Group to achieve its strategic objectives 
and to support its long-term growth.

Governance
The principal risks facing ITE are 
reviewed regularly by both the Risk 
Committee and the Board, who confirm 
that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that could 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency and liquidity. 
The risks described represent those 
that we consider have the potential to 
have the greatest impact on our ability 
to meet our strategic objectives. 
The Group has established 
risk management 
processes in place for 
identifying and monitoring 
risks and uncertainties 
affecting the Group. 
Principal Risks  
and Uncertainties
Risk Potential impact Mitigation Change in probability and/or  
impact of risk vs prior year
Political uncertainty 
and regulatory risk
Changes in law or the regulatory environment could have 
an effect on some or all of the exhibitions of the Group.
As an international organisation, political and regulatory 
changes in the regions in which we organise our 
exhibitions could impact our ability to operate in  
these territories.
We have established local companies that fully contribute to the local economy in 
the countries where we operate.
Over recent years, we have diversified our business geographically, through 
acquisitions and expansion into new regions and markets, reducing the 
proportion of our business that is exposed to a single country or region’s political 
and regulatory environment. Our largest market represents approximately 47% 
of the Group revenues.
Towards the end of the year we hired a General Counsel to, amongst other 
things, monitor and report on regulatory matters affecting our markets and 
recommend appropriate actions to minimise risk.
Economic instability 
reduces demand for 
exhibition space
An economic downturn or period of uncertainty could 
reduce demand for exhibition space, which would in turn 
reduce the profitability of our exhibitions.
We operate across a wide range of sectors and countries to minimise our 
exposure to any single market.
The nature of our business cycle is such that, with revenues largely generated in 
advance of the costs we incur, we can react to periods of economic instability to 
protect the profitability of our exhibitions. Through strong relationships with 
venues and staff, we have a relatively flexible cost structure, allowing us to manage 
our event margins in the short and medium term.
The implementation of the TAG programme is designed to make our events 
‘must-attend’ which should have the benefit of protecting them somewhat from 
economic instability.
Economic weakness in certain Central Asian countries and 
Turkey has continued during 2017, reducing demand for 
exhibition space year-on-year. However, our largest market, 
Russia, is showing early signs of improvement following the 
stabilisation of Moscow.
Financial risk –  
foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange 
rates against Sterling for both trading transactions and for 
the translation of overseas operations. The principal 
exposure is to the Euro and the Ruble, which form the 
basis of our invoicing, and to the Ruble which is the 
functional currency of our Russian operations.
The Group seeks to minimise exposure by:
 – protecting a certain amount of Euro-denominated sales with forward 
contracts;
 – seeking to maximise the matching of costs and revenues in the same currency; 
and
 – employing a hybrid pricing strategy which ensures local customers are 
exposed to currency risk.
Financial risk –  
liquidity risk
The Group operates in a number of countries with 
complex local requirements surrounding overseas 
payments. There is a risk that excess cash is ‘trapped’  
in subsidiaries resulting in liquidity shortages within  
the Group.
The Group has well-established payment mechanisms to repatriate cash from its 
subsidiaries.
Overseas cash balances are monitored on a weekly basis by Group management.
During the year a review of trapped cash was conducted with the support of 
external advisors, resulting in an action plan to reduce exposure going forward.
Financial risk –  
covenant risk
The Group has a debt facility with a number of covenants. 
There is a risk that the impact of the other risks noted 
could challenge key covenant metrics.
The Group reports covenant compliance to its banks on a quarterly basis and all 
covenants have been complied with and are expected to be complied with based 
on current forecasts.
Subsequent to the year end, we have refinanced our debt 
facility, on improved terms, with greater headroom and more 
appropriate covenants. Trading has also improved, with the 
recent return to growth. Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Changes in our risk profile
We review our risk profile regularly, 
meaning that the list of key risks and 
uncertainties will evolve over time. 
The list of risks is consistent with 
the list of risks presented last year, 
with the addition of a risk around the 
TAG programme implementation. 
As noted in the Risk Committee 
report, a thorough review of our 
risks is currently being undertaken 
and the key risks identified, where 
different to those set out here, will be 
summarised in the next Annual Report.
Risk Potential impact Mitigation Change in probability and/or  
impact of risk vs prior year
Commercial 
relationships
The Group has key commercial relationships with venues 
which secure our rights to run our exhibitions in the future.
The breakdown of a relationship with a key venue provider 
could reduce the profitability of any exhibitions that have 
to be relocated to an alternative venue and could increase 
competitor risk if a rival exhibition is launched at the 
previous venue.
The key commercial relationships are regularly reviewed. We seek to maintain our 
exhibition rights for at least the next three-year period for significant exhibitions.
In the longer-term the Group seeks to maintain good relationships with its 
principal venues to ensure the continuance of availability.
Venue availability
Damage to or unavailability of a particular venue could 
impact the Group’s short-term trading position.
We carry business interruption insurance policies which protect profits on our 
largest fully-owned events against such an event in the short term.
Competitor risk
Competition has existed in ITE’s markets for some years 
and we face competitive pressures on a market-by-market 
basis.
A single exhibition or sector in a market could have its 
prospects curtailed by a strong competitor launch.
In all of our markets, we have a strong position as an international organiser, 
achieved through the effective use of our international sales network and the 
established brands of our major events.
The breadth of our portfolio of events, with its geographic and sector diversity, 
reduces the risk of a competitive threat to our overall business.
Integration and 
management of 
acquisitions
With new acquisitions there can be no assurances that the 
Group will achieve the expected return on its investment.
Integration issues and a failure to realise planned 
operational and synergistic benefits are a risk to delivering 
the expected returns on our investments.
The Group has formal investment decision criteria to identify suitable, earnings-
enhancing acquisition targets and we employ experienced professionals to drive 
the acquisition process and perform, when appropriate, financial, tax, legal and 
commercial due diligence. Post-acquisition plans are prepared to ensure 
businesses are effectively integrated into the Group and that planned synergies 
are realised.
People
A failure to attract and retain high calibre people could 
adversely affect our ability to meet our strategic objectives.
Given the long-standing relationships our employees  
have with our customers, a loss of key staff could 
negatively impact the short-term prospects of a specific 
event or sector.
We have sought to build loyalty in our staff by ensuring remuneration is competitive 
and through a wide distribution of the Group’s long-term incentive plans.
We have well-established management development programmes in place and 
are committed to the development of all of our people.
We monitor staff satisfaction levels through the use of employment engagement 
surveys and act on the results to ensure we have motivated as well as talented 
employees. These are currently being reassessed as part of the TAG programme.
Transformation and 
Growth (TAG) 
programme
The TAG programme initiatives may not be delivered on 
time or within budget.
Growth may not be delivered within the expected timeline 
or at a rate that will cover investment costs, which will 
impact financial performance and stated growth objectives.
There are defined structures in place to support and deliver the TAG programme. A 
strict governance structure has been established and a Steering Committee directs 
the overall programme to ensure it delivers the strategic objectives.
Each workstream within the programme has a dedicated workstream lead who 
manages a particular part of the programme, and these separate teams meet 
frequently. The Steering Committee controls the finances available to each 
workstream and ensures the workstream is delivered to plan.
The Steering Committee is comprised of a team of functional and industry 
specialists. All risks to workstreams are considered through regular review forums.
Management have considerable experience of executing large-scale transformation 
programmes. Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Governance
The Nomination Committee (the 
Committee) was in place throughout 
the financial year and is chaired by the 
Chairman of the Company. Neil England 
assumed the role as Committee Chair 
following the resignation of Marco Sodi 
on 13 July 2017. All of the members of 
the Committee who served during the 
year were independent Non-executive 
Directors, as required under section B2.1 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer may also be invited to 
attend meetings, unless they have a conflict 
of interest. During the year, the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer 
either attended partially or fully four of 
the Committee meetings. The Company 
Secretary and HR Director may be invited, 
but only as appropriate and only if they 
do not have a conflict of interest. The 
Committee is also assisted by executive 
search consultants as and when required. 
Terms of Reference
The Nomination Committee’s Terms of 
Reference are available on the Group’s 
website (www.ite-exhibitions.com) or 
can be obtained from the Company 
Secretary. The Terms of Reference 
are reviewed annually and presented 
to the Board for approval. 
The role and responsibilities of 
the Committee
The Nomination Committee meets a 
minimum of twice a year and as required. 
The Committee is responsible for 
considering and recommending to the 
Board suitable candidates for appointment 
as Executive and Non-executive Directors.

Nomination Committee  
Report
When the need to appoint either an 
Executive or a Non-executive Director 
arises, the Committee reviews what 
skills and experience are required for 
the position, whilst taking into account 
the Board’s existing composition. 
Appointments to the Board follow a formal, 
rigorous and transparent process, which 
involves the Committee interviewing 
candidates proposed by either existing 
Board members or by external search 
consultants. Careful consideration is given 
to ensure appointees have sufficient time 
available to devote to the role and that the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience 
on the Board is maintained or improved. 
ITE has adopted a Board Diversity Policy 
which recognises and embraces the 
benefits of having a diverse Board, and 
sees increasing diversity at Board level 
as an important element in maintaining 
a competitive advantage. A truly diverse 
Board in its broadest sense will include 
and make good use of differences in the 
skills, regional and industry experience, 
background, race, gender and other 
qualities of Directors. These differences 
will be considered in determining the 
optimum composition of the Board 
and when possible should be balanced 
appropriately. All Board appointments 
are made on merit, in the context of 
the skills and experience the Board 
as a whole requires to be effective. 
When dealing with the appointment of 
a successor to the Company Chairman, 
the Senior Independent Non-executive 
Director will chair the Committee 
instead of the Company Chairman. 
When the Committee has found a 
suitable candidate, the Chairman of the 
Committee will make a proposal to the 
whole Board and the appointment is 
the responsibility of the Board following 
recommendation from the Committee.
Activities during the financial year
The Committee met five times during 
the financial year. The Committee met 
more frequently than usual due to the 
resignation of the Chairman in July 2017, 
and the need to appoint a successor. After 
a tender process was completed, the 
external search consultants, Blackwood 
Group, were appointed to carry out the 
search for the role of the Chairman. At 
the time of their appointment, Blackwood 
Group had no connection to the business. 
Whilst the search for a Chairman continues, 
the Committee appointed Neil England as 
Chairman of the Group. Subsequent to the 
resignation of Marco Sodi as Chairman, 
the Committee appointed Sharon Baylay 
to join the Nomination Committee. 
In addition to the search for a new 
Chairman, the Committee met to review 
and discuss: 
– the balance of skills and experience on 
the Board and considered if any changes 
were necessary;
– the annual Board evaluation responses; 
– Membership and Chairmanship of the 
plc committees; 
–  the Committee’s Terms of Reference; 
– the re-election of all Directors at the 
2018 Annual General Meeting; 
– the Company’s succession plans for the 
Company’s Board, its Executive Team 
and other key roles across the Group; 
and
– talent development and management 
across the Group.

Remuneration Committee  
Report
This Report complies with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 
8 of the Large and Medium-Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended 
in 2013). The Report has been prepared 
in line with the recommendations of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
requirements of the UKLA Listing Rules.
Alignment of remuneration with 
strategy
Our current Remuneration Policy was 
approved by over 96% of shareholders 
at last year’s AGM following a 
number of refinements to align the 
Policy better with our strategy and 
developments in institutional investors’ 
best practice expectations.
The key changes made included a 
modest rebalancing of incentive quantum 
towards annual performance targets 
but with the introduction of compulsory 
deferral of part of the annual bonus into 
Company shares and a two-year holding 
period on shares that vest under our 
long-term incentive plan. As an events-
based business with a heavy weighting 
towards emerging markets, biasing our 
incentive arrangements towards annually 
set targets enables the Committee to 
have an appropriate level of flexibility to 
respond to fast moving economic and 
political developments in our key markets. 
However, the inclusion of deferral of annual 
bonus to operate with share ownership 
guidelines and a holding period on vested 
shares ensures that any short-term 
success retains a clear link to our long-term 
performance. This is particularly relevant in 
light of the Board’s approval during the year 
of the transformation and growth strategy.
2017 performance and reward
Our focus at the start of 2017 was on 
delivering profitable growth from our 
operations at the same time as driving 
strong cash conversion from our 
profits and creating a high performing 
culture. As detailed in the Strategic 
report, the Board approved a refined 
strategy during the year that focusses on 
transforming and growing the business 
over the next three to five years.
In what was a transitionary year, we made 
strong progress in our key markets at 
the same time as successfully executing 
the early investments targeted through 
our Transformation and Growth (TAG) 
strategy. Strong progress was also achieved 
against a number of strategic priorities 
that included a review of international 
sales, an assessment and strengthening 
of the senior management team and 
a review of recent acquisitions. As a 
result, bonuses were paid at 79.9% of 
the maximum level to the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
Full disclosure of the bonus targets 
set, and performance against them, is 
included on page 65. In approving bonus 
awards, the Remuneration Committee 
noted the financial results achieved 
during the year, with headline profit 
before tax of £31.6 million (2016: £36.5 
million), and was comfortable with 
the overall remuneration awarded. 
The long-term incentive award vesting in 
2018 is based on a three-year performance 
period ending 30 September 2017. There 
will be no vesting as the challenging range 
of headline diluted EPS targets were not 
met. The deterioration in the market 
environments in which the Company 
operated during this period meant it 
was not possible to meet the targets.
Overall, the Committee is comfortable 
that there has been a robust relationship 
between performance and reward. 57

Governance
Implementation of Policy for 2018
The base salaries of the Executive 
Directors will be increased with effect from 
1 October 2017. The increase in salary 
for Mark Shashoua, at 3%, was consistent 
with the typical increase awarded across 
the Company. The increase in salary for 
Andrew Beach, at 5%, took account of his 
appointment on a salary at the lower end 
of the relevant market range for a Company 
of comparable size and complexity to 
ITE in October 2016. The 5% increase 
represents the Committee’s desire to move 
him inside the typical market range over 
time. The increase is consistent with the 
treatment of employees in the Company 
where they have been performing 
strongly in post but fell towards the lower 
end of relevant market data ranges.
Given the Remuneration Policy 
(implemented in 2017) is working well, we 
are to retain the same quantum, structure 
and performance metrics for 2018.
The annual bonus will continue to operate 
based on a combination of challenging 
headline profit before tax, revenue 
growth and cash conversion targets with 
a small but significant proportion of the 
total bonus opportunity reserved for the 
delivery of tailored strategic objectives. 
One-third of any bonus earned will 
continue to be subject to deferral into 
the Company’s shares to provide a bridge 
between the attainment of short-term 
objectives and longer-term performance. In 
addition, robust recovery and withholding 
provisions will also continue to apply to 
any bonus earned in relation to 2018.
With regards to the long-term incentive 
plan, the three-year performance 
targets will again relate to headline 
earnings per share growth and relative 
total shareholder return performance 
versus a pan-sector group of companies 
of a similar size. As with the annual 
bonus, robust recovery and withholding 
provisions apply along with a two-year 
holding period on any shares that vest.
In line with best practice, the Committee 
also retains discretion to over-ride the 
formulaic outcomes of incentive plans 
if it considered there to be a disconnect 
between performance and reward.
Shareholder engagement
We are committed to maintaining an 
ongoing dialogue with shareholders on 
the issue of Executive remuneration and 
we welcome any feedback you may have.
We look forward to your support on 
the resolution relating to remuneration 
at the AGM on 25 January 2018.

Remuneration Policy Report
Set out below is an overview of the Group’s Remuneration Policy.
The complete shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy is available on our website.
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary/
fees
Set at competitive levels 
in the markets in which 
ITE operates, in order 
to attract and retain 
Executives, capable of 
delivering the Group 
strategy.
Reviewed annually with 
changes normally effective 
from 1 October of each 
year.
Decisions influenced by:
 – scope of the role and 
the markets in which ITE 
operates;
 – performance and 
experience of the 
individual;
 – pay levels at 
organisations of a similar 
size and complexity; and
 – pay and conditions 
elsewhere in the Group.
Salaries will be eligible 
for increases during the 
three-year period that 
the Remuneration Policy 
operates from the effective 
date (26 January 2017).
During this time, salaries 
may be increased each year 
(in percentage of salary 
terms) in line with increases 
granted to the wider 
workforce.
Increases beyond those 
granted to the wider 
workforce (in percentage 
of salary terms) may 
be awarded in certain 
circumstances such as 
where there is a change in 
responsibility, experience 
or a significant increase 
in the scale of the role 
and/or size, value and/or 
complexity of the Group.
Not applicable.
Benefits Designed to be 
competitive in the 
market in which the 
individual is employed.
Benefits include life 
insurance, private medical 
insurance and income 
protection insurance. 
Where appropriate, 
other benefits may be 
offered including, but not 
limited to, allowances 
for car, accommodation, 
relocation, other expatriate 
benefits, and participation 
in all-employee share 
schemes.
Benefits vary by role and 
individual circumstance 
and eligibility is reviewed 
periodically
Benefits are not 
pensionable.
The value of benefits may 
vary from year to year 
depending on the cost to 
the Company from third 
party providers.
Not applicable.
Pension To provide cost-effective 
retirement benefits.

Annual 
performance 
bonus
Designed to reinforce 
individual performance 
and contribution to 
the achievement of 
sustainable profit 
growth and strategic 
objectives.
Compulsory deferral of 
one-third of any bonus paid 
into shares for three years 
with the balance of the 
bonus paid in cash.
Deferred shares typically 
vest after three years and 
are normally subject to 
continued employment.
Dividend equivalent 
payments may be made 
(in cash or shares) on 
deferred shares at the 
time of vesting and may 
assume the reinvestment 
of dividends.
Annual bonus awards are 
not pensionable.
Payments made under 
the annual bonus are 
subject to recovery and 
withholding provisions 
which enable value over-
paid to be recouped to the 
later of one-year following 
the date of payment or 
the completion of the 
next audit of the Group’s 
accounts, in the event 
of a fraud or material 
misstatement of results 
being identified in relation 
to the year in which the 
bonus was earned.
Maximum potential 
opportunity of up to 150% 
of base salary.
For the current Executive 
Directors, the annual 
bonus will be limited to the 
following levels during the 
three-year policy period:
 – 150% of salary (Chief 
Executive Officer); and
 – 120% of salary (Chief 
Financial Officer).
Details of the performance 
measures used for the 
current year and targets set 
for the year under review 
and performance against 
them will be provided 
in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Bonus will be 
predominantly based on 
a challenging range of 
financial targets set in line 
with the Group’s KPIs (for 
example, revenue growth, 
cash conversion and 
profit). For a minority of 
the bonus, targets relating 
to the Group’s other KPIs 
will operate (for example, 
strategic targets).
For financial targets, 
and where practicable 
strategic targets, bonus 
starts to accrue once the 
threshold target is met 
(0% payable) rising on a 
graduated scale to 100% 
for outperformance.
The Committee may adjust 
bonus outcomes, based 
on the application of the 
bonus formula set at the 
start of the relevant year, if 
it considers the quantum 
to be inconsistent with 
the Company’s overall 
performance during the 
year. For the avoidance 
of doubt this can be to 
zero and bonuses may not 
exceed the maximum levels 
detailed above. Any use 
of such discretion would 
be detailed in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Performance 
Share Plan 
(PSP)
Ensures that the 
Executive Directors’ 
interests are 
aligned with those 
of shareholders 
through providing 
share-based awards 
linked to sustained 
improvements in 
long-term targeted 
performance metrics.
Awards of nominal cost 
(or nil cost) options (or 
similar) may be granted 
annually as a percentage 
of base salary. Vesting is 
based on performance 
measured over three years. 
The performance period 
normally starts at the 
beginning of the financial 
year in which the date of 
grant falls.
Dividend equivalent 
payments may be made 
(in cash or shares) on 
PSP shares at the time of 
vesting on vested shares 
and may assume the 
reinvestment of dividends.
Payments made under the 
PSP are subject to recovery 
and withholding provisions 
which enable recoupment 
of the value over-paid 
for the later of one year 
following the date of 
vesting or the completion 
of the next audit of the 
Group’s accounts in the 
event of fraud or material 
misstatement of results 
being identified in relation 
to the years in which the 
PSP is earned.
The maximum award 
limit under the PSP is 
capped at 150% of salary 
other than in exceptional 
circumstances (e.g. 
recruitment ‘buy-out’ to 
compensate for value 
forfeit from a previous 
employer) when awards 
may be granted up to 200% 
of salary.
For the current Executive 
Directors, the annual 
PSP award limit for the 
three-year Remuneration 
Policy period (excluding 
any buy-out awards) will be 
limited to:
 – 100% of salary (Chief 
Executive Officer); and
 – 80% of salary (Chief 
Financial Officer).
Granted subject to 
challenging financial (e.g. 
EPS) and total shareholder 
return performance targets 
tested over three years.
20% of maximum vests for 
threshold performance for 
the CEO (30% of maximum 
for other participants), 
rising on a graduated 
basis to full vesting for 
equalling, or exceeding, the 
maximum performance 
targets (no awards vest 
for performance below 
threshold).
The Committee may adjust 
PSP vesting outcomes, 
based on the result of 
testing the performance 
condition, if it considers the 
quantum to be inconsistent 
with the Company’s overall 
performance during the 
three-year performance 
period. For the avoidance 
of doubt this can be to 
zero. Any use of such 
discretion would be 
detailed in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Non-
executive 
Directors’ 
fees
To reflect the time 
commitment in 
preparing for and 
attending meetings, 
the duties and 
responsibilities of 
the role, and the 
contribution expected 
from the Non-executive 
Directors.
Annual fee for Chairman.
Annual base fee for 
Non-executive Directors. 
Additional fees are paid to 
the Senior Independent 
Director and the 
Chairmen of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees 
to reflect additional 
responsibilities.
Fees are reviewed 
annually, taking into 
account time commitment, 
responsibilities and fees 
paid by comparable 
companies.
All Non-executive Directors 
are reimbursed for travel 
and related business 
expenses reasonably 
incurred in performing 
their duties.
There is no prescribed 
maximum. Non-executive 
Director fee increases are 
applied in line with the 
outcome of the periodic 
reviews and considering 
wider factors, for example, 
inflation.

Notes to policy table
In addition to the above elements of remuneration, any commitment made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, the approval and 
implementation of the Remuneration Policy detailed in this Report will be honoured.
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting
Performance targets are set at such a level as to be stretching and achievable, with regard to the particular strategic priorities and 
economic environment.
Annual bonus
Annual bonuses are based 50% on profit, 20% on revenue growth, 15% on cash conversion and 15% on individually tailored strategic 
targets. These metrics and weightings are to be retained in 2018 having been introduced in 2017 for the first time.
The range of metrics chosen provides a keen balance between incentivising operational success and delivering growth. Profit will be 
measured on a reported basis (i.e. using actual exchange rates) with revenue growth and cash conversion measured using budgeted 
exchange rates to provide a balance between shareholder alignment and incentivising management to deliver against internal plans 
(noting the international nature of ITE’s operations).
The Committee will review the choice of metrics and weightings at the start of each financial year in light of developments in the 
Company’s  strategy.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
PSP awards are granted 70% based on adjusted EPS and 30% on relative total shareholder return (TSR) versus a combination of the FTSE 
Small Cap and FTSE 250 Index constituents (excluding investment trusts). These metrics and weightings are to be retained in 2018 having 
been introduced in 2017 for the first time.
The Committee considers that EPS (adjusted on such basis as the Committee considers necessary to ensure consistent testing of the 
condition across the performance period) is the most appropriate financial measure of long-term performance of the Group as it is well 
aligned with shareholder interests and provides good line of sight. Relative TSR will provide clear alignment between Executives and our 
shareholders with vesting only taking place if we deliver at, or above, median market returns for shareholders.
The Committee will review the performance conditions (choice of metric, weightings and TSR comparator group) to apply to PSP awards 
annually, prior to the start of the performance period, taking into account a number of internal and external reference points to help ensure 
they are appropriately stretching.
Executive Director shareholding guidelines
The Committee recognises the importance of aligning the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders through the building up of a 
significant shareholding in the Group. Executive Directors are required to retain shares of a value equal to at least 25% of any gain made 
after tax on the vesting of awards under the Plans, until they have built up a minimum shareholding of a value equivalent to at least 200% of 
annual base salary.
Remuneration Policy for new Executive Directors
When appointing a new Executive Director, including by way of internal promotion, the Committee may make use of all the existing 
components of remuneration as follows:
Component Approach Maximum value
Base salary Determined in line with the stated Policy, and taking into account 
their previous salary. Initial salaries may be set below market and 
consideration given to phasing any increases over two or three years 
subject to development in the role.
Not applicable.
Benefits In line with the stated Policy.
Pension In line with the stated Policy.
Annual bonus In line with stated Policy, with the relevant maximum pro rata to reflect 
the proportion of the year served.
150% of base salary.
PSP In line with the stated Policy. 100% of base salary (200% in 
exceptional circumstances as detailed 
in the previous table).
In connection with recruitment, the Committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under a structure not included in the Policy 
detailed above to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. Any ‘buy out’ of incentive arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer would be on broadly similar terms and awards would have a fair value no higher than the 
awards forfeited.
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the Group will honour any contractual commitments made 
prior to their promotion to Executive Director.
In cases of appointing a new Non-executive Director, the approach will be consistent with the Policy.
Service contracts and exit payments policy
In line with UK Corporate Governance Code Provision B.7.1, all Directors are subject to re-election annually at the Company’s AGM. The 
previous Chairman, Marco Sodi, had a six-month notice period and the Non-executive Directors have a one-month notice period. Although 
Neil England has been appointed Chairman, as we are recruiting a permanent successor, Neil’s notice period remains at one month.
The effective dates of their letters of appointment are as follows:
Director
Date of letter  
of appointment Notice period
Neil England 18 March 2008 One month
Linda Jensen 7 July 2011 One month
Stephen Puckett 16 May 2013 One month
Sharon Baylay 24 March 2014 One month
Marco Sodi
1
1 February 2012 Six months
1 Resigned as Chairman on 13 July 2017, but remained on the Board as a Non-executive Director until 11 October 2017.
Executive Director service contracts have no fixed term and have a notice period of up to 12 months from either the Executive Director or 
the Group. The Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Group’s registered office and at the AGM. The dates of the 
Executive Director service contracts and the relevant notice periods are as follows:
Director
Effective date  
of contract Notice period
Mark Shashoua 1 September 2016 12 months
Andrew Beach 17 October 2016 12 Months
The Committee’s policy is to limit severance payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements and the rules of the 
relevant incentive plans. In doing so, the Committee’s objective is to avoid rewarding poor performance. Furthermore, the Committee will 
take account of the Executive Director’s duty to mitigate his loss.
Termination payments are limited to base salary, benefits and pension during the notice period and the Company may elect to make a 
payment in lieu of notice. If an Executive Director’s contract is terminated, he may be eligible for a pro rata annual bonus over the period to 
the date of cessation of employment, subject to performance.
In addition to the contractual provisions regarding payment on termination set out above, the Group’s incentive plans and share schemes 
contain provisions for termination of employment. Unless an individual is a good leaver under the terms of the incentive plans (e.g. if they 
leave for reasons of death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, part of the business in which the individual is employed or engaged 
ceasing to be a member of the Group, circumstances that are considered by the Committee to be retirement, or any other reason as the 
Committee decides), entitlements to incentives are lost on cessation of employment. In good leaver circumstances, an individual may 
remain eligible to participate in the incentive but following the application of performance targets and a pro rata reduction unless the 
Committee determines otherwise. Awards may remain eligible to vest.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
In line with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended in 2013) the 
following parts of the Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration are audited: the single total figure of remuneration for each Director, 
including annual bonus and PSP outcomes for the financial year ending 30 September 2017; scheme interests awarded during the year; 
pension entitlements; payments to past Directors and payments for loss of office; and Directors’ shareholdings and share interests. All 
other parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report are unaudited.
The Remuneration Committee was in place throughout the financial year and was chaired by Linda Jensen. Linda stepped down from  
the role of Committee Chair with effect from 1 October 2017, and was succeeded by Sharon Baylay. During the year Stephen Puckett  
joined the Committee. Committee members are all Non-executive Directors or the Company Chairman, as instructed in Provision D.2.1 of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). Members of the Committee are appointed by the Board, on the recommendation of the 
Nomination Committee in consultation with the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, for an initial period of three years, which can 
then be followed by an additional two further three-year periods. During the financial year all Committee members played an active role in 
all Remuneration Committee meetings held.
Where there is no conflict of interest, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the Human Resources Director and the Company 
Secretary may be invited to attend the Committee’s meetings to assist the Committee in making informed decisions. To maximise 
effectiveness, meetings of the Committee generally take place just prior to a Company Board meeting. The Chairman of the Committee 
reports to the Board, as part of a separate agenda item, on the activity of the Committee and matters of particular relevance to the Board 
in the conduct of its work. No individual is present when their own remuneration is being discussed. The Chairman of the Committee also 
meets separately with the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, the Human Resources 
Director and the Committee’s external adviser.
Advisers
Korn Ferry Hay Group (KFH) are the appointed Committee remuneration advisers, and were appointed by the Committee after a 
competitive tender in 2016. Total fees paid to KFH in respect of providing their services to the Committee during the 2017 financial year 
were £70,050 (excluding VAT), with the fees charged on a time spent and materials provided basis. KFH are signatories to the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Group Code of Conduct and any advice provided is governed by that Code. Advisers attend Committee meetings as 
appropriate, and provide advice on Remuneration Policy, best practice and market updates. The Committee evaluates the support 
provided by its advisers annually and is comfortable that the individual advisers detailed did not have any connections with the ITE Group 
that may have, or continue to, impair their independence.
Terms of Reference
The Remuneration Committee’s Terms of Reference are available on the Group’s website www.ite-exhibitions.com or can be obtained from 
the Company Secretary. The Terms of Reference are reviewed annually and presented to the Board for approval.
The role and responsibilities of the Committee
The Remuneration Committee meets at least three times a year and on other occasions, as required. The Committee has delegated 
responsibility from the Board to set the Remuneration Policy for all Executive Directors and the Company Chairman. The objective of  
such Policy shall be to ensure that members of the executive management of the Company are provided with appropriate incentives to 
encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of 
the Company. For clarification, the Company Chairman and the Executive Directors are responsible for setting the remuneration of the 
Non-executive Directors.
Annual Report

– determine and agree with the Board the Policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and members of the executive 
management (including pensions);
– review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the Remuneration Policy;
– approve the design of, and determine targets for, any performance-related pay schemes operated by the Company and approve the 
total annual payments made under the schemes;

2 Taxable benefits include private medical insurance contributions.
3 Annual bonus paid for performance over the relevant financial year. Details are set out below on pages 65 to 67 of the performance targets set and actual 
performance against them. Consistent with the terms of the revised 2017 Remuneration Policy one-third of the bonus earned in relation to 2017 is deferred into the 
Company’s shares for a period of three years with the balance payable in cash. These shares will be held in the ITE Group Employees’ Share Trust. The entire 2016 
bonus was payable in cash. Annual bonus awards may be subject to recovery and withholding provisions in line with the Company’s Remuneration Policy.
4 There was no vesting of long-term incentive awards in relation to performance periods concluding 30 September 2017 or 2016.
5 This is a pro-rated amount of Mark Shashoua’s annual salary as he was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2016.
6 This is a pro-rated amount of Andrew Beach’s annual salary as he was appointed to the Board on 17 October 2016.
7 As detailed in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, Russell Taylor ceased to be an Executive Director of the Company on 31 August 2016 as part of an orderly 
leadership transition. As part of this transition, he remained in active employment through to 31 December 2016 before being placed on garden leave for the balance 
of his twelve-month notice period (i.e. from 1 January 2017 to 5 May 2017). This ensured that he remained available to assist the new Chief Executive Officer as 
required during the full period of his twelve months’ notice period. For the period of his active employment during the leadership transition (i.e. the period from 
1 October 2016 to 31 December 2016) he remained eligible to earn a pro rata bonus based on pre-set performance targets. This bonus was paid wholly in cash as per 
the Group’s policy for non-PLC Directors as it related to a period when Russell Taylor was not a PLC Board Director.
Executive Directors’ base salaries
As both Mark Shashoua and Andrew Beach were appointed in 2016, they were not eligible for a pay review during the financial year ended 
30 September 2017. Details of the current Executive Director salaries are set out on page 71.
Pension and other benefits
During the year, the Group made pension contributions equal to 10% of each Executive Directors’ salary for the relevant pro rata period of 
their employment. Benefits were provided in line with Policy.

Annual bonus
Framework and outcomes for the financial year ended 30 September 2017
For the 2017 financial year, the continuing Executive Directors were eligible to participate in the Executive Bonus Plan – designed to 
reinforce delivery of sustainable profit growth and achievement of strategic objectives.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity was 150% of salary for Mark Shashoua and 120% for Andrew Beach.
The annual bonus was based 85% on financial targets and 15% on personal targets. As detailed in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration 
Report the weightings were adjusted for the year under review (from 70% financial and 30% personal) to place a higher weighting on key 
financial objectives.
The range of financial targets set and actual performance against the targets is detailed below:

1 The actual FY2017 profit performance, for comparison against the target, is adjusted to add back the actual Transformation and Growth project costs incurred. The 
target was also increased marginally to reflect the expected benefit of these investment costs. The Committee, in making these adjustments, recognise that the 
Transformation and Growth strategy had not been determined at the time of setting the FY2017 targets. Therefore, adding back these items subsequently approved 
by the Board ensured that the annual bonus targets fulfilled their original purpose. 
 
The actual FY2017 revenue performance, for comparison against the target, is adjusted to include budgeted foreign exchange rates, the Transformation and Growth 
project costs and expected benefit, and to exclude the impact of current year acquisitions. 
 
Following these adjustments, the Committee was comfortable that the targets were no more or less challenging than when originally set.
The personal targets set for Mark Shashoua and the Committee’s assessment of his performance against them is set out below:

Long-term incentive
Vesting of awards granted in January 2015 with performance measures over the three financial years ending 30 September 2017
The purpose of the incentive was to align the Executive Directors with delivering sustainable profitable growth and above market 
shareholder returns.
The three-year performance period of PSP awards granted on 13 January 2015 ended on 30 September 2017. From 1 October 2014 to 
30 September 2017, ITE’s three-year cumulative headline diluted EPS was 34.1p, which was below the requirements of 62p to 70p. As a 
result, the minimum performance requirement for the award was not met and the awards will not be eligible to vest. As recent joiners, 
neither Mark Shashoua nor Andrew Beach are recipients of the 2015 PSP awards.
Scheme interests awarded during the year
In line with the expectation set in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, Mark Shashoua and Andrew Beach received a ‘normal’ policy 
award (at 100% of salary and 80% of salary respectively) and a performance-related ‘buy-out’ award set at an extra 50% of salary that, in 
both cases, was in lieu of incentives forfeited when joining the Company. The Committee was comfortable that the additional one-off 50% 
of salary performance-related PSP award was appropriate noting that the time horizon of the buy-out element was greater than that of the 
awards forfeited (with vesting to potentially take place in June 2020) and having had regard to the quantum foregone in agreeing to join 
the Company.
The performance conditions applicable to these awards are detailed below. 70% of the award is subject to a challenging range of earnings 
per share targets to be achieved in the financial year ending 30 September 2019. 30% of the award is subject to a performance target 
comparing the Company’s TSR against the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE 250 and FTSE Small Cap Indices (excluding investment trusts) 
over the three financial years commencing 1 October 2016. The performance targets are provided below:
Vesting percentage (of EPS element) 2019 Headline diluted EPS

0% Less than 11.3p
30% (20% for CEO) 11.3p
100% 15.3p

To the extent that the awards vest, they will be subject to a two-year holding period. Vested awards will be subject to clawback for the latter 
of one year following the date of vesting or completion of the next audit of the Group’s accounts in the event of a fraud or material 
misstatement of results being identified in relation to the years in which the PSP is earned. 68

Chairman and Non-executive Director fees
During the year the Committee reviewed the Chairman’s fee in light of the time commitment required of the role and the fees payable at 
comparator companies and decided on an increase of 3%. The Chairman’s fee increases to £168,100 (2016: £163,200) per annum.
With effect from 1 October 2017, the Non-executive Directors receive a base fee of £47,800 (2016: £46,400), with an additional fee for the 
Senior Independent Director of £5,250 (2016: £5,100) and for the Audit and Remuneration Committee Chairs of £6,400 (2016: £6,200). The 
revised fees were considered to better reflect the required time commitment of the roles. Non-executive Directors’ fees for the year 
commencing 1 October 2017 are therefore as follows:

Payments to past Directors and payments for loss of office
As detailed in last year’s Annual Report and on page 64, Russell Taylor ceased to be an Executive Director of the Company on 31 August 2016 
as part of an orderly leadership transition. He remained in active employment through to 31 December 2016 before being placed on 
gardening leave for the balance of his twelve-month notice period (i.e. from 1 January 2017 to 5 May 2017). This ensured that he remained 
available to assist the Chief Executive Officer as required during the full period of his twelve months’ notice period. For the period of his active 
employment during the leadership transition (i.e. the period from 1 October 2016 to 31 December 2016) he remained eligible to earn a pro 
rata bonus based on pre-set performance targets. He was not eligible to be considered for a bonus for the period from 1 January 2017.
With regards to Russell Taylor’s outstanding long-term incentive awards, consistent with the rules of the relevant plans and the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy, the Committee exercised its discretion to allow Russell Taylor’s unvested PSP share awards over 286,000 shares, 
459,500 shares and 460,750 shares granted in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively to vest at the end of their respective performance periods 
subject to applicable performance conditions being satisfied, and subject to time pro rata to reflect Russell Taylor’s actual service during the 
applicable performance period. Neither the 2014 or 2015 awards performance targets were met and these awards will not vest. The 
185,250 shares granted in 2013, and the 286,000 shares granted in 2014 did not vest. The remaining 154,000 of the 164,000 shares granted 
in 2011 (reduced due to a prior exercise of 10,000 shares) and the remaining 135,800 shares of the 194,000 shares granted in 2012 (scaled 
back to 70% of the original shares granted following a testing of the performance condition) were exercised and sold in the previous 
financial year.
As noted on page 68, Marco Sodi resigned as Chairman on 11 July 2017 and left the Board with effect from 11 October 2017. Marco Sodi 
continued to receive his fee on a monthly basis until the 11 January 2018, in line with the terms of his letter of appointment, which included 
a six-month notice period. No other payments were made in connection with his resignation and leaving of the Board.
Dilution limits
The Group has at all times complied with the dilution limits set out in the rules of its share plans (principally a limit of 10% in ten years). The 
Group will also operate within a dilution limit of 5% in any rolling ten-year period for discretionary schemes. In the ten-year period to 
30 September 2017, awards made under the Group’s share schemes represented 0.41% (2016: 0.6%) of the Group’s issued ordinary share 
capital. Shares to satisfy awards granted under the PSP which are normally purchased in the market do not count towards the dilution limits.

Directors’ shareholding guidelines and share scheme interests
During the year, the Executive Directors were required to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of the gain made after tax, on the vesting of 
awards under the Plans, until they have built up their minimum shareholding of at least 200% of annual base salary.
The table below shows the Directors’ interests in shares owned outright and/or vested, and the extent to which ITE’s shareholding 
guidelines are achieved. There have been no other changes in the holdings of the current Directors and any connected persons between 
30 September 2017 and 27 November 2017, being the last practicable date before publication of the Remuneration Report.

3 During the year both Mark Shashoua and Andrew Beach purchased shares in the Group. As at 30 September 2017, neither Director had complied with the Group’s 
shareholding guidelines. However, as recent appointments (with Mark Shashoua being appointed on 1 September 2016, and Andrew Beach being appointed on 
17 October 2016) the Committee’s expectations is that further progress will be made towards meeting the guidelines as a result of the future vesting of share awards, 
as a minimum, through the retention of an appropriate portion of shares vesting under the Company’s share plans.

Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy for the year ending 30 September 2018
Full details of the Remuneration Policy to operate for the financial year ended 30 September 2018, and how it differs to the Remuneration 
Policy operated during the financial year ended 30 September 2017, are set out on pages 57 to 59. Set out below is how the Committee 
anticipates applying this Remuneration Policy during the financial year ended 30 September 2018.
Executive Directors’ base salaries
The base salaries of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer were reviewed during the year. The Chief Executive Officer was 
granted an increase of 3%, and the Chief Financial Officer was granted an increase of 5%. The increase to Andrew Beach took into account 
the fact that his salary on appointment was set at a lower level to the role in similar sized companies and reflected the Committee’s 
objective of moving his salary to within the market range over time. The revised salaries, with effect from 1 October 2017, are £463,500, for 
Mark Shashoua and £270,375 for Andrew Beach. The next salary review date will be 1 October 2018.
The Committee was comfortable setting base salaries at these levels given the size of the roles and the experience and calibre of the 
individuals.
Pension and other benefits
Pension, or cash in lieu of pension, will be provided to a maximum of 10% of salary. Benefits are in line with the Remuneration Policy. Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Annual bonus framework
For the financial year commencing 1 October 2017, the Executive Bonus Plan quantum will operate in line with details set out in the 
Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors.
The metrics to apply include a challenging range of profit (50%), revenue growth (20%), cash conversion (15%) and individually tailored 
strategic targets (15%). Profit targets are set based on reported numbers with revenue growth and cash conversion targets set using 
budgeted exchange rates. This approach aligns shareholders and management through the use of reported numbers when determining 
bonus earned based on profit with the use of budgeted exchange rates for revenue and cash conversion providing clear line of sight 
between performance and reward for the Executives given the potential for volatile exchange rates in the Group’s key markets. This is 
considered to provide a balanced approach to aligning overall performance and reward. While the financial targets are considered 
commercially sensitive in advance, full retrospective disclosure of the targets, and performance against them, will be included in next year’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
With regards to individually tailored strategic targets, which include, for example, measurable objectives set against the development and 
execution of the Company’s strategy, leadership, funding and stakeholder communication objectives, full details of the complete range of 
targets set and performance against them will be included in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration. Should targets be considered to 
remain commercially sensitive, as a minimum, an overview of the extent to which bonus was earned against these targets will be included in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration next year to enable investors to make an informed view on the extent to which bonus was earned for 
this part of the bonus. Further disclosure would then be considered in the following Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Long-term incentive framework
PSP awards are anticipated to be granted in December 2017 in line with the Remuneration Policy to both Executive Directors. For both 
Executive Directors’ awards this will be based on a ‘normal’ Policy award (at 100% of salary and 80% of salary to the Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer respectively).
The vesting of the awards (totalling 100% of salary and 80% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) will be assessed 
against a combination of EPS growth (70% of the award) and relative TSR (30% of the award). The conditions will operate independently.
The EPS condition will be measured based on EPS in the year ending 30 September 2020 with the TSR condition measuring ITE’s relative 
performance versus the constituents of the FTSE Small Cap and FTSE 250 Index constituents (excluding investment trusts).
The EPS condition (70% of an award) will be as follows:
Vesting percentage (of EPS element of Award)
EPS at  
30 September 2020
0% Less than 8.8p
30% (20% for CEO) 8.8p
100% 14.4p
Straight-line basis Between 8.8p and 14.4p
The TSR condition (30% of an award) will be based on ITE’s performance against a combination of the FTSE Small Cap and FTSE 250 Index 
constituents (excluding investment trusts) with vesting as follows:
Vesting percentage (of TSR element of award)
Three-year TSR relative to the FTSE Small Cap 
and FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) 
constituents to 30 September 2020
0% Below median
30% (20% for CEO) Median
100% Upper quartile
Straight-line basis Between median and upper quartile
With regards to the choice of metrics, EPS aligns the Executive Directors with delivering a key objective of delivering long-term profitable 
growth with TSR providing alignment with the Company’s shareholders in that vesting will only take place for creating above median total 
shareholder returns.
The range of EPS targets was set having had regard to internal planning expectations, current market consensus expectations and the 
wider environment. The lower end of the range was set to be a realistic target and motivational to the executive team with the maximum 
performance requirement set to be a stretch target. The TSR comparator group was selected given ITE is a constituent member of the FTSE 
Small Cap Index. However, given our historical membership of the FTSE 250 Index and our medium to long-term aspiration of returning to 
the FTSE 250, we will again measure our performance for relative TSR purposes against a combination of the FTSE Small Cap and FTSE 250 
Index constituents (excluding investment trusts).
The awards, to the extent that they vest, will be subject to a two-year holding period.

Directors’ Responsibilities  
Statement
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable 
law), including FRS 102 ‘The Financial 
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK 
and Republic of Ireland’. Under company 
law the Directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
– make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
– state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial 
statements; and
– prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial 
statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
– properly select and apply accounting 
policies;
– present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information; 
– provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
– make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on 
the Company’s website. Legislation in 
the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best 
of our knowledge:
– the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant financial 
reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole;
– the Strategic report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face; and
– the Annual Report and financial 
statements, taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved 
by the Board of Directors on 27 November 
2017 and is signed on its behalf by:

Opinion
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
30 September 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
 – the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland’; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of ITE Group plc (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the ‘Group’) which 
comprise:
 – the Consolidated Income Statement;
 – the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;
 – the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity;
 – the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position;
 – the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement; 
 – the related notes 1 to 30; 
 – the Company Statement of Financial Position;
 – the Company Statement of Changes in Equity; and
 – the related notes 1 to 9.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company 
financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our Report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
 – carrying value of goodwill, other intangible assets and interests in associates and joint ventures; and
 – taxation, in particular the assessment of risks relating to tax in overseas jurisdictions where the 
Group operates.
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £1.1m, which we determined using 5.4% of an 
adjusted profit before tax measure being the Group loss before tax after adding back non-recurring 
adjusting items.
Scopings We completed full scope audit work in London, Russia, Turkey and India. In addition, we performed 
specified audit procedures at Moda and Sinostar.
These entities represent the principal business units and account for 80% (2016: 85%) of the Group’s 
revenue and 87% (2016: 90%) of the Group’s headline operating profit of £34.8m (2016: £39.6m) as set 
out in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Significant changes in our 
approach
Last year our Report included two audit matters which are not included this year: 
 – Acquisition accounting – this was previously considered a key audit matter due to the number of 
acquisition and the judgements involved in the identification and valuation of intangible assets. 
There was only one acquisitions in the current year (Gehua), and
 – Foreign exchange (FX) on transactions and consolidation – whilst our approach to FX has not 
changed, it was not considered a key audit matter as the number of errors previously identified 
during the course of prior audits has reduced. 
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern 
basis of accounting contained within note 2 to the financial statements and the Directors’ statement 
on the longer-term viability of the Group contained within the Directors’ Report on page 45.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation 
to:
 – the disclosures on pages 50 to 53 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
 – the Directors’ confirmation on page 45 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity;
 – the Directors’ statement in note 2 to the financial statements about whether they considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group and the Parent Company’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements;
 – the Directors’ explanation on page 45 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions; or
 – whether the Directors’ statements relating to going concern and the prospects of the Company 
required in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) are materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention 
to in respect of these matters.
We agreed with the Directors’ 
adoption of the going concern 
basis of accounting and we did not 
identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because 
not all future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this statement is 
not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going 
concern.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we 
identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Carrying value of goodwill, other intangible assets and interests in associates and joint ventures
Key audit matter 
description
As set out in notes 12, 14 and 18, the Group carries £92.6m (2016: £97.9m) of goodwill, £61.9m (2016: £70.8m) of 
other intangible assets and £45.5m (2016: £45.7m) of interests in associates and joint ventures on the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at 30 September 2017.
Management prepare a detailed assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets by 
cash-generating unit (CGU) and interests in associates and joint ventures using a number of judgemental 
assumptions (as described in note 12 to the financial statements). These include 2018 Board-approved 
forecasts, long-term growth rates (based on forecast GDP growth rates for the country) and country-specific 
discount rates. 
There is a risk, whether due to fraud or error, that the application of inappropriate assumptions supports assets 
that should otherwise be impaired or further impaired. Our work focusses on those cash generating units 
(CGUs) where the risk of impairment is higher due to, amongst other things, trading conditions in the market 
and growth prospects.
As a result of management’s exercise, a £12.6m (2016: £24.7m) impairment was booked in the year in India, 
Turkey and Africa Oil Week (2016: India, South East Asia and Siberia). In addition, an impairment of £1.7m (2016: 
£1.9m) was also booked against interests in associates and joint ventures. This matter is disclosed in the Audit 
Committee Report included within the Annual Report.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter
We reviewed the design and implementation of controls over goodwill, intangible assets and interests in 
associates and joint ventures recognition and impairment.
We considered whether management’s impairment review methodology is compliant with IAS 36 (‘Impairment 
of Assets’).
We challenged management’s assumptions used in the impairment assessment for goodwill, other intangible 
assets and interests in associates and joint ventures. Our audit work on the assumptions used in the 
impairment model focussed on:
 – considering the appropriateness of the CGUs identified by management and the allocation of assets to 
these;
 – testing the integrity of management’s model;
 – agreeing the underlying cash flow projections for each CGU to Board-approved FY 2018 forecasts;
 – comparing short-term cash flow projections against recent performance and historical forecasting accuracy 
and assessing whether there are other indicators of impairment based on this analysis;
 – engaging our valuation specialists to independently establish appropriate discount rates;
 – assessing the long-term growth rates used against independent market data; 
 – considering post year-end trading performance; 
 – calculating a range of reasonably possible sensitivities and comparing these to those calculated by 
management to ensure no further indicator of impairment is identified; and
 – assessing whether the disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts were appropriate to the Groups’s 
situation and in line with IAS 36.
Key observations We are satisfied that the remaining carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets and interests in associates and 
joint ventures is supportable and no further impairment at the year end is required
Taxation
Key audit matter 
description
The Group operates and derives profits from a range of international markets and as such it is subject to tax in 
a number of territories. 
As a consequence, the Group has to consider both the tax risks by country as well as the transfer pricing 
arrangements particularly in the light of the rules agreed between OECD territories developed as part of the 
OECD’s ‘Base Erosion and Profit Shifting’ initiative. 
The Group is also subject to Withholding Tax on remittances from overseas investments. From time to time tax 
rules and treaties change and this can impact the amount of tax the Group has to withhold and pay on such 
remittances.
Currently the Group holds tax provisions of £2.9m (2016: £2.0m) in respect of potential risk of challenge to 
historical arrangements in these areas. 
Judgement is also required in respect of deferred tax on acquired intangibles and other assets and further in 
respect of deferred tax assets in relation to in-territory tax losses. This requires judgement over the likelihood 
of future profits in those territories. 
The Group has currently recognised deferred tax assets of £5.4m (2016: £3.1m) and has unrecognised tax 
losses of £13.1m (2016: £5.2m).
This matter is disclosed in the Audit Committee Report included within the Annual Report. 
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter
We considered developments in international tax rules in the year and reviewed management’s assessment of 
the impact of those developments on the Group. In particular, we reviewed documentation prepared by 
management to support the Group’s global allocation of profits for transfer pricing purposes.
We reviewed management’s calculations of uncertain tax provisions arising from the risk of tax authority 
challenge of historical arrangements and challenged the assumptions made in those calculations. Through 
enquiry with management at Group and in each territory in scope, we noted there were no significant ongoing 
tax authority challenges in any territory.
Our audit procedures also included re-performing provision calculations based on different assumptions to 
measure the potential risk relating to tax authority challenge including the availability of unrecognised tax 
attributes in respect of any such challenges. Further based on our experience assessed of challenges typically 
raised by tax authorities we considered how they might apply to the Group.
Our audit work on the recognition of deferred tax assets included assessing the evidence supporting 
management’s profit forecasts by territory taking into account our knowledge of likely tax authority acceptance 
of any future changes to transfer pricing arrangements and consideration of the appropriateness of the 
assumptions made.
We also considered the disclosure in the financial statements particularly in light of the Financial Reporting 
Council’s thematic review encouraging more transparent reporting between tax charges and accounting profit 
and the factors that could affect that relationship in the future.
Key observations Based on our procedures performed, we are satisfied that the provision for uncertain tax provisions 
appropriately reflects a balanced assessment of the risks and these risks are disclosed appropriately. We are 
also satisfied there is support for future profits in jurisdictions where deferred tax assets are recognised. Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Financial statements
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £1.1m (2016: £1.2m)
Basis for determining materiality We determined this using 5.4% (2016: 5.6%) of an adjusted profit before tax measure being the 
Group loss before tax after adding back non-recurring adjusting items, notably the restructuring 
costs of the TAG programme and the impairment charges (see table below):
 2017 
(£000)
2016
(£000)
Loss before tax (3,163) (4,095)
Add back one off non-recurring items
Impairment charges 14,276 26,509
Transaction costs on completed and pending acquisitions 406 330
Loss/(profit) on disposal of investments 3,712 (1,498)
Restructuring costs 4,982 0
‘Adjusted’ profit before tax 20,213 21,246
Materiality 1,100 1,200
% used 5.4% 5.6%
Rationale for the benchmark applied Loss before tax adjusted for non-recurring adjusting items recognised in the year has been used 
as the base for materiality as it is a key measure of underlying business performance for the 
Group. We have used this adjusted profit measure as it excludes volatility of one-off items from 
our determination, to aid consistency of the scale of the Group in determining our materiality 
base each year.
The materiality level is also 3.5% (2016: 3.3%) of headline profit before tax and 1.2% (2016: 1.2%) 
of equity. The decrease in materiality is directly attributable to the fall in the profitability of the 
business in the year.
Group materiality £1.1m
Audit Committee reporting threshold

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £55,000 (2016: £57,000), as 
well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
The Group operates in a wide range of territories including Europe, Asia and the US, and our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an 
understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the 
Group level. Based on this assessment our Group audit scope focussed on the UK, Russia, Turkey and India (2016: UK, Russia, Turkey and 
India). In addition, we performed specified audit procedures at Moda and the joint venture entity, Sinostar.
These entities represent the principal business units and account for 80% (2016: 85%) of the Group’s revenue and 86% (2016: 90%) of the 
Group’s headline operating profit (£34.8m; 2016: £39.6m) as set out in the Consolidated Income Statement. They were also selected to 
provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at 
each location was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality and ranged 
from £0.6m to £1.0m (2016: £0.6m to £0.8m).
At the Group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were 
no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or 
audit of specified account balances.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that have been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor or a 
senior member of the Group team visits each of the principal locations where the Group audit scope is focussed at least once every two 
years and the most significant of them at least once a year (2017: Russia, India and China; 2016: Russia, India and Turkey). In addition, for 
each component subject to full scope audits, we reviewed and challenged the key issues and audit findings, attended the component close 
meetings and reviewed formal reporting and performed a review of work papers.
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our Auditors’ Report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our Report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements 
of the other information include where we conclude that:
 – Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual 
Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 – Audit Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or
 – Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the Directors’ 
Statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditors in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code.
We have nothing to report 
in respect of these 
matters.

Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors’ Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditors’ Report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
Auditors’ Report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 – the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 – the Strategic report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic report or the Directors’ Report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 – the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
 
We have nothing to report in respect of 
these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain 
disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’

1 General information
ITE Group plc is a company incorporated in the UK. The address of the registered office is given on page 134. The nature of the Group’s 
operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Review on pages 1 to 35 and in note 3.
These financial statements are presented in British pounds Sterling. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting 
policies set out below.
Impact of new accounting standards
The Group has not yet adopted certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards, which have been published 
but are only effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2017. A list of these can be found below:
New, amended and revised Standards Effective date
Amendments to IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ 1 January 2017
Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ 1 January 2018
Clarifications to IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 1 January 2018
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 1 January 2018
Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ 1 January 2019
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 1 January 2019
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group with the exception of the adoption of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, which will replace the current leasing standard, 
IAS 17 ‘Leases’.
IFRS 16 requires all leases to be treated in a consistent way to the current rules on finance leases. This will result in all leases being disclosed 
in the Statement of Financial Position, with the exception of short-term leases, where, for lease terms of less than twelve months, an 
election can be made to account for the expense in line with the payment terms.
This is expected to have a significant impact on both the Group’s Statement of Financial Position, as there will be an increase in lease assets 
and financial liabilities recognised, and the Group’s Income Statement, through a changing of the expense profile and the financial 
statement lines in which the expenses are recognised. The adoption of IFRS 16 will increase the expense charged at the beginning of our 
lease contracts, due to the straight-line operating lease expense charge being replaced by the finance cost approach, which, by its nature is 
front-loaded. This is expected to reduce profit before tax in the first year of adoption. Currently, our operating lease rentals are recognised 
within administrative expenses, but under IFRS 16, these will be classified as finance costs and therefore operating profit is expected to 
increase on adoption. The financial impact of the changes have yet to be quantified by management.
The adoption of IFRS 15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s Income Statement but may lead to a change in the 
Statement of Financial Position. The Group has significant forward bookings, which are currently recognised within trade debtors and 
deferred income at the point at which a contractual obligation to provide the service arises. Under IFRS 15, the deferred income, and 
corresponding debtor, may not be recognised until the earlier of the service being provided and the payment falling due. This may result in 
a material reduction to the deferred income and trade receivables on adoption of the standard. Management is currently in the process of 
assessing the extent of the impact on adoption of the new standard and the financial impact of the changes have yet to be quantified.
2 Basis of accounting
ITE Group plc (‘the Company’) is a UK listed company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to as the ‘Group’. The 
Company is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. In addition, 
the Group has complied with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses. These estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time and are used to make judgements about 
the carrying value of assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from other sources. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to estimates and assumptions are reflected in the 
financial statements in the period in which they are made.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future as disclosed in the Directors’ Report on page 45.
The statements are presented in pounds Sterling and have been prepared under IFRS using the historical cost convention, except for the 
revaluation of financial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out on the following pages.

Financial statements
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of ITE Group plc and the subsidiary undertakings controlled by the Company drawn up to 
30 September each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an 
investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. The interest of non-controlling shareholders is stated 
at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those 
used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-
controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests as at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling 
interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in excess of their 
interest in the subsidiaries equity are allocated against non-controlling interests even if this results in a deficit balance.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of 
the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree. Any costs attributable to the business combination are expensed directly to the Consolidated Income 
Statement. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for resale 
in accordance with IFRS 5 (‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’), which are recognised and measured at fair 
value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If the 
Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business 
combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of 
acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent 
consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes in the fair value of contingent 
consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured as the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net fair value of 
the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at 
least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication 
that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit, pro rata based on the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill on acquisition of a foreign entity is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Intangible assets
Computer software is initially measured at purchase cost. Customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor databases are 
initially measured at fair value. Computer software, customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor databases have a definite 
useful life and are carried at cost or fair value less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to 
allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives are typically between three and ten years for customer 
relationships, for some trademarks up to 20 years and for visitor databases between five and eight years. Computer software is amortised 
over five years.
Impairment of assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to 
determine the extent of the impairment (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the 
Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested 
for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment is recognised immediately as an expense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in 
the Consolidated Income Statement immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the 
impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following 
bases:
Leasehold land and buildings  – term of lease
Plant and equipment  – 4 to 10 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying value amount of the asset and is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence. Significant influence is the power to 
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control over those policies.
A joint venture is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise joint control. Joint control exists when decisions about the 
activities of the entity require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity 
method of accounting. Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at cost as adjusted by 
post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture, less any impairment in the value of individual 
investments. Losses of an associate or joint venture in excess of Group’s interest in that entity (which includes any long-term interests that, 
in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate or joint venture) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has 
incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate or joint venture of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the relevant associate or joint venture. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which 
case an appropriate provision is made for impairment.

Financial statements
Venue advances
Venue advances arise where the Group has advanced funds to venue owners that can be repaid by either offsetting against future venue 
hire or by cash repayment. Where the advance can be settled in cash, the loan balance is measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method where the impact of discounting is material. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Advances that are prepayments of future venue hire and do not permit the repayment of the principal in cash are recognised at cost as 
venue advances and prepayments.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted to 
present value where the effect is material.
Financial Instruments
Classes of financial instruments
The Group aggregates its financial instruments into classes based on their nature and characteristics. The details of financial instruments 
by class are disclosed in note 23 to the accounts.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: investments, cash and cash equivalents, loans and receivables and 
derivative assets at fair value through profit or loss. The classification is determined by management upon initial recognition, and is based 
on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Financial assets are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether its financial assets are to be impaired. Impairment losses are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement where there is objective evidence of impairment. Financial assets are derecognised (in full or partly) when 
the Group’s rights to cash flows from the respective assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has neither exposure to 
the risks inherent in those assets nor entitlement to rewards from them.
Investments
Investments in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market are classified as available-for-sale financial assets and stated at fair 
value. Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 23. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value are recognised in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve with the exception of impairment losses, interest 
calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gain and losses on monetary assets which are recognised directly in 
the Consolidated Income Statement. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve is reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Dividends on available for sale equity instruments are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the Group’s right to receive 
the dividends is established.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and on-demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are 
measured at initial recognition at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value with all 
realised gains or losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. This 
category includes the following classes of financial assets: trade and other receivables and venue advances.
Loans and receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when there is objective evidence 
that the asset is impaired. The estimates are based on specific credit circumstances and the Group’s historical bad receivables experience. 
No interest is charged on the loans and receivables, due to either their short-term nature or specific arrangements in place, and hence the 
effective interest rate method is not applied.
Derivative assets
A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no or little net initial 
investment and is settled at a future date. Derivative assets are classified as at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), unless designated 
in hedged relationships. Derivative assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair 
value at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. These derivatives are 
acquired in full compliance with the Group’s treasury policies.
Financial liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following categories: written put options, bank borrowings, trade and other payables held 
at amortised cost and derivative liabilities through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Written equity options
Any contract with a single or multiple settlement option that contains an obligation for the Group to purchase equity in a subsidiary for cash 
gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of the repurchase price. An amount equal to the liability is recorded in equity on initial 
recognition of a written equity option. The liability is subsequently remeasured through the Consolidated Income Statement.
Where considered significant, the Group’s written equity options are discounted to their appropriate value. The unwinding of the discount is 
charged through the Consolidated Income Statement over the period to exercise.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis 
in the Consolidated Income Statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise. Loan and overdraft interest and associated costs that are considered to be financing in nature are presented as 
financing activities in the cash flow statement.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade payables are 
derecognised in full when the Group is discharged from its obligation, it expires, is cancelled or replaced by a new liability with substantially 
modified terms. Trade and other payables are short-term and there is no interest charged in connection with these, hence the effective 
interest method is not applied.
Derivative liabilities
A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in an underlying variable, requires no or little net initial 
investment and is settled at a future date. Derivative liabilities are classified as FVTPL. Derivative liabilities are measured at initial recognition 
at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each financial year with the resulting gains and losses 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. These derivatives are acquired in full compliance with the Group’s treasury policies.
Hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. The Group 
uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge these exposures
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair 
value at the end of each financial year. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement immediately unless the 
derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the Consolidated Income 
Statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates its derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges. A 
derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than twelve months 
and it is not expected to be realised or settled within twelve months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. At the inception of the hedge and on 
an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in 
offsetting changes in the fair values of cash flows of the hedged item.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured 
to their fair value at the end of each financial year. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and 
qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement as investment revenue 
or finance costs respectively. Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the Consolidated Income Statement in the periods when the 
hedged item is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, in the same line of the Consolidated Income Statement as the recognised 
hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, 
or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is 
recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.

Financial statements
The Group’s use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s financial policies.
Fair values
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between 
informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
The Group determines the fair value of its financial instruments using market prices for quoted instruments and widely accepted valuation 
techniques for other instruments.
Valuation techniques include discounted cash flows, standard valuation models based on market parameters, dealer quotes for similar 
instruments and use of comparable arm’s length transactions.
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business net of 
discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised on completion of an event. Contractually committed revenues, billings and cash received in advance, and directly 
attributable costs relating to future events, are deferred. The amounts deferred are included in the Statement of Financial Position as 
deferred income and prepayments respectively until the event has completed. If an event is anticipated to make a loss, then the prepaid 
event costs in excess of the deferred income held in the Statement of Financial Position at the end of a financial year are written off in full.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Barter transactions
Where barter transactions occur between advertising and exhibition space and the revenue can be measured reliably, revenues and costs 
are recognised in the Income Statement.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax charge is based on the taxable profit for the year using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the balance sheet date. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of 
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that does not affect the tax profit or the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets 
and liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or their contractual rate where 
applicable. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the end of each financial year are retranslated at the rates 
of exchange prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was 
determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Gains and losses 
arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in income for the period. Exchange 
differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in income for the period except for 
differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains or losses are recognised directly in equity. For such 
non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Details of the Group’s accounting policies for forward contracts and options are included in the policy on derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the monthly Income Statements of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for each month, 
and each Statement of Financial Position at the rates ruling at the end of each financial year. Exchange differences arising are classified as 
equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the 
period in which the operation is disposed of.
Under the exemption permitted from IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’, cumulative translation differences for all 
foreign operations prior to 1 October 2004 have been treated as zero. Consequently, any gain or loss on disposal will exclude translation 
differences that arose prior to 1 October 2004.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
Employee Share Ownership Trust
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT). Shares in the Company held by 
the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to profit or loss as 
incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity 
holders.
Pension and other retirement benefits
The Group operates defined contribution pension plans in multiple regions around the Group. Contributions payable are charged to the 
Income Statement as they fall due as an operating expense.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’. IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 
that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of 
non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and 
adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’s best estimate.
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such 
a basis. Benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Financial statements
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, a number of estimates have been made by management. Those that have the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements or have the most risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
There are a number of estimates management considers when determining value in use, most significantly the growth rates applied to 
future cash flows and the discount rates used to derive the present value of those cash flows. Growth rates reflect management’s view of 
the long-term forecast rates of growth, using third party sources such as the International Monetary Fund where appropriate. Discount 
rates are selected to reflect the risk adjusted cost of capital for the respective territories. The most significant area of estimation uncertainty 
relates to forecast cash flows at each CGU. Forecast cash flows are based on Board-approved budgets and plans.
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at 30 September 2017 is £92.6m (2016: £97.9m) and £61.9m (2016: £70.8m) respectively.
Taxation
The Group operates and derives profits from a range of international markets, and as such it is subject to tax in a number of territories. 
International and domestic tax rules are inherently complex, frequently subject to change, and are not always applied consistently by tax 
authorities in different jurisdictions. The Group complies with all tax legislation in the local territories and does not have any significant tax 
authority challenges or investigations in any territory. The Group actively monitors developments in international and domestic tax rules to 
which it is subject and continually assesses the potential impact of measures announced as part of the OECD’s ‘Base Erosion and Profit Shifting’.
The Group is also subject to withholding tax on remittances from overseas investments. From time to time tax rules and treaties change 
and this can impact the amount of tax the Group has to withhold and pay on such remittances.
The Group takes a considered view of changes to tax legislation, considers a range of potential outcomes, and models the potential financial 
impact of those outcomes. The Group holds tax provisions in respect of potential challenge to historical arrangements, on which there are 
no current ongoing investigations. However, the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that any eventual resolution could differ 
from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the Group’s results and future cash flows.
Equity option liabilities
The valuation of equity option liabilities held over own equity, of £12.6m (2016: £20.6m), requires management to estimate the fair value of 
the liabilities to be settled in future years to acquire non-controlling interests in subsidiary companies. The liabilities are to be settled based 
on a multiple of future years’ EBITDA. The EBITDA estimates are based on the latest budgeted information grown in line with projected GDP 
growth rates for the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. The valuation of the equity option liabilities is highly sensitive to changes to 
forecast results, given that the equity options are based on multiples of 7.5x-12.5x EBITDA. A £100,000 movement in EBITDA in the relevant 
period could therefore result in up to a £1,250,000 movement in the equity option liability valuation.
3 Segmental information
The Group has identified reportable segments based on financial information used by the Senior Operating Board in allocating resources 
and making strategic decisions. The Senior Operating Board (consisting of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief 
Operating Officer, Strategy Director and HR Director) is considered to be the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Group evaluates 
performance on the basis of headline profit or loss before tax.
The Group’s reportable segments are operational business units and groups of events that are managed separately, either based on 
geographic location or as portfolios of events. During the year the Group has made changes to the reportable segments, adding a new 
Brands segment, which includes our Africa Oil Week, Breakbulk and Moda portfolios and is managed by the Brands Managing Director. This 
replaces the Rest of the World segment reported in the prior year, which also previously included central costs and other unallocated costs 
that are now presented separately, as a reconciling segment.
The products and services offered by each business unit are identical across the Group. The revenue and headline profit before tax are 
attributable to the Group’s one principal activity, the organisation of trade exhibitions, conferences and related activities and can be 
analysed by operating segment as follows:

The Group operates and derives profits from a range of international markets, and as such it is subject to tax in a number of territories. The 
Group actively monitors developments in international and domestic tax rules to which it is subject and is currently assessing the potential 
impact of measures announced as part of the OECD’s ‘Base Erosion and Profit Shifting’. It is possible that changes in tax rules will have an 
impact of the Group’s effective tax rate in future periods.

 ITE Group plc
 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The 
recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are 
those regarding the discount rates, projected future cash flows and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the 
CGUs. The pre-tax discount rates applied to the CGUs are between 10% and 28% (2016: 10% and 31%). The large variance in discount rates 
applied reflects the differences in risks inherent in the regions in which the CGUs operate.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based upon the most recent one-year financial plans approved by the Board and extrapolates  
the planned cash flows. Central costs are allocated to the CGUs to the extent that they are considered to contribute to the cash inflow 
generation of the CGUs. The allocation has increased in the year, reflecting the shift to a more centralised operating model. Growth rates 
beyond the detailed plans are based on IMF forecasts of GDP growth rates in the local markets, with management judgements applied to 
the first three years. These growth rates, of between 1% and 8% (2016: between 1% and 8%), do not exceed the long-term growth rates for 
the economies in which these business operate.
Individually significant CGUs
India
The India CGU has goodwill and intangible assets with a carrying value of £24.0m. The intangible assets for the Indian business have a finite 
useful life and are amortised in accordance with the Group’s amortisation policy disclosed in note 2. The recoverable amount of the 
goodwill and intangible assets was determined using the value in use calculation using the following information:
 – Cash flow forecasts based on the 2018 financial plan approved by the Board which assumes exchange rates at September 2017 levels.
 – These forecasts are extrapolated based on assumed long-term growth rate for the Indian business of 7.9%, based on IMF forecasts of 
GDP growth in India.
 – A pre-tax discount rate of 16.1%.
Using the above methodology, the total carrying value exceeded the recoverable amount by £6.0m resulting in the need to recognise an 
impairment. Recent trading has improved, but refinements to our value in use calculations, when coupled with existing low headroom, has 
resulted in an impairment. The refinements included an increase in the allocation of central costs to the CGU, reflecting the shift to a more 
centralised operating model, together with an update to the discount rate methodology. Headroom was limited due to the impairment of 
the goodwill and intangible assets to their value in use in the prior period.
Breakbulk
The Breakbulk CGU has goodwill and intangible assets with a carrying value of £28.0m. The intangible assets for the Breakbulk business 
have a finite useful life and are amortised in accordance with the Group’s amortisation policy disclosed in note 2. The recoverable amount 
of the goodwill and intangible assets was determined using the value in use calculation using the following information:
 – Cash flow forecasts based on the 2018 financial plan approved by the Board which assumes exchange rates at September 2017 levels.
 – These forecasts are extrapolated based on assumed long-term growth rate for the Breakbulk business of 1.7%, based on IMF forecasts 
of GDP growth in Belgium and the US, the markets in which the CGU’s largest events are typically held each year.
 – A pre-tax discount rate of 10.2%.
Using the above methodology, the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by £5.3m. Sensitivity analysis has been carried 
out considering reasonably possible changes to the discount rate and the forecast cash flows as outlined below. A 2% increase in the 
discount rate would decrease the value in use of the Breakbulk CGU by £6.1m, which would result in a potential impairment of £0.8m.  
A reasonably possible change in the forecast cash flows would not result in the need to recognise an impairment charge.
Impairment of goodwill
India
As noted above, an impairment loss of £6.0m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of goodwill in India, 
within the Asia segment.
Turkey
An impairment loss of £2.5m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of goodwill in Turkey, within the Eastern 
& Southern Europe segment. Recent trading has improved in Turkey, but refinements to our value in use calculations, discussed above, 
when coupled with existing low headroom have resulted in an impairment being recognised. Prior to the refinements, headroom at the 
Turkey CGU was lower as a result of the adverse macro-economic and geopolitical conditions the country has faced in recent years.
Africa Oil Week (AOW)
An impairment loss of £3.5m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of goodwill (£2.4m) and intangible 
assets (£1.1m) in AOW, within the Brands segment. The impairment loss in AOW is also as a result of the refinements made to our value in 
use calculations. Headroom at the CGU was lower prior to the methodology changes, following the significant downturn in the oil price in 
2015 which adversely affected our AOW oil show in South Africa. The event runs annually in October and the edition that ran last month 
exceeded management’s expectations.
China
An impairment loss of £0.6m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of goodwill (£0.3m) and intangible 
assets (£0.3m) in China, within the Asia segment. This arose due to the cessation of trading at The Hub during the year, resulting in the write 
off in full of the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets held.
The Group’s annual impairment review identified no impairments at any other CGU.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate and growth rates used. The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis 
taking into consideration the impact on these assumptions arising from a range of reasonably possible trading and economic scenarios. 
The scenarios have been performed separately for each CGU with the sensitivities summarised as follows:
 – An increase in the discount rate by 2%.
 – A decrease of 10% on forecast cash flows over the term for all CGUs.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no further impairment would result from either an increase in the discount rates or a decrease in 
forecast cash flows in any CGU other than in those CGUs disclosed above which have had their headroom impaired to nil and at the 
Breakbulk CGU, as discussed above.
13 Goodwill acquired through business combinations
Gehua
On 9 December 2016, ITE’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ITE Asia Exhibitions Limited, acquired a 70% holding in ITE Gehua Exhibitions Co Ltd 
(Gehua), a company incorporated in Shanghai, for consideration of £10.8m.
Gehua is a Shanghai-based business, founded in 2001, that runs a portfolio of complementary exhibitions in China spanning Textile and 
Clothing, Auto Parts and Accessories, Mechanical Equipment, Gifts, and Food – attracting both domestic and international exhibitors 
and visitors.
During the period the Group incurred transaction costs on the Gehua acquisition of £0.1m, which are included within administrative expenses.
Details of the fair values of the net assets acquired, and the goodwill arising, are presented as follows:

The values used in accounting for the identifiable assets and liabilities of these acquisitions are provisional in nature at the balance sheet 
date. If necessary, adjustments will be made to these carrying values and the related goodwill, within twelve months of the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition of £9.8m reflects the strategic value in increasing the Group’s presence in China and the expected synergies 
with the Group’s existing industry sectors and Chinese operations. None of the acquired goodwill and intangibles are expected to qualify 
for tax deductions in the UK.
The acquired business has contributed £3.0m to Group revenue and a profit of £1.0m since acquisition. If the acquisition had occurred on 
1 October 2016 it would have contributed £4.3m to revenue and £1.7m to profit.

The Group’s investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, recognised initially at cost. The 
carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise ITE’s share of the profit or loss of the associate or joint venture after the date of 
acquisition. ITE’s share of the profit or loss of the associate or joint venture is recognised in the income statement. Distributions received 
from the associate or joint venture also reduce the carrying amount of the investment.
During the year the Group increased its investment in its joint venture, ECMI, by £0.2m. The Group received dividends from Sinostar of 
approximately £3.5m, from ITE MF of approximately £0.3m and from ECMI of approximately £0.1m.
The carrying value of interests in associates and joint ventures have been assessed for impairment at the year end. The recoverable 
amounts of each investment were determined from value in use calculations, using assumptions consistent with those applied in the 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment review detailed in note 12. The review resulted in an impairment charge of £1.7m being 
recognised on the interest held in our Indonesian joint venture, due to uncertainties regarding the future trading performance of  
the business.

20 Bank borrowings
During the year the Group’s multi-currency revolving credit facility reduced to £86.0m (30 September 2016: £93.0m), committed through to 
31 March 2019. The facility amortises by £7.0m in June 2018. The facility was secured by a guarantee between a number of Group 
companies.
The Group’s borrowings were arranged at floating interest rates, thus exposing the Group to interest rate risk. Drawdowns under the facility 
bear interest at interbank rates of interest plus a margin of between 2.15% and 2.65%. The Group took out interest rate swaps during the 
prior period, totalling £40.0m, which reduced the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Refer to note 23 for further details. During the 
year ended 30 September 2017, the average interest rate on the Group’s borrowings approximated 3.0% (2016: 2.8%).
The total drawdowns under the facility of £72.9m at 30 September 2017 were denominated in Sterling (£71.0m) (2016: £73.0m) and US 
Dollars (£1.9m) (2016: £1.6m). The Directors estimate that the carrying value of the borrowings approximates their fair value. At 
30 September 2017 the Group had £13.1m (2016: £18.4m) of undrawn committed facilities.
On 22 November 2017 a refinancing of the Group’s external debt facility was completed. Refer to note 30 for further details.

National Insurance on share options is calculated by reference to the employer’s National Insurance cost on the potential gain based on the 
difference between the exercise price and share price for those share options where the share price exceeds the exercise price at 
30 September 2017.
The lease provision relates to the spreading of a reduced rent period over the full period of the lease and the recognition of onerous leases 
in respect of unused office space.

The Group seeks to minimise the effects of foreign currency and interest rate risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the 
risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board. Compliance with policies and 
exposure limits is reviewed by the Board on a continuous basis. The Group does not enter into financial instruments, including derivative 
financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Fasteners and Scoop equity option liabilities have not been discounted as the effect is not material. The options held in respect of ECMI 
and Debindo are valued at £nil.

Fair value hierarchy
The following table categorises the Group’s financial instruments which are held at fair value into one of three levels to reflect the degree to 
which observable inputs are used in determining their fair values:
 – Level 1: Fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 – Level 2: Fair value measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability 
either directly or indirectly.
 – Level 3: Fair values measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

Total 24,233 – 3,662 20,571
Level 1 financial instruments are valued based on quoted bid prices in an active market. Level 2 financial instruments are measured by 
discounted cash flow. For interest rate swaps future cash flows are estimated based on forward interest rates (from observable yield curves 
at the end of the reporting period) and contract interest rates, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the various counterparties. 
For foreign exchange contracts future cash flows are estimated based on forward exchange rates (from observable forward exchange rates 
at the end of the reporting period) and contract forward rates, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the various 
counterparties. For equity instruments that are classified as Level 3 financial instruments the carrying value approximates to fair value.
For the Level 3 equity options, these are valued based on a multiple as contractually agreed of forecast future EBITDA for each relevant 
option. The key unobservable inputs relate to the EBITDA multiple (ranging from 7.5x to 12.5x) and the forecast future EBITDA for each 
entity.

All Level 3 amounts credited to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year are attributable to the change in unrealised gains or losses 
relating to those liabilities held at the end of the reporting period.
The Level 3 inputs are highly sensitive to the EBITDA forecasts. Given that the EBITDA multiples range from 7.5x to 12.5x, a movement in the 
forecast EBITDA results for the relevant period could have a significant impact on the equity option valuation.
Financial risk management
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to a number of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency and interest rate), 
credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. This note presents the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks. The Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for measuring and managing risks can be found in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 35.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has 
established policies to identify and analyse risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and 
adherence to limits.
Market risk management
Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of 
financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable 
parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group 
enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to both. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies and therefore exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising foreign currency forward contracts.

Foreign currency forward contracts
As at 30 September 2017 the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that the Group has committed to 
amounted to £23.4m (2016: £45.6m). These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the next 24 months 
and are renewed on a revolving basis as required, subject to not committing the Group to less than six months or more than 36 months in 
the future.
At 30 September 2017, the fair value of these derivatives is estimated to be a net liability of approximately £2.3m (2016: net liability of 
£3.3m). These amounts are based on market valuations.
Interest rate risk management
As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, other than cash, the Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially 
independent of changes in market interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its borrowings at floating interest rates. 
This risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate level of floating interest rate borrowings and through the use of interest 
rate swap contracts. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring the most 
cost-effective hedging strategies are applied.
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section of this note.

Interest rate swap contracts
With effect from 30 April 2016, the Group entered into two interest rate swap agreements to exchange the floating rate of interest paid on 
its bank borrowings for fixed rates on the first £40.0m of the Group’s GBP debt, calculated on agreed notional principal amounts of £20.0m 
each. Under the agreements, one month GBP LIBOR is exchanged for fixed rates of 0.66% with a maturity date of 31 March 2018 and 0.71% 
with a maturity date of 31 March 2019.
The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates 
on borrowings. The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously each month.
These arrangements were designed to address significant interest rate exposures over the next 18 months and were expected to affect the 
Consolidated Income Statement over that time period.
Subsequent to the year end, on completion of the refinancing of the Group’s external debt (see note 30), the interest rate swaps have been 
terminated.
Credit risk management
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its contractual obligations. The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and 
cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, venue advances and derivative financial instruments. The Group considers its maximum 
exposure to credit risk to be as follows:
2017  
£000
2016 
£000
Cash and cash equivalents 23,321 15,508
Trade receivables (net of bad debt provision) 44,133 32,499
Venue advances and prepayments 6,128 6,267
Other receivables 3,917 3,634
77,499 57,908
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with 
creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group’s objective is to ensure all 
customers have paid before any service is provided to them. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being  
large and unrelated.
The ageing profile of the Group’s trade receivables and the details of the Group’s allowances for doubtful receivables can be seen below.
The credit risk on liquid funds arises due to where the liquid funds are held. The territories in which ITE operates do not always have banks 
with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies such as Moody’s and Fitch. The Group aims to minimise the 
exposure to credit risk by minimising the level of cash held in such banks. The Group’s exposure and credit ratings of its counterparties  
are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions.

Management review debtors based on when an event has been held. The Group invoices on receipt of signed contracts, with payments 
typically due in stages in the lead up to events. Any overdue amounts, after the stage of payment due date, are reviewed and chased.
Trade receivables not past due represent contracts with customers for future events. It therefore includes receivables for events taking 
place in 2018. Customers are typically due to settle the full contractual amount at least 30 days before an event. The increase in trade 
receivables not yet due is a result of the increased focus on customer retention and early booking initiatives.
The trade receivables amounts presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, 
estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience, specific credit issues and their assessment of the current economic 
environment. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries and geographical areas and the 
Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the Group’s 
customer base, including default risk of the industry and country, in which the customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
The Group establishes an allowance for doubtful debts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade receivables when 
there is objective evidence that the debt will not be collected in full. The allowance is recognised and measured as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows. Where material, it is discounted at the effective interest rate 
computed at initial recognition. The main component of this allowance is a specific loss component that relates to individually significant 
exposure on shows which have taken place but the debt has not been collected in full. This allowance is determined by reference to the 
specific circumstances of each show and past experience.
The details of the movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables are shown below.

Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as they fall due. Such risk may result from inadequate market 
depth or disruption or refinancing problems. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. They 
have built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding 
and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring continuity of funding for operational needs through cash deposits and debt facilities as 
appropriate.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return  
to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash 
equivalents and bank loan which are disclosed in note 19 and note 20 and equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent, comprising 
issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 25 and in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in the above table. The following is the analysis of deferred tax balances for

£000
Deferred tax liabilities (12,494) (12,675)
Deferred tax assets 5,411 3,070
(7,083) (9,605)
As at 30 September 2017, the Group has unused tax losses of £19.0m (2016: £12.0m) available for offset against future profits. No deferred 
tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses in either year due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. These losses may 
be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £33.0m (2016: £13.0m). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences 
because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised (for the carry forward of unused tax losses, accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences) 
to the extent that, based on a review of expected profits, that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
unused losses and tax credits can be utilised.
The Finance (No 2) Act 2015, which provides for reductions in the main rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 
and to 18% effective from 1 April 2020, was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. These rate reductions have been reflected in the 
calculation of deferred tax at the balance sheet date.
The Finance Act 2016 provides for reductions in the main rate of corporation tax to 17% effective from 1 April 2020 was substantively 
enacted on 15 September 2016. It has not had a material effect on the calculation of deferred tax at the balance sheet date.

During the year, the Group issued 2,299,379 shares of 1p each as part of the consideration paid to acquire a 70% shareholding in Gehua 
(note 13).
During the year, the Group exercised its put option in respect of the acquisition of the final 25% shareholding in Africa Oil Week. The 
consideration was settled through the allotment and issue of 2,791,120 ordinary shares of 1p each.
The Company announced a scrip dividend alternative for the year ended 30 September 2016 final dividend, allowing shareholders to elect 
to receive their dividend in the form of new ordinary shares. As a result of this, 1,605,813 new ordinary shares of 1p each were issued. 
The Company also announced a scrip dividend alternative for the year ended 30 September 2017 interim dividend, allowing shareholders 
to elect to receive their dividend in the form of new ordinary shares. As a result of this, 444,289 new ordinary shares of 1p each were issued.
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 
17 November 1998, shareholders approved the establishment of the ITE Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT). The terms of 
the ESOT allow the trustees to transfer shares to employees who exercise options under the Company’s Share Option Schemes, to grant 
options to employees and to accumulate shares by buying in the market or subscribing for shares at market value. The ESOT is capable of 
holding a maximum of 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. The ESOT reserve arises in connection with the Employee Share 
Ownership Trust. The amount of the reserve represents the deduction in arriving at shareholders’ funds for the consideration paid for the 
Company’s shares purchased by the Trust which had not vested unconditionally in employees at the end of each financial year.
The ESOT held 2,783,585 shares in ITE Group plc at 30 September 2017 (2016: 2,869,603 shares). During the year 1,908,175 nominal share 
options under the Employees PSP were granted against ESOT held shares. No shares (2016: none) were purchased for the ESOT. The 
market value of the ordinary shares held by the ESOT at 30 September 2017 was £5.0m (2016: £4.7m).
The Company has agreed to make available to the ESOT an interest-free loan of up to £12.5m for the purpose of buying shares. At 
30 September 2017, the amount of the loan drawn down was £11.6m. The ITE Group plc Company profit and loss account and balance 
sheet include the results of the ESOT for the year ended 30 September 2017.
The trustees have waived their current and future rights to all dividend entitlement on the shares held by the ESOT. 86,018 options were 
exercised from ESOT during the year. The total consideration for the options exercised from ESOT was £70,000. 8,249,626 of outstanding 
options are to be settled by ESOT, so all shares held by the ESOT are under option as at 30 September 2017. Details of the options in issue 
and their exercise dates can be seen at note 28 to the accounts.

28 Share-based payments
The Company operates two share option schemes.
Share option plans
The Company operates a share option plan for certain employees of the Group. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average 
quoted market price of the Company’s share on the date of grant. The vesting period is typically three years and the options are exercisable 
up to ten years from granting. The options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Performance share plans
The Company operates a Performance Share Plan (PSP) for executives and staff. Awards under the PSP are at an exercise value of 1p. 
Awards can be made to an employee over shares up to a maximum of 100% of base salary, or 150% for the Chief Executive Officer and 
120% for the Chief Financial Officer, each year based on market value. The vesting period is three years and awards are exercisable up to 
ten years from the date of grant. For conditional awards the vesting is automatic on the satisfaction of performance targets. The options 
are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. The awards are also subject to a performance target. Further details 
of the performance targets can be found in the Report on Remuneration on pages 62 to 72.

Financial statements
These separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting 
standards, including Financial Reporting 102 – ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland’ 
(‘FRS 102’), and with the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
As permitted by FRS 102, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payments and related party transactions. The Directors’ Report, Corporate Governance Statement and Directors’ 
Remuneration Report disclosures are on pages 43, 41, and 55, respectively, of this Report.
The Company has taken advantage of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own profit and loss account in these 
financial statements. The Company has also adopted the following disclosure exemptions:
 – the requirement to present a statement of cash flows and related notes; and
 – financial instrument disclosures, including:
 – categories of financial instruments,
 – items of income, expenses, gains or losses relating to financial instruments, and
 – exposure to and management of financial risks.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding 
year.
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future. 
The Company therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
Investments
Fixed asset investments including subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for any impairment.
Intangible assets
Trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and have a definite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives are 
up to 20 years.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors and creditors
Trade debtors and creditors are stated at their nominal value. Trade debtors are reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to 
profit or loss.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised 
in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it 
can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing 
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the 
revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements. Neither is deferred tax 
recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and 
when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation 
of monetary assets are included in profit or loss for the period.
Employee Share Ownership Trust
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT). Shares in the Company held by the 
ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to profit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of 
non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest 
and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’s best estimate.
Details of the Company’s equity-settled share-based payments are included in note 28 to the Group accounts.
2 Profit/(loss) for the year

During the year, the Group exercised its put option in respect of the acquisition of an additional 25% shareholding in Africa Oil Week. The 
consideration was settled through the allotment and issue of 2,791,120 ordinary shares of 1p each.
The Company announced a scrip dividend alternative for the year ended 30 September 2016 final dividend, allowing shareholders to elect 
to receive their dividend in the form of new ordinary shares. As a result of this, 1,605,813 new ordinary shares of 1p each were issued. The 
Company also announced a scrip dividend alternative for the year ended 30 September 2017 interim dividend, allowing shareholders to 
elect to receive their dividend in the form of new ordinary shares. As a result of this, 444,289 new ordinary shares of 1p each were issued.
No (2016: nil) ordinary shares were issued in respect of Directors’ remuneration. The total consideration for the shares issued was £nil 
(2016: £nil).
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 
17 November 1998, shareholders approved the establishment of the ITE Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT). The terms of the 
ESOT allow the trustees to transfer shares to employees who exercise options under the Company’s Share Option Schemes, to grant 
options to employees and to accumulate shares by buying in the market or subscribing for shares at market value. The ESOT is capable of 
holding a maximum of 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. The ESOT reserve arises in connection with the Employee Share 
Ownership Trust. The amount of the reserve represents the deduction in arriving at shareholders’ funds for the consideration paid for the 
Company’s shares purchased by the Trust which had not vested unconditionally in employees at the end of each financial year.
The ESOT held 2,783,585 shares in ITE Group plc at 30 September 2017 (2016: 2,869,603 shares). During the year no share options and 
1,908,175 nominal share options under the Employees Performance Share Plan were granted against ESOT held shares. No shares (2016: 
none) were purchased for the ESOT. The market value of the ordinary shares held by the ESOT at 30 September 2017 was £5.0m (2016: 
£4.7m).
The Company has agreed to make available to the ESOT an interest-free loan of up to £12.5m for the purpose of buying shares. At 
30 September 2017, the amount of the loan drawn down was £11.6m. The ITE Group plc Company-only profit and loss account and balance 
sheet include the results of the ESOT for the year ended 30 September 2017. The trustees have waived their current and future rights to all 
dividend entitlement on the shares held by the ESOT. 86,018 options were exercised from ESOT during the year. The total consideration for 
the options exercised from ESOT was £70,000. 8,249,626 of outstanding options are to be settled by ESOT, so all shares held by the ESOT 
are under option as at 30 September 2017. Details of the options in issue and their exercise dates can be seen at note 28 to the 
consolidated accounts.
The Company’s profit and loss reserve is £112.2m (2016: £126.2m). Part of this balance is non-distributable as it does not meet the 
requirements for recognition as distributable reserves, therefore the distributable reserves of the Company, and therefore the Group, are 
£16.8m (2016: £46.6m).

This method of payment removes the risk of delay or loss of dividend cheques in the post and ensures that your account is credited on the 
due date.
SCRIP dividend
A SCRIP dividend allows the Company to issue a dividend to the appropriate shareholders while retaining the relevant capital within the 
Company. Rather than receiving a cash dividend, the shareholder can elect to receive the equivalent value of shares as newly allotted 
shares, reducing the amount of cash reserves paid out by the Company.
Share dealing services
The Company’s Registrar, Equiniti Limited, offers a telephone and internet dealing service, Shareview, which provides a simple and 
convenient way of buying and selling shares. For telephone dealings call 03456 037 037 between 8.00am and 4.30pm, Monday to Friday, 
and for internet dealings log onto www.shareview.co.uk/dealing.
Electronic communications
Shareholders can elect to receive shareholder documents electronically by registering with Shareview at www.shareview.co.uk. This will 
save on printing and distribution costs, creating environmental benefits. When you register, you will be sent an email notification to say 
when shareholder documents are available on our website and you will be provided with a link to that information. When registering, you 
will need your shareholder reference number which can be found on your share certificate or proxy form. Please contact Equiniti if you 
require any assistance or further information. Financial statements Governance Strategic report
