non-financial services through our business support programme, 
which features various opportunities for training sessions, individual 
consultations, useful business tools and a renowned annual business

non-financial services to early-stage companies.

Focus on financial services 
TBC Bank is focused on financial services activities and 99.7% of 
our total assets relate to banking, insurance, leasing, brokerage 
and corporate advisory services. We have several small 
subsidiaries, including card processing and a self-service terminal 
operating company, which play a supporting role to strengthen  
our core business. Over the past 25 years, we have built a sound, 
straightforward and resilient operating model, as well as gained 
strong business expertise and market knowledge. Our clear 
strategic focus and experience provides a significant advantage 
and solid basis for our future growth and development, and clearly 
differentiates us from our peers. 
Best-in-class digital channels 
We continue to leverage our leading digital capabilities to achieve 
business growth and operating efficiency. TBC Bank has world-
class digital banking channels, which include the award-winning 
internet and mobile banking applications, a call centre and a vast 
network of ATMs, POS terminals and self-service terminals. Due 
to our continued efforts, the number of retail transactions 
conducted via digital channels continues to grow, resulting in a 
retail offloading ratio as high as 88.3% in December 2017. At the 
same time, we continue to innovate and enhance our digital 
product offerings. This year, we have developed and introduced  
the first Georgian-speaking chatbot, Ti Bot, using Facebook 
Messenger. It can understand questions and provide helpful 
answers about currency exchange rates, various product 
offerings, branch and ATM locations, as well as conduct P2P 
transactions and purchase cinema tickets. We are also proud  
that our digital capabilities gained global recognition and Global

regional (CEE) and country awards in many digital  
banking categories.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
We established TBC Bank in 1992, shortly after Georgia had 
restored its independence following the collapse of the Soviet 
Union. We have since grown side-by-side with our country 
throughout its economic and political development. As Georgia 
lacked a functioning financial system at the time of TBC Bank’s 
inception, we became true pioneers in establishing a well-run 
banking institution with a long-term perspective.
We set ourselves a challenging task: to build a banking business 
that would earn trust and credibility with our customers. For that 
reason, from the outset, we adopted a customer-centric approach 
in our business. To help achieve our goal, we have sought to 
employ people who share our mindset and have created a strong, 
committed team with common values.
Over the past 25 years, TBC Bank has been growing together with 
its customers, supporting them in meeting their financial needs, 
helping them to achieve success and contributing to the entire 
country’s development.
Today, we take pride in being the largest privately-owned bank in 
the region
1
. In addition to our strong team spirit, we attribute our 
continued success to having one of the most recognised brands in 
Georgia, a superior customer experience, the best multichannel 
network and a full range of innovative services and products.
Strategy
We believe that TBC Bank’s future success depends on its digital 
competence, as customers are increasingly shifting towards digital 
banking. The banking industry is entering a digital era and we need 
to stay abreast of upcoming changes. Last year , we announced an 
updated strategy to become the best digital financial services 
company in the region
1
. We remain committed to this strategy.
We are also focused on our customer experience. We have made 
significant efforts to anticipate our customers’ needs and offer 
them the best products and services. We measure customer 
satisfaction regularly to identify areas that need improvement,  
and we work diligently to enhance our offerings. We pride 
ourselves on having the highest customer satisfaction scores in 
the Georgian banking sector
2
, as well as on holding leading 
positions in the country’s broader retail industry. 
We will continue to use our strengths to keep growing with the 
market and more actively engage with our customers by creating 
innovative, value-added solutions for them. At the same time, we 
will remain focused on operating efficiency and automation to 
become more agile in our fast-changing environment.
Key achievements
In May, we successfully completed the integration of Bank Republic, 
well ahead of schedule. As a result, we have expanded our 
distribution network and increased our client base by around 
380,000 customers, all of whom now have full access to our 
innovative range of products and services. 
Another significant development in 2017 was the inclusion of our 
shares into the FTSE 250 Index, reflecting the improved liquidity 
of our shares and the increased valuation of our business. Since 
then, we have begun to benefit from a more diversified shareholder 
base and are seeing greater interest from potential investors.
Dear shareholders,
It is with great pleasure that  
I present our 2017 annual report.
As the year also marks our 25th 
anniversary, I would like to reflect  
on where we started and how far  
we have come over this past quarter 
of a century.

Governance Additional Information Financial Statements Strategic Report  
Overview
Strategic Rreport  
Strategy & Performance
Over the past year , we made good progress towards our updated 
strategy of becoming the best digital financial services company in 
the region
1.
 The number of transactions and sales conducted in 
remote channels continue to grow rapidly, as do internet and mobile 
banking penetration levels. We also launched the first Georgian-
speaking chatbot,Ti Bot, which allows customers to conduct simple 
banking transactions via Facebook Messenger . It also provides 
useful information about our products, as well as entertainment 
events and weather forecasts. The chatbot has been well received 
by our customers and has become a highly popular channel, 
attracting more than 124,000 users since its launch in March 2017.
Our strong operating performance during 2017 translated into robust 
financial results. For 2017, TBC Bank recorded an underlying net 
profit of GEL 369.2 million, up 35.1% year-on-year . In addition, our 
underlying return on equity and return on assets stood at a respective 
21.4% and 3.2%. In terms of our loan book, our loan portfolio grew by 
16.2% year-on-year , leading to a market share of 38.2%
3
.
Operating environment
2017 was another remarkable year in Georgia’s continued 
development. The country’s citizens were granted visa-free access 
to the Schengen zone, which is a significant advancement and will 
support our deeper integration with the EU countries. Visa 
liberalisation would also have a positive impact on tourism, leading 
to increased awareness about Georgia and greater tourist inflow 
from the EU. The country is already being promoted as one of the 
best places to visit, including by many reputable magazines
4
, which 
have named it in their lists of the top 10 tourist destinations.
In 2017, Georgia recorded strong economic growth with GDP 
reaching 5.0%
5
, which is one of the largest increases among 
countries in the CIS and Eastern Europe. This improvement was 
mainly driven by high tourism income and an increase in net 
exports. Another positive factor was the improvement in the current 
account deficit, which decreased to 7.1% of GDP
6
 for 9M 2017, 
compared with 11.2% a year earlier , indicating that the country is 
experiencing more sustainable economic development. 
Other important developments in 2017 included the official opening 
of the long-awaited Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway and the beginning of 
a new phase of development at Anaklia Deep Sea Port, where 
construction work started in December . These projects will 
strengthen Georgia’s position as a regional tourism and 
transportation hub, as it offers the shortest route to connect the 
economies of China and countries in Central Asia to those of 
European countries. These transportation links, coupled with free 
trade agreements with the EU, China and all major economic 
powers in the broader region, will further support the growth of 
Georgia’s economy and diversify trade exports.
Finally, Georgia regained its position among the top 10 countries in 
the World Bank’s Doing Business 2018 ranking, moving up by seven 
positions to ninth place to become the best performer in Europe 
and Central Asia. This outstanding performance in these rankings 
highlights the government’s continued efforts to improve the 
business environment and to make Georgia one of the world’s 
most attractive places to do business.
Governance
TBC Bank is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance and business transparency. Our experienced Board of 
Directors takes the leading role in framing our strategy, 
overseeing our risk management and challenging our 
performance. With their diverse and unique skillsets, our 
Directors help to guide our strategic development and create 
sustainable value for our stakeholders.
I would like to thank all our Directors for their active involvement 
and valuable contribution towards our achievements in 2017.  
I firmly believe that, together, we are well positioned to realise  
our strategy of becoming the best digital financial services 
company in the region
1
. 
As already announced, two non-executive Directors, Stefano 
Marsaglia and Stephan Wilcke will be leaving TBC Bank and 
stepping down from the Board as and when suitable replacements 
are found during 2018. I would like to extend the Board’s thanks  
to both Stefano and Stephan for their important contributions to 
TBC Bank and we wish them every success in the future.
Acting responsibly 
Corporate responsibility has always been one of our overriding 
values. During the past 25 years, TBC Bank has actively supported 
culture, sports, young talent and other important social projects. 
We continue to hold a firm belief and commitment to supporting 
the community, the environment, the human rights, and our wider 
stakeholders, including our shareholders, employees and 
customers. We also aspire to conduct business in a way that 
promotes high ethical standards, values and encourages our 
employees to act with integrity and responsibility towards each 
other and our customers, partners and community.
This year, we launched an innovative platform, statusdonates.ge, 
which focuses on supporting success and features short videos 
about individuals and organisations that need financing, enabling 
people to select a specific cause that they would like to promote 
and support. 
We remain long-term partners with the Georgian Rugby Union and 
are the title sponsor of the national rugby team. In 2017, Georgia 
hosted the World Rugby Under-20 Championship and we actively 
promoted the games using our social and media channels, helping 
to attract many fans to the stadiums. This championship put 
Georgia on the international sports map and introduced world 
rugby fans to the country from a different angle.
Outlook
While we have achieved significant success over the past 25 years, 
we continuously seek ways to improve our business. We remain 
eager to go further after achieving each new accomplishment. We 
will continue to innovate and offer unbeatable digital solutions, a 
superior customer experience and tailor-made financial products. 
In 2018, we will progress towards our strategy of becoming the 
best digital financial services company in the region
1.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to express my deep gratitude 
to our management team, employees and partners for their 
continued hard work and dedication. I am confident that our joint 
efforts will enable us to achieve success in all our undertakings 
and create maximum value for all our stakeholders over the next 
25 years.

CEO LETTER
The driving force behind our success has always been a strong 
commitment to our goals, the dedication of our team and our 
clear long-term vision. The shareholders have entrusted me with 
the leadership of TBC Bank since 1998 and I am extremely proud 
of our accomplishments throughout these years. While TBC Bank 
has mostly grown organically, it has also strengthened its position 
through the acquisitions of Bank Constanta in 2011 and Bank 
Republic in 2016. Today, TBC Bank is the leading bank in Georgia 
and is well positioned to become the best digital financial services 
company in the region
1
 due to our outstanding digital capabilities.
Highlights of 2017
TBC Bank delivered another strong financial performance in 2017, 
posting a record high net underlying profit of GEL 369.2 million, up 
by 35.1% year-on-year. Our strong profitability was underpinned 
by the integration of Bank Republic, which we completed well 
ahead of schedule in the second quarter of the year. We are using 
the merger to drive cost synergies and significantly improve our 
efficiency, delivering an underlying cost to income ratio of 40.5% in 
2017. The integration has also increased our distribution network 
and expanded our customer base, allowing us to cross-sell our 
products to the newly acquired customers. As a result, our 
product per customer ratio in the retail segment increased to 3.9 
in 2017, compared with 3.7 a year earlier.
In 2017, we recorded strong balance sheet growth, increasing our 
loan and deposit portfolios by a respective 16.2% and 21.1% 
year-on-year. As a result, we had market shares of 38.2%
2
 of total 
loans and 39.8%
2
 of deposits in Georgia. In line with our strategy, 
we also increased our net fee and commission income by 39.5% in 
2017, mainly driven by settlement, card and trade finance 
operations. Robust growth, paired with a significant increase in 
net fee and commission income and improved efficiency, offset the 
expected reduction in the net interest margin and led to strong 
profitability. Our underlying return on equity was 21.4% and our 
underlying return on assets was 3.2%. At the same time, we 
continue to maintain sound asset quality and our ratio of non-
performing loans was low at 3.3%.
I am pleased to report that we are on track towards achieving our 
strategic goal of becoming the best digital financial services 
company in the region
1
. Our customers benefit from our reliable 
and user-friendly internet and mobile banking applications, as 
well as from our wide network of self-service terminals, allowing 
them to conduct most banking transactions remotely. As a result, 
our offloading ratio in retail segment reached 88.3%, while our 
mobile banking penetration ratio increased by 7.2 percentage 
points year-on-year to 31.4%. 
In 2017, we also introduced the first Georgian-speaking chatbot on 
Facebook Messenger, Ti Bot, which gained popularity in a very 
short time and attracted around 124,000 customers and received 
6.5 million messages since launch in March. Ti Bot serves as an 
efficient new sales channel and can also be used to conduct 
simple banking transactions. In December , we also deployed a 
biometric voice recognition system in our call centre to simplify 
customer identification and improve the safety of our customers’ 
personal and account data. We are the first bank in the region
1
 to have 
implemented such a system.
We continue to deliver a superior customer experience by carefully 
analysing feedback received and continuously improving our products 
and service levels. Over the past year , we introduced a fully digital 
onboarding system for our business clients, allowing them to open a 
current account online and perform their transactions without delay. 
The usage of this service is increasing rapidly and, in December , around 
20% of new legal entities registered online. We also launched a loyalty 
programme called Ertguli for our retail customers. Ertguli is a credit

to increase the use of our credit cards by 79.4% year-on-year . 
On the corporate side, we continue to enhance our product 
offerings. To better serve our customers, we are currently 
developing comprehensive brokerage and corporate advisory 
services, aiming to offer corporate clients a “one-stop shop”. On 
the MSME side, we launched a new financing programme called 
Startuperi for early-stage companies. The programme aims to 
support start-ups not only financially, but also by providing 
non-financial services, including training sessions, master classes 
and special discounts with TBC Bank’s partners.
I am delighted with the first-year results of our newly acquired 
business, TBC Insurance, which grew rapidly in 2017. The number of 
customers increased to around 277,000 from just 3,000 at the time of 
the acquisition in October 2016. Our market share, excluding health 
insurance, reached 13.3%

Macroeconomic overview
2017 was quite a successful year for Georgia’s economy. The country’s 
GDP growth rate almost doubled from the levels seen over the past two 
years, reflecting improvements in the external environment and continued 
domestic reform efforts, which helped to strengthen the confidence of 
consumers and businesses in the country. In 2017, Georgia’s GDP grew by 
around 5.0%
4
, placing the country among the fastest-growing economies 
in CEE, as well as in the CIS region. Improved macroeconomic 
performance across all directions was reflected in the sovereign credit 
rating of the country. In September , 2017 Moody’s upgraded Georgia’s 
credit rating to Ba2 from Ba3 previously with the stable outlook. An 
improved trade and investment relationships, together with strengthened 
banking supervision framework, were named as underlying factors of the 
improved credit rating. Fitch also revised Georgia’s credit rating outlook 
from stable to positive in March 2018 to reflect accelerating growth and 
improved resilience of the economy. 
Georgia continues to benefit from its open trade policies with all major 
economic players in the region. Exports of goods went up by a solid 
29.1% year-on-year in 2017, reflecting the recovery witnessed among 
the country’s major trading partners. Starting from 2018, a free-trade 
agreement with China has entered into force, which should give 
additional impetus to Georgia’s growing exports. 
Tourism remained a source of strength for Georgia’s economy, as the 
number of visitors exceeded 7.5 million in 2017, which represented a 
significant increase on previous years. Tourism revenue surged by 
26.9% year-on-year in 2017 and remained one of the country’s most 
important sources of foreign currency inflows. Georgia’s growing 
image as an attractive year-round tourist destination is expected to 
continue to drive its economy.
Growth in lending and the broader economy were reinforcing each 
other throughout 2017. Banking sector lending to the economy 
increased by 17.8% year-on-year , while loans to legal entities rose by 
10.4% year-on-year . After the subdued growth seen in 2015 and 2016, 
this suggests a revival of investment activity by local companies.  
The continuing trend of growing employment and household 
disposable income contributed to the 25.7% year-on-year growth  
of loans to individuals.
Another positive development in 2017 was the reduction of 
dollarisation of the banking sector , reflecting joint efforts of the public 
and financial sectors. At the year-end, the share of deposits 
denominated in foreign currency was down by 5.9
5
 percentage points 
year-on-year at 65.3%, while the share of loans denominated in 
foreign currency was down by 8.3
5
 percentage points year-on-year at 
57.1%. Lower dollarisation together with a proven track record of 
sound macro and micro risk management have further supported the 
resilience of the banking sector , which traditionally positioned itself 
with high capital, liquidity and profitability ratios, low levels of 
non-performing loans, as well as a prudent regulatory framework. 
Strategic priorities
Our strategic priorities for the coming years include:
  deepening our relationships with customers and delivering 
sustainable growth
  further developing the digital capabilities of our multichannel 
platform
  continuing to improve our customer experience
  increasing operating efficiency and automation
  proactively managing our net interest margin in the context of 
market maturity, competition and regulatory initiatives.
To strengthen our relationships with customers, we actively engage 
with them and offer an innovative range of products and services to 
maintain our leading positions. Currently, our retail customer base is 
more than 2 million people, which is around 75% of Georgia’s adult 
population, providing us with vast opportunities to cross-sell and  
move clients further along our value chain.
In parallel to deepening our relationships with clients, we consistently 
provide a superior customer experience, as measured by the net 
promoter
6 
and customer satisfaction
6
 scores. On these metrics, TBC 
Bank ranks the highest in the Georgian banking industry. Moreover , 
we have one of the top net promoter scores among the leading service 
industries in the country.
As digital channels are vital to our long-term success, our team 
strives to further enhance our digital multichannel capabilities and 
offer reliable solutions to our customers. The number of transactions 
conducted via digital channels continues to grow, especially in mobile 
banking and self-service terminals, indicating customers’ preferred 
digital channels.
I am confident that we are well positioned to implement our strategy.  
For the medium term, we maintain our guidance as follows:
  annual loan book growth of around 15%
  return on equity target of 20% or more
  cost to income ratio of below 40%
  dividend payout ratio of 25-35% of consolidated net profit.
Acknowledgement
In 2017, we made significant progress towards achieving our 
goals. I would like to thank all my colleagues for their dedicated 
hard work and commitment. Over the past 25 years, we as a team 
have worked hard to build a success story. I am confident that we 
will continue to develop and set new standards for the region’s
1
 
banking industry in 2018 and beyond.

MARKET OVERVIEW
Our operations are primarily based in 
Georgia and are focused on providing 
a full range of financial services to 
both retail and business customers. 
Georgia’s growing role as a regional 
hub for tourism, trade, transport and 
logistics supports its position as one 
of the fastest-growing economies in 
CEE as well as in the CIS. 
External inflows and exchange rate
Given the positive trend in external inflows, Georgia’s current 
account balance improved markedly. In 9M 2017, the current 
account deficit stood at 7.1% of GDP, compared with 11.2% a  
year earlier . From the perspective of the saving-investment gap,  
the lower current account deficit was primarily due to the  
increased saving level in the country, which sets the stage for  
even more sustainable growth and a reduced current account  
deficit going forward.

Chart 2. Exports, tourism and remittances YoY
Economic growth and employment
In 2017, Georgia’s real GDP growth accelerated to 5.0%, well above 
the 2.8% reported in 2016, amid a favourable external environment. 
Continued reform efforts and improved domestic business and 
consumer sentiment added more thrust to economic growth.
The economy benefitted from considerable positive spillover from 
the higher than expected growth in the EU, Georgia’s largest trading 
partner . Most CIS countries started to recover from the slowdown 
experienced in 2014-16. This translated into a sharp increase in 
exports of goods, as well as higher tourism and remittance inflows 
from these countries. 
Growth was synchronised across a broad range of economic 
sectors, mostly driven by services. In 2017, acceleration of growth 
was mostly on the back of the transport and communications and 
trade sectors. Transport and communications expanded by 6.2% 
YoY, compared with a contraction of 3.1% YoY in 2016, while the 
trade and repairs sector posted 6.6% YoY growth in 2017, up from 
2.4% a year earlier . Growth remained in double digits in the 
construction sector (up 11.2% YoY) and hotels and restaurants  
(up 11.2% YoY), the former supported by higher public investments 
and the latter by a sharp increase of tourism inflows.
This solid macroeconomic performance was reflected in Moody’s 
decision in September 2017 to upgrade Georgia’s Sovereign credit 
rating from Ba3 to Ba2, maintaining the outlook at stable, due to the 
improved trade and investment relationship and the strengthened 
banking supervision framework. Fitch also revised Georgia’s credit 
rating outlook from stable to positive in March 2018 to reflect 
accelerating growth and improved resilience of the economy. 
The existing dynamics of decreasing unemployment and pick-up  
in jobs in business sector continued in 2017 as well. In 2017 
employment in the business sector went up by 5.6% YoY.

Governance Additional Information Financial Statements Strategic Report  
Overview
Strategic Report  
Strategy & Performance
In 2017, exports of goods surged by 29.1% YoY with diversified 
growth across different regions. Exports to CIS countries 
increased the most (up 60.0% YoY) due to the recovery seen in 
these economies, albeit from the low base of the previous year,  
as exports to the CIS had halved from 2013 to 2016. Exports 
continued to grow to the EU (up 13.0% YoY) and other countries  
(up 12.2% YoY) as well. Notable export growth to China continued 
(up 23.4% YoY), making it the fifth-largest destination for Georgian 
goods. The free trade agreement with China that came into effect 
from the beginning of 2018 should further boost Georgian exports 
to one of the world’s largest markets.
Imports of goods increased by 9.4% YoY amid a domestic demand 
recovery and higher oil prices. Imports went up by 18.4% for 
petroleum products, by 10.6% for consumer goods and by 5.0%  
for capital and intermediate goods. The balance of trade in goods 
worsened slightly, edging down by 1.4%, or roughly US$ 70 million 
in absolute terms.
Tourism revenue grew by an estimated 26.9% YoY with the total 
number of visitors exceeding 7.5 million as Georgia is becoming 
an increasingly popular tourist destination for visitors from ever 
more countries. While its immediate neighbours still account for 
most incoming visitors, tourism inflows from the EU and Middle 
East have been on an upward trend.
Remittances climbed by 19.8% YoY, including by 15.1% YoY from 
the EU and by 15.6% YoY from the CIS. Growth of remittances  
from other countries stood at a sizeable 31.3% YoY. Among the 
latter group of countries, Israel and Turkey made the highest 
contributions with respective YoY increases of 96.1% and 25.6%.
The real effective exchange rate supported the competitiveness of 
Georgian goods and services exports, as it remained somewhat 
below its long-term trend, depreciating by 4.5% QoQ and 2.2% YoY 
in Q4 2017. 
As of the year-end, the USD/GEL exchange rate appreciated by 
2.1% YoY, while the EUR/GEL rate depreciated by 11.1%, reflecting 
the EUR strengthening against the USD. As expected, the stronger 
EUR coincided with improved growth in the EU, as well as higher 
commodity prices, which had an overall positive impact on the 
Georgian economy.
Inflation and monetary policy
Annual inflation as measured in terms of CPI was relatively high 
throughout 2017, reaching 6.7% by the year-end. Inflation 
exceeded the target as a result of the one-off increase of excise 
taxes on petroleum and tobacco and the customs tax on 
automobiles. In 2H 2017, higher oil prices and a weaker nominal 
effective exchange rate added to the inflationary pressure. To curb 
second-round effects on inflation, the National Bank of Georgia 
raised its policy rate by 0.25 pp to 7.25% in December 2017, where 
it remained at the year-end, as the pressure on prices from the 
exchange rate eased along with the appreciation of the GEL ’s 
nominal effective exchange rate. In its latest guidance, the 
National Bank of Georgia reported that inflation should align 
closer to the 3% target in 2018, when the one-off effects of the 
increased import taxes on petroleum, automobiles and tobacco 
will drop out of the CPI inflation figures. This is confirmed by the 
deceleration of annual inflation to 4.3% and 2.7% in January and 
February 2018, respectively. 
The National Bank of Georgia continues to follow its inflation 
targeting framework, which calls for a flexible exchange rate  
to support economic growth and the GEL ’s long-term stability.  
For 2018, the inflation target was decreased to 3%, which  
should support a stronger nominal exchange rate for the GEL 
going forward.
Fiscal policy 
The Ministry of Finance delivered on its commitment to maintain  
a sustainable budget deficit in 2017 while accelerating the pace  
of investment in public infrastructure. The budget deficit came in  
at 3.8% of GDP, down from 3.9% in 2016. As a percent of GDP, 
capital spending edged up from 4.1% in 2016 to 4.8% in 2017, 
while social expenditures declined from 10.0% to 9.3%, and 
government consumption
1
 fell from 9.2% to 8.4%. The ratio of 
government consumption to GDP reached the lowest level of the 
past 10 years, reflecting the successful attempts to optimise 
government spending on salaries and the purchase of goods  
and services. Further steps were taken to enhance the cost 
efficiency of public institutions. Starting from 2018, the number  
of ministries was reduced from 18 to 14. This initiative is a  
welcome development from the perspective of reducing the 
bureaucratic burden. 
The public debt level remains comfortable at around 44.0% of GDP 
as of the year-end, well below the upper limit of 60%.
In addition, the government has continued its efforts to increase 
the transparency of public finances. According to the 2017 
assessment by the International Budget Partnership, Georgia 
ranked fifth among the 102 countries surveyed, indicating its high 
levels of transparency, oversight and public participation in the 
budgeting process. In the Open Budget Index ranking, Georgia 
outscored all EU countries except for Sweden and Norway.
Financial sector
The financial sector, dominated by banks, continues to grow under 
a prudent regulatory framework. In 2017, the banking sector’s 
total assets increased by 14.7% YoY to GEL 34.6 billion.
 
The total loan portfolio increased by 17.8% YoY to GEL 22.3 billion,  
or 58.6% of GDP, while the growth excluding FX effect was 19.3%.  
The loan portfolio growth was primarily driven by loans in the 
national currency (up 46.3% YoY), while foreign currency loans 
increased by 5.0% (excluding foreign exchange effect).
In 2017, the National Bank of Georgia and the government 
introduced measures to reduce the economy’s dependence on 
foreign currency, bringing down the share of the loan portfolio 
denominated in foreign currency. Additionally, new liquidity 
1 Budget spending on salaries and goods and services  18 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
management instruments and an expanded collateral base allowed 
banks to promote lending in GEL more actively. The share of foreign 
currency deposits declined by 5.9 pp YoY (5.4 pp without the FX effect) 
to 65.3%, while the share of loans in foreign currency declined by 8.3 
pp YoY (7.8 pp without the FX effect) to 57.1%.
The National Bank of Georgia has enhanced the capital adequacy 
framework according to the Basel III requirements. The new 
regulatory requirements are aimed at further increasing the banking 
sector’s capacity to absorb any possible shocks in the future.  
The updates envisage the introduction of additional capital 
requirements for systemically important banks, as well as a 
countercyclical capital buffer. These requirements will be phased in 
gradually and will further increase the banking sector’s resilience. 
The quality of the financial sector’s credit portfolio remains robust.  
In Q4 2017, the share of non-performing loans
1
 in the total loan 
portfolio stood at 2.8%, down 0.3 pp QoQ and 0.7 pp YoY.
Going forward
In 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the 
momentum of global growth to remain high in advanced, emerging 
and developing market economies. Georgia’s economy should 
continue to benefit from the healthy growth of its main trading 
partners, buoyed by the further expansion of inflows from exports, 
tourism and remittances.
Aside from the favourable external environment, ongoing structural 
reforms, improved trade and investment relationships and a 
strengthened banking supervision framework further improve the 
country’s investment environment. For 2018, the IMF expects growth 
of 4.2% of GDP, while the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD), the government and the National Bank of 
Georgia project a slightly higher rate of 4.5%. As for 2022, IMF 
forecasts GDP growth rate of 5.5%. Growth at these levels should 
allow Georgia to remain one of the fastest-growing economies in  
CEE and the CIS.

STRATEGY
TBC Bank’s main source of income is interest income and fee and 
commission income generated by the core banking business and  
other related financial activities. In the long term, we aim to continue 
offsetting the decreasing trend in net interest margins through 
increasing fee and commission income and operational efficiency.  
We see significant opportunities in the insurance business through  
our recently acquired subsidiary, TBC Insurance, with the ambition to 
become a market leader in the medium term. Our payment business, 
including its card business, also offers tremendous growth potential 
and we are actively utilising this by developing new products. 
With Georgia’s increasing trade flows, we see rising demand for trade 
finance products, which gives us a great opportunity to leverage our 
strong trade finance capabilities. Our brokerage, investment banking 
and asset management businesses will become an increasingly 
important source of income in the future, especially with upcoming 
pension reforms and the development of capital markets in Georgia.  
At the same time, we are focused on streamlining our internal 
processes and increasing automation levels within the Group in order 
to improve efficiency and flexibility, as well as to lower operating costs.

Strategy & Performance
Last year we observed an accelerated pressure on net interest margin 
(NIM) due to competition in loans and regulatory changes. As these 
factors will remain in the future, we have added a new strategic 
priority: to proactively manage our NIM.
Our goal is to ensure that our NIM remains stable in the short to 
medium term. 
We will be working on various initiatives, both internally and with one  
of the world’s leading consulting firms. This will include introducing 
appropriate customer segmentation and pricing methodologies, 
conducting a proper product and segment profitability analysis, and 
targeting the right portfolio mix. 
As discussed above, we aim to offset the decrease in NIM by increasing 
other operating income through our initiatives, including increasing 
fees from the insurance business, card operations, trade finance, and 
brokerage and asset management products and services. 
Medium-term financial targets
  Loan book growth rate at c.15% per year
  Return on equity target of above 20%
  Cost to income ratio below 40%
  Dividend payout ratio 25-35% of consolidated 
net profit

We closely monitor the progress against our strategy and have developed key 
performance indicators (KPIs) that measure our financial and operational 
performance. These KPIs are closely aligned with our strategy and ensure that we 
deliver on our goals and achieve sustainable growth. 
In 2017, we have recorded strong underlying and reported net profit, 
which was up by 35.1% and 20.7% year-on-year respectively. Our 
underlying return on equity stood at 21.4% in line with our medium-
term target of above 20%. Underlying NIM decreased by 1.1pp due to 
increased competition and more stringent liquidity requirements, but 
still remained solid. The decrease in NIM was offset by the increased 
non-interest income, which grew by 34.8% year-on-year, improved cost 
efficiency, which resulted in underlying cost to income ratio of 40.5%, 
as well as prudent cost of risk management, leading to 1.2% cost of 
risk. Over the same period, our loan book grew by 16.2%, while the 
asset quality remained solid, with our non-performing loans ratio 
standing at 3.3%. We also achieved strong performance in 
digitalisation: our offloading ratio increased by 4.2pp and our mobile 
banking penetration ratio increased by 7.2pp. Furthermore, our 
customer and employee satisfaction scores remain exceptionally high.  27 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Overview
Retail banking is our largest segment. We serve more than 2 million 
customers, which is around 75% of the adult Georgian population. 
Our retail banking is differentiated by our outstanding customer 
experience, world-class digital channels, strong brand, advanced 
analytical capabilities, as well as innovative products. We are pioneers in 
Georgia following the launch of the first Georgian speaking chatbot 
available through facebook messenger and a voice biometric recognition 
system in our call center .
Our retail segment is comprised of three sub-segments: high-net-worth 
individuals (HNWI), affluent customers (TBC Status) and mass retail.

Strategy & Performance
Retail sub-segments
TBC Bank serves mass retail customers through a well-
developed multichannel network with a special focus on digital 
channels. Most banking transactions can be carried out online, 
via self-service terminals or ATMs, and clients need to come to 
branches only if they want to take out a mortgage or conduct 
non-standard transactions. 
Our TBC Status brand serves the affluent segment, including 
individual clients with minimum monthly income of GEL 3,000 
or a loan or deposit amount of at least GEL 30,000. TBC Status 
differentiates itself with best-in-class personal bankers, 
dedicated multichannel and tailored products and  
value-added services.
Our personal bankers are highly qualified professionals who are 
committed to understanding the clients’ financial needs and 
offering them well-suited solutions. They strive to build lasting 
relationships with customers, becoming trusted partners who 
can always be relied on and are easily accessible. As our 
customers’ long-term well-being is of utmost importance to us, 
we carefully analyse their personal circumstances and goals 
before coming up with solutions.
While we understand the importance of personal relationships, 
we also realise that our affluent customers are busy and have 
less time for banking, so we have modelled our TBC Status 
banking concept around this idea. We have created dedicated 
multichannel services for our affluent customers with a special 
focus on digital channels. We serve our TBC Status clients 
through a separate call centre with extended capabilities, as 
well as internet and mobile banking offerings with enhanced 
functionality, allowing most transactions to be conducted 
remotely. In cases where our affluent customers still need to 
come to a branch, they are seen in specially designed service 
areas that offer additional comfort. We have around 70 TBC 
Status service areas in 27 branches. In addition, our affluent 
customers are entitled to a priority pass in all branches that 
allows them to skip any lines and be served first.
Other benefits of TBC Status include:
  preferential rates on various TBC Bank products and 
services, including higher interest rates on deposits and 
lower commissions on money transfers;
  special offers, discounts or cash back from certain retailers, 
hotels, restaurants and other partners; and
  exclusive events for TBC Status customers and special 
discounts for main concerts, such as our annual  
Jazz Festival.
In addition, we offer a wide range of lifestyle products through 
our concierge service, including:
  holiday planning;
  restaurant reservations;
  flower delivery;
  cleaning service; and
  auto services.
The HNWI segment is comprised of resident and non-resident 
clients with deposit amounts equal to or above US$ 100,000. 
Our representative office in Israel, TBC Invest, allows us to 
attract non-resident clients more effectively from all over the 
world. We serve our HNWI clients in our VIP service area, which 
offers an impeccable combination of luxury, comfort and 
privacy. Our personal bankers are much more than just service 
managers, they are consultants and wealth planners dedicated to 
maximising customers’ prosperity by offering them the best 
investment opportunities available on the market. 32 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Main achievements of 2017
In 2017, our retail loan book grew by 15.0% to GEL 4,233.2 million, 
while retail deposits increased by 16.8% to GEL 4,378.3 million in 
2017. As a result, the share of retail book in total loan portfolio stood 
at 49.5% and the share of retail deposits in the total deposit portfolio 
amounted to 56.0% as of 31 December 2017.
As the number one bank in Georgia, we are constantly working to 
provide our customers with innovative, added-value services and 
products tailored to their needs and interests. We continue to invest 
our time and money to strengthen our multichannel platform and to 
reinforce our leadership in retail banking.
One innovative project implemented during the year was the first 
chatbot available via Facebook Messenger. We developed and 
introduced the first Georgian-speaking chatbot, Ti Bot, which can not 
only understand typed messages, but also understand voice 
messages and respond accordingly. Ti Bot can perform simple 
transactions including P2P transfers and purchasing tickets, as well 
as provide helpful information about subjects as diverse as the 
weather forecast, currency exchange rates, various entertainment 
offerings, branch and ATM locations. Ti Bot has proven very popular 
among our clients and we have received around 6.5 million 
messages from 124,000 customers since launch.
We have also achieved outstanding results in terms of offloading our 
branches. In 2017, 88.3% of all retail transactions were conducted 
remotely. The main drivers were increased transactions through our 
mobile banking and self-service terminals. In addition, mobile 
banking penetration jumped from 24.2% to 31.4% YoY. At the same 
time, 44.5%
3
 of total sales were conducted digitally or through the 
call centre.
As an innovator in the card business, we constantly develop new 
products and offerings to support cashless transactions. In April 
2017, we launched a new loyalty programme called Ertguli. The 
literal Georgian meaning of the word is “loyal”, but it can also be 
deconstructed into two separate words, “one” and “heart”, which is 
where the inspiration for our logo is drawn from. All customers who 
own TBC Bank plastic cards automatically participate in the 
programme and can accumulate points on each purchase. 
Furthermore, within the Ertguli loyalty programme, we have 
developed a new credit card that gives our customers an opportunity 
to collect more points at partner merchants, as well as participate in 
special promotions and receive exclusive discounts. In addition, the 
card has a pre-approved instalment limit and it is no longer 
necessary to fill out a special form and wait for approval at a branch 
desk. As a result, our credit card sales increased significantly in 
2017, when we issued around 160,000 new credit cards, up 79.4% 
YoY. Our priority for 2018 is to increase card transactions by fully 
automating and simplifying processes. In addition, in May 2017, we 
developed youth and student cards with distinctive benefits tailored 
to these clients’ interests. The cards also have a unique design, 
which can be changed based on owners’ wishes and interests. For 
youth cards, parents can set maximum daily expenditure limits to 
foster appropriate spending habits in their children. 
DIVISIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Key strengths
Multichannel distribution platform
Branches 
We have one of the most productive, modern and visually appealing 
branch networks in Georgia with 77 branches in Tbilisi and 77 
regional offices. Following the merger with Bank Republic, we have 
redesigned and rebranded its former branches.
ATMs
We have the largest ATM network in Georgia with about 1,150 ATMs, 
including partner banks.
Self-service terminals
As Georgia is still largely a cash-based society, our self-service 
terminals with cash payment functionality remain a very important 
channel for our customers. It represents a strong substitution for the 
bank branches, as it offers the majority of branch functionality. We 
have 2,790 self-service terminals around Georgia.
Call centre
Our best-in-class call centre operates 24/7 and is a particularly 
strong channel for sales and customer inquiries. Around 21.6% of all 
products sold in remote channels are conducted in the call centre. 
The call centre is integrated with our Siebel CRM system, which 
allows us to deliver personalised services to our customers, as well 
as achieve faster lead conversion.
Internet and mobile banking
We pride ourselves on having the best-in-class internet and mobile 
banking applications with customer review ratings of 4.9 stars on 
Google Play, 4.8 stars in the Apple App Store and the highest number 
of active online users in Georgia. Since its launch in 2012, we have 
received many digital awards at the national and regional levels from 
Global Finance, as well as three global awards: the world’s “Best 
Integrated Corporate Bank Site” in 2017, the world’s “Best 
Integrated Internet Bank Site” in 2013, and the world’s “Best Bill 
Payment and Presentment” in 2013.
Strong brand and superior customer experience
TBC Bank is one of the most trusted and well-known brands in Georgia 
and is associated not only with the best financial services, but also with 
an outstanding contribution to the country as a whole. For 25 years,  
we have been working diligently to build long-standing relationships  
and deliver a superior customer experience to strengthen our brand and 
gain the trust of prospective customers, thus encouraging them to 
explore our services and become clients. As customer satisfaction is a 
vital part of our success, we are committed to continually improving our 
customer experience to further enhance our leading position.
Advanced analytical capabilities
Since 2014, we have operated advanced data analytics that help  
us to better understand our customers’ needs and anticipate their 
behaviour. This, in turn, enables us to increase sales efficiency  
and productivity, as well as improve customer loyalty. As a result, 
this year we have increased our customer reactivation rate 1
 by  
22.8% and decreased our churn rate
2
 by 8.2%. 33 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance Additional Information Financial Statements Strategic Report  
Overview
Strategic Report  
Strategy & Performance
Furthermore, in December , we launched a mobile wallet application that 
allows customers to pay directly using the near-field communication 
(NFC) technology built into their smartphones. Another 2017 innovation 
was the addition of a new feature to our ATMs allowing our customers to 
withdraw money by means of contactless cards, which reduces the time 
per transaction from around 40 seconds to 25 seconds.
Another breakthrough this year was the introduction of a voice 
biometrics recognition system. In partnership with Verint Systems, a 
global leader in actionable intelligence solutions, we developed and 
implemented a voice biometrics recognition system in our call centre 
that helps us to identify a person based on their voice. The main benefits 
are that customers can be verified quickly, enabling us to deal with a 
greater number of calls and reduce fraud through identity theft. We are 
the first bank in the region
4
 to have implemented such a system.
To serve our clients better , we constantly refine our IT infrastructure and 
analytical capabilities. In 2017, we tested big data solutions and data 
architecture, successfully developed a proof of concept and are currently 
working on implementing the big data cluster , which will allow us to 
generate new revenue streams, deliver better customer service and 
improve operational efficiency. In addition, we developed spending 
analysis that enables us to accommodate customer needs and offer 
them products and services tailored to their interests. As a result, we 
have achieved strong results in cross-selling and increased our products 
per customer ratio by to 3.9 in December 2017 from 3.7 in 2016.

Main achievements in 2017
We had a strong performance in 2017, increasing our loan book  
by 20.0% YoY to GEL 2,475.4 million, while our trade finance  
portfolio grew by 38.6% YoY to GEL 1,589 million. At the same time, 
our deposits expanded by 28.6% YoY to GEL 2,410.9 million. 
Consequently, our market shares reached 36.0%

We supported our robust growth by becoming the core bank for 
leading industry players such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Nikora
2
, 
Silknet

 and Nova
4
. Our performance was further strengthened by  
the contribution from the Bank Republic integration, including the 
retention of key customers and employees. As a result, we gained  
a high-quality pool of international customers, together with a 
well-diversified, mid-corporate segment and advanced trade  
finance capabilities. 
As the demand for capital markets products and corporate finance 
advisory services is increasing among large corporates in Georgia, 
the need for sophisticated investment banking products and services 
is becoming increasingly prominent. At the same time, evolving 
legislation and regulation further supports the development of 
capital markets in Georgia, which should, in turn, attract more 
international investors. We aim to harness this opportunity by 
developing a strong suite of investment banking products and 
services to help our clients achieve their corporate goals and growth 
objectives. In 2017, we further strengthened our investment banking 
subsidiary by appointing a new managing director Irakli Elashvili, 
who has more than 15 years of experience in Georgia and in global 
universal and investment banks. We broadened the deal team and 
revamped TBC Capital’s strategy to position it to benefit from 
increased capital markets activity in Georgia and the region. During 
the year, we completed several notable transactions: TBC Capital 
was the sole arranger of Silknet

activities, including horse riding, quad-bike tours,  
mini-golf and fishing. 
The hotel started its operations in 2008 with just seven rooms and 
TBC Bank actively assisted the company from a very early stage. 
Since then, the resort has been growing rapidly with our support, 
with annual revenue expanding from GEL 280,000 in 2008 to GEL 12 
million in 2016, recording a compound annual growth rate of 60% 
over the eight-year period. Alongside the provision of direct financing 
to the company, we have also advised and assisted the hotel in raising 
equity for its future development. In 2017, the company successfully 
closed a transaction with the Georgian State-owned Equity 
Partnership Fund, obtaining US$ 5.4 million. These funds will be 
used to further expand the resort, allowing it to almost double the 
number of rooms by the end of 2018. This should result in a sharp 
increase in the number of guests from the current level of around 
47,000 local and international visitors per year.

GEORGIAN BEER COMPANY
Georgian Beer Company is a major domestic company that 
produces beer and non-alcoholic beverages. It has a 
modern factory near Tbilisi, in Saguramo village, that is 
equipped with state-of-the-art European equipment. Its 
products are based on unique spring water from the base 
of Zedazeni mountain – a vital component of its high-
quality beverages. Among the company’s various brands, 
Zedazeni is one of the most popular on the local market.
The company became TBC Bank’s customer in 2012, when it was 
starting its operations. With our financial assistance, it has 
significantly expanded its business and is now one of the leading 
players on Georgia’s beverage market. In 2016, the company decided 
to enter a new segment and start producing natural juice. We 
provided funding for this purpose and the company built a facility 
adjacent to the brewery for receiving and processing fruit from 
nearby farmers. The new business line will contribute to economic 
development by producing new Georgian products and creating new 
jobs, and will also support agriculture.

providing a syndicated loan together with the EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction  
and Development) to purchase and renovate a new building and to acquire high-quality 
equipment for the clinic. Since then, we have been closely cooperating with the company  
and have provided a number of short-term loans for working capital needs, as well as other 
operating products.

Main achievements in 2017
Our MSME loan portfolio grew by 14.2% during the last year to  
GEL 1,844.7 million, accounting for 21.6% of the total loan portfolio. 
In 2017, the deposit portfolio increased by 23.6% and to GEL 1,027.7 
million, representing 13.1% of the total deposit portfolio. 
TBC Bank continues to attract and increase the number of MSME 
customers. By the end of 2017, we served around 110,000 MSME clients. 
To make banking easier and more comfortable for MSMEs, we offer  
fully digital on-boarding, so that a prospective client can fill in the 
application and open a current account without visiting our branch  
(www.businessregistration.ge). If the client prefers to receive hard copies, 
all the necessary documents are delivered by our eco-friendly car .  
In addition, our award-winning multichannel offering enables our clients  
to perform most transactions remotely , driving our offloading ratio as  
high as 92.0%

 by the end of 2017.
We also actively cooperate with the government programme, “Produce in 
Georgia”, which aims to support agriculture, manufacturing and hospitality 
industries. Within the programme, borrowers can apply for a subsidy from 
the government to lower their interest expense during the grace period.
This year , we also launched an innovative programme named “Startuperi”, 
giving early-stage companies access to financing from a bank. The 
programme also involves extensive non-financial support, such as 
training, masterclasses, individual consultations and media coverage  
for young companies. In addition, participant companies also receive 
special offers from TBC Bank and its partners. The programme has  
proved to be very successful and, by the end of 2017, 13,000 companies 
took part in “Startuperi”, and we disbursed 168 loans totalling around  
GEL 21 million. Please see figure 1 for more information.
The MSME segment’s strong performance is shaped by our continuous 
efforts to transform our customer experience via innovative offerings.  
We are the sole bank in Georgia offering a business support programme  
to our clients, including training, workshops and individual consultations. 
In 2017, around 4,400 companies attended training in areas such as 
budgeting and analysis, innovations management, taxation, digital 
marketing and simplified IFRS. Through these training sessions, we 
provide an essential business toolkit to our clients, encouraging them to 
fine-tune their businesses and become even more successful. We strive  
to make our clients confident that we are more than just a bank: we are 
their partners.
In collaboration with Georgia’s Revenue Service, we have created Business 
Map (www.businessmap.ge), a useful benchmarking tool for companies. 
We have analysed public big data and built an online business map where 
companies can evaluate their performance against their competitors by 
district, city , or nationwide. Business Map presents the following metrics: 
revenue, costs, number of employees and payroll. 
In November 2017, we organised our second annual business awards 
ceremony , attracting up to 700 participants. This year , we have announced 
winners in seven categories. We try to find and promote successful 
Georgian businesses and encourage entrepreneurship in the country.  
The event was a huge success and attracted 5.3 million views.

IB MTHIEBI 
IB Mthiebi is one of the pioneer private secondary schools in Georgia. 
Since 1995, the school has distinguished itself by the high standards  
of its academic programme, as well as by its qualified faculty and 
modern infrastructure.
The school was founded with the aspiration to set a new standard and create a 
positive learning environment. When the school was set up, very few parents 
entrusted a start-up school with their children, but today it is highly ranked and has 
more than 1,200 students. The school’s founder is actively involved in continuously 
developing the educational programme. In partnership with German shareholder IB, 
the school faculty regularly participates in exchange training to enhance their 
qualifications and learn about new teaching practices. As demand for the school  
has grown, IB Mthiebi has decided to invest in its infrastructure to increase capacity 
and create classrooms equipped with modern technology. 
For TBC Bank, this was not just another commercial loan, it was a chance to have  
a direct impact on developing an education system. In 2012-16, with financing from  
the Bank, IB Mthiebi renovated its existing premises and built a new, 2,000 m2 
campus that is fully equipped with the latest laboratories and IT infrastructure.  
IB Mthiebi is one of the few schools in Georgia that has implemented the highest 
safety and quality management standards, receiving the OHSAS 18001:20017 and

NADIA KANDELAKI 
Agriculture is one of the oldest, most widespread occupations in 
Georgia, where a large share of the labour force is engaged in 
farming. However , employment in the agricultural sector is mostly 
dominated by male farmers, while female farmers are under-
represented. Nadia Kandelaki is an example of a daring woman  
who decided to take up agriculture and start a farm. 
In 2013, Nadia approached TBC Bank to finance her expansion plans. At the 
time, she had some land, orchards, vineyards, beehives and livestock. She 
decided to increase the number of beehives, as natural honey was in high 
demand and quite profitable. She also bought dairy cattle and expanded her 
dairy production. Nadia is very hard working, managing the farm on her own. 
As her first expansion project was successful, she decided to grow her 
business further. In 2016, TBC Bank provided Nadia with the funds she 
needed to set up a vineyard and build a wine cellar. This year, she fermented 
her first harvest in her cellar. Nadia’s successful business endeavours 
encourage women to be more active and entrepreneurial. TBC Bank  
supports women in business and has a special programme aimed at financing 
women’s start-ups.

SUBSIDIARIES
TBC Insurance
TBC Insurance is a wholly owned subsidiary of TBC Bank and the 
main bancassurance partner of the Bank. It was acquired by the 
Group in October 2016 and has been growing rapidly since then.  
TBC Insurance’s product offerings comprise motor, travel, personal 
accident, credit life and property, business property, liability and 
cargo insurance products. The company uses a broad range of 
channels to sell its products, including insurance agents, auto 
dealerships and web platforms, as well as TBC Bank’s market-
leading multichannel network. 
In line with the Group’s digitalisation strategy, TBC Insurance 
actively uses digital channels to market and sell its products. In 
2017, TBC Insurance launched the first insurance chatbot, B Bot, on 
the local market, which sells different types of insurance products. 
B Bot is great fun to use and is quickly gaining popularity among our 
clients, especially the younger generation. Another popular sales 
channel is the wide network of TBC Bank’s self-service terminals, 
where customers can buy travel, casualty and collision (CASCO), and 
motor third-party liability (MTPL) insurance in a very short time. In 
addition, travel insurance can be purchased through TBC Bank’s 
internet and mobile banking services, and more products are 
planned to be added to this channel in 2018, including payment 
protection insurance (PPI), CASCO and MTPL. 
Georgia’s insurance market is promising with high growth potential. 
The penetration level, measured as gross written premium to GDP, 
stood at 0.62%
1
 for the property and casualty (P&C) insurance 
market as of 31 December 2017, which is the lowest among CEE 
countries. The density, which is measured as gross written premium 
per capita, is also low compared with peer countries at US$24.4
1
.
The insurance business is regulated by the Insurance State 
Supervision Service of Georgia, which closely monitors insurance 
companies, and sets the minimum and solvency capital 
requirements. There are 16 insurance companies operating in the 
Georgian P&C insurance market. The two largest players hold 
respective market shares
2
 of 37.4% and 17.2%, followed by TBC 
Insurance in third place with 13.3%.
During the last five years, the P&C insurance market in Georgia has 
grown at a significant compound annual growth rate of 11.7%. The 
largest insurance product lines are motor (35.1%) and property 
insurance (29.8%), followed by credit life and personal accident (11.7%), 
liability insurance (11.4%), travel insurance (3.2%) and other (8.8%). We 
see particular growth potential in car insurance due to the introduction 
of mandatory MTPL insurance starting from March 2018. Travel 
insurance is another promising segment, as the number of outbound 
tourists has been growing significantly since the introduction of a 
visa-free regime with EU countries in March 2017. 
TBC Insurance has grown rapidly since our acquisition and has 
increased its market share to 13.3%
2
 as of 31 December 2017, 
compared with 3.5% in December 2016. It has particularly 
strengthened its position in the retail segment by reaching 28.9%
2
 to 
become the second-largest player. Over the same period, the 
number of clients reached 276,848 compared to 2,887 one year prior. 
Gross insurance profit amounted to GEL 6,8 million in 2017. At same 
time, the company has significantly improved its efficiency and 
decreased the net combined ratio to 95.9% in 2017 from 110.3% one 
year prior. As a result, TBC Insurance recorded a net profit of GEL 
935,000 in 2017.
TBC Insurance aims to further strengthen its positions on the 
market and become the number one retail insurance company in 
Georgia in the medium term. Our strategic priorities include:
  increase the usage of digital channels; 
  diversify our product offerings and develop new products, 
including agricultural insurance, financial risks insurance and 
personal risks insurance; 
  offer a best-in-class customer experience to achieve the highest 
net promoter score among industry players; and
  achieve a total market share of 25-30% and retail market share 
of 30-35% in the medium term. 
TBC Leasing
TBC Leasing is the leading leasing company in Georgia with a 
market share of over 74.3%

. The company was founded in 2003 by 
TBC Bank, which currently holds a 99.6% interest. By the end of 
2017, TBC Leasing’s portfolio amounted to around GEL 145 million, 
with approximately 2,150 customers and up to 3,450 active leasing 
agreements. 
In 2017, the company had one of the most successful years in its 
history. TBC Leasing launched two new products: used car financing for 
the retail segment (product named “Starto”) and full-service 
operational leasing for both corporate clients and individuals. We also 
enhanced our value proposition by beginning to offer advisory services. 
Additionally, TBC Leasing strengthened its collaboration with the 
Bank by beginning to use banking channels to sell its products to 
TBC Bank’s MSME customer base. As a result, we disbursed record 
high leases in the amount of GEL125 million to MSME clients. 
In 2017, TBC Leasing also enhanced its internal operations and 
processes by:
  launching the first bespoke leasing core software system, which 
was developed by a local IT company; 
  establishing an independent call centre separate from that of the 
Bank; and
  enhancing operational risk management procedures. 
Our mission is to contribute to Georgia’s economic development by 
providing comprehensive leasing solutions and premium advisory 
services to our customers, making it easier for them to invest in 
capital assets. 55 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

TBC Pay 
TBC Pay was founded in 2008 by TBC Bank and is its wholly owned 
subsidiary. The company provides fast and easy payment options for 
individuals all over the country through its wide network of 
self-service terminals on a 24-hour basis. Customers can conduct 
various transactions, including paying for utilities or state services, 
depositing money in their accounts, repaying loans, topping up their 
mobile balance and many more. 
Starting from 2017, in addition to cash payments, our self-service 
terminals were equipped with card readers and pin pads, allowing 
our customers to pay for their services both with cash and credit/
debit cards. We also started using our terminals as a channel to 
originate fast, preapproved loans for the Bank’s customers. 
In 2017, TBC Pay updated its online payment platform (www .tbcpay.
ge), which has the same functionality as the self-service terminals 
but offers a significantly improved user experience. The company 
was also successful in increasing the number of transactions by 
improving the availability of services and adding 200 new self-
service terminals. In addition, we won an important tender process 
in 2017 allowing us to place our terminals in metro stations, thus 
capturing more attractive locations. As a result, the number and 
volume of transactions increased by a respective 9.5% and 43.5% 
YoY in 2017. 
In addition to the existing business, TBC Pay started a cash 
management business for companies with a large volume of cash 
operations. We placed our terminals at retailers’ sites, allowing 
them to deposit money directly to their bank accounts, which will be 
reflected instantly. Customer interest in this service is tremendous 
and we plan to further expand this business in 2018. 
The company’s strategy in 2018 is to further develop and improve its 
online platform (www.tbcpay.ge) by adding new functions, such as 
wallet, mobile apps and loyalty programmes, which will further our 
ambition to become the number one payment company in Georgia in 
the medium term.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Principal risks and uncertainties 
Risk management is a critical pillar of the Group’s strategy. To 
perform it effectively, it is essential to identify emerging risks and 
uncertainties. The principal risks that could adversely impact on the 
Group’s performance, financial condition and prospects are 
presented below. Performance may be affected by additional risks 
and uncertainties other than those listed below and some as-yet-
unknown risks that emerge in the future. More details regarding  
risk management practices can be found on pages 60-69. 
The Board has undertaken a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group in order to determine whether to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting and during its assessment of the 
long-term viability of the Group’s operations as set out in the Going 
Concern and Viability Statements on pages 111 to 112.
1. Principal risk
The Group faces currency-induced credit risk due to the high share 
of loans denominated in foreign currencies in the Group’s portfolio.
The potential for further GEL depreciation is one of the most 
significant risks that could negatively impact on portfolio quality due 
to the large presence of foreign currencies on the Group’s balance 
sheet. Unhedged borrowers could suffer from increased debt burden 
when their liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are amplified.
Risk description
A significant share of the Group’s loans (and a large share of the 
total banking sector loans in Georgia) is denominated in currencies 
other than the GEL, particularly the USD. As of 31 December 2017, 
the National Bank of Georgia reported that 58.1%
1
 of total banking 
sector loans were denominated in foreign currencies. As of the 
same date, 59.7% of the Group’s total gross loans and advances to 
customers (before provision for loan impairment) were denominated 
in foreign currencies.
The income of many customers is directly linked to USD via 
remittances, or exports in case of business borrowers. Nevertheless, 
customers may not be protected against significant fluctuations in the 
GEL ’s exchange rate against the currency of the loan.
In 2017, the USD/GEL exchange rate appreciated by 2.1% YoY, 
supported by the relative stability of major trading partners’ 
currencies and the solid improvement in external inflows. The USD/
GEL exchange rate remained volatile throughout the year due to the 
free-floating exchange rate regime and Georgia’s small forex 
market. However, the amplitude of volatility remained within the 
acceptable range.
The National Bank of Georgia operates effectively under its 
inflation-targeting framework. However, the GEL remains in free 
float and is exposed to many internal and external factors that in 
some circumstances could result in devaluation against the USD.

Risk mitigation
Specific attention is paid to currency-induced credit risk due to the 
high share of loans denominated in foreign currencies in the 
portfolio. The vulnerability to exchange rate depreciation is 
monitored on a frequent basis to be able to promptly implement an 
action plan, when and as needed. The ability to withstand certain 
exchange rate depreciation is incorporated into the credit 
underwriting standards, which also include applying significant 
currency devaluation buffers for uncharged borrowers. In addition, 
the Group holds significant capital against currency-induced credit 
risk. Given the experience and knowledge built throughout the 
recent currency volatility, the Group is in a good position to promptly 
mitigate emerging exchange rate depreciation risks.
In 2017, the government enacted a law aimed at reducing the 
economy’s dependence on foreign currency by requiring loans for 
amounts of less than GEL 100,000 to be disbursed in local currency.
This and other initiatives have helped to reduce the share of loans 
denominated in foreign currencies in TBC Bank’s retail portfolio 
from 58.1% at the end of 2016 to 49.3% at the end of 2017.
2. Principal risk
The Group’s performance may be compromised by adverse 
developments in the economic environment.
A slowdown of economic growth in Georgia would have an adverse 
impact on the repayment capacity of the borrowers, restraining their 
future investment and expansion plans. These occurrences would be 
reflected in the Group’s portfolio quality and profitability and would also 
impede the portfolio growth rates. Negative macroeconomic 
developments could compromise the Group’s performance through 
various parameters, such as rising unemployment rates, increasing retail 
sector default rates, falling property values, worsening loan 
collateralisation, or falling debt service capabilities of companies 
suffering from decreasing sales.
Potential political and economic instability in the neighbouring and 
main trading partner countries could negatively impact the economic 
outlook of Georgia through a worsening current account (eg decreased 
exports, tourism inflows, remittances and foreign direct investments).
Risk description
As the Group operates primarily in, and sources nearly all its 
revenue from Georgia, its business, financial condition and operating 
results are, and will continue to be, highly dependent on the general 
economic conditions in the country.
During 2011-17, the Georgian economy recorded average real GDP 
growth of 4.6% per annum. In 2017, economic growth recovered 
significantly to 5.0%, compared with 2.8% in 2016. The sharp 
improvement was primarily driven by a recovery in exports, tourism 
and remittance inflows.
Georgia’s economy is open, liberal, well diversified and reasonably 
reformed. While it has shown resilience during international or 
regional crises, it is still exposed to many internal and external 
developments. These could result in lower growth or, in some severe 
circumstances, a contraction of the economy. 57 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance Additional Information Financial Statements Strategic Report  
Overview
Strategic Report  
Strategy & Performance
Risk mitigation
To decrease its vulnerability to economic cycles and adverse 
developments, the Group identifies and limits its exposure to cyclical 
industries within its risk appetite framework.
The Group has in place a macroeconomic monitoring process that 
relies on close, recurrent observations of the economic 
developments in Georgia, as well as its neighbouring countries, to 
identify early warning signals indicating imminent economic risks. 
This system allows the Group to promptly assess significant 
economic and political occurrences and analyse their implications 
for the loan portfolio. The identified implications are duly translated 
into specific action plans with regards to reviewing the underwriting 
standards, risk appetite metrics or limits, including the limits for 
each of the most vulnerable industries.
Additionally, the stress-testing and scenario analysis applied during 
the credit review and portfolio monitoring processes enable the 
Group to have an advance evaluation of the impact of 
macroeconomic shocks on the business and the portfolio.
Resilience towards a changing macroeconomic environment is 
incorporated into the Group’s credit underwriting standards. As 
such, borrowers are expected to withstand certain adverse economic 
developments through prudent financials, debt-servicing 
capabilities and conservative collateral coverage.
3. Principal risk
The Group encounters the capital risk of not meeting the minimum 
regulatory requirements, which may compromise growth and 
strategic targets.
The Bank is regulated by the National Bank of Georgia. The 
regulations and various terms of its funding and other arrangements 
require compliance with certain capital adequacy and other ratios. 
Local regulatory requirements are more conservative than the 
current Basel standards. At the same time, the local regulator has 
the right to impose additional regulations on a bank if it perceives 
excessive risks and uncertainties in that lender or in the market.
Risk description
The National Bank of Georgia has introduced a new capital adequacy 
framework that came into force in December 2017. The updated 
regulation divides the current capital requirement across Pillar 1 
and Pillar 2 buffers that are introduced gradually over a four-year 
period. The Bank’s capitalisation as of December 2017 stood at 
13.4% and 17.5% against the regulatory minimum requirement of 
10.3% and 12.9% for Tier 1 and Total capital, respectively. The ratios 
are well above the respective regulatory minimums. 
From January 2018, the National Bank of Georgia has fully phased 
out the Basel I and Basel II/III capital adequacy standards and 
replaced them with the updated capital framework, which is more 
compliant with the Basel III guidelines. More information about the 
new regulation can be found in the Risks, Ethics and Compliance 
Committee (RECC) report on pages 123-125.
Risk mitigation
The Group undertakes stress-testing and sensitivity analysis to 
quantify extra capital consumption under different scenarios. Such 
analyses indicate that the Group holds sufficient capital to steadily 
meet the minimum regulatory requirements.
Capital forecasts, as well as the results of the stress-testing and 
what-if scenarios, are actively monitored with the involvement of the 
Bank’s Management Board and Risk Committee to ensure prudent 
management and timely actions when needed. In addition, under the 
new capital adequacy framework, the Pillar 2 minimum capital 
requirements can be reduced by the amount equal to the additional 
capital needed, as a result of the increased risk-weighted assets 
due to the technical effect of GEL devaluation. 
4. Principal risk
The Group is exposed to regulatory risk.
The Group’s activities are highly regulated and thus face regulatory 
risk. The local regulator, the National Bank of Georgia, can increase 
the prudential requirements across the whole sector as well as for 
specific institutions within it. Therefore, the Group’s profitability and 
performance may be compromised by an increased regulatory 
burden, including higher capital requirements.
Risk description
The Bank is regulated by the National Bank of Georgia. In addition to 
mandatory capital adequacy ratios, the regulator sets lending limits 
and other economic ratios, including, inter alia, lending, liquidity and 
investment ratios. Under the Georgian banking regulations, the 
Bank is required, among other things, to comply with minimum 
reserve requirements and mandatory financial ratios and regularly 
file periodic reports. The Bank is also regulated by respective tax 
code or other relevant laws in Georgia.
Following the Company’s listing on the London Stock Exchange’s 
premium segment, the Group became subject to increased 
regulations from the UK Financial Conduct Authority.
In addition to its banking operations, the Group also offers other 
regulated financial services products, including leasing, insurance 
and brokerage services.
The Group’s current operations in Azerbaijan (through TBC Kredit) 
are required to comply with the local regulations.
The Group’s operations remain in full compliance with all relevant 
legislation and regulations.
The Group is also subject to financial covenants in its debt 
agreements. For more information, see page 242 in the Group’s 
Audited Financial Statements.
Risk mitigation
The Group has established systems and processes to ensure full 
regulatory compliance. 58 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The dedicated compliance department reports directly to the Chief 
Executive Officer and bears the primary responsibility for regulatory 
compliance. However, compliance is embedded in all levels of the 
Bank’s operations.
The Group’s RECC is responsible for regulatory compliance at the 
Board level.
In terms of banking regulations and Georgia’s taxation system, the 
Group is closely engaged with the regulator to ensure that new 
procedures and requirements are discussed in detail before their 
implementation.
Although decisions made by regulators are beyond the Group’s 
control, significant regulatory changes are usually preceded by a 
consultation period that allows all lenders to provide feedback and 
adjust their business practice. 
5. Principal risk
The Group is exposed to concentration risk. 
Banks operating in developing markets are typically exposed to both 
single-name and sector concentration risks. 
The Group has large individual exposures to single-name borrowers 
whose potential default would entail increased credit losses and 
high impairment charges.
The Group’s portfolio is well diversified across sectors, resulting in 
only a moderate vulnerability to sector concentration risks. However, 
should exposure to common risk drivers increase, the risks are 
expected to amplify correspondingly.
Risk description
The Group’s loan portfolio is diversified, with maximum exposure to 
a single industry (ie energy and utility) standing at 8.4%. Considering 
the macroeconomic outlook, this figure is reasonable and 
demonstrates adequate credit portfolio diversification.
The exposure to the 20 largest borrowers stands at 12.4%, which is 
in line with the Bank’s target of alleviating concentration risk.
Risk mitigation
The Group constantly checks the concentrations of its exposure to 
single counterparties, as well as sectors and common risk drivers, 
and introduces limits for risk mitigation.
As part of its risk appetite framework, the Group limits both 
single-name and sector concentrations. Any considerable change in 
the economic or political environment, in Georgia or neighbouring 
countries, will trigger the Group’s review of the risk appetite criteria 
to mitigate emerging risk concentrations. Stringent monitoring tools 
are in place to ensure compliance with the established limits. In 
addition, the Bank has dedicated restructuring teams to manage 
weakened borrowers. When it is deemed necessary, clients are 
transferred to such teams for more efficient handling and, 
ultimately, to limit resulting credit risk losses.
The National Bank of Georgia’s new capital framework introduced  
a concentration buffer under Pillar 2 that helps to ensure that  
the Group remains adequately capitalised to mitigate  
concentration risks.
6. Principal risk
Liquidity risk is inherent in the Group’s operations.
While the Board believes that the Group currently has sufficient 
financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due, 
liquidity risk is inherent in banking operations and can be 
heightened by numerous factors. These include an overreliance on, 
or an inability to access, a particular source of funding, as well as 
changes in credit ratings or market-wide phenomena, such as the 
global financial crisis that commenced in 2007.
Access to credit for companies in emerging markets is significantly 
influenced by the level of investor confidence and, as such, any 
factors affecting investor confidence (eg a downgrade in credit 
ratings, central bank or state interventions, or debt restructurings  
in a relevant industry) could influence the price or availability of 
funding for companies operating in any of these markets.
Risk description
Throughout 2017, the Group was in compliance with the risk appetite 
limits, as well as the minimum liquidity requirements set by the 
National Bank of Georgia, which introduced a liquidity coverage ratio 
in 2017. This is in addition to the Basel III guidelines, under which a 
conservative approach was applied to the weighting of mandatory 
reserves and to the deposit withdrawal rates, depending on the 
concentration of client groups.
As of 31 December 2017, the net loan to deposits plus international 
financial institution funding ratio stood at 92.5%, the liquidity 
coverage ratio at 112.7%, and the net stable funding ratio at 124.4%. 
All are comfortably above the National Bank of Georgia’s minimum 
requirements or guidance for such ratios.
Risk mitigation
To mitigate this risk, the Group holds a solid liquidity position and 
performs an outflow scenario analysis for both normal and stress 
circumstances to make sure that it has adequate liquid assets and 
cash inflows. The Group maintains a diversified funding structure to 
manage respective liquidity risk. The Board believes there is 
adequate liquidity to withstand significant withdrawals of customer 
deposits, but the unexpected and rapid withdrawal of a substantial 
amount of deposits could have a material adverse impact on the 
Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and/or 
prospects. As part of its liquidity risk management framework, the 
Group has a liquidity contingency plan in place outlining the risk 
indicators for different stress scenarios and respective action plans.

CONTINUED 59 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance Additional Information Financial Statements Strategic Report  
Overview
Strategic Report  
Strategy & Performance
7. Principal risk
Any decline in the Group’s net interest income or net interest 
margin could lead to a reduction in profitability.
Net interest income accounts for the majority of the Group’s total 
income. Consequently, fluctuations in its NIM affect the results of 
operations. High competition on the local banking sector could drive 
interest rates down, compromising the Group’s profitability. At the 
same time, the cost of funding is largely exogenous to the Group and 
is derived based on both the national and international markets.
Risk description
The majority of the Group’s total income derives from net interest 
income. Consequently, the Group’s results of operations are affected 
by fluctuations in its NIM.
In 2017, the NIM decreased by 1.3 pp YoY to 6.5%, which the Bank 
had expected and included in the forecast that provides the basis for 
the Group’s guidance. 
The decrease in the net interest margin is mainly caused by the 
faster repricing of the assets than liabilities, through the competition 
for newly disbursed loans and through prepayment of loans at times 
when market interest rates are falling. 
Finally, the Group limits its direct exposure to the LIBOR and local 
refinancing rates or, where this is not feasible, prices them 
appropriately between assets and liabilities. As of 31 December 
2017, GEL 2,532 million in assets (19.5%) and GEL 1,308 million in 
liabilities (11.8%) were floating, related to the LIBOR/FED/ECB 
(deposit facility) rates. During the same period, GEL 1,786 million of 
assets (13.8%) and GEL 2,131 million of liabilities (19.2%) were 
floating, related to the National Bank of Georgia’s refinancing rate.
Risk mitigation
The high current margin levels, increase in fee and commission 
income and continuous cost optimisation efforts represent a safeguard 
against margin declines, posing profitability concerns for the Group.
The Group has also launched an enhancement programme for 
margin management, including an adequate pricing framework and 
profitability analysis, to assist in decision making. In cases where 
loans are extended on fixed rather than floating terms, the interest 
rate risk is adequately translated into price premiums, safeguarding 
against changes in the interest rates.
The Group expects margins to stabilise in the medium term. The 
Group expects that the decreasing margins will be compensated in 
practice by increased fee and commission income and decreased 
unit cost spent per transaction.
8. Principal risk
The threat posed by cyber-attacks has increased in recent years 
and continues to grow.
The risk of potential cyber-attacks, which have become more 
sophisticated, may lead to significant security breaches. Such risks 
change rapidly and require continued focus and investment.
Risk description
No major cyber-attack attempts have targeted Georgian commercial 
banks in recent years. Nonetheless, the Group’s rising dependency 
on IT systems increases its exposure to potential cyber-attacks.
Risk mitigation
The Group actively monitors, detects and prevents risks arising from 
cyber-attacks. Staff monitor the developments on both local and 
international markets to increase awareness of emerging forms of 
cyber-attacks. Intrusion prevention and Distributed Denial of Service 
(DDoS) protection systems are in place to protect the Group from 
external cyber-threats. Security incident and event monitoring 
systems, in conjunction with respective processes and procedures, 
are in place to handle cyber-incidents effectively.
Processes are continuously updated and enhanced to respond to 
new potential threats. A data recovery policy is in place to ensure 
business continuity in case of serious cyber-attacks.
9. Principal risk
External and internal fraud risks are part of the operational risk 
inherent in the Group’s business. Considering the increased 
complexity and diversification of operations together with the 
digitalisation of the baking sector, fraud risks are evolving. Unless 
proactively managed, fraud events may materially impact the 
Group’s profitability and reputation. 
Risk description
External fraud events may arise from the actions of third parties 
against the Bank. Most frequently, this involved events related to 
banking cards and cash. Internal fraud arises from actions committed 
by the Bank’s employees and such events happen less frequently. 
During the reporting period, the Group faced few instances of fraud 
events which had an immaterial impact on the Group’s profit and 
loss statement (the details on the largest case in 2017 are 
summarised on page 68. 
 
Nonetheless, fraudsters are adopting new techniques and 
approaches to exploit various possibilities to illegally obtain funds. 
Therefore, unless properly monitored and managed, the potential 
impact can become material.
Risk mitigation 
The Group actively monitors, detects and prevents risks arising from 
fraud events. There are permanent monitoring processes in place 
for the timely detection of unusual activities. The risk and control 
self-assessment exercise focuses on identifying residual risks in key 
processes, subject to respective corrective actions. Given our 
continuous efforts to monitor and mitigate fraud risks, together with 
the high sophistication of our internal processes, the Bank ensures 
timely identification and control of fraud-related activities.  60 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management
Overview
Risk management objectives and principles
The Group operates a strong and independent, business-minded risk management system. Its main objective is to contribute to the sustainability 
of risk-adjusted returns through the implementation of an efficient risk management system. The Group has adopted four primary risk 
management principles to better accomplish its major objectives:
  Govern risks transparently to obtain understanding and trust. Consistency and transparency in risk-related processes and policies are 
preconditions for gaining the trust of various stakeholders. Communicating risk goals and strategic priorities to governing bodies and 
providing a comprehensive follow-up in an accountable manner are key priorities for staff responsible for risk management.
  Manage risks prudently to promote sustainable growth and resiliency. Risk management acts as a backstop against excessive risk-taking. 
Capital adequacy management and strong forward-looking tools and decision-making ensure the Group’s sustainability and resiliency.
  Ensure that risk management underpins the implementation of strategy. Staff responsible for risk management provide assurance on the 
feasibility of achieving objectives through risk identification and management. Identifying and adequately pricing risks, as well as taking risk 
mitigation actions, support generating the desired returns and achieving planned targets.
  Use risk management to gain a competitive advantage. Comprehensive, transparent and prudent risk governance facilitates understanding 
and trust from multiple stakeholders, ensuring the sustainability and resilience of the business model and the positioning of risk management 
as the Group’s competitive advantage and strategic enabler.
Risk management framework
The Group’s risk management framework incorporates all necessary components for comprehensive risk governance and is comprised  
of enterprise risk management, credit, financial and non-financial risk management, risk reporting and supporting IT infrastructure,  
cross-risk analytical tools and techniques such as capital adequacy management and stress-testing. The following diagram depicts the risk 
management framework. 61 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Governance
The Group conducts its risk management activities within the framework of its unified risk management system. The involvement of all 
governance levels in risk management, clear segregation of authorities and effective communications between different entities facilitate clarity 
regarding the Group’s strategic and risk objectives, adherence to the established risk appetite and sound risk management. 
The Group’s governance structure ensures adequate oversight and accountability, as well as clear segregation of duties. The Board and the 
Supervisory Board have joint overall responsibility to set the tone at the top of the Group and monitor compliance with the established objectives, 
while the Management Board governs and directs the Group’s daily activities.
The risk governance structure consists of three board levels, including the Board, Supervisory Board and Management Board. All three boards 
have dedicated risk committees. The Board and Supervisory Board each have a Risk, Ethics and Compliance Committee that supervises the risk 
profile and risk governance practice within the Group, as well as an Audit Committee that is responsible for implementing key accounting policies 
and facilitating internal and external auditor activities. 
The Management Board’s Risk Committee was established to guide the Group-wide risk management activities and monitor major risk trends to 
ensure that the risk profile complies with the established risk appetite. The Management Board’s Operational Risk Committee makes decisions 
related to operational risk governance while the Assets and Liabilities Management Committee (ALCO) is responsible for the implementation of 
asset-liability management policies.
The Board, Supervisory Board and the Bank’s senior management govern risk objectives through the Risk Appetite Statement, which establishes 
the desired risk profile and risk limits for different economic environments. The statement also sets monitoring and reporting responsibilities, as 
well as escalation paths for different trigger events, and limits breaches, which prompt risk teams to frame and implement established 
mitigation actions. To effectively incorporate the Group’s risk appetite into day-to-day operations, Risk Appetite Statement metrics are cascaded 
into more granular limits at the business unit level, establishing risk allocation across different segments and activities. 
The process of setting and cascading the risk appetite is undertaken in parallel with the business planning process. The interactive development 
of business and risk plans aligns the plans by solving risk-return trade-offs in the process and increases the feasibility of achieving targets. The 
Board level oversight, coupled with the permanent involvement of senior management in the Group’s risk management and the exercise of 
top-down risk allocation by the enterprise risk management function, ensures clarity regarding risk objectives, intense monitoring of the risk 
profile against the risk appetite, the prompt escalation of risk-related concerns and the establishment of remediation actions.

Overview
Strategic Report  
Strategy & Performance
The daily management of individual risks is based on the three lines of 
defence principle. While business lines are the primary owners of risks, 
risk teams act as the second line of defence by sanctioning transactions, 
tools and techniques for risk identification, analysis, measurement, 
monitoring and reporting. The committees established at operational 
levels are charged with making transaction-level decisions as part of a 
framework comprised of clear and sophisticated delegations of authority 
based on the “four-eyes” principle. All new products and projects pass 
through risk teams to ensure that risks are comprehensively analysed. 
These control arrangements guarantee that the Group makes informed 
decisions that are adequately priced and that any risks exceeding the 
Group’s established targets are not taken. Credit, liquidity, market, 
operational and other non-financial risks are each managed by 
dedicated teams. 
The Group’s strong and independent risk-management structure 
enables the fulfilment of all required risk management functions 
within the second line of defence by highly skilled professionals, with 
a balanced mix of credentials in banking and real sectors in local 
and international markets.
In addition to the risk teams subordinated to the chief risk officer, 
the compliance department reports directly to the CEO and is 
specifically in charge of anti-money laundering and compliance risk 
management. As a third line of defence, the internal audit 
department is responsible for providing independent and objective 
assurance and recommendations to the Group to promote the 
further improvement of operations and risk management.
Enterprise risk management 
The centralised enterprise risk management (ERM) function is in place 
to ensure the effective development, communication and 
implementation of risk strategy and risk appetite across the Group. The 
ERM function facilitates cross-risk activities such as aggregation, 
analytics and reporting and addresses issues that are not specific to a 
single type of risk. Accordingly, the ERM function complements the role 
of other risk functions to ensure the coverage of key risk activities and 
responsibilities and builds capabilities in a centralised team. The major 
ERM functions can be summarised as follows:
  Risk appetite development, cascading and monitoring are 
essential elements of the Group’s strategy. A risk budget is 
allocated to individual business lines to ensure achievement of 
aggregated metrics.
  Internal capital adequacy assessment is a continuous process 
within the Group to ensure adequate calculation of unexpected 
losses and prompt respective mitigation actions to assure 
solvency. Economic capital is assessed for all material risks of 
the Group, such as credit, financial, operational and market 
risks. Additionally, individual economic capital calculations are 
supplemented by enterprise-wide stress-tests. Based on the 
selected stress scenarios, the Group calculates losses and 
projects capital adequacy ratios. This exercise helps the Group to 
define the capital buffers that are to be held to meet the 
regulatory requirements under predefined stress scenarios.
  Stress-testing exercises are one of the crucial tools for effective 
risk identification, measurement and mitigation. In that regard, 
the Group continuously advances its stress-testing capabilities 
and tools. Stress-testing at both the transaction and portfolio 
levels forms part of the regular risk management activities.
  Consistency of risk management practices within the Group is 
also an important task of the ERM. A risk management function 
dedicated to promoting consistency ensures that the risks are 
identified, measured and governed in an optimal manner within 
the Group, and reported and understood on a consolidated basis. 
The Group-wide approach to risk management was underpinned 
and enhanced further due to the recent acquisition of two 
significant financial institutions.
  Generating adequate return on risk plays a crucial role in the 
sustainability of the business model. Risk inputs for pricing are 
designed in a way to serve as a backdrop against excessive risk 
taking and guarantee that the Group takes adequately priced risks.
Credit risk management
As a provider of banking services, the Group is exposed to the risk  
of loss due to the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its 
obligations to settle outstanding amounts in accordance with agreed 
terms. Credit risk is the most material risk faced by the Group since 
it is engaged mainly in traditional lending activity with a simple 
balance sheet. Thus, the Group dedicates significant resources to  
its management.
Due to the significant reliance on foreign currencies in Georgia’s 
economy, currency-induced credit risk is a significant component of 
credit risk, which relates to risks arising from foreign currency-
denominated loans to unhedged borrowers in the Group’s portfolio. 
Credit risk also includes concentration risk, which is the risk related 
to credit portfolio quality deterioration due to large exposures 
provided to single borrowers or groups of connected borrowers,  
or loan concentration in certain economic industries. 
The major objectives of credit risk management are to put in place a 
sound credit approval process for informed risk-taking and procedures 
for effective risk identification, monitoring and measurement. 
The Group adopts segment- and product-specific approaches for 
prudent and efficient credit risk management. Therefore, the 
corporate, MSME and retail portfolios are managed separately to 
address the specifics of individual segments. Corporate and MSME 
(except micro) borrowers have larger exposures and are managed 
on an individual basis, whereas micro and retail borrowers are 
managed on a portfolio basis. Major credit risk functions can be 
summarised as follows.
Credit approval
The Group strives to ensure a sound credit-granting process by 
establishing well-defined lending criteria and building up an 
efficient process for the assessment of a borrower’s risk profile.  
A comprehensive credit risk assessment framework is in place  
with clear segregation of duties among parties involved in the credit 
analysis and approval process. The credit assessment process is 
distinct across segments, being further differentiated across various 
product types to reflect the differing natures of these asset classes. 
Corporate, SME and larger retail and micro loans are assessed on 
an individual basis, whereas the decision-making process for 
smaller retail and micro loans is largely automated.  64 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
After a thorough assessment of borrowers’ requirements, credit 
analysts in the case of corporate and loan officers in the case of SME 
borrowers prepare a presentation containing certain key information  
in relation to the potential borrower and submit it for review to the 
business underwriting risk management unit. An underwriting risk 
manager ensures that the project analysis provided by the credit analyst/
loan officer is complete, all risks and mitigating factors are identified 
and adequately addressed, and the loan is properly structured. Business 
underwriting risk managers specialise in a particular sector to be aware 
of current industry trends and developments. 
For exposures above GEL 5 million, a risk report assessing the credit 
application and recommending a decision is issued for a loan 
approval committee to review. A multi-tiered system of loan approval 
committees is in place with different approval levels to consider the 
borrower’s overall indebtedness and risk profile. These committees 
are responsible for reviewing credit applications and approving 
exposures, with different committees based on the size and risk of 
the loan. At the highest level, the Chief Executive Officer, corporate 
business director and chief risk officer are involved. In addition, 
loans to the 20 largest borrowers or for amounts exceeding 5% of 
the Bank’s regulatory capital would require review and approval of 
the RECC.
Loan officers submit the credit applications for retail and micro 
exposures to the respective underwriting risk management units. 
Depending on the amount of the loan, a loan approval committee 
will review the loan request based on specified limits as to the risk 
level of the customer. 
Underwriting of unsecured retail loans, point-of-sale loans and 
credit cards is largely automated with decisions based on internal 
scorecard models and ratings provided by the credit bureau. 
Different scorecard models are developed based on the type of 
product and the borrowers’ segment, taking into consideration 
various internal and external data. The performance of scorecard 
models is closely monitored to ensure that decisions are in line with 
predefined risk limits. 
Currency-induced credit risk
The Group faces currency-induced credit risk, given that a large part 
of its exposure is denominated in foreign currency, in line with the 
Georgian economy’s significant reliance on currencies other than 
the GEL. However, limits have been established within the risk 
appetite framework to ensure that the Group continues its efforts 
toward minimising the share of foreign currencies in the portfolio. 
Various management tools and techniques are applied to mitigate 
the inherent currency-induced credit risk in the loan book, 
encompassing all phases of credit risk management. In addition, in 
the beginning of 2017, the government introduced a legislative 
initiative to support reducing the banking sector’s reliance on foreign 
currencies. As part of this initiative, all loans to individual borrowers 
in amounts of less than GEL 100,000 should be disbursed in GEL.
The Group applies conservative lending standards to unhedged 
borrowers with exposures denominated in foreign currencies to 
ensure that they can withstand a certain amount of forex 
depreciation without credit quality deterioration.
Apart from the measures in place throughout the underwriting 
process, the Group actively monitors and assesses the quality of loans 
denominated in foreign currencies through stress-testing exercises 
and holds sufficient capital buffers against unexpected losses.
In the event of material currency depreciation, the Group has tools in 
place to accelerate its monitoring efforts, identify customers with 
potential weaknesses, and introduce prompt mitigation. 
Credit concentration risk
The Group is exposed to concentration risk, defined as potential 
deterioration in portfolio quality due to large exposures or individual 
industries. It has established a set of tools to efficiently manage 
concentration risk and, particularly, concentrations of single names 
and sectors in the portfolio. 
The Group is subject to concentration limits on single names and  
the largest 20 borrowers and is focused on optimising the structure 
and quality of the latter portfolio. In addition, the Group imposes 
limits on individual sectors with more conservative caps applied for 
high-risk sectors, which are defined based on comprehensive 
analysis of industry cycles and outlook.
Credit concentrations are monitored monthly. Trends in the  
risk positions are analysed in detail and corrective actions are 
recommended should new sources of risk or positive  
developments emerge.
Along with managing concentration levels in the portfolio, the Group 
estimates unexpected losses and respective economic capital for 
concentrations of both single name borrower and sectors using the 
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, thus ensuring that sufficient capital is 
held against concentration risk.
Collateral policies
Collateral represents the most significant credit risk mitigation tool 
for the Group, making effective collateral management one of the 
key risk management components. Collateral on loans extended by 
the Group may include, but is not limited to, real estate, cash 
deposits, vehicles, equipment, inventory, precious metals, securities 
and third-party guarantees. The collateral accepted against a loan 
depends on the type of credit product and the borrower’s credit risk. 
The Group has a largely collateralised portfolio in all its segments 
with real estate representing a major share of collateral.
A centralised unit for collateral management governs the Group’s 
view and strategy in relation to collateral management and ensures 
that collateral serves as an adequate mitigating factor for credit risk 
management purposes. The collateral management framework 
consists of a sound independent appraisal process, a haircut system 
throughout the underwriting process, monitoring and revaluations. 
Throughout the underwriting process, provided collateral is 
appraised by the Group’s internal appraisal function in accordance 
with internal policies. In specific instances, such as lending to 
related parties and material transactions, external appraisers 
validate these appraisals. The internal appraisal group is part of the 
collateral management unit and is independent from the loan-

Strategy & Performance
granting process to ensure that adequate appraisals are obtained 
and proper procedures are followed. When appraising collateral,  
the Group applies haircuts to the asset’s market value based on  
the property type and its location.
Collateral of significant value is re-evaluated annually through 
on-site visits by internal appraisers. Statistical methods are used  
to monitor the value of collateral of non-significant value.
Credit monitoring
The Group’s risk management policies and processes are designed to 
identify and analyse risk in a timely manner and monitor adherence  
to predefined limits by means of reliable and timely data. The Group 
dedicates considerable resources to gain a clear and accurate 
understanding of the credit risk faced across various business segments.
The Group uses a robust monitoring system to react promptly to 
macro and micro developments, identify weaknesses in the credit 
portfolio and outline solutions to make informed risk management 
decisions. Monitoring processes are tailored to the specifics of 
individual segments, as well as encompassing individual credit 
exposures, overall portfolio performance and external trends that 
may impact on the portfolio’s risk profile. Early warning signals 
serve as an important advance alert system for the detection of 
credit deteriorations, leading to mitigating actions.
The Board’s RECC reviews reports relating to the credit quality of 
the loan portfolio quarterly. By comparing current data with 
historical figures and analysing forecasts, the management believes 
that it can identify risks and respond to them by amending its 
policies in a timely manner.
Restructuring and collections
The Group uses a comprehensive portfolio supervision system to 
identify weakened credit exposures and promptly take early 
remedial actions when necessary. The collection and recovery 
processes are initiated when the borrower does not meet the agreed 
payments or the borrower’s financial standing is weakened, 
potentially jeopardising the repayment of the credit.
Dedicated restructuring and recovery units manage weakened 
borrowers across all business segments, with collection and 
recovery strategies tailored for business segments and individual 
exposure categories. The restructuring unit’s primary goal is to 
rehabilitate the borrower and transfer the exposure back to the 
performing category. The sophistication and complexity of the 
rehabilitation process differs based on the type and size of the 
exposure. Corporate and SME borrowers are transferred to the 
recovery unit when there is a strong probability that a material 
portion of the principal amount will not be paid, and the main 
stream of recovery is no longer the borrower’s cash flow. 
Loan recovery plans may include all available sources of loan 
recovery, such as selling the borrower’s assets, realising collateral 
or payments under guarantees. The Group’s goal in the recovery 
process is to negotiate a loan recovery strategy with the borrower 
and secure cash recoveries to the extent possible, or to negotiate 
repayment through the sale or repossession of collateral.
Collection functions for retail and micro loans support customers 
who are experiencing difficulties in fulfilling their obligations. Such 
customers may miss payments or notify the Group about their 
difficulty with loan repayments. A centralised team monitors retail 
borrowers in delinquency which, coupled with branches’ efforts, 
aims to maximise collection. The debt managed through FICO 
software is applied for early collection processes. Collection 
strategies are defined based on the size and type of exposure. 
Specific strategies are tailored to different sub-groups of customers, 
reflecting respective risk levels, so that greater effort is dedicated to 
customers with a higher risk profile.
Retail and micro loans are generally transferred to the recovery unit 
at 60-90 days past due. Collateralised loans are transferred to the 
internal recovery unit, whereas the Group collaborates with external 
collection agencies for unsecured loans. To recover collateralised 
loans, the recovery plan is outlined considering the individual 
borrower’s specifics and may involve loan repayments under revised 
schedules or the sale of collateral. Collection agencies generally 
negotiate with the borrowers so that the full repayment of the loan 
or loans can be rescheduled and repaid accordingly.
Once the exposure is transferred to the recovery unit, if the Group is 
unable to negotiate acceptable terms with the borrower, the Group 
may initiate collateral repossession, which is usually a standard 
process with limited legal complications, and may include court, 
arbitration or notary procedures. Restructuring and recovery units 
are supported by qualified incumbent lawyers for efficient 
accomplishment of litigation and repossession processes.
Provision assessment
In assessing the credit risk and calculating provisions according to 
IAS 39, the Group takes into account three components: (i) the 
probability of default by the counterparty on its contractual 
obligations; (ii) current exposures to the counterparty and potential 
utilisation of undrawn credit liabilities, from which the Group 
assessed the exposure at default; and (iii) the likely loss ratio on the 
defaulted obligations (the loss given default). According to the 
Group’s policy, asset and contingent liability loss reserves must be 
maintained at an adequate level to absorb all estimated incurred 
losses in the Group’s credit portfolio at any given point in time. 
Starting from 1 January 2018, the Group moved to the new 
provisioning methodology in line with IFRS 9 requirements.  
The updated methodology makes it possible to assess loan-loss 
provisions and allowances accurately with the incorporation of 
forward-looking information. Along with methodology development, 
an IT tool for provisioning was implemented. 
During 2016-17, significant work was performed to develop the 
impairment methodology and models per IFRS 9 requirements  
and set up the respective systems and processes. The project was 
undertaken with the support of Deloitte. Representatives of the 
Group’s risk, finance and IT departments were responsible for the 
methodology and IT tool implementation.
The new models are more complex and make it possible to 
incorporate expectations of macro developments based on  66 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
predefined scenarios. Under the IFRS 9 methodology, the Bank 
classifies its exposures in three stages: 
  Stage I – assets for which no significant increase of credit risk 
since initial recognition is identified;
  Stage II – assets for which significant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition is identified; and
  Stage III – credit-impaired exposures.
The implementation of IFRS 9 has resulted in a one-time impact of GEL 
64 million, which will be passed directly to IFRS equity. The impact did 
not affect the Bank’s profit and loss statement or capital adequacy.
Financial risk management
Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group either may not have sufficient 
financial resources available to meet all its obligations and 
commitments as they fall due, or may only be able to access those 
resources at a high cost. 
Both funding and market liquidity risks can emerge from a number 
of factors that are beyond the Group’s control. Due to financial 
market instability, factors such as a downgrade in credit ratings or 
other negative developments may affect the price or ability to access 
funding necessary to make payments in respect of the Group’s 
future indebtedness.
Liquidity risk is managed by the financial risk management and 
treasury departments and monitored by the Management Board’s 
Risk Committee or the Assets and Liabilities Management 
Committee (ALCO) within their predefined functions.
The principal objectives of the Group’s Liquidity Risk Management 
Policy are to:
(i) ensure the availability of funds to meet claims arising from total 
liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments, both actual and 
contingent, at an economic price;
(ii) recognise any structural mismatch existing within the Group’s 
statement of financial position and set monitoring ratios to manage 
funding in line with the Group’s well-balanced growth; and
(iii) monitor liquidity and funding on an ongoing basis to ensure that 
approved business targets are met without compromising the 
Group’s risk profile.
The Management Board reviews the Liquidity Risk Management 
Policy, which is then presented to the Board and the Supervisory 
Board for approval.
Liquidity risk is categorised into two risk types: funding liquidity risk 
and market liquidity risk. 
Funding liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to 
efficiently meet both expected and unexpected current and future 
cash flows without affecting either its daily operations or its financial 
condition under both normal conditions and during a crisis. To 
manage funding liquidity risk, the Group has an internally developed 
model using a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and a net stable funding 
ratio (NSFR), both under Basel III liquidity guidelines. 
Additionally, the Group applies stress-tests and “what-if” scenario 
analyses and monitors the National Bank of Georgia’s minimum liquidity 
ratio. In 2017, the National Bank of Georgia introduced its own LCR for 
liquidity risk management purposes. In addition to the Basel III 
guidelines, the ratio applies conservative approaches to the weighting of 
mandatory reserves and deposit withdrawal rates depending on the 
client group’s concentration. From September 2017, the Bank also 
monitors compliance with the National Bank of Georgia’s LCR limits. In 
addition to the total LCR limit, the National Bank of Georgia has also 
defined limits per currency for the GEL and foreign currencies.
The LCR is calculated by reference to the qualified liquid assets divided 
by 30-day cash net outflows. It is used to help manage short-term 
liquidity risks. The NSFR is calculated by dividing available stable 
funding by required stable funding. It is used for long-term liquidity risk 
management to promote resilience over a longer time horizon by 
creating additional incentives for the bank to rely on more stable sources 
of funding on a continuing basis. 
Market liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot easily offset or 
eliminate a position at the then-current market price because of 
inadequate market depth or market disruption. To manage market 
liquidity risk, the Group follows the Basel III guidelines on high-
quality liquidity asset eligibility to ensure that the Group’s high-
quality liquid assets can be sold without causing a significant 
movement in price and with minimum loss of value.
In addition, the Group has a liquidity contingency plan, which forms 
part of the overall prudential liquidity policy. The plan is designed to 
ensure that the Group can meet its funding and liquidity 
requirements and maintain its core business operations in 
deteriorating liquidity conditions that could arise outside the 
ordinary course of its business.
Funding and maturity analysis
The Group’s principal sources of liquidity include customer deposits and 
accounts, borrowings from local and international banks and financial 
institutions, subordinated loans from international financial institution 
investors, local interbank short-duration term deposits and loans, 
proceeds from sales of investment securities, principal repayments on 
loans, interest income and fee and commission income.
The Board believes that a strong and diversified funding structure is 
one of the Group’s differentiators. The Group relies on relatively 
stable deposits from Georgia as the main source of funding. To 
maintain and further enhance its liability structure, the Group sets 
targets for retail deposits in its strategy and sets loan-to-deposit 
ratio limits. 
The Group also sets deposit concentration limits for large deposits 
and deposits of non-Georgian residents in its deposit portfolio. The 
Board believes that the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet its 
current on- and off-balance-sheet obligations. For further 
information on the management of liquidity risk, please refer to 
Note 36 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.
RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 67 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance Additional Information Financial Statements Strategic Report  
Overview
Strategic Report  
Strategy & Performance
Market risk
The Group follows the Basel Committee’s definition of market risk 
as the risk of losses in on- and off-balance-sheet positions arising 
from movements in market prices. These risks are principally (a) 
risks pertaining to interest-rate related instruments and equities in 
the “trading book” (financial instruments or commodities held for 
trading purposes); and (b) foreign exchange risk and commodities 
risk throughout the Group. 
The Group’s strategy is not to be involved in trading financial 
instruments or investments in commodities. Accordingly, the 
Group’s only exposure to market risk is foreign exchange risk in  
its “structural book”, comprising its regular commercial banking 
activities which have no trading, arbitrage or speculative intent. 
Foreign exchange risk
Due to the Georgian economy’s significant reliance on foreign 
currencies, movements in foreign exchange rates can adversely affect 
the Group’s financial position. This risk stems from the open currency 
positions created due to mismatches in foreign currency assets and 
liabilities. The National Bank of Georgia requires the Bank to monitor 
both balance-sheet and total aggregate balance (including off-balance-
sheet) open currency positions and to maintain the latter within 20% of 
the Bank’s regulatory capital. For the year ended 31 December 2017, the 
Bank maintained an aggregate balance open currency position of 1.5%.
In addition, the Supervisory Board sets further limits on open currency 
positions. The ALCO has set limits on the level of exposure by currency 
and for total aggregate position that are more conservative than those 
set by the National Bank of Georgia and the Supervisory Board. The 
heads of the treasury and financial risk management departments 
separately monitor the Bank’s compliance with these limits daily. 
Compliance with these limits is also reported daily to the Management 
Board and periodically to the Supervisory Board and its Risk, Ethics and 
Compliance Committee. On the Group-wide level, foreign-exchange risk 
is monitored and reported monthly. A value-at-risk analysis following 
the Basel guidelines is used to assess the Bank’s minimum capital 
requirements under the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP) framework monthly. 
Interest rate risk management
Interest rate risk arises from potential changes in market interest rates 
that can adversely affect the value of the Group’s financial assets and 
liabilities. This risk can arise from maturity mismatches of assets and 
liabilities, as well as from the re-pricing characteristics of such assets 
and liabilities. The deposits and most of the loans offered by the Group 
are at fixed interest rates, while a portion of the Group’s borrowing is 
based on a floating interest rate. 
The Group’s floating rate borrowings are, to a certain extent, hedged 
because the National Bank of Georgia pays a floating interest rate on the 
minimum reserves that TBC Bank holds with it. Furthermore, many of 
TBC Bank’s loans to and deposits from customers contain a clause 
allowing it to adjust the interest rate on the loan/deposit in case of 
adverse interest rate movements, thereby limiting exposure to interest 
rate risk. The management also believes that TBC Bank’s interest rate 
margins provide a reasonable buffer to mitigate the effect of a possible 
adverse interest rate movement.
The Group employs an advanced framework for the management of 
interest rate risk by establishing appropriate limits, monitoring 
compliance with them and preparing forecasts. Interest rate risk is 
managed by the financial risk management department and is 
monitored by the ALCO, which decides on actions that are necessary  
for effective interest rate risk management and follows up on their 
implementation. The major aspects of interest rate risk management 
development and the respective reporting are periodically provided to 
the Management Board, the Supervisory Board, the Board and the Risk, 
Ethics and Compliance Committees.
The Group measures four types of interest-rate risk based on the source 
of the risk: (i) re-pricing risk; (ii) yield curve risk; (iii) basis risk; and (iv) 
optionality (embedded option) risk.
The Group considers numerous stress scenarios, including different 
yield curve shifts and behavioural adjustments to cash flows (such as 
deposit withdrawals or loan prepayments), to calculate the impact on 
one-year profitability and enterprise value. Appropriate limits are set by 
the Supervisory Board and the Management Board’s Risk Committee. 
Under the ICAAP framework, the Group reserves capital in the amount 
of the adverse effect of possible parallel yield curve shift scenarios on 
net interest income over a one-year period for Basel II Pillar 2 capital 
calculation purposes. In addition, the Group has developed stress-tests 
in accordance with Basel II requirements to ensure that the Bank can 
withstand severe but probable stress scenarios.
Counterparty risk
Through performing banking services, as lending in the interbank 
money market, settling a transaction in the interbank foreign exchange 
market, entering into interbank transactions related to trade finance or 
investing in securities, TBC Bank is exposed to the risk of losses due to 
the failure of a counterparty bank to meet its obligations. 
To manage counterparty risk, the Bank defines limits on an individual 
basis for each counterparty and as well on a portfolio basis by limiting 
the expected loss from both treasury and trade finance exposures. As of 
31 December 2017, TBC Bank’s interbank exposure was concentrated 
with banks that external agencies, such as Fitch, Moody’s and Standard 
and Poor’s, have assigned high A-grade credit ratings.
Non-financial risk management
Operational risk management
One of the main risks that the Group faces is operational risk, which  
is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes and 
systems, human error , fraud or external events. It includes legal risk  
but excludes strategic and reputational risk. However , reputational risk 
management is also given high importance and priority and is an 
integral part of the organisation’s overall risk culture.
The Group is exposed to many types of operational risk, including: 
fraudulent and other internal and external criminal activities; 
breakdowns in processes, controls or procedures; and system failures 
or cyber-attacks from an external party with an intention to make the 
Group’s services or supporting infrastructure unavailable to its intended 
users, which in turn may jeopardise sensitive information and financial 
transactions of the Group, its clients, counterparties or customers.  68 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Moreover , the Group is subject to the risks that cause disruption to 
systems performing critical functions or business disruption arising 
from events wholly or partially beyond its control, for example, natural 
disasters, transport or utility failures, etc, which may result in losses or 
reductions in service to customers and/or economic losses to the Group. 
The operational risks discussed above are also applicable where the 
Group relies on outside suppliers of services. Considering the fast-
changing environment and sophistication of both banking services and 
possible fraudsters, the importance of constantly improving processes, 
controls, procedures and systems is heightened to ensure risk 
prevention and reduce the risk of loss to the Group.
To oversee and mitigate operational risk, the Group has established an 
operational risk management framework, an overarching document that 
outlines the general principles for effective operational risk management 
and defines the roles and responsibilities of various parties involved in 
the process. Policies and procedures enabling effective management of 
operational risks are an integral part of the framework.
The Management Board ensures a strong internal control culture 
within the Group, where control activities are an integral part of 
operations. The Board sets the operational risk appetite and the 
Operational Risks Committee oversees compliance with the limits. The 
Operational Risks Committee discusses the Group’s operational risk 
profile and risk minimisation recommendations on a regular basis.
The operational risk management department acts as second line of 
defence. It is responsible for implementing the framework and 
appropriate policies and procedures to enable the Group to manage 
operational risks, as well as monitoring operational risk events, risk 
exposures against risk appetite and material control issues.
The department is also responsible for the day-to-day management 
of operational risks using various techniques. These include but are 
not limited to: 
  running risk and control self-assessments, which are aimed at 
detecting possible gaps in operations and processes with the 
purpose of suggesting appropriate corrective actions;
  forming an internal risk event database for further quantitative 
and qualitative analysis;
  performing internal control to detect systematic errors in 
banking operations, internal fraud events and monitoring key risk 
indicators;
  conducting scenario and root-cause analyses;
  providing business advisory services regarding non-standard 
cases as well as assessments of new products and procedures;
  monitoring IT incident occurrence and overseeing activities 
targeted at solving identified problems; and
  obtaining insurance policies to transfer the risk of losses from 
operational risk events.
The operational risk management department has reinforced its 
internal control, risk assessment teams and methodologies to further 
fine-tune the existing control environment. The same applies to the set 
of actions directed to homogenise operational risk management 
processes throughout the Group’s member companies. The operational 
risk management department reports to the chief risk officer .
Various policies, processes and procedures are in place to control and 
mitigate operational risks, including:
  enacting an outsourcing risk management policy, which enables the 
Group to control outsourcing (vendor) risk arising from adverse 
events and risk concentrations due to failures in vendor selection, 
insufficient controls and oversight over a vendor and/or services 
provided by a vendor and other impacts to the vendor;
  implementing procedures to analyse systemic flaws and take 
corrective measures to prevent the reoccurrence of significant losses
  involving the operational risk management department in the 
approval process for new products and services to minimise risks 
relating thereto; and
  developing a special operational risk awareness programme for the 
Group’s employees and providing regular training to further 
strengthen the Group’s internal risk culture.
During 2017 particular attention was given to operational risk 
concerns arising from an incidence of identity fraud in the fourth 
quarter 2017. Using an apostilled power of attorney, which was 
ultimately confirmed as fraudulent by the account owner, a third 
party was able to gain access to our client’s bank account and 
withdraw approximately US$ 800,000 in cash. To prevent any 
reoccurrence of this type of fraud, extra control measures were 
added to the Bank’s identity verification process and its 
corresponding policies.
Compliance
The compliance department is a key body executing the Bank’s 
compliance function, has a formal status and is independent from 
operating structural units and business lines. The compliance 
function’s role is executed by a compliance officer, who acts as a 
compliance adviser and coordinator, addressing compliance issues 
in structural units or business lines. The chief compliance officer 
reports quarterly to the Risk, Ethics and Compliance Committee, 
with a disciplinary reporting line to the CEO. 
The department is responsible for the Group’s compliance and 
reputational risk management. It implements and monitors the 
fulfilment of requirements of the following policies: 
  the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Policy;
  the Anti-Bribery, Anti-Corruption and Anti-Facilitation of Tax 
Evasion Policy;
  the Related-Party Transaction Policy;
  the Share Dealing Policy; and
  the Whistleblowing Policy.
The compliance department manages regulatory risk by conducting 
root cause analyses of customer complaints, the operational risk 
event database, internal audit findings and litigation cases. Based on 
the outcomes of these analyses, it then initiates changes to internal 
instructions or gives recommendations to the Bank’s structural 
units on relevant process amendments. The compliance officer has 
the role of educator and adviser on compliance issues. The 
compliance department delivers training courses via distance-
learning and face-to face sessions to existing staff members and 
newcomers, and promotes a compliance culture within the Group.

Governance Additional Information Financial Statements Strategic Report  
Overview
Strategic Report  
Strategy & Performance
As part of its ongoing operations in 2017, the National Bank of 
Georgia has conducted a thematic inspection of the Bank covering the 
past six years. Over this period, it has identified a certain number of 
transactions in connection with which the Bank was required to pay 
penalties in the aggregate amount of GEL 1.9 million. The majority of 
these transactions were related to few companies, which were 
considered not to be properly identified and the amount of a single 
penalty for most of these transactions did not exceed GEL 1,000.
However, the National Bank of Georgia noted the progress that the 
Bank has made to date, as well as the planned actions going 
forward, and assessed the level of anti-money laundering and 
counter-terrorist financing controls as acceptable. The Bank paid 
these penalties from the appropriate provisions that had been 
created for similar actions and operations in the previous years and, 
accordingly, there was no impact on the Bank’s profit and loss 
statement in the 2017 results.
The new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will come 
into force on 25 May 2018, which will apply mainly to our holding 
company, TBC Bank Group PLC. Given the fact that the Group’s 
operations are mainly in Georgia, which is outside EU, the impact of 
GDPR on the Group will be limited. However, the Group is in the 
process of assessing the scope, given that the GDPR applies to 
entities outside the EU offering goods and services into the EU, and 
developing respective actions.
Information Security Steering Committee
An Information Security Steering Committee has been established and 
charged with continuously improving information security and business 
continuity management processes and minimising information security 
risks. The committee has been formed to centralise the information 
security function, including physical security, HR security, data security, 
IT security and business continuity. 
The Group invests in effective information security risk management, 
incident management and awareness programmes, which are enhanced 
with automated tools that ensure acceptable levels of information 
security risk within the organisation. Whenever preventive controls are 
not applicable, comprehensive business continuity and incident 
response plans ensure the Group’s ability to operate on an ongoing basis 
and limit losses in the event of a severe business disruption.
Conduct risk 
Conduct risk is defined as the risk to the delivery of fair outcomes 
for customers and other stakeholders.
The Group’s business holds a unique place of trust in the lives of 
more than 2.2 million customers throughout Georgia. Therefore, 
preserving market confidence through the protection of our 
customers’ interests is of utmost importance for the financial 
stability of the Group and the attainment of its strategic objectives.
The Group’s employees undertake and perform their responsibilities 
with honesty and integrity. They are critical to maintaining trust and 
confidence in its operations and upholding the important values of 
trust, loyalty, prudence and care.
Additionally, the Group’s management understands that it bears 
responsibility to a diversified group of domestic and international 
investors and needs to embrace the rules and mechanisms of 
protecting customers and maintaining the confidence of investors 
and financial markets. The Group’s directors strive to establish the 
“tone from the top,” which sets out the messages describing and 
illustrating the core components of good conduct.
In managing conduct risk, the Group entrusts different departments 
and divisions with carrying out the task of managing, mitigating and 
eliminating the conduct risk across all the Group’s operations with 
clients and other stakeholders. The compliance and operational risk 
departments cooperate to create a unified conduct risk management 
framework and assist the business lines and departments in:
1.  developing and maintaining policies and procedures to ensure 
that the respective departments and individual employees 
comply with the provisions set out by regulatory provisions, best 
practice and the Group’s internal handbook;
2.  maintaining a liaison with the compliance department regarding 
the administration of policies and procedures and the 
investigation of complaints regarding the conduct of the 
department, its manager and/or its employees;
3.  ensuring that product information provided to clients by the 
front-line employees is accurate and complete, and is conveyed 
(both in written and oral form) in a simple and understandable 
way regardless of the level of sophistication of a given client;
4.  maintaining records of client conversations and emails that contain 
sensitive and sales-related information, including information 
pertaining to the acquisition of new clients and making complex 
product offers to existing and prospective clients;
5.  delivering timely on-boarding training for new employees 
regarding proper conduct and ensuring that all employees stay 
up to date on evolving compliance standards within the Group 
through periodic training;
6.  developing an open culture that encourages employees to speak up 
without fear of punishment. Specifically, this means setting up 
processes for the prevention and detection of conflicts of interest, 
creating ethical incentives and bonus formulas, and aligning 
incentives and disciplinary practices to the Group’s risk appetite; and
7.  employing qualified staff and sufficient human and technological 
resources to investigate, analyse, implement and monitor sales 
and after-sales activities.
The above approach ensures that the management of conduct risk is 
not limited to risk management units, including the compliance 
department, but is fully embraced by the front-line departments and 
that the proper conduct is fully integrated into required job skills.
Viability statement
The assessment of principal risks underpins the Viability Statement 
in the Directors’ Report for 2017, see pages 111 to 112. The 
assessment involved consideration of the Group’s current financial 
position over three years of coverage ending 1 January 2021, which 
is relevant to the strategic considerations of the Group. INFOCUS

found in the retail banking section on pages 30-33. 
Business customers
We believe that one of our main responsibilities is to help 
businesses grow and develop. Increasing the number of successful 
businesses in our country makes it stronger, increases its economic 
potential and fosters an attractive investment environment. 
TBC Bank was a start-up 25 years ago, and we understand the 
importance of having a steady partner through different 
development stages. Early-stage businesses need financial 
assistance as well, but it is common for established banks to refrain 
from financing them because of the risks associated with start-ups. 
In 2017, we launched our first project oriented at start-ups, called 
Startuperi, which aims to mentor start-ups on their strategy, assist 
them to become thriving businesses and provide financing for 
further development. The word “startuperi” in Georgian means 
“start-up nation,” reflecting our belief that our country’s prosperity 
is related to the number of flourishing businesses in Georgia. The 
project has partnerships with several leading companies, offering 
the participating start-ups tailored services for their needs. This 
year we co-organised a special annual conference called Spotlight 
for the start-ups, where the speakers were founders of successful 
firms sharing their stories of failures and successes. The project has 
been a huge success since its launch. Start-ups received individual 
consultations with leading professionals about topics such as 
marketing, human resources, management, finance and taxes. In 
total, up to 13,000 start-ups were involved, and we disbursed 168 
loans totalling GEL 21.0 million in financing for their businesses.

OUR PEOPLE
Promoting equal opportunity
We are an equal-opportunity employer and do not discriminate 
based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, age or disability. We aim  
to create a corporate culture that welcomes and benefits  
from diversity. 
We promote gender equality and support women in the workforce. 
We are proud that women comprised 67% of our total workforce  
at the end of 2017. To better support women employees, we offer  
them six months of maternity leave at full pay and other  
childcare benefits.
Furthermore, we have provided more than GEL 160.4 million for micro, 
small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in rural areas, supporting 
agriculture, manufacturing, tourism and other economic activities in 
those regions. We also continue to support MSMEs through our 
business support programme, which we launched in 2013. The 
programme offers free training courses, individual consultations, 
networking events, conferences and masterclasses. During the past 
year , around 4,400 companies have attended the training courses and 
workshops, and 116 MSMEs have received individual consultations. 
Participation in the business support programme is free of charge. 
Another remarkable idea put into action in 2017 was making basic 
information about various industries easily accessible for 
businesses. We collaborated with Georgia’s Revenue Service to 
analyse available public data and create a business map that is 
accessible to any person free of charge, allowing them to 
benchmark against actual average industry metrics like revenues, 
costs, number of employees and payroll. This tool will enable 
companies to measure their place and performance against their 
competitors. 
This year , we held our annual business awards ceremony for the second 
time. After the successful ceremony last year , this year the number  
of participants increased up to 700. The awards ceremony promotes 
entrepreneurship in Georgia and presents thriving business examples 
to a wider audience, encouraging innovative businesses to set up. The 
event was covered by traditional and social media channels, reaching 
5.3 million views. For the 2017 business awards, we introduced a new 
“Business of the Year” category. To select a winner for the new 
category, we paid special attention to a company’s corporate 
responsibility strategy and assessed their activities, along with  
other criteria.
Georgia’s mountainous regions are an area that is less developed, 
but has high potential to grow economically and attract a significant 
number of tourists to the country due to their unique nature and 
beauty. Georgian ski resorts are becoming increasingly popular but 
need support to transform them into high-class destinations with 
proper infrastructure, thereby improving their reputations among 
tourists. We have been supporting Georgian mountain resorts since 
2016. The primary focus of our partnership is developing 
infrastructure and innovative payment systems at Georgian 
mountain resorts, which will improve their efficiency and facilitate 
increased demand for skiing treks, positively reflecting on the 
Georgian economy and promoting local businesses.
Priorities for 2018
In 2018, we will carry on innovating and developing new offerings for 
our customers, as well as continue focusing on increasing customer 
satisfaction levels.
We will also increase lending volumes in rural areas to encourage 
economic activities and help to lower the unemployment rate in 
those regions. We firmly believe that each employee is part of our 
success and we are committed to attracting and retaining top talent 
by providing competitive remuneration and attractive benefits; 
fostering fair, honest and collaborative working relationships; and 
supporting professional development. As of the end of 2017, we 
employed more than 7,000 people who all share the same values 
and are dedicated to achieving our vision of becoming the best 
digital financial services company in the region

Performance assessment
The Bank runs a transparent and fair assessment system to 
evaluate the performance and skills of all employees. Actively 
engaging employees in their goal setting, monitoring performance 
progress and providing constructive feedback are the key 
components of our performance assessment system. 
We use the management-by-objectives (MBO) system for most of 
our back-office staff, under which specific objectives, aligned to the 
organisational goals, are defined and agreed at the beginning of the 
assessment period. After setting goals, employees have a clear 
understanding of their roles, responsibilities and contribution to the 
Group’s overall strategy. The process includes ongoing tracking and 
semi-annual feedback on employee achievements. The scoring 
system is the same for all employees within the MBO system and 
ensures fairness throughout the organisation.
For front-office staff, we have a target-based system developed by 
external consultants. Under our target-based system, employee 
performance is linked to quantitative and qualitative KPIs that are 
closely aligned to the Group’s strategic objectives. Compared with 
the MBO system, the target-based system’s progress is measured 
monthly, quarterly or annually.
We also run a 360-degree feedback system for our middle 
managers, which allows them to receive a well-rounded and 
balanced view of their skills and behaviours, assisting them to build 
on current strengths and develop new skills. 
To further enhance our performance-assessment system for middle 
management, in 2017, we introduced a new system that we 
developed together with Mercer, a leading international HR 
consulting company. The new system utilises a more standardised 
approach and helps to better align the managers’ tactical goals with 
the Group’s overarching strategy, and assists them in developing 
critical competencies. 
Financial rewards and non-monetary benefits
To attract and retain the best talent, we offer a competitive 
remuneration and market-leading benefits package. Our employee 
remuneration package consists of monthly salaries and an attractive 
bonus scheme, which vary by position and are linked to 
performance. To promote a longer-term view and align middle 
managers’ interests with those of shareholders, we offer a deferred 
share bonus scheme, whereby 15-20% of the annual bonus is paid in 
TBC PLC shares with a three-year vesting period as follows: 10% is 
awarded on the first anniversary of the award, a further 10% on the 
second anniversary and the remaining 80% on the third anniversary. 
The company awarded around 136,000 shares as annual bonuses in 
2018 based on 2017 performance. The directors’ remuneration 
system is described in detail in the remuneration report on pages 
126 to 147.
We provide our colleagues with attractive insurance and pension 
benefits, six months of maternity and paternity leave at full pay, and 
paid annual and sick leave. We also offer corporate mobile numbers 
with free internal calls and special discounted fees for other calls.  
In the case of both marriage and childbirth, we provide our team 
members and their families with monetary awards, as well as 
compensation in the case of serious illness or death. We also 
support large families and provide a special, one-time gift of GEL 
10,000 to all TBC Bank employees upon the birth of their fourth  
child or more.
Talent attraction and development
As we believe that our people are one of our key competitive 
advantages, we seek to recruit, retain and develop highly qualified 
and engaged individuals.
We actively participate in numerous job fairs organised by top 
universities and leading HR consultancies to help us in selecting the 
best candidates with the highest growth potential. 
Since 2012, we have run a special internship programme for college 
students in their third or fourth year of study. We partner with top 
Georgian universities and give the best students an opportunity to 
become part of our team. During our one-year internship 
programme, students can rotate through different departments of 
the bank. After they complete their internships, we offer permanent 
jobs to the most successful trainees. We pride ourselves on being 
named the best supporter of education in 2017 by Free University of 
Tbilisi, the leading university in Georgia.
Supporting the development of our people and helping them to 
realise their potential is one of our top priorities. For this purpose, 
we offer various in-house training sessions and courses, in addition 
to sponsoring various international certification programmes, 
including CFA, ACCA and FRM, for all our employees. We also 
provide financial support to our brightest people to pursue graduate 
education at leading universities worldwide. In 2017, 19 managers 
received TBC scholarships.
Since 2011, the Bank has run TBC Academy, an in-house educational 
centre available to all employees that offers numerous courses in 
banking and related fields. The Bank’s top and middle management 
teach the courses. For new employees, we provide introductory 
training in order to share with them our corporate values and 
culture, and to give them a brief overview of the Group. In 2017, 
several new classes were added, including regulations, ethics and 
financial fraud management, as well as soft skills like leadership 
and change management. In addition, we regularly organise various 
job-related training for our employees. We also use a distance 
learning system for many training programmes, allowing employees 
more flexibility in completing the courses. Furthermore, in May 
2017, we started a session of masterclasses for personal 
development, which were delivered by leading professionals who 
shared their knowledge and experience with our employees.  
In total, six masterclasses were held, and more than 1,800 
employees attended.

Strategy & Performance
Employee motivation and engagement
We constantly work on improving our people’s motivation and 
engagement levels by exploring their interests and doing our best to 
surprise and celebrate with them. 
To support internal communications, we have established several 
clubs based on employee interests that unite photographers, 
football lovers, TBC talents and employees with other interests. 
Clubs bring together employees from different departments and 
give them an opportunity to get to know each other, share their ideas 
and views. One such employee gathering is an internal 
championship of the intellectual game “What? Where? When?” in 
which over 30 teams participated. 
To promote a healthy work - life balance, we organise weekend field 
trips, team-building events and retreats for our employees, as well 
as numerous internal championships, including bowling, football, 
basketball and sand rugby. We also participate in external running 
competitions and various sporting events. As part of our efforts to 
promote a healthy lifestyle, we offer our employees medical 
check-ups and free consultations. In 2017, nearly 2,000 employees 
benefited from these benefits. In addition, our team members can 
receive special discounts and offers at various sport centres. Most of 
our employees also donate up to 2% of their salary to the TBC Fund, 
which supports our team members and their relatives with severe 
diseases and helps to finance their medical treatment costs. TBC 
Fund was established in 2009 and has since helped around  
1,000 people.
For middle management, we organise annual overseas workshops. 
As national rugby team supporters, we try to combine these 
workshops with important rugby matches. Last year, we supported 
our national team in an autumn test match with Scotland. In 2017, 
we took our middle managers to Wales to support the Georgian 
national rugby team in a challenging game versus Wales as part of 
Autumn Internationals 2017. This type of event both creates strong 
team spirit and is in line with our strategy of becoming the 
ambassadors for rugby in Georgia.
As we care about our employees’ appearance and comfort, this year 
we decided to upgrade our corporate apparel. To take into 
consideration our employees’ ideas and wishes, we conducted a 
survey that more than 2,500 employees participated in. Based on the 
survey results, we created 10 different designs of scarves and ties in 
partnership with leading Georgian designers. These accessories 
were distributed to front-office employees as gifts and are also 
available for sale at our corporate online brand shop. Our brand 
shop is subsidised by TBC Bank and features other products as well, 
including branded stationery, clothing, accessories and gift items. 
We continuously add new collections to our brand shop that are 
designed exclusively for TBC Bank. 
We offer our employees various promotions and discounts through 
our internal network, including free tickets to exhibitions, the 
cinema, opera and ballet, and rugby games. We also host book fairs, 
where our employees can buy books with special discounts. In 
addition, we provide back-to-school packages to the youngest 
members of our “TBC family”.
Regular communication with employees is an integral part of our 
corporate culture. We strive to provide our employees with the latest 
information and developments about the Group. Since 2012, we have 
conducted an annually employee satisfaction and engagement survey to 
get feedback from our staff and take actions accordingly. These surveys 
are conducted in partnership with leading international universities and 
research firms. Our most recent survey, conducted in December 2017, 
generated an employee engagement index as high as 91%
1
 and 
employee net promoter score of 55.
1 91% of all employees feel involved and committed to TBC Bank 78 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Ethics and conduct
We aspire to conduct business in a way that promotes high ethical 
standards, values and respects human rights, and encourages our 
employees to act with integrity and responsibility towards each other 
and our customers, partners and community.
For this purpose, we have implemented a set of internal policies and 
procedures and closely monitor their execution: 
  Code of Ethics
  Code of Conduct
  Anti-Bribery, Anti-Corruption and Prevention of the Facilitation of 
Tax Evasion Policy (which was approved in January 2018 to 
replace the former Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy)
  Whistleblowing Policy
These policies can be found on our IR website at www.tbcbankgroup.
com.
The Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct regulate employee rights 
and responsibilities, and set appropriate relationship norms and 
principles. TBC Bank’s employees are expected to act honestly and 
fairly at all times and to comply with both the spirit and intent of all 
laws. All employees are responsible for ensuring that the working 
environment is free of any form of harassment, discrimination 
(including gender, age, physical disability or religious affiliations) or 
inappropriate behaviour. In dealing with customers, the TBC Bank is 
dedicated to offering top-quality products and services, as well as to 
providing straightforward information. In regard to suppliers, the 
Group engages only in arm-length transactions. 
Compliance with the Group’s Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct is 
closely monitored by the HR Department, Compliance Department 
and Information Security Department on regular basis. Periodic 
audits are also conducted by the Internal Audit Department in order 
to identify any breach or misconduct in relation to compliance with 
these policies. No material breaches of the Group’s Code of Ethics 
and Code of Conduct were identified during 2017.
Our Anti-Bribery, Anti-Corruption and Prevention of the Facilitation 
of Tax Evasion Policy complies with all relevant local and 
international laws and regulations, and applies to all employees of 
the Group. The policy provides comprehensive guidance on the types 
of behaviour that may give rise to violations of anti-bribery and 
anti-corruption laws and/or Criminal Finance Bill requirements, and 
reinforces a culture of honesty and openness among employees.
To ensure employee protection and improve working conditions, we 
have a whistleblowing policy in place that is available to all 
employees and aims to identify and respond to potential violations 
that may jeopardise employee work effectiveness. The policy 
encourages all employees to report on any suspected violations in 
an open manner without fear of retaliation. In addition, TBC Bank 
provides channels for anonymous whistleblowing for anyone who 
believes that a violation of internal standards or legal requirements 
has taken place but is uncomfortable using the normal reporting 
lines. Our guidelines seek to ensure that complaints are recorded 
and that employees are safe from any potential retaliation.
The Compliance Department regularly conducts employee training 
sessions in order to raise awareness and highlight the importance of 
anti-corruption and anti-bribery issues. Periodic audits are also 
conducted by the Internal Audit Department to identify any violations 
or inappropriate behaviour. No such material instances were 
identified during 2017. In terms of whistleblowing, 45 whistleblowing 
reports were received according the Group’s internal policy, which 
were escalated and resolved, as appropriate.
Priorities for 2018
To maintain and enhance our position as one of the most desired 
employers in the country, we continuously work in partnership with 
the leading HR consulting companies to further improve our human 
resources systems and remain abreast of new market trends. 
Our 2018 initiatives include:
  introducing a job classification system, which means assessing 
and grading head office staff positions. The job classification 
system will make it easier to compare different positions 
throughout the Bank and will facilitate transparent and 
consistent people management and career development 
processes; and
  implementing a self-service platform through our internal 
network and mobile application, which will allow each employee 
to control their job-related information, such as updating 
personal information, applying for annual leave or registering for 
health insurance. Employee self-service systems will help us to 
save time, make processes easier and more efficient, and give 
our employees more autonomy to manage their employment-
related issues.

Strategy & Performance
OUR COMMUNITY
We take care of our community and support those areas that are 
pivotal for our country and its future: the young generation, sports 
and culture. These are the directions that we believe require the 
most attention to develop and foster success.
Young generation
As the leading Georgian bank, we are convinced that it is our social 
responsibility to set examples and encourage the young generation 
to succeed. In 2017, we continued to sponsor numerous campaigns 
encouraging young people to undertake challenging endeavours.
For the second year in a row, we hosted the Da Vinci scientific 
festival, which aims to popularise STEM fields among young people. 
The winning team received a one-year scholarship from TBC Status. 
We also supported last years’ winners to participate in the Intel 
International Science and Engineering Fair. Our talented participants 
took third place out of 800 teams. Besides the local festival, TBC 
Bank sponsored the participation of Georgian teams in the 
international scientific Olympiads, such as First Global, Intel 
International Science and Engineering Fair, etc. 
To encourage innovative business ideas and entrepreneurship, TBC 
Bank’s Startuperi programme, in partnership with Estonian firm 
Garage 48, organised a three-day training course for Georgian 
students in small towns. Students received training from leading 
marketers, software developers, project managers and, on the last 
day, had to work on an idea and create a prototype of their product. 
The winning teams participated in a hackathon organised in Tbilisi. 
More than 100 people with a start-up mindset took part in the 
hackathon, creating business prototypes for gamification  
and entertainment. 
After renovating Tbilisi’s renowned Mziuri Park and opening the 
non-profit Mziuri Cafe last year, we continued to support the cafe. 
We also initiated Sunday meetings for primary schoolchildren, 
where invited experts would discuss a variety of intriguing topics 
and develop children’s curiosity and fantasy. 
Statusdonates.ge 
In the beginning of 2017, TBC Bank’s private banking brand, TBC 
Status, launched statusdonates.ge, an innovative donation platform 
featuring different stories of people in need, organisations or 
specific projects. Short movies are made on each story and uploaded 
to the platform, where people can view and choose which project 
they want to support. The platform is innovative, since it mainly 
focuses on supporting success and it gives donors an opportunity to 
select a particular case that they want to support. Different stories 
are submitted to appear on the platform, but a specially designated 
committee reviews cases and selects the most appropriate ones. 
Since its launch, statusdonates.ge has financed 13 projects. 
Rugby
TBC Bank is a title sponsor of the Georgian Rugby Union and 
supports numerous tournaments throughout the year. We have a 
long-term partnership with the Rugby Union and, in addition to the 
sponsorship, we use our social media channels to promote the sport 
of rugby and increase the number of national team fans. 
Georgian rugby had a remarkable year in 2017; it is the first time that the 
country hosted the World Rugby Under-20 Championship. A total of 12 
leading teams from all over the world visited Georgia in June to play in 
the Championship, which is the second most important event in rugby, 
following the Rugby World Cup. 
Our partnership with Rugby Union entered a new phase in November , 
when we branded the autumn international rugby test-series as the TBC 
Rugby Series, attracting more fans to the matches. This is another 
example of our successful cooperation with sports. 
Culture
TBC Bank remains an avid supporter of Georgian culture, including 
the visual arts, literature and ballet. During the past 25 years, we 
have organised numerous exhibitions, supported young artists and 
financed the restoration of artwork.
In 2017, we restored two masterpieces by prominent Georgian 
painter Niko Pirosmani, “Tamar King” and “Rustaveli”, providing an 
opportunity for Georgian society to view these unique paintings for 
the first time. TBC Bank also organised special educational tours for 
schoolchildren to introduce them to Pirosmani’s life and work. 
Another significant exhibition during the year was presenting the 
works of Petre Otskheli, one of the founders of Georgian 
modernism. For the 110th anniversary of Otskheli’s birth, we 
financed the conservation and restoration of 30 paintings. The 
exhibition drew special attention from a wider audience and received 
excellent reviews. 
In 2003, TBC Bank established Saba, the main literary award in 
Georgia. Since then, it remains the country’s most prestigious 
annual cultural event. Saba popularised not only known Georgian 
writers, it also helped to uncover new talent and introduce them to a 
wider audience. In 2017, Saba introduced a mobile audiobook 
application that provides free audiobooks to blind users. 80 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Another milestone project that began in 2016 is the translation 
platform supported by Microsoft, GeoLab, Leavingstone, PH 
International and TBC Bank. For the project, more than 500 million 
Georgian sentences from the database of the Georgian e-book 
application, Saba, were analysed, translated and contributed to the 
platform. Translated sentences were loaded into Microsoft’s 
machine-learning platform. As a result, the Microsoft text API will 
support the Georgian language and will accurately translate 
Georgian sentences into English. Microsoft has already started to 
integrate Georgian language translation capability into its products, 
such as the Bing search engine, Microsoft Office, Skype, etc. This is 
an important advancement for the Georgian language in the 
information age. 
Another initiative that we have curated since 2013 is Artarea, the 
first online TV Channel dedicated to art and culture. The channel 
offers its viewers various culturally themed lectures, 
recommendations, entertainment programmes and live concerts, 
which are quite popular among all generations. One of the most 
successful projects is Tbilisuri Ezo (Tbilisian Yard), which gathers an 
audience in a random yard of Old Tbilisi and organises a classical 
music concert by the National Symphony Orchestra. 
Priorities for 2018
While TBC Bank continues growing and developing as a financial 
institution, we reaffirm adherence to our chosen directions: the 
young generation, culture and sports. We are convinced that  
these are the key areas where we can have a positive impact on  
the community and dedicate our efforts to building a  
prosperous country. 
In 2018, we will increase the number of projects that we support, in 
line with our strategy; actively promote them; and ensure that they 
remain transparent, to allow more people to benefit from our 
endeavours. As the number one bank in Georgia, we will set a 
leading example and encourage other businesses to engage in 
corporate responsibility activities. 
ENVIRONMENT
As the largest banking group in the country, we fully understand the 
importance of doing business with minimal impact on the 
environment. We are strongly committed to preserving the 
environment by operating our business in a sustainable and ethical 
manner, and to take action to reduce our negative impact from both 
direct and indirect activities. 
Lending responsibly
We lend responsibly and do not finance projects that have an adverse 
environmental or social impact. For this purpose, the Bank has adopted 
an Environmental and Social Risk Management Policy to ensure 
compliance with local environmental legislation and applicable 
international guidelines. It outlines our liabilities in terms of impact on 
both the environment and communities. 
Compliance with the Bank’s Environmental and Social Risk Management 
Policy is closely monitored by the Social and Environmental Risk 
Manager . In terms of lending activities, credit officers undertake periodic 
monitoring visits to their clients to ensure that all environmental and 
social norms are adhered to. Periodic audits are also conducted by 
Internal Audit Department in order to identify any breaches. No such 
material breaches of the Bank’s Environmental and Social Risk 
Management Policy were identified during 2017.
We are also committed to promoting eco-friendly projects. This year we 
attracted around US$70 million in the form of debt finance from 
international financial institutions to foster investments in areas related 
to energy efficiency, renewable energy and pollution reduction.
Waste management and energy conservation
Since 2016, TBC Bank has implemented a waste management 
programme that has been approved by Georgia’s Ministry of 
Environment and Natural Resources Protection and has ensured that 
we closely monitor and effectively manage our non-hazardous and 
hazardous waste. 
The non-hazardous waste mainly arises from printing paper , which we 
shred and exchange with a recycling company in return for books that 
we donate to orphanages, vulnerable families and libraries in remote 
villages in Georgia’s mountainous regions. This year we introduced 
several changes to reduce the usage of paper in line with the Bank’s 
Environmental and Social Risk Management Policy. In June 2017, we 
transformed several client authorisation procedures paperless and 
saved around 1.7 million sheets of paper . We also simplified our 
banking product agreements and reduced the number of pages per 
agreement. Moreover , our customers can apply for and receive 
pre-approved fast consumer loans via remote channels, meaning that 
no additional paperwork is needed for disbursing a loan. In 2017 we 
disbursed around 23,000 such loans. 
For hazardous office waste, such as printer cartridges, we 
collaborate with a company that specialises in supplying new 
cartridges and recycling used ones.

Strategy & Performance
Since 2016, we have used only energy-efficient LED lighting in our 
premises, which has helped us to reduce the consumption of 
electricity by around 9% this year. In addition, we operate an 
energy-efficient heating and cooling system in our offices.
Greenhouse gas emissions
As one of the largest financial institutions in Georgia and a 
premium-listed company trading on the LSE, TBC Bank has a 
commitment to calculate and report upon its greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions from the usage of fuel and electricity for its direct 
operations. To this end, we commissioned the Energy Efficiency 
Centre Georgia (EECG) to prepare a report on GHG emissions from 
activities for which TBC Bank is responsible. This report allowed us 
to obtain a more complete picture of our direct impact in 2017 and 
2016, by calculating GHG emissions from TBC Bank’s business 
activities in tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO

Whilst we remain committed to reducing our GHG emissions, the 
increase in our CO

 emissions between 2016 and 2017 is, in part, 
attributable to TBC Bank’s increased scale of operations following the 
completion of TBC Bank’s acquisition of Bank Republic in 2017, and 
partially the result of a change in methodology, which incorporated 
an assessment of 100% of TBC Bank’s operations in 2017.
Calculation methodology 
The EECG report considers all emission sources required under the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013 (Scope 1 and 2) and the emission sources under 
Scope 3 that are applicable to our business. In preparing the 
emissions data, the World Resources Institute (WRI) “Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 
(revised edition)”, emissions factors from the UK government’s 
Greenhouse Gas Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2017 
and national Provider, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) emission factors for electricity (tCO
2
*/MWhe) were used. The 
required data was collected and the report developed to address the 
scope of TBC Bank’s main banking activities, which includes all 
offices and/or retail branches where TBC Bank has operational 
control, as follows:
Scope 1 (combustion of fuel and operation of facilities) includes 
emissions from combustion of natural gas, diesel and/or petrol  
in equipment at owned and controlled sites. It also includes 
combustion of, among others, petrol, diesel fuel and natural gas  
in owned transportation devices.
Scope 2 (purchased electricity for own use, i.e. lighting, office 
appliances, cooling, etc) includes emissions from used electricity at 
owned and controlled sites. To calculate the emissions, the 
conversion factor for Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia (average) 
conversion from the UK Government’s Greenhouse Gas Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2017 and national IPCC emission 
factors for electricity (tCO
2
*/MWhe) have been used.
Scope 3 includes emissions from air business travels (short haul, 
medium haul, long haul and international haul). 82 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Overview
These financial results are presented for TBC Bank Group PLC (“TBC 
Bank” or “the Group”), which was incorporated on 26 February 2016 
as the ultimate holding company for JSC TBC Bank. TBC Bank 
became the parent company of JSC TBC Bank on 10 August 2016, 
following the Group’s restructuring. As this was a common ownership 
transaction, the results have been presented as if the Group existed at 
the earliest comparative date as allowed under the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European 
Union. TBC Bank successfully listed on the London Stock Exchange’s 
premium listing segment on 10 August 2016.
In Q4 2016, TBC Bank acquired Bank Republic (BR) which has been 
consolidated into the Group’s results.
Results reported below prior to 30 September 2016 relate to the 
group previously headed by JSC TBC Bank.
TBC Bank Group PLC financial results are prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (as endorsed by the 
European Union) ("IFRS") and are adjusted for certain one-off items to 
enable better analysis of the Group’s performance. The reconciliation 
of the underlying profit and loss items with the reported profit and 
loss items and the underlying ratios are given under annex 1 section 
on pages 99-100. To further enhance the analysis, the Group 
separately discloses BR effects in 2016 and 2017. Detailed information 
is given in annex 2 section on pages 100-103.

In FY 2017, net interest income grew by 23.2% YoY to GEL 604.0 million (GEL 493.3 million without the Bank Republic estimated contribution effect).
Without the Bank Republic estimated contribution effect, the interest income increased by GEL 142.0 million, or 19.5% YoY, mainly driven by a 
higher interest income from loans to customers by GEL 114.3 million, or 17.5%. This is primarily related to the 26.2% gross loan portfolio 
increase. A rise in interest income from investment securities (comprising both investment securities available for sale and bonds carried at 
amortised cost) of GEL 13.5 million, or 25.1%, also contributed to the overall increase in loan portfolio. That in turn was driven by the significant 
rise in the respective portfolio. In addition, net interest income from due from other banks grew by GEL 7.7 million, which was also determined by 
the large increase in respective portfolio.
In FY 2017 the Bank Republic effect mainly contributed GEL 152.0 million, or 16.5% to the interest income from loans and advances to customers, 
which totalled GEL 919.8 million, and GEL 8.7 million, or 11.5%, to interest income from investment securities, which amounted to GEL 76.1 
million. As a result, the overall Bank Republic estimated contribution effect was GEL 163.3 million, or 15.8%, to the interest income.
Loan yields declined over the same period from 13.4% to 12.1%. The drop was driven by a decrease in rates on foreign currency-denominated loans, 
from 10.4% to 9.1%, as well as by decline in GEL-denominated loan rates from 19.0% to 16.9% broadly in line with the overall market trend. The 
decline of yields on investment securities, from 8.6% to 7.8%, over the same period is related to a lower average refinance rate in the country in FY 
2017 compared to FY 2016. As a result, the yields on average interest earning assets dropped from 12.2% in FY 2016 to 11.1% in FY 2017.
In the reporting period, without the Bank Republic estimated contribution effect, interest expense increased by GEL 115.3 million, or 44.0% YoY. 
The rise was mainly due to a higher interest expense on customer accounts of GEL 61.2 million, or 41.6%, and due to credit institutions of GEL 
54.9 million or 69.8%. The growth in interest expense on both customer accounts and on due to credit institutions was driven by the large 
increase in respective portfolios related to the overall business growth.
The Bank Republic estimated contribution effect added GEL 25.4 million, or 10.9%, to the interest expense on customer accounts, which 
amounted to GEL 233.9 million in FY 2017, and GEL 23.5 million or 15.0% to interest expense due to credit institutions, which amounted to GEL 
157.1 million. As a result, the overall Bank Republic contribution effect was a GEL 52.5 million, or 12.2%, to the interest expense.
The cost of deposits increased slightly by 0.1pp to 3.4% in FY 2017 and in the same period the cost of borrowing dropped to 6.5%, from 7.0% in  
FY 2016. This was mainly due to the 1.2 pp decrease in rates on GEL-denominated borrowings and the 0.2 pp decrease in rates on FC-
denominated borrowings. As a result, the cost of funding ratio remained flat at 4.5%.
Consequently, NIM was 6.5% in FY 2017, compared to underlying NIM of 7.6% in FY 2016 (or reported NIM of 7.8%)

In FY 2017, net fee and commission income totalled GEL 126.0 million, marking an increase of GEL 35.7 million, or 39.5%, compared to FY 2016. 
The rise resulted mainly from a GEL 14.7 million, or 39.0%, gain in net fee and commission income from settlement transactions; a GEL 10.0 
million, or 38.0%, increase in net card operations; a GEL 2.7 million, or 25.5%, rise in net cash transactions, and a GEL 2.4 million, or 22.2%, 
increase in net guarantees. The Bank Republic estimated contribution was GEL 6.9 million, or 5.5%, in the net fee and commission income.
Net fee and commission income from card operations expanded due to an increase in the number of active cards by 35.6% YoY, as well as a rise  
in number of POS terminals by 12.1% YoY. Net Fee and commission income from settlement transactions increased mainly due to increased 
commission income from money transfers by 40% and an increased volume of settlement transactions by 44% for one of the subsidiaries, TBC Pay. 86 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

In FY 2017 total other operating non-interest income and gross insurance profit increased by GEL 30.7 million, or by 30.6%, YoY to GEL 131.0 
million in FY 2017. This increase was mainly driven by a GEL 23.7 million or 35.0% rise in net gains less losses from trading in foreign currencies 
and foreign exchange translations mainly driven by increased trade volume and Bank Republic contribution. Another large contributor to the 
increase in other operating non-interest income and gross insurance profit is a GEL 6.5 million increase in gross insurance profit from our 
subsidiary - TBC Insurance, which was acquired in October 2016. As a result, the Group’s consolidated figures include contribution from  
TBC Insurance only in the 4Q 2016, while it has been consolidated on a full year basis in 2017.
During 2017, we have significantly increased the number of customers to around 277,000 from only 3,000, which in turn led to high increase in 
gross written premium which amounted to GEL12.2 million in 2017 on a stand-alone basis. As a result, market share increased to 13.3% from 
3.5% establishing TBC Insurance as the third-largest player on market.
1
The growth is also due to a GEL 1.7 million increase in gain from the sale of investment properties as well as GEL 5.2 gain in the “other” 
subsection of other operating income. The latter is mainly attributable to GEL 2.6 million reimbursed taxes; a GEL 2.9 million related to fair value 
adjustment of previously acquired portfolio due to a better than expected performance, and a GEL 2.1 million related to a expense-sharing 
programme by our partner payment technology companies. The rise across these items was largely offset by a GEL 8.8 million drop in net gains 
less losses from disposal of investment securities available for sale due to a one-off gain from the sale of investment security in Q2 2016.  
The Bank Republic’s estimated contribution in total other operating non-interest income was GEL 22.8 million or 17.4%, out of which GEL 14.1 
million was related to gains less losses from trading in foreign currencies and foreign exchange translations.

million, or 6.5% YoY. The growth was mainly driven by a GEL 15.3 million increase in administrative expenses and a GEL 4.4 million rise in depreciation 
and amortisation.

Annex 2
Please note: Bank Republic figures after the merger on 8 May 2017 are based on internal estimates as described below.
Bank Republic contribution assumptions:
To make the YoY analyses more comparable, the Bank has segregated the Bank Republic contribution after the merger on 8 May 2017, which is 
based on direct income and cost attribution calculation and, where not applicable, based on established allocation rules, appropriate 
management assumptions, and estimates.
The management has estimated the Bank Republic contribution effect within the Group's financial results based on the following rationale:
  Loan and deposit portfolio as well as the interest income and expense from these portfolios have been calculated for all Bank Republic’s 
existing clients with outstanding exposure for the reporting period, as well as for all new clients attracted through the former branches of 
Bank Republic.
  For the remaining items of B/S and P&L where the direct attribution is not practical, the management has used the allocation based on  
Bank Republic loan and deposit books contribution to each operating segment.

DIRECTORS’ GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Chairman’s governance overview
Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to present our corporate governance report for 2017.  
My role as Chairman is to lead the Board and ensure that it works 
effectively in the pursuit of sustainable, long-term shareholder value. 
We believe that an effective governance structure and strong oversight 
of the Company’s business by the Board is vital in providing necessary 
checks and balances, thus supporting better decision-making and 
accountability in turn. The effective delivery of long-term, sustainable 
value for shareholders requires an effective Board.
We understand that the Board requires the right balance of skills, 
country-specific knowledge, and diversity of experience and 
perspectives to achieve maximum effectiveness. As Chairman, I 
ensure that there is constructive debate in the boardroom in order to 
create and maintain an environment where the Board remains open 
to different viewpoints and ideas. Our Board is comprised of nine 
members, of which five (namely, Nikoloz Enukidze (SID), Stefano 
Marsaglia, Nicholas Haag, Eric Rajendra and Stephan Wilcke) are 
considered independent non-executive Directors. The Board views 
each of these non-executive Directors as being independent of 
management judgement and character, and free from any business 
or other relationship that could materially interfere with their 
exercise of independent judgement. In accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), all Directors are subject to 
annual re-election by shareholders at our Annual General Meeting.
As previously announced, two non-executive Directors, Stefano 
Marsaglia and Stephan Wilcke will be leaving TBC Bank and 
stepping down from the Board as and when suitable replacements 
are found during 2018. I would like to extend the Board’s thanks to 
both Stefano and Stephan for their important contributions to TBC 
Bank and wish them every success in the future. Both non-executive 
Directors will remain in post pending the appointment of 
successors, which may or may not have occurred by the time of the 
Annual General Meeting. Stefano and Stephan will, therefore, only

General Meeting.
The Board is responsible for promoting the highest standards of 
corporate governance within the Group and we are committed to 
further developing and strengthening our governance structure to 
achieve the highest level of effectiveness.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
The Group’s corporate governance framework provides 
shareholders with an explanation of how the Company has applied 
the main principles of the Code as relevant to the Company in 2017.
Compliance statement
As a premium-listed company on the LSE, the Company complies 
with the Code. At the date of this report, the Company has applied 
the principles and complied with the provisions of the Code in full.
The Code and associated guidance is published by the Financial 
Reporting Council and is available at www.frc.org.uk.
The Board 
The Board is collectively responsible for promoting the Group’s 
long-term success and the delivery of sustainable value to 
shareholders by establishing and overseeing the strategic direction of 
the Company and its business. The Board is led by the Chairman and 
provides challenge, oversight and advice to ensure the Company’s 
success. The Board is the decision-making body in relation to all 
matters that are significant to the Group. There is a formal schedule 
of matters reserved for the Board’s approval in place to ensure that 
the Board retains control over key decisions. The matters exclusively 
reserved for the Board’s approval include, among other things, 
approval of the Group’s strategy, long-term objectives, risk appetite, 
the annual operating and capital expenditure budgets, changes to the 
Group’s capital, share buy-backs, major acquisitions and/or mergers, 
annual reports and accounts. The full document is available on our 
website at www.tbcbankgroup.com.
Board Committees
The Board places significant reliance on its committees (the 
“Committees”) and delegates a broad range of responsibilities to 
them, while maintaining the effective links between Committees and 
the Board where required. The Board has four Committees: (i) the 
Audit Committee; (ii) the Remuneration Committee; (iii) the 
Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee; and (iv) the 
Risks, Ethics and Compliance Committee. The chairs of each 
Committee report matters of significance to the Board after each 
meeting. The detailed roles and responsibilities of each committee 
are set out in its terms of reference, which can be found on the 
website at www.tbcbankgroup.com. 105 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Division of responsibilities
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the senior independent non-executive Director. 
As Chairman, Mamuka Khazaradze is responsible for leading the Board to ensure that the Board as a whole performs a full and constructive role 
in the development and determination of the Group’s strategy and overall commercial objectives. He also oversees the Board’s decision-making 
processes. The Chief Executive Officer, Vakhtang Butskhrikidze, is responsible for the Company’s day-to-day management and has the principal 
responsibility of running the Group’s business. He is responsible for proposing, developing and implementing the Group’s strategy and overall 
commercial objectives, which is done in close consultation with the Chairman and the Board. In addition, the Board has appointed, in line with the 
requirements of the Code, Nikoloz Enukidze as the senior independent non-executive Director, who provides a sounding board for the Chairman. 
He serves as an intermediary for the other Directors where necessary and meets with investors to discuss the Group’s corporate governance 
matters. This separation of responsibilities between the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the senior independent non-executive Director 
ensures that no one individual has unfettered powers of decision-making. The full document detailing the division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the senior independent non-executive Director is available on our website at www.tbcbankgroup.com.
Board composition 
The Board currently comprises a Chairman, five non-executive Directors and two executive Directors. In accordance with the Code, the majority of 
the Board are independent non-executive Directors. Non-executive Directors constructively challenge and scrutinise the performance of 
management and help develop proposals on strategy.
The Board has considered the independence of the Company’s non-executive Directors against the factors described in the Code and has 
determined, as mentioned previously, that all non-executive Directors are independent, except for Mamuka Khazaradze and Badri Japaridze.
Provision A.3.1 requires that the Chairman on appointment should be independent. Mamuka Khazaradze, who is the Chairman, is, for the purposes 
of the Code, not considered to have been independent on his appointment (in 2016) as the Chairman due to his role as founder of the Group. The 
Board is unanimously of the opinion that Mr Khazaradze is an extremely valuable asset to the Company, bringing a wealth of experience in Georgia’s 
banking sector , and that it is, therefore, in the Company’s best interests that he should continue as the Chairman of the Company.
Each non-executive Director has an ongoing obligation to inform the Board of any circumstances that could impair his independence.
Details of the individual Directors and their biographies are set out on pages 114-117.
Time commitment
Each non-executive Director is required to devote such time as necessary for the effective discharge of their duties. This includes attendance at 
the Board meetings and respective Committee meetings of which they are members, as well as scheduled away days, site visits, conference calls 
and email communication. Non-executive Directors consider all relevant materials prior to each meeting and commit additional time to the 
Company when it is undergoing a period of particularly increased activity. 106 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Board and Committee meeting attendance
 In 2017, the Company held three scheduled and eleven additional meetings. In addition, the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer maintain 
frequent contact (in person or otherwise) with each other and the other Board members throughout the year outside of the formal meetings.
In addition, the affairs of the Company’s main subsidiary, JSC TBC Bank (the “Bank”), are supervised by a supervisory board (the “Supervisory 
Board”) with the same composition as the Board and equivalent committees of the Supervisory Board. There are, therefore, in practice two 
equivalent supervisory bodies within the Group represented by the Board and the Supervisory Board, which are separate but interconnected with 
committees that have common membership. However, we carefully balance the work of the Board, the Supervisory Board and their respective 
committees, dividing functions according to whether they are supervising the topics that impact on the Company or solely the Bank.
Attendance of meetings of the Board and its Committees in 2017 are set out below:

Additional Information Financial Statements Governance
Diversity policy
We recognise the importance of ensuring diversity and see 
significant benefit to our business in having a Board and 
management team that is drawn from a diverse range of 
backgrounds. This brings the required expertise, cultural diversity 
and different perspectives to the Board discussions and helps to 
improve the quality of decision-making. 
The Board is mindful that it does not currently include any female 
members and, although the Board is satisfied with the current level 
of diversity, relevant skills and expertise of its members, it intends 
to ensure that the next appointments to the Board address this 
concern and complement the Board’s diversity in terms of ethnicity, 
cultures, gender, age levels, relevant skills and work experience. 
The Board notes the number of talented women in key positions 
reporting to the CEO and other management board members and, 
going forward, the Board intends to increase diversity by identifying 
qualified female candidates for appointment to the Board and senior 
management teams. 
Induction and training 
A formal induction is arranged for newly appointed Directors based 
on the individual’s need, skills and experience. Typically, these 
included a series of meetings with the Chairman and other Directors 
and senior executives, as well as local site visits to provide 
familiarity with the business. During the year, the Company did not 
have any new appointments to the Board or its Committees.
In addition, the Chairman takes responsibility to ensure that the 
Board is updated in a timely manner about the Company’s 
performance, to enable it to make proper decisions. The Chairman 
ensures that there are information exchanges between the Board, 
the Committees and executives. If there is a need for independent 
advice, the Board can seek it directly at the Company’s expense.
Members of the Board are required to complete a self-assessment 
process at the end of the year, which is considered as part of the 
Board’s annual effectiveness evaluation.
Annual Board effectiveness evaluation 
The Board and Committees continually strive to improve their 
effectiveness and recognise that their annual evaluation process is  
an important tool in reaching that goal. Non–executive Directors’ 
individual performance evaluations were undertaken by the 
Chairman, which involved a discussion about a Director’s individual 
contribution, the time commitment that is required to continue to 
deliver the role effectively, and their training and development needs. 
The Chairman has confirmed that all non-executive Directors 
continue to perform effectively, contribute positively to the governance 
of the Group and are able to commit the time required for their role.
 
The Chairman’s performance is evaluated by the independent 
non-executive Directors led by the senior independent Director. 
Executive Directors’ individual performance evaluation is undertaken 
as part of the performance management process for all employees. 
The results are considered by the Remuneration Committee when 
determining pay awards each year.
Having assessed the overall findings of the effectiveness review,  
the Directors were satisfied that the Board, collectively, and its 
individual members operated effectively during 2017. 
Following last year’s evaluation, the Board discussed the previous 
suggestion to establish a strategy committee and unanimously 
decided that since all of the directors need to be engaged in setting 
the Group’s strategy, this topic should be a focus for the full Board. 
Therefore, instead of establishing a new committee, the Board 
decided to add new meeting dates dedicated solely to the discussion 
of the Group’s strategy. Furthermore, the Chairman defined several 
areas of focus to help maintain and improve its effectiveness in the 
following areas:
  Continuing to focus the Board’s attention on the Company’s 
strategic planning by dedicating specific meeting days on  
this topic.
  Further refining the quality of debate on strategic matters  
by increasing the length of meetings dedicated to this topic.
In addition, as required by the Code, the Company, in 2018, and going 
forward, once every three years will conduct an independent, 
externally facilitated self–assessment of the effectiveness of the 
Board, the Committees and individual Directors. 
Directors’ commitments
The Directors are required to disclose to the Board their external 
appointments or other significant commitments prior to their 
appointment. Our non-executive Directors hold external 
directorships or other external positions, but the Board believes they 
still have sufficient time to devote to their duties as a Director of the 
Company and believe that the other external directorships/positions 
held provide the Directors with valuable expertise that enhances 
their ability to act as a non-executive Director of the Company.  
No significant changes to the commitments of the Chairman or 
non-executive Directors were identified.
Re-election of Directors
As mentioned above, in accordance with the Code, all Directors are 
subject to annual re-election by shareholders at our Annual General 
Meeting. Biographical details of the Directors are included on pages 
114 to 117.
As already announced, two non-executive Directors, Stefano 
Marsaglia and Stephan Wilcke will be stepping down from the Board 
but remain in post pending the appointment of successors, which 
may or may not have occurred by the time of the Annual General 
Meeting. Stefano and Stephan will, therefore, only be re-elected if 
they remain Directors at the opening of the Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration Committee
Information on the Remuneration Committee is included in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 126 to 147.
Engagement with shareholders
Effective communication with shareholders is one of the Board’s 
highest priorities. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer, together with the deputy Chairman and/or the Chairman, 
remain in regular contact with the Company’s major shareholders. 
They hold regular investor calls and also conduct face-to-face 
meetings with investors visiting Georgia. Moreover, they participate 
in regular roadshows, as well as various investor conferences across 
numerous geographic locations to promote awareness and 
understanding of the Group’s business. In addition, they take an 
active part in government events abroad aimed at increasing 
investor confidence in the economic stability of the country and its  108 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
sustainable development. The Bank’s senior executive team and 
Directors are also involved in hosting an annual Capital Markets Day 
in London. Senior non-executive Director, Nikoloz Enukidze, together 
with the chairman of the Remuneration Committee met with large 
institutional shareholders to discuss remuneration matters in 
advance of the 2018 annual general meeting. 
The Company has a dedicated investor relations website, which 
contains information on all disclosures made to the market, 
including results presentations and annual reports. 
All announcements issued to the LSE are available on the Group’s 
website at www.tbcbankgroup.com.
The Group maintains a permanent representative in London, who 
handles matters relating to investor relations and international 
media on behalf of the management team. In addition, the Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, as well as Chairman, 
deputy Chairman and senior independent Director are available to 
discuss the concerns of shareholders at any point during the year. 
Annual General Meeting
The last Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company was held 
on 5 June 2017 at the offices of Baker McKenzie, 100 New Bridge 
Street, London. At the AGM, 74.93% of total voting rights were 
exercised by shareholders. All resolutions put to shareholders  
were passed, with votes in favour ranging from 92% to 99% of the 
votes cast. 
The 2018 AGM is scheduled for 21 May 2018 in London. The Notice of 
AGM will be circulated to all the shareholders at least 21 working 
days before the AGM and it will also be made available on our IR 
website: www.tbcbankgroup.com. The voting on the resolutions will 
be announced via the Regulatory News Service and made available 
on our website at www.tbcbankgroup.com.

Directors’ conflicts of interests
The Company, in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and the Company’s articles of association (the 
“Articles of Association”), requires Directors to declare actual or 
potential conflicts of interest that could interfere with the interests 
of the Company. The Directors are required, prior to the Board 
meetings, to declare any conflict of interest they may have in relation 
to the matters under consideration and, if so, abstain from voting 
and decision-making, in relation to the matter in question. Directors 
have a continuing duty to update any changes to these conflicts.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
The Group maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, 
which gives appropriate cover for legal action brought against its 
Directors and the company secretary. The Company has also 
granted indemnities to each of its Directors to the extent permitted 
by law. Neither the indemnity nor insurance cover provides cover in 
the event that a Director, officer or company secretary is proved to 
have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. The above referred liability 
insurance and indemnities were in force during the course of the 
financial year ended 31 December 2017 and remain in force as at the 
date of this report.
Political donations
The Group did not make any political donations or incur any political 
expenditure during 2017.
Relationship agreement 
On 31 May 2016, the Company entered into a relationship agreement 
with Mamuka Khazaradze, Badri Japaridze, Vakhtang Butskhrikidze, 
Temur Japaridze, Bob Meijer and David Khazaradze (together the 
“Presumed Concerted Party Group”) (the “Relationship 
Agreement”) to regulate the degree of control that the members of 
the Presumed Concerted Party Group and their associates may 
exercise over the Group’s management and business. The principal 
purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure that the 
Company and its subsidiaries are capable at all times of carrying on 
their business independently of members of the Presumed 
Concerted Party Group and their associates.
Under the Relationship Agreement, for as long as it remains in 
force, the members of the Presumed Concerted Party Group shall, 
and have agreed that each of their associates shall, when acting in a 
capacity (which could include as a shareholder or director) with any 
member of the Group, amongst other things:
  conduct all transactions and arrangements entered into between 
any member of the Group (on the one hand) and that member of 
the Presumed Concert Party Group and/or his associates (on the 
other) on an arm’s length basis and on normal commercial terms 
and in accordance with the related-party transaction rules set 
out in the Listing Rules;
  not take any action that would have the effect of preventing the 
Company from complying with its obligations under the Listing 
Rules; and/or
  not propose or procure the proposal of any resolution of the 
shareholders which is intended, or appears to be intended, to 
circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules. 110 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Share capital 
As of 28 March 2018, the Company’s issued ordinary share capital 
comprised 53,550,507 ordinary shares with a nominal amount of 
£0.01 each and carrying one vote per ordinary share at general 
meetings of the Company. There were no shares held in treasury. 
The Company has in issue one class of ordinary shares, all of which 
are fully paid up, and it does not have preference shares in issue. 
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares are set out in the Articles of Association. There are no voting 
restrictions on the issued ordinary shares and each ordinary share 
carries one vote. Details of the movements in share capital during 
the year are provided in Note 25 to the consolidated financial 
statements on page 209 of this Annual Report.
Profit and dividends
The profit for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 
attributable to the Company’s shareholders, after taxation, amounts 
to GEL 354,410,352. The Board intends to recommend GEL 1.64 per 
share, which will represent about 25% of the net profit, to be 
distributed to the Company’s shareholders as dividend, payable in 
British Pounds Sterling at an official exchange rate of the National 
Bank of Georgia for 24 May 2018, which is subject to shareholders’ 
approval at the 2018 AGM. If approved, the final dividend will be paid 
on 22 June 2018 to shareholders on the Register of Members at the 
close of business in the UK (ie 6pm London time) on 18 May 2018.
Shareholders may have their dividends reinvested in the Company 
by joining Company’s scrip dividend programme approved at the 
2017 Annual General Meeting. The scrip dividend programme 
enables shareholders, if they wish, to receive new fully-paid ordinary 
shares in the Company instead of a cash dividend.
Powers of Directors
The Directors may exercise all powers of the Company subject to 
applicable laws and regulations and the Articles of Association.
Special rights and transfer restrictions
None of the ordinary shares in the capital of the Company carry 
special rights with regard to the control of the Company. There are 
no specific restrictions on transfers of shares in the Company, which 
is governed by its Articles of Association and prevailing legislation, 
other than:
  certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed by 
laws or regulations such as those relating to insider dealing;
  pursuant to the Group’s Share Dealing Code, whereby the 
Directors and designated employees require approval to deal in 
the Company’s shares; 
  where a person with an interest in the Company’s shares has 
been served with a disclosure notice and has failed to provide the 
Company with information concerning interests in those shares; 
and
  pursuant to the Group’s Senior Management Compensation 
System, whereby Participants (as defined therein) may be 
granted restricted share awards, which vest subject to 
continuous employment and malus and clawback provisions over 
three years from the award date.
All employees (including Directors) that are deemed by the Company 
to be insiders have complied with the Group’s Share Dealing Code. 
There are no restrictions on exercising voting rights, save in 
situations where the Company is legally entitled to impose such a 
restriction (for example, under the Articles of Association where 
amounts remain unpaid in the shares after request, or the holder is 
otherwise in default of an obligation to the Company). The Company 
is not aware of any arrangements between shareholders that may 
result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights.
Major shareholders
As at 31 December 2017, the Company had been notified under  
Rule 5 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority (the “DTRs”) of the following interests  
in its total voting rights of 3% or more.

Group’s website at www.tbcbankgroup.com and the LSE website at

Powers of Directors to issue and/or buy-back 
Company shares
The Companies Act 2006 and the Articles of Association determine 
the powers of Directors, in relation to share issues and buy-backs  
of shares in the Company. The Directors are authorised to issue and 
allot shares subject to approval at a general meeting of 
shareholders. Such authorities were granted to the Directors by 
shareholders at the general meeting of the Company, held on 5 June 
2017, authorising the Directors to allot ordinary shares in the capital 
of the Company up to an aggregate nominal value of £163,702.40. 
The Company did not repurchase any of its ordinary shares  
during 2017.
This authority will apply until the conclusion of the 2018 AGM. 
Shareholders will be requested to renew these authorities at the 
2018 AGM.

Appointment/replacement of Directors and amendment of 
Articles of Association 
The appointment and retirement of Directors is governed by the 
Company’s Articles of Association, the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the Companies Act 2016 and related legislation. 
Shareholders are authorised to appoint/replace the Directors and 
make amendments to the Articles of Association by resolution at a 
general meeting of the Company with the latter being required to  
be passed as a special resolution. 
All of the Directors will stand for annual re-election at the Annual 
General Meeting. As already mentioned, two non-executive 
Directors, Stefano Marsaglia and Stephan Wilcke will be stepping 
down from the Board but remain in post pending the appointment of 
successors, which may or may not have occurred by the time of the 
Annual General Meeting. Stefano and Stephan will, therefore, only 
be re-elected if they remain Directors at the opening of the Annual 
General Meeting. Vakhtang Butskhrikidze and Giorgi Shagidze have 
service contracts with the Company, which came into effect on 10 
August 2016 and will continue until terminated by either party to 
such contracts, giving the other not less than seven months written 
notice. They also have service contracts with the Bank, which both 
came into effect on 1 July 2015 and will continue until 31 December 
2018. Further details on the Directors’ service contracts are 
available in the Remuneration Report on pages 146 to 147. 
Biographical details and reasons for the reappointment for the 
Directors are given in the Notice of AGM.
Change of control
There are no significant agreements to which the Company is a party 
of that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company. In addition, there are no agreements between the 
Company and its employees and the Directors that contain 
compensation clauses for loss of office or employment that occurs 
because of a takeover bid, resulting in a case of change of control.
Employee disclosures
The Company’s disclosures relating to the employee engagement 
and policies, as well as human rights, are included in the “Employee 
Matters” section on pages 75 to 78 of this Annual Report.
Disclosure information to the auditor
The Directors, who held office at the date of approval of this Annual 
Report, confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware, and 
that each Director has taken all steps that he/she reasonably should 
have taken as a Director in order to make him/herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
statutory auditors are aware of such information. This confirmation 
is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions 
of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Going Concern statement
The Board has fully reviewed the available information pertaining to 
the principal risks, strategy, financial health, liquidity and solvency 
of the Group, and determined that the Group’s business remains a 
going concern. The Directors have not identified any material 
uncertainties that could threaten the going concern assumption and 
have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to remain operational and solvent for the 
foreseeable future (which is, for this purpose, a period of 12 months 
from the date of approval of these financial statements). Accordingly, 
the Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in line 
with the going concern basis of accounting.
Viability statement
In compliance with the Code, the Directors have assessed the 
viability of the Group over a three-year period beginning on 1 
January 2018. The Directors have determined the three-year period 
ending on 1 January 2021 to be appropriate, as it is consistent with 
the Group’s planning cycle, covering, financial forecasts and 
strategic considerations of the Group. In considering the longer-
term viability of the Group and its operations, the Directors have 
carried out a robust and thorough assessment of the Groups risk 
profile including all material existing and emerging risks that could 
cause the deviation of the group’s financial condition, operations  
and prospects from the expectations over the period of assessment.  
In addition, the Directors analysed the Groups ability to meet all 
regulatory requirements.
The Directors’ assessment considered: 
  All principal risks and uncertainties of the Group and 
effectiveness of current and proposed mitigating actions.
The key areas of focus were: 
(i) foreign exchange rate risk which is significant due to the high 
dollarisation of the Group’s portfolio;
(ii) the risk of economic and political instability and its impact on the 
Groups future performance;
(iii) the risk of economic and political instability and its impact on the 
Groups future performance;
(iv) the risk of not meeting minimum regulatory and liquidity 
requirements. This particular topic was extensively analysed 
during the year due the recent regulatory changes introduced by 
the National Bank of Georgia. (Please refer to more details on 
page 125; and
(v) interest rate risk, in order to ensure that the Group will meet its 
profitability expectations.
A summary of all material risks the Group is exposed to and the 
mitigating actions taken by the Group are set out on pages 56 to 59. 112 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
  The Group’s strategic plans
While reviewing and analysing the Group’s strategic plans, the 
Directors assessed all potential risks related to the strategic plans 
the achievement of the Group’s strategic objective and ensured that 
those risks were properly managed. The key focus areas were:
(i) the current business position and future prospects of the Group
(ii) capital, funding and liquidity profile of the Group 
(iii) the use of stress tests to ensure that the Bank holds adequate 
economic capital to withstand the predefined stress scenarios. 
The stress scenarios incorporate external and internal 
macroeconomic shocks, specific idiosyncratic risks such as 
increased competition in the market and regulatory changes. 
(iv) availability and efficient use of respective human and  
technical resources.
  Effectiveness of the Group’s risk management framework, 
practice and internal control mechanisms. 
The Directors ensure that the Group’s governance structure enables 
adequate oversight and accountability, as well as a clear segregation 
of duties. The involvement of all governance levels in risk 
management, clear segregation of authorities and effective 
communications between different entities facilitates clarity 
regarding the Group’s strategic and risk objectives, adherence to the 
established risk appetite, risk budget and sound risk management. 
The centralised ERM function ensures effective development, 
communication and implementation of risk strategy and risk 
appetite across the Group.
The Directors have determined that the Group’s risk management 
framework is adequate for managing the principal risks and 
uncertainties set out in the Annual Report and reducing their 
likelihood and impact wherever possible.
The review and analysis of the information presented in this Annual 
Report has enabled the Directors to confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation of the Group’s viability over the next three 
years up to 1 January 2021 and that the Group will be able to 
continue its operations and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the three-year period from 1 January 2018 to 1 January 2021.

and diversity needed on the Board to ensure that the Group has the 
best calibre of individuals and a clear plan for both executive and 
non-executive succession. As at the date of this Report the 
Committee is engaged in selecting an external search firm to 
identify suitable candidates to join the Board as additional 
Independent non-executive Directors.
Eric J. Rajendra
Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee
28 March 2018
Members of the Committee
There have been no changes in the composition of the Committee 
and as at 28 March 2018, the Committee is composed of three 
independent non-executive Directors, namely Eric Rajendra 
(Chairman), Nikoloz Enukidze and Stephan Wilcke, and Badri 
Japaridze, who is not considered to be independent for the purposes 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code. As such, the Board believes 
that the composition of the Committee complies with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and that the majority of the Committee 
members are free from any relationship or circumstances which 
may, could, would be likely to, or appear to, affect their judgement.
Attendance at Committee Meetings
Only members of the Committee have the right to attend its 
meetings, but the Committee may invite others, including the Chief 
Executive Officer, the head of human resources and external 
advisors, to attend all or part of any meeting if it thinks it is 
appropriate or necessary. The Committee members meet on a 
quarterly basis and schedule additional meetings when appropriate. 
The attendance of members at the Committee meetings during the 
year is set out on page 106.
Committee role and responsibilities 
The Committee’s role and responsibilities are set out in its terms of 
reference, available on the Group’s website: www.tbcbankgroup.com.
The Committee is responsible for the establishment and oversight of 
the Group’s compliance with the corporate governance guidelines 
and for making recommendations to the Board in respect of changes 
or additional actions as the Committee deems necessary. The 
Committee is responsible for leading the process for appointments 
to the Board and the Bank’s Management Board. The Committee is 
also responsible for identifying and nominating candidates with the 
appropriate skills and experience, for approval by the Board.
The main responsibilities of the Committee, in relation to 
the development and functioning of corporate governance 
within the Group, are:
  advising the Board periodically with respect to significant 
developments in the law and practice of corporate governance;
  reviewing the independence standards for Board members;
  monitoring and evaluating the process for assessing the 
performance and effectiveness of the Board and its committees 
(including a self-assessment of this Committee); and 
  reviewing the structures and procedures of the Board and its 
relationship with management to ensure that it can function 
independently.
The main responsibilities of the Committee, in relation to 
nomination, are:
  evaluating the current balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the Board and within the senior 
management team and, in light of this evaluation, preparing a 
description of the role and capabilities required for particular 
appointments;
  ensuring that non-executive Directors are appointed for specified 
terms, subject to re-election and to statutory provisions relating 
to the removal of a Director;
  considering and making recommendations to the Board on the 
composition of the senior management team; 122 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
  overseeing the orientation programme for new members of the 
Board with respect to their Board responsibilities and roles, as 
well as the contribution that individual members are expected to 
make; and
  making recommendations to the Board on succession planning 
for the Board and the senior management team, over the longer 
term, in order to maintain an appropriate and diverse balance of 
skills and experience, and to ensure progressive refreshing.
Appointment and re-election of Directors
The Committee considers a skills matrix for the Board, and the 
Board’s committees, and identifies the skills, core competencies, 
diversity and experience that the Group needs in order to be able to 
deliver its strategic aims, to govern the Group appropriately and 
align with the Group’s corporate culture and values. 
In order to assess the overall effectiveness of the Committee in 
accordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Chairman of the Committee carried out an internal 
evaluation and Committee is of the view that each Director 
demonstrated the level of commitment required in connection with 
their role on the Committee. 
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all the 
Directors will stand for re-election at the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting. As already announced, two non-executive Directors, 
Stefano Marsaglia and Stephan Wilcke will be stepping down from 
the Board but remain in post pending the appointment of 
successors, which may or may not have occurred by the time of the 
Annual General Meeting. Stefano and Stephan will, therefore, only 
be re-elected if they remain Directors at the opening of the Annual 
General Meeting.
In addition, as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code, in 
2018, (and going forward, once every three years) the Board and its 
Committees will conduct an independent, externally facilitated self 
–assessment.
Diversity
The Committee recognises the importance of ensuring that there is 
diversity on the Board, while continuing to recommend all appointments 
based on merit in the context of the skills and experience required. The 
Committee is very mindful that the Board does not currently include any 
female members and has resolved to ensure that the next appointments 
to the Board address this concern and complement the Board’s diversity 
in terms of ethnicity , cultures, gender , age levels, relevant skills and work 
experience. The Committee notes the number of talented women in key 
positions reporting to the CEO and other Management Board members 
and, going forward, the Committee intends to increase diversity by 
identifying qualified female candidates for appointment to the Board and 
senior management teams.
Board Recruitment and Appointment Process 
The Board has formal, thorough and transparent procedures in 
place for Board recruitment and appointment. In identifying suitable 
candidates, the Committee typically seeks recommendations from 
trusted advisers, but may also use external search consultancies to 
facilitate the recruitment. As at the date of this Report the 
Committee is engaged in the selection of an external search firm to 
assist in the requirement of additional non–executive Directors to 
the Board.
The Committee carefully assesses each candidate for membership 
of the Board against our criteria for Board appointments and 
ensures that appointees have enough time available to devote to the 
position. The Committee then decides whether to recommend an 
appointment to the Board and the Board decides whether to make 
the appointment.
The Committee’s work 
In 2017, the Committee remained focused on succession planning, 
diversity matters, assessment of effectiveness of the Board and its 
committees.
Succession 
The Committee recognises that good succession planning 
contributes to the delivery of the Group’s strategy, by ensuring there 
is the desired mix of skills and experience in current and future 
Board members. During the course of 2017, the Committee 
chairman personally met with key members of the Management 
Board and middle management to ensure that the Group creates 
opportunities for current and future leaders. The Committee has 
identified strong and weak areas for each candidate and developed a 
plan for further professional development. The recommended 
succession planning framework ensures that the Company builds an 
appropriate internal leadership pipeline and includes initiatives that 
cover additional qualification courses, training opportunities and 
recommendations on developing relevant skills as needed.
Corporate governance, independence and diversity 
The Committee oversaw the continued developments of the Group’s 
corporate governance framework and reviews of its compliance with 
the Code requirements; the independence of non-executive Directors, 
together with non-executive Directors re-election and suitability to 
continue in office. The review of Directors’ independence was also 
satisfactory, as throughout 2017 all independent non-executive 
Directors remained independent as to both character and judgement. 
Although Board appointment recommendations are always based on 
merit, the Committee and the Board recognise the importance of 
diversity and are committed to increasing the diversity of the Board 
including by adding one or more female members to the Board.
Assessment of effectiveness 
The Committee effectiveness review is conducted every year in order 
to assess the Committee’s performance. This assessment is carried 
out by the Committee as part of the annual evaluation process. The 
2017 Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee evaluation 
has found that the Committee effectively fulfilled all of its 
responsibilities and obligations.
Looking forward to 2018
In the coming year, the Committee will continue its focus on 
increasing gender diversity by seeking to identify talented female 
candidates for appointment to the Board and to the Group’s senior 
management team. In addition, the Committee will further elevate 
the performance standards expected of each member of the Board 
and oversee an external evaluation of the Board’s performance. 
Lastly, the Committee will continue its effort to strengthen the 
development of the skillset of the Group’s senior management team 
via specialised local and international training programmes.

Chairman’s Letter
Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to present Risks, Ethics and Compliance Committee 
(the “RECC”) report for the Group.
Throughout 2017, the RECC continued to take a proactive approach 
to risk management by closely monitoring and discussing the 
internal and external challenges facing the Group. Along with 
regular updates regarding the macroeconomic environment, the 
Group’s risk profile, risk management practices and results, the 
committee focused on several other issues, namely: 
  the recent regulatory changes concerning the new liquidity 
coverage ratio, risk weighting rules and capital management 
framework, the details of which are given below under 
“Regulatory updates”;
  the successful project to implement IFRS 9, including updating 
the Group’s provisioning methodology; and
  the post-merger integration of Bank Republic into the Group, 
which was successfully finalised in May 2017.
In January 2017, TBC Bank appointed a new CRO, David Chkonia, to 
further strengthen the risk function. He has 15 years of experience 
in risk management. In previous positions held before joining the 
Group, Mr Chkonia consulted companies regarding risks, especially 
those associated with credit and capital market transactions. The 
RECC worked closely with the new CRO and oversaw the transition 
process to ensure that he was equipped with all the necessary 
information to perform his  
duties effectively.
The report below summarises the RECC’s activities for the year.
Nikoloz Enukidze
Chairman of the Risk, Ethics and Compliance Committee
28 March 2018
RISK, ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
Committee responsibilities
The RECC’s primary function is to assist the Board in its oversight  
of all matters related to the risk management and compliance of  
the Company and the Group as a whole. 
The RECC is responsible for recommending the Group’s risk appetite 
limits to the Board and monitoring the risk profile to make sure that 
it complies with the established limits. It is also responsible for 
reviewing, assessing and recommending any actions for the Board  
to take regarding the Group’s overall risk management strategy, as 
well as the risk management system and associated policies. 
In addition, the committee reviews and approves credit facilities  
to large borrowers (if the borrower represents one of the top 20  
groups of borrowers of the Bank or exceeds 5% of the Bank’s 
supervisory capital). 
The RECC is also responsible for overseeing the Group’s compliance 
activities to ensure that it complies with all applicable laws and 
regulations and maintains the highest standards of ethical 
behaviour. The committee supports fostering an ethical culture 
within the Group based on the principles of honesty, integrity, 
fairness and transparency.
The RECC’s terms of reference are available on the Group’s website: 
www.tbcbankgroup.com.
Committee members and meetings
The RECC consists of five independent non-executive Directors: 
Nikoloz Enukidze (Chairman), Stefano Marsaglia, Nicholas Haag, 
Eric Rajendra and Stephan Wilcke. Their biographies can be found 
on pages 114 to 117.
The committee meets in person on a quarterly basis. At each 
meeting its members review a thorough report on risk management 
results for the quarter, as well as updates on compliance and other 
areas within its remit. The Chief Executive Officer, CRO, head of 
compliance and key members of the Group’s risk and compliance 
teams normally attend the meetings. Additional meetings, as 
needed, are held electronically.
The attendance of members at the RECC’s meetings during the year, 
at the Company and the Bank levels, are set out in the Directors’ 
Governance statement on page 106.
RECC activities during 2017
In 2017, one of the Group’s primary focus areas was to ensure a 
smooth post-merger integration with Bank Republic. The RECC 
played an important role in monitoring the project of aligning all 
processes, which was successfully completed in the first half of the 
year. Additionally, the NBG introduced various regulatory changes 
during the reporting period. The committee closely monitored these 
changes, including through reviews of periodical regulatory updates 
and frequent discussions regarding these changes, assessing 
potential implications for the Group’s capital and liquidity 
management processes, and outlining ways to manage these 
processes more effectively. 124 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The RECC was actively involved in the IFRS 9 implementation project 
by, amongst other things, systematically reviewing its progress and 
the key changes in the provisioning methodology, as well as 
analysing the expected impact on the Group’s level of allowances.
Apart from the above activities, the committee maintained its focus 
on its key responsibilities of monitoring the Group’s risk 
management processes, promoting progress in risk management 
tools and techniques, and implementing mitigation actions against 
prevailing risks.
Risk appetite
The RECC received and reviewed the risk appetite compliance 
reports at each of its quarterly meetings, during which the 
committee members discussed the Group’s risk profile and 
respective outlook with the management.
In the beginning of 2017, the RECC discussed updates in risk 
appetite limits that the CRO proposed, as well as assumptions and 
drivers for change. The committee suggested certain revisions to the 
currently proposed limits, which they subsequently considered and 
approved. 
Macroeconomic environment in Georgia
The RECC received a comprehensive report on Georgia’s 
macroeconomic environment and discussed the medium-term 
economic outlook. Considering that a significant part of the Group’s 
loan book is denominated in foreign currency, the GEL ’s volatility 
remained a key focus for discussions throughout the year. The 
committee discussed potential implications of GEL depreciation on 
the Group’s performance and respective actions that it undertakes 
to mitigate these risks. The RECC continued to closely monitor how 
government initiatives launched in the beginning of 2017, which are 
aimed at reducing the economy’s dependence on currencies other 
than GEL, affected the Group’s portfolio composition and discussed 
expectations going forward.
Credit risk
The RECC reviewed the performance of the Group’s loan book at 
each meeting during 2017. The reports covered the structure of the 
Group’s portfolio, including segmentation by currency, business 
segments and economic sectors.
The committee received a detailed update regarding the Group’s 
largest exposures during the meetings from the CRO and corporate 
business director. They presented the strategy for growing the 
corporate loan book to ensure that it is balanced with proper risk 
assessment processes. The RECC encouraged the CRO to maintain 
a balanced growth approach.
Operational risk
Throughout the year, the RECC focused on reviewing the results of 
internal loss data collection and fraud risk management. The 
committee discussed establishing and segregating duties among the 
lines of defence of the Group’s internal control system with the aim 
of further fine-tuning the operational risk management framework. 
Following a recent incident of identity fraud, a summary of which is 
set out on page 68, the RECC conducted a further review of TBC 
Bank’s internal control system and recommended the following 
actions to the Board:
  the enhancement of authorisation processes related to execution 
of large cash transactions, including those authorised under 
powers of attorney; and
  the assessment of risks and controls involved with the Bank’s 
operating procedures, with a focus on branch operations.
Financial risks
The RECC closely reviewed the Group’s financial risk positions and 
produced a report that included an assessment of TBC Bank’s risks 
associated with liquidity, foreign exchange, banking book interest 
rates and counterparties. As part of assessing compliance with the 
approved risk appetite limits, the committee monitored TBC Bank’s 
readiness to meet the NBG’s new regulatory ratio, the liquidity 
coverage ratio, which came into force in September 2017. In 
addition, the RECC received comprehensive updates on optimising 
the liquidity coverage ratio and reviewed a thorough report on the 
interbank portfolio’s performance within the counterparty risk 
management framework. The committee focused on developing a 
deep understanding of the interbank limits approval process. At the 
year-end, the Supervisory Board approved the Bank’s counterparty 
risk management policy in light of the RECC’s positive 
recommendation.
The RECC paid special attention to the reduction in margins, 
reviewing the interest rate risk positioning of the Bank’s net interest 
income and reports analysing the economic value sensitivities for 
different interest rate scenarios.
Capital management
The RECC continued to review the internal capital adequacy process 
and closely monitored compliance with regulatory ratios under 
different macroeconomic scenarios. During the committee’s 
meetings, it also examined the changes and impacts associated with 
various capital framework initiatives that the NBG introduced during 
the reporting period.
In addition to the updated framework discussed below, under the 
new capital regulations, the NBG initiated a stress-testing exercise. 
During the RECC’s meetings, it reviewed comprehensive 
presentations covering the methodology of the stress-testing and 
discussed the results extensively. The main purpose of the stress-
testing framework is to use it in the future to define Pillar II buffers.
Compliance
Throughout 2017, the RECC reviewed the Group’s compliance 
programmes on a quarterly basis. The topics of discussion included 
the following:
  the status of the compliance and anti-money laundering 
programme’s implementation;
  information on the supervision of subsidiaries;
  identified weaknesses and compliance failures, as well as 
follow-up corrective measures;
  a summary of regulatory changes; and
  a report on whistleblowing cases.
In addition, the committee closely scrutinised the Group’s related-
party list and transaction tracker for the purposes of the UK Listing 
Rules during 2017.

Strategic Report  
Overview
Strategic Report  
Strategy & Performance
Additional Information Financial Statements Governance
As part of the NBG’s ongoing operations, it conducted a thematic 
inspection of the Bank covering the last six years, a summary of 
which is set out on page 69. The RECC followed up on agreed  
actions in response to the recommendations that the NBG provided 
after its inspection.
Regulatory updates
The NBG introduced numerous initiatives during the reporting 
period. The RECC examined all key initiatives that were relevant for 
risk management by analysing their impact on the Group’s 
performance. The NBG introduced capital buffers compliant with the 
Basel III regulatory framework, which are based on the updated 
capital requirements that will be divided across Pillar I and II 
buffers. These initiatives include:
  the capital conservation buffer (which is currently incorporated in 
minimum capital requirements), which has been separated;
  over a four-year period, a systemic risk buffer, which will be 
introduced for systemically important banks;
  a countercyclical capital buffer, which has been introduced and 
initially set to 0%;
  a currency-induced credit risk (CICR) buffer, which has replaced 
the current conservative weighting for un-hedged loans 
denominated in foreign currencies;
  concertation buffer, which will be introduced for sectoral and 
single borrower exposures;
  a net stress buffer, which will be introduced based on the 
stress-testing results that the Group provided; and
  a General Risk-Assessment Programme (GRAPE) buffer, which is 
defined by the regulator and will be applied based on the Bank’s 
specific risks.
In addition, based on the updated methodology, the NBG has 
introduced specific payment-to-income (PTI) and loan-to-value (LTV) 
thresholds, applying higher risk weights to exposures that do not fall 
into the pre-defined limits for the PTI and LTV ratios.
Apart from the capital changes, the NBG has introduced a liquidity 
coverage ratio, which is used to manage liquidity risk. This is in 
addition to the Basel III guidelines, under which a conservative 
approach was applied to the weighting of mandatory reserves and to 
the deposit withdrawal rates, depending on the concentration of 
client groups.
IFRS 9 implementation
The implementation of IFRS 9 began in 2016 and was one of the 
most significant projects in 2017. The Group developed an enhanced 
provisioning methodology in line with the IFRS 9 requirements. With 
the updated methodology, the Group can assess loan loss provisions 
and allowances accurately with the incorporation of forward-looking 
information. In addition to developing the methodology, the Group 
also implemented an accompanying IT tool. The impact of IFRS 9 on 
the equity, as of the transition moment, amounts to GEL 64 million. 
Major impacts were observed in the retail segment. 
Committee effectiveness review
The Board and RECC members conduct a review of the committee’s 
effectiveness every year. The main role of the review is to assess the 
RECC’s performance as per international standards of best practice 
in corporate governance. During 2017, the RECC was found to be 
effective in overseeing the Group’s risk management, compliance 
activities and ethical standards.
Looking ahead to 2018
Going forward, the RECC will continue to focus on its key 
responsibilities of assessment of quarterly risk results and 
compliance with the Bank’s risk appetite, providing sign-off on 
transactions with the largest exposures, and facilitate progress in 
risk management tools and techniques. The RECC will continue the 
close monitoring of the impact that recent and upcoming regulatory 
changes may have on the Bank’s financial standing and respective 
implications for risk management processes. In addition, key 
attention will be paid to proper management of risks that may arise 
from further digitalisation of TBC Bank’s services. Moreover, review 
and monitoring of results produced from newly introduced IFRS 9 
models will stay as one of the key focus areas of the RECC, to 
ensure that respective results adequately capture TBC Bank’s 
expected losses. 126 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
REMUNERATION REPORT
Dear shareholders,
As Chairman of the Board Remuneration Committee (the 
“Committee”), I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for 2017, which describes the Remuneration Policy (the 
“Policy”) for our executive and non-executive directors.
The Committee continues to ensure that directors’ remuneration is 
aligned with their performance and creates strong motivation to 
achieve the Group’s strategy, meets appropriate regulatory and best 
practice requirements and takes into the account the views of 
shareholders as well as other stakeholders. 
The executive members’ remuneration is comprised of:
  Fixed compensation consisting of both cash-based and 
share-based payments; 
  Annual bonus based on the level of achievement of short-term 
key performance indicators (KPIs) and consisting of share-based 
payments only 
The non-executive members’ remuneration is in the form of monthly 
fixed cash payments and is based on best practice and specifically 
FTSE 250 financial companies board membership payments, as well 
as reflecting the unique individual roles the chairman and deputy 
chairman play within the Group.
2017 Performance
2017 year was another successful year as the Group recorded high 
underlying net profit of GEL 369.2 million, 35.1% up compared to the 
last year. High profits were supported by strong NIM, growth in 
non-interest income, operating efficiency and strong asset quality. 
As a result, all corporate financial KPIs were met in full. In addition, 
the executives achieved a number of corporate non-financial and 
personal KPIs, as explained below. Hence, executive directors 
received cash salary equal to the amounts received in 2016, as well 
as a number of deferred shares under the deferred share salary 
equal to the number of shares received in 2016 under this 
component. In terms of deferred share bonus, payouts amounted  
to 88% and 84% of the maximum opportunity in 2017 for CEO and 
CFO respectively.
New remuneration policy for 2019
Taking into consideration that our existing executive remuneration 
policy is expiring at the end of 2018, we have engaged with 
shareholders and external, independent consultants to enhance our 
remuneration structure in order to ensure that it is more closely 
aligned with all stakeholders’ expectations and at the same time 
allows us to attract and retain the best talent. The new strategy, 
subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 AGM, will come into 
force from 1 January 2019. The total expected compensation will not 
exceed 2017 levels. However, there will be improvements in the 
structure of the compensation to strengthen the alignment of pay 
with long-term performance and ensure that it better conforms with 
market practice. The key changes are:
  Rebalancing the variable remuneration component and moving 
certain part of the annual bonus to a long-term incentive plan 
(LTIP). As a result, the maximum opportunity under the new 
policy will not exceed 2017 levels;
  Introducing an LTIP in the form of a performance share plan with 
a 3 year vesting period subject to meeting performance 
conditions over this period plus setting a two year post 
performance holding and continued employment requirement;
  The amount of deferred shares under the base salary and the 
annual bonus will be calculated by reference to a cash amount 
rather than a fixed number of shares; and
  The maximum amount of salary and annual bonus will be also 
fixed by reference to a cash amount rather than number of 
shares.
We believe, the new policy meets the best and regional practices, is 
competitive and aligns executives' long-term interests with those of 
the Group and its shareholders. The full details are outlined in 
section 10. 
Looking ahead 
The Remuneration Committee will continue to review the Policy on a 
regular basis to ensure that it is in compliance with all regulatory 
changes that might arise, is in line with evolving market practises 
and continues to promote the long-term success of the Group.

1. Remuneration Committee
The Company’s Remuneration Committee is responsible for: establishing and overseeing the Group’s remuneration policy principles; considering and 
approving remuneration arrangements of the executives; and exercising oversight for remuneration. Full details of the Committee’s responsibilities are 
set out in the Committee terms of reference, which are available on our website at www.tbcbankgroup.com.
The Remuneration Committee membership is comprised of solely independent non-executive directors from a wide variety of skills and 
backgrounds to provide the best input. The members are: Stefano Marsaglia (chairman), Nikoloz Enukidze, Eric Rajendra and Nicholas Haag.
The attendance of members at the Committee meetings during the year at the Company and the Bank levels are set out in the Directors’ 
Governance Statement on page 106.
1.1 Advisers to the Remuneration Committee 
Members of the Remuneration Committee provide valuable input in updating the Remuneration Committee on the recent developments in the 
area of remuneration. However when there is a need, the Remuneration Committee receives external advisory services. In 2017, KPMG was 
selected by the Remuneration Committee to provide advice to the Remuneration Committee on the remuneration policy for the executive 
members of the board. The new Remuneration policy that is described in section 10 of the report is based on recommendations provided by 
KPMG and will be presented for the shareholders’ approval at the 2018 AGM. 
KPMG was selected as a result of a tender among the potential candidates. The amount of fees for the advice provided to the Remuneration 
Committee for the year 2017 by KPMG was US$ 29,500, net of taxes. The Fees were charged on a time and materials basis, which was capped at 
the amount mentioned above. 
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that KPMG’s advice was objective and independent and that KPMG team which provides the 
Remuneration Committee with advice does not have any connections with the Group that may impair its independence. The Remuneration 
Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and decided that KPMG had appropriate safeguards in place.

42.8% 70.3%
Total remuneration 35.4% 27.7%
Notes to table:
1. This includes cash and deferred share salary. The CEO’s cash salary increase is calculated in US dollars, the currency which is fixed for his cash salary
2. The increase in deferred share salary reflects the increase in the share price. The number of deferred shares awarded as salary has not changed between 2016 and 2017
3. For all employees’ cash salary and cash bonus calculations, the actual increase of the salaries and bonuses of the employees employed at the end of 2017, who were also 
employed at the end of 2016, was used. The total IFRS consolidated staff cost has increased by 17.9% in 2017 YoY. However, this does reflect the fact that the Bank Republic 
was only included for 2 months in the P&L statement in 2016 and in 2017 the bank was successful in extracting synergies from the acquisition. 
4. The actual number of shares awarded to CEO as part of deferred shares bonus was increased from 89,361 shares in 2016 to 93,348 shares in 2017. The increase shown in the 
table reflects the increase in the share price. 131 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Corporate Governance Code. Unvested shares are subject to continuous employment and malus and clawback requirements but are not subject 
to specific performance conditions. 133 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

9. Policy Implementation in 2018
Remuneration policy for executive directors
The existing remuneration scheme for the executive directors was developed with the support of external consultants and was implemented on 
17 June 2015 covering the period of 2015 until the end of 2018. The Group worked with EY to review the existing remuneration policy for executive 
directors. The existing remuneration policy will expire at the end of 2018.
The Group has developed a new remuneration policy, which is presented in this document and if approved by shareholders on 2018 AGM, will 
become applicable starting from 1 January 2019. 
Non-executive director compensation
As advised by the external consultants and approved by the shareholders on 2017 AGM, the compensation of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman 
will be decreased by about 20% and 30% respectively starting from 1 January 2018.
Their new fees reflect the complexity of tasks and high intensity of the work carried out by the Chairman and Deputy Chairman to support the 
growth of the business, taking into account their deep understanding of the market and their roles as the founders of the bank. The Chairman’s 
and deputy Chairman’s input add significant value and are key and instrumental for the other members of the Board of Directors and for the 
Executive Committee members, especially on all strategic matters and relationship with large corporate or individual customers as well as with 
policy makers.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to seek out shareholder feedback and undertake a benchmarking review of compensation practices 
when the current policy expires.
Introduction of the Policy for Companies Act 2006 purposes
Due to requirements associated with the Group's premium listing and to comply with Companies Act 2006 requirements, shareholders will be 
asked to specifically approve the Policy at the upcoming 2018 Annual General Meeting (with the new Policy coming into effect for Companies Act 
2006 purposes from 1 January 2019).
Statement of implementation
In 2018, the Remuneration Committee intends to continue to provide remuneration in accordance with the policy tables set forth below as 
approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM. Fees and salaries may be adjusted but in all cases will not exceed the maximums stated in the 
appropriate policy table as approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM. New targets will be set for the deferred share bonuses. The appropriate 
level of awards to be granted in 2018 is assessed by the Remuneration Committee but in all cases will remain within the maximums stated in the 
appropriate policy table as approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM. 136 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
From January 2018 the following will apply:
Executive directors
Base salary (cash and deferred shares) The cash and deferred share salaries are set out in the executive directors' service contracts. The

2017 AGM. The Remuneration Committee's discretion will be exercised fairly and reasonably and with 
regard to appropriate comparable market practice and business strategy.

10. Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This section describes the proposed new remuneration policy for executive directors, which is expected to come into force starting from 1 January 
2019 and is intended apply for 3 years until the end of 2021, subject to shareholders approval at the AGM meeting to be held on 21st May 2018.
The new policy aims to enhance our existing remuneration structure and ensure that it is more closely aligned with all stakeholders expectations, 
as well as to offer competitive compensation to the executive directors. Total expected compensation will not exceed 2017 levels. 
The following table compares the executives’ maximum and actual compensation paid in 2017 to their maximum and expected compensation 
under the new remuneration policy in 2019 respectively.

Notes:
1.  As described in section 2.1
2. The 2017 maximum opportunity has been valued using the closing market value of the shares on 9 March 2018 (GBP18.4 converted into US$ using the cross rate of the official 
exchange rates published by the NBG of 2.4462 for GEL/US$ and 3.397 for GEL/GBP on the same date) and grossed up for directors’ income tax on share awards paid by the 
Company.
The key changes are:
  Introducing a long-term incentive plan (LTIP) in the form of a performance share plan with a 3 year vesting period subject to meeting 
performance conditions over this period. Awards are initially intended to be in the form of conditional share awards, which are conditional 
rights to receive shares in the Company, but the plan also permits the grant of options and restricted share awards. The performance will be 
measured over three years and shares will be delivered during the first quarter of the fourth year from the start of the performance period, 
subject to the achievement of appropriate performance measures. However after delivery, the shares will be subject to an additional two year 
holding period during which time they will be subject to continued employment. The maximum amounts of the LTIP are as follows: CEO-US$ 
1,554,240, CFO- US$ 777,120 
  The amount of deferred shares under the base salary and the annual bonus will be calculated by reference to a cash amount rather than a 
fixed number of shares. The shares granted will be subject to continued employment for a 2 year period as follows: 50% of the award for 1 
year from the award date and the other 50% for 2 years from the award date. 
  The maximum amount of deferred share salary and the annual bonus will be also fixed by reference to a cash amount rather than number of 
shares. The maximum amounts of the deferred share salary are as follows: CEO- US$ 510,000, CFO- US$ 255,000. The maximum amount of 
annual bonuses are determined as follows: CEO- US$ 1,301,760, CFO- US$ 650,880. The shares granted will be subject to continued 
employment for a 2 year period as follows: 50% of the award for 1 year from the award date and the other 50% for 2 years from the award 
date.
  The maximum amounts of annual cash salaries to be paid to CEO and CFO are determined to be US$ 453,994 and US$ 227,004 respectively. 
It is the Remuneration Committee’s intention that the Policy remains unchanged for three years until the end of 2021.
For the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that the new remuneration scheme to be approved at the 2018 AGM allows the existing remuneration 
scheme for the executive directors to continue until 1 January 2019 with the new remuneration scheme to take effect from 1 January 2019. 138 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Pre-existing obligations
It is a provision of this Policy that the Group will uphold all pre-existing obligations and commitments that were agreed prior to this Policy taking 
effect. The terms of those pre-existing obligations and commitments may differ from the terms of the Policy and may include (without limitation) 
obligations and commitments under service contracts, deferred share compensation schemes and pension and benefit plans. 
We believe, the new policy meets the best and regional practices, is competitive and aligns executives' long-term interests with those of the 
Group and its shareholders. The full details are outlined below.
10.1 Remuneration policy for Chief Executive Director and Chief Financial Director:
Component Purpose and Link to Strategy of the Group Operation Maximum Opportunity Performance Measures
Fixed Pay
Base Salary 
– in the form 
of cash and 
deferred 
shares
Salaries are determined based 
on market practice and provide 
each executive director with a 
competitive fixed income to 
efficiently retain and reward the 
director , based upon each 
director's roles and 
responsibilities within the 
Group and relative skills and 
experience.
Cash salary
The cash part of the salary is 
aimed to provide fixed cash 
remuneration to reflect the 
complexity of the Group. 
Deferred share salary
Part of the salary is given in the 
form of shares and despite 
being salary is still intended to 
promote the long-term success 
of the Group by closely aligning 
executive directors' and 
shareholders' interests.
Shares are usually delivered 
during the first quarter of the 
second year (i.e. the year after 
the work is performed) and the 
exact date is determined by the 
remuneration committee. 
Once shares are delivered, they 
remain subject to continued 
employment; 50% of the shares 
for 1 year and the other 50% for 
2 years from the delivery date. 
Upon the delivery, whilst the 
shares remain subject to the 
continued employment 
condition, the shares are 
registered in the trustees name 
as nominee for the participants 
and the participants are entitled 
to receive dividends. 
Both the cash and deferred share 
salaries are paid in part under the 
executive director’s service contract with 
TBC JSC and in part under his service 
contract with TBC PLC, to reflect the 
executive director’s duties to each. 
Initial salaries are set by the 
Remuneration Committee based on 
responsibilities and market data and are 
set out in an executive director's service 
contract with the Group. 
An executive director may be paid 
separate salaries for roles and 
responsibilities at different entities within 
the TBC Group as set out in a separate 
service contract with any relevant entity.
Deferred compensation is subject to the 
Group’s malus and clawback policies 
until the shares are vested and during the 
holding period. If at any time after 
making the deferred compensation there 
is a material misstatement in the 
financial results for the year in respect of 
which the compensation was formally 
granted, the Remuneration Committee 
has the right to cause some or all of the 
deferred compensation for that year or 
any subsequent financial year that is 
unvested (or unpaid) to lapse (or not be 
paid).
Cash salary
The maximum annual cash salary 
for Chief Executive Director is 
US$  453,994.
The maximum annual cash salary 
for Chief Financial Director is  
US$  227,004.
Deferred Share Salary 
The maximum annual value for the 
deferred share salary for the Chief 
Executive Director is US$ 510,000. 
The number of shares is calculated 
based on the average share price of 
the last 10 days preceding the 
committee decision date. However , 
the maximum is fixed by reference 
to a cash amount.
The maximum annual value for the 
deferred share salary for the Chief 
Financial Director is US$ 255,000. 
The number of shares is calculated 
based on the average share price of 
the last 10 days preceding the 
committee decision date.. However , 
the maximum is fixed by reference 
to a cash amount. 
The bank pays income tax
1
 and 
other employee-related taxes 
related to base salary, however , 
taxes are included in the maximum 
amounts.
These numbers include the salaries 
received from both JSC TBC Bank 
and TBC Bank Group PLC. The 
executives do not receive any 
additional salary from other Group 
entities. 
Not performance 
based.
1 The proposed structure of paying income tax for the executives is due to the Georgian tax code, which requires a company to pay income tax on any benefit paid to the 
executives ( and does not allow for alternative arrangements). However, the numbers disclosed include such income tax estimates.

. 
Performance conditions are 
chosen to align our executive 
directors' interests with 
strategic objectives of the 
Group over multi-year periods 
and encourage a long-term 
view.
In order for the shares to be 
delivered, the executive 
directors need to meet 
performance conditions over 
the 3 year performance period. 
Share are usually delivered 
during the first quarter of the 
fourth year (i.e. the year after 
the performance period ends) 
and the exact date is 
determined by the 
remuneration committee.
Once shares are delivered,  
they remain subject to 2 year 
holding period and continued 
employment requirements.
Awards may benefit from 
dividend equivalents. No 
dividend equivalents will be 
paid on any awards (or part 
thereof) that lapse on or  
before vesting.
The awards may be granted in the form  
of conditional share awards, options or 
restricted share awards.
Performance Conditions are set by the 
Remuneration Committee for a period  
of 3 years. (see more detail below at 
10.3(c)). The Remuneration Committee 
determines the level of award at the end 
of the performance period, based on the 
extent to which the performance 
conditions have been met.
The performance conditions and 
respective targets will be disclosed in  
the annual report published in the year  
of the award.
The Remuneration Committee may also 
adjust performance conditions during  
the performance period to take account 
of material events, such as (without 
limitation): material corporate events, 
changes in responsibilities of an 
individual and/or currency exchange 
rates. 
Awards are subject to the Group’s malus 
and clawback policies until three years 
after the shares are delivered. If at any 
time after making the award the award 
holder deliberately mislead the Company 
or the Bank in relation to the financial 
performance, there is a material 
misstatement (or material error) in the 
financial statements of the Company or 
the Bank, the award holder’s unit has 
suffered a material downturn in its 
financial performance caused by the 
award holder , there is misconduct on the 
part of the award holder that caused 
material harm to the Company’s or the 
Bank’s reputation or there is misconduct 
on the part of the award holder that 
caused failure of the risk management 
resulting in a material loss to the 
Company or the Bank, the Remuneration 
Committee has the right to cause some 
or all of the award for that year or any 
subsequent financial year that is 
unvested (or unpaid) to lapse (or not be 
paid) and to clawback any amount that 
has already been paid.
The maximum value of the award 
for the Chief Executive Director in 
any given year , under the long-
term incentive arrangements, to 
be awarded is US$ 1,554,240 
(161% of fixed salary). The number 
of shares is calculated based on 
the average share price during the 
10 days after the preliminary 
annual results of the year 
preceding the year of each grant is 
announced.
The maximum value of the award 
for the Chief Financial Officer in 
any given year , under the long-
term incentive arrangements, to 
be awarded is US$ 777,120 (161% 
of fixed salary). The number of 
shares is calculated based on the 
average share price during the 10 
days after the preliminary annual 
results of the year preceding the 
year of each grant is announced.
The bank pays income tax
2
 and 
other employee-related taxes 
related to the award, however , 
taxes are included in the maximum 
amounts.
The performance 
conditions for the 
award are set by 
the Committee 
each year . The 
Remuneration 
Committee’s 
current view is 
that performance 
conditions will 
include:
• a measure of 
efficiency (e.g. 
ROE)
• a measure of 
share price 
performance 
(e.g. EPS/TSR)
• a measure of 
customer 
experience
Weightings of 
these measures 
may vary 
year-on-year .
The performance 
period is

For newly issued and treasury shares, the 
LTIP is limited to using 10% in 10 years 
for employee plans and 5% in 10 years for 
discretionary plans.
These limits will exclude shares under 
awards that have been renounced, 
forfeited, released, lapsed or cancelled or 
awards that were granted prior to the 
Company’s IPO or awards that the 
Remuneration Committee decide will be 
satisfied by existing shares.
The plan will be administered by the 
Remuneration Committee.
Pension To assist our employees in 
providing for their retirement 
and to maintain a market 
competitive benefits package  
to attract and retain executive 
directors.
The Group may introduce a defined 
contribution pension scheme taking into 
account any pension reform or practice in 
Georgia. The operation of the pension 
would be considered by the 
Remuneration Committee fairly and 
reasonably and with regard to best 
market practice.
If introduced, there will be no provision 
for the clawback or withholding of 
pension payments.
The maximum employer 
contribution will not exceed  
3% of annual salary. 
Not performance 
based.
Benefits Benefits are in line with 
Georgian market practice and 
are designed to be sufficient  
to attract and retain high 
calibre talent.
Benefits available to executive directors 
consist of insurance (such as medical, life  
and disability insurance), physical 
examinations, tax gross ups
3
, directors'  
and officers' liability insurance, a car 
service, personal security arrangements 
and assistance with filling out tax returns,  
where required. 
Executive directors are reimbursed for 
reasonable business expenses incurred 
in the course of carrying out duties under  
their service contracts, on provision of  
valid receipts.
A tax equalisation payment may be paid 
to an executive director if any part of his 
remuneration becomes subject to double 
taxation. 
The policy is framed by the nature 
of the benefits that the 
Remuneration Committee is willing 
to provide to executive directors. 
The maximum amount payable 
depends on the cost of providing 
such benefits to an employee in the 
location at which the executive 
director is based.

1 This element has been added to the remuneration policy to extend the long term outlook of the policy beyond, but in addition to, the annual bonus plan
2 The proposed structure of paying income tax for the executives is due to the Georgian tax code, which requires a company to pay income tax on any benefit paid to the 
executives ( and does not allow for alternative arrangements). However, the numbers disclosed include such income tax estimates.
3 According to Georgian tax code, the company is responsible for paying income tax for the participants. As about 95% of the remuneration of CEO and CFO is subject to Georgian 
tax regulations, the Company pays respective taxes on the relevant portion.

10.2 Individual arrangements
There are no individual arrangements other than those disclosed in this report.
10.3 Performance measures and targets
(a) Salary – deferred shares
Paying part of the executive director's salary in shares is an important element of remuneration as it helps to align each individual's efforts with 
the Group’s performance. As the executive directors' shareholding will increase each year, we believe this is an effective tool to incentivise 
executive directors to think about long-term performance. There are no performance measures or conditions associated with salary – the salary 
is fixed at the outset in the executive directors' service contracts.
The Policy naturally results in our executive Directors holding a significant number of unvested shares and achieves a delay between 
performance and vesting which we believe is consistent with the principles of the Corporate Governance Code. Unvested shares are subject to 
continuous employment and malus and clawback requirements but are not subject to specific performance conditions.
(b) Annual Share Bonus 
Annual deferred share bonuses are awarded to reward past performance over the year. At the end of the performance year, the shares will be 
delivered to the extent that annual KPIs have been met (as determined by the Remuneration Committee). Once shares are delivered, the shares 
will be subject to a 2 year post performance vesting period (with 50% vesting each year) subject to continued employment.
The Remuneration Committee’s goal for each KPI is to establish a level of performance that is not certain to be attained, so that achieving or 
exceeding the targets requires diligent efforts by our executive directors. 
Remuneration committee intention is to retain the current KPIs for the Annual Share Bonus, which consist of corporate, financial (such as ROE, 
cost to income ratio, CoR) and non-financial KPIs (share price performance, employments and customer satisfaction levels) and individual KPIs 
(such as leadership and/or performance of specific function) and which reflect the executive directors' required contribution to the Group's 
overall key strategic and financial objectives for that financial year.
However, given the fact that the first year under assessment for the Annual Share Bonus is 2019, the respective KPIs will be set at the start of the 
each performance period: 2019, 2020 and 2021. The nature (but not necessarily the weightings) of the KPIs will be disclosed in the annual report 
published in the performance year. However, specific targets for each KPI will be disclosed only retrospectively given the sensitivity of the 
measure to the Group’s business.
Each KPI will have a threshold, target and maximum level and conditions to meet these levels. Targets for each corporate KPI will be determined 
by the Remuneration Committee and will be approved by the Board. Individual KPIs will be approved by the Remuneration Committee based on 
the recommendations of the CEO.
(c) LTIP 
The Awards, will be granted subject to performance conditions over a 3 year period. After three years, the shares will be delivered to the extent 
the performance conditions have been met (as determined by the Remuneration Committee). Once shares are delivered, the shares will be 
subject to a 2 year post performance holding period subject to continued employment.
This approach will be used for 3 years starting from 2019. Thus, 2019-2021 performance will be measured in 2022, 2020-2022 performance will 
be measured in 2023 and 2021-2023 performance will be measured in 2024. 
Given the fact that the first performance period under the LTIP will start only in 2019, the exact performance conditions will be defined closer to 
this date. 
The Remuneration Committee’s goal for each performance condition is to establish a level of performance that is not certain to be attained, so 
that achieving or exceeding the targets requires diligent efforts by our executive directors. Remuneration Committee’s current view is that 
performance condition will include a measure of efficiency (e.g. ROE), a measure of share price performance (e.g. absolute EPS/TSR) and a 
measure of long term differentiator such as customer experience. However, in the case of relative KPIs, the Remuneration Committee retains the 
right to apply downward adjustment considering factors such as absolute share price/TSR in determining the final payouts. Any measure 
selected, will be closely aligned with the group strategy. 
The performance conditions for each three year performance period will be set at the start of the each performance period: 2019, 2020 and 2021. 
The performance conditions and respective targets will be disclosed in the annual report published in the year of the award. 
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to amend the agreed performance conditions in exceptional circumstances if, in the opinion of the 
Remuneration Committee, the original performance conditions are no longer appropriate.

Overview
Strategic Report  
Strategy & Performance
Additional Information Financial Statements Governance
Each performance condition will have a threshold, target and maximum level and conditions to meet these levels. Targets for each corporate 
performance condition are determined by the Remuneration Committee and are approved by the Board. 
(d) Shareholder guidelines
Executive directors should naturally build up a significant holding of shares in the Company. In order to encourage this and set a standard 
position, the Company is introducing a minimum shareholding requirement of 200% base salary. There is no set time during which this 
requirement must be met, but until it is met, executive directors are expected to hold shares (net of tax) acquired under this policy. Shares 
counted for this purpose include deferred shares paid in relation to salary and annual bonus and any vested awards from the LTIP. Unvested 
awards from the LTIP will not be counted.
11. Consideration of shareholder views
The current policy takes into account shareholder feedback regarding the remuneration of the Board. Shareholder input has been key to 
designing the remuneration policy as described above. We have established a practice to meet with the shareholders on this matter and request 
their feedback, which will continue in the future. The Remuneration Committee remains mindful of shareholder views when evaluating and 
setting ongoing remuneration strategy.
12. Remuneration throughout the Group
Remuneration of other top management members of JSC TBC Bank is similar to that of the executive members of the Company. Other senior 
and middle management across the Group as well as some other key employees receive their entire salary in cash and are also eligible to cash 
and share bonus compensation. All other employees within the Group receive cash salaries and may be eligible to receive cash bonuses. 
Executive director and employee pay is studied and determined through the use of appropriate market data usually with input from a 
compensation consultant. 
All employees receive a competitive benefit package in line with Georgian market practice and are entitled to participate in the pension scheme 
on a voluntary basis.
13. Policy table: non-executive directors
In the same way as the executives, the non-executive directors receive their compensation both from the Company and the main subsidiary, JSC 
TBC Bank, proportionate to the time spent working on the respective entity's Boards and committees. Starting from 1 January 2018 until the end 
of 2021, the compensation for the non-executive directors is as follows: 144 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Component Purpose and Link to Strategy Operation Maximum Opportunity
Fees To provide appropriate 
compensation for a non-
executive director of the 
Group, sufficient to attract, 
retain and motivate high-
calibre individuals with the 
relevant skills, knowledge and 
experience to further the 
Group’s strategy.
In addition, for the chairman 
and deputy chairman, the 
Group’s remuneration policy 
reflects the importance and 
unique role each of them has 
within the Group. 
The Group pays fees to non-executive directors. The fees 
are determined by the Remuneration Committee and the 
current level of fees include the following:
  The annual fees for the chairman are US$950,000 
  The annual fees for the deputy chairman are 
US$800,000 
  The annual fees for acting as a non-executive director 
(other than for chairman and deputy chairman) range 
between US$84,375 - US$94,553
  The annual fees for acting as Senior Independent 
Director, in addition to the fees received for acting as a 
non-executive director are US$20,000 
  The annual fees for relevant committee memberships 
range between US$10,882 - US$11,250 
  The annual fees for committee chairman positions 
range between US$27,206 - US$28,125 
The ranges depend on tax residency status where the 
Company aims to ensure that the net compensation per 
each of the items above paid to the non-executive 
directors are the same. 
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to 
structure the non-executive directors’ fees differently in 
its absolute discretion. The Remuneration Committee's 
discretion will be exercised fairly and reasonably and with 
regard to appropriate comparable market practice and 
business strategy.
Fees are generally paid monthly in cash. However, the 
Remuneration Committee reserves the right to pay the 
fees on a different basis.
Fees are periodically reviewed and adjusted by the 
Remuneration Committee, having regard to external 
comparators such as the Group's peer group, the chair or 
committee roles and responsibilities and other market 
factors.
The maximum annual fees that may 
be paid to the chairman and deputy 
chairman are US$950,000 and 
US$800,000 respectively. 
The maximum annual fee paid to 
the Senior Independent Director is 
US$175,000. 
The maximum annual fee paid for 
acting as a non-executive director 
(other than for chairman, deputy 
chairman and Senior Independent 
Director) is US$165,000.
Expenses To compensate non-executive 
directors for expenses 
incurred in connection with 
the performance of their 
non-executive director duties 
and to ensure the Group has 
the appropriate non-executive 
director input as and when 
required. 
The Group may reimburse non-executive directors for 
their expenses incurred in connection with the 
performance of their duties including attending Board 
and committee meetings (such as, for example, travel, 
accommodation, other subsistence expenses and 
personal security arrangements), Board/committee 
dinners and functions, Board training sessions, director’s 
and officers’ liability insurance, advice in respect of 
professional duties and corporate hospitality events (or 
the Group may pay such expenses directly).
For the Chairman and Deputy Chairman, JSC TBC Bank 
provides insurance, company car service, and a security 
service for the Chairman only which is a legacy 
arrangement and widely establish practice in 
Georgian market.
The policy is framed by the nature 
of the expenses that the 
Remuneration Committee is willing 
to provide to non-executive 
directors. The maximum amount 
payable depends on the cost of 
providing such expenses in the 
location at which the non-executive 
director is based.
Shareholders should note that the 
cost of providing comparable 
expenses in different jurisdictions 
may vary widely.

13.1 Non-executive directors
Since non-executive directors are not employees, they do not receive compensation or benefits reserved only for employees such as company 
paid/subsidised insurance or paid holiday. The non-executive directors are not eligible for performance-based share awards. They do not 
currently receive pension or other equivalent benefits except for the chairman and deputy chairman who are compensated for and provided with 
car service expenses. Awards with performance conditions are not part of the non-executive remuneration package as we do not wish the 
non-executive directors to be driven by short-term Group performance so as to maintain their independence as advisors to the Group.
The non-executive directors are entitled to broad indemnification by the Group pursuant to a deed of indemnity entered into with each director 
and are covered by the Group’s Directors & Officers’ Liability Insurance Policy.

Notes:
1. Directors’ compensation consists of cash salary, deferred share salary, annual bonus and LTIP. Cash salary and deferred share salary are the same in each performance 
scenario. No pension contributions have been included in the performance scenarios as we assume no pension contributions will be paid.
2. The "below bonus threshold" chart reflects a scenario where KPI achievement falls below 60% and so no bonuses would be awarded. 
3. If KPIs are fulfilled at minimum, on target or maximum ranges the evaluation and subsequent bonus award will be 60%, 100% and 135-137% respectively. 
15. Recruitment policy
The Remuneration Committee intends that the components of remuneration set out in the above policy tables, and the approach to those 
components as set out in the policy tables, will (subject to the remainder of this recruitment policy) be equally applicable to the annual package 
provided to new recruits, i.e. for executive directors, salary (with cash and share components), discretionary deferred share bonuses, pension and 
employee benefits; for non-executive directors, fees and relevant expenses.
For an internal appointment of an executive or non-executive director , any pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue on 
its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment, as appropriate. In the year of promotion for an internal appointment, additional 
awards pro-rated for the time served in the new role may be made to the individual within the maximums set out in the policy tables above.
Where necessary, the Remuneration Committee can make a recruitment-related award to an external candidate. However , the Group will not pay 
more than the Remuneration Committee considers necessary and will endeavour to deliver any such awards in line with the existing Group policies.
The Remuneration Committee has a preference not to provide a “buy out” arrangement and/or to establish additional or particular arrangements 
specifically to facilitate the recruitment of the individual. However, where an individual would be forfeiting remuneration or employment terms in 
order to join the Group, the Remuneration Committee may award appropriate compensation. The Remuneration Committee would require 
reasonable evidence of the nature and value of any forfeited arrangements and would, to the extent practicable, ensure any compensation was of 
comparable commercial value and capped as appropriate, taking into account the terms of the previous arrangement being forfeited (for example 
the form and structure of award, timeframe, performance criteria and likelihood of vesting). Where appropriate, the Remuneration Committee 
would have a preference for buy-outs to be delivered in the form of shares in the Company. All such awards will be appropriately discounted to  146 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
ensure that the Group does not, in the view of the Remuneration 
Committee, over-pay. The Remuneration Committee will also 
consider the application of performance conditions and/or clawback 
provisions, as appropriate. Details of any recruitment-related 
awards will be appropriately disclosed and any arrangements would 
be made within the context of minimising the cost to the Group. In 
any case, total value of a recruitment and “buy out” award, should 
not exceed 100% of the salary (including cash and share salary) paid 
for the comparable executive position the year immediately 
preceding to the recruitment.
The Group may make a contribution towards legal fees in connection 
with agreeing employment terms. The Group may also agree to pay 
certain expenses and taxes should an executive director be asked to 
relocate to a different country, such that the executive director pays 
no more than would have been required in the home location.
16. Policy on payments for loss of office
The following paragraphs describe the Group's general policy on 
payments for loss of office. Section 16.2 sets out the policy for 
payments on termination of Mr Butskhrikidze's and Mr Shagidze's 
service contracts.
Any compensation payable in the event that the employment of an 
executive director is terminated will be determined in accordance 
with the terms of any service contract between the Group and the 
executive, as well as the relevant rules governing outstanding 
deferred share awards, bonus shares, awards under the LTIP and 
this Policy. Please see section 16.2 further for a summary of the 
treatment of such awards where an executive directors is a good or 
bad leaver.
The Remuneration Committee will take all relevant factors into 
account when considering whether the director is a good leaver (as 
set out in their service contract or other applicable plan document). 
The Remuneration Committee will exercise its absolute discretion to 
determine whether such terms should be included in any new 
service contract. 
In addition to any payment referred to above, the Remuneration 
Committee reserves discretion as it considers appropriate to 
continue benefits beyond the date of termination, pay for relocation 
to previous location, where applicable, make payments in lieu of 
notice, accelerate the vesting of equity awards, make a severance 
payment and/or pay for out placement services and/or legal fees.
Generally, the Group would require a non-compete and 
confidentiality agreement from the departing executive director to 
protect the interests of the Group.
16.1 Notice periods
Notice periods are set out in the executive director's service 
contracts. Generally speaking, either party may terminate the 
service contract by giving the other party not more than one year 
and not less than seven months' notice and the Group will reserve 
the right to terminate without notice in certain circumstances. 
Notice periods will be reviewed by the Board and the Remuneration 
Committee when contracts are due for renewal with consideration 
given to business continuity and potential candidates in the market, 
amongst other factors. 
16.2 Service contracts 
The service contracts of executive directors may contain tailored 
terms which allow for termination payments to be paid if the 
executive director’s employment is terminated under certain 
circumstances, such as following a corporate change, a change in 
control, involuntary termination, termination without cause, for "good 
leaver" reasons (including) death or disability, each as defined in the 
applicable executive director’s service contract. Details of such terms 
contained in the current executive directors' service contracts are 
described below

Service contracts with TBC PLC
On 12 May 2016, TBC PLC entered into a service agreement with 
Vakhtang Butskhrikidze. The service agreement can be terminated by 
either party giving to the other party not less than seven months' 
written notice. In addition, TBC PLC may terminate the service 
agreement without notice or pay in lieu of notice for cause (as defined 
in the service contract). The service contract contains non-compete 
and confidentiality provisions and is governed by English law.
On 12 May 2016, TBC PLC entered into a service agreement with 
Giorgi Shagidze. TBC PLC will also reimburse the CFO for all 
reasonable business expenses properly incurred and paid by him. The 
service agreement can be terminated by either party giving to the 
other party not less than seven months' written notice. In addition, 
TBC PLC may terminate the service agreement without notice or pay 
in lieu of notice for cause. The service agreement contains non-
compete and confidentiality provisions and is governed by English law. 
Service contracts with TBC JSC
Vakhtang Butskhrikidze and Giorgi Shagidze also serve as CEO and 
deputy CEO (CFO) of TBC JSC, respectively. Although it is not strictly 
required under UK law, we have described the service contracts that 
the Group's executive directors have with TBC JSC below for 
completeness.
In 1995, TBC JSC entered into a service agreement with Vakhtang 
Butskhrikidze. The current service agreement provides for Mr 
Butskhrikidze to act as CEO of TBC JSC. The service agreement 
contains non-compete and confidentiality provisions and is governed 
by Georgian law. 
In 2010, TBC JSC entered into a service agreement with Giorgi 
Shagidze. The current service agreement provides for Mr . Shagidze to 
act as deputy CEO (CFO) of TBC JSC. The service agreement contains 
non-compete and confidentiality provisions and is governed by 
Georgian law. 
In September 2016, Vakhtang Butskhrikidze and Giorgi Shagidze were 
appointed to the Supervisory Board of TBC JSC.

1. The shares held in JSC TBC Bank were awarded to each executive director 
before the premium listing under the applicable compensation policy. Those 
shares were not exchanged for Company shares due to temporary Georgian tax 
obligations. The executive directors intend to exchange those shares with 
Company shares following the expiration of the tax obligations.
If an executive director ceases to be employed by any Group 
company at his/her sole decision before the service contract expires 
or if the executive director leaves for a bad leaver reason, the 
executive director must return all bonus shares awarded for which 
the continuous employment condition has not been met (or as 
directed by the Company) and/or any nil cost options awarded will 
lapse and any unvested awards under the LTIP will lapse. Depending 
on the circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may, at its sole 
discretion and with regard to any recommendation made by the CEO 
of the Company (as applicable), allow the executive director to 
partially or fully retain such bonus shares and/or LTIP awards.
If the executive director is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee to be a good leaver, the executive director is entitled to 
receive an award of deferred salary and deferred bonus shares pro 
rated for both time and performance during the performance year. 
All outstanding awards of deferred salary and deferred bonus will 
continue to vest on their initial terms. Subject to the achievement of 
the relevant performance criteria, a portion of any outstanding 
awards under the LTIP may vest, subject to a reduction pro rata to 
reflect shortened period of employment between grant and the end 
of the holding period. In general, the original performance period 
will continue to apply. However, where in the opinion of the 
remuneration committee, early vesting is appropriate, or where it is 
otherwise necessary, awards will vest by reference to performance 
criteria achieved over the period of employment.
If, during the three years after the dismissal of the executive director 
as a good leaver, it is established that the executive director was a 
bad leaver, the provisions applicable to bad leavers will apply.
(b) Letters of appointment – non-executive directors
Each non-executive director is required to submit himself or herself 
for annual re-election at the Annual General Meeting. The letters of 
appointment with the Group for each non-executive director are 
effective from 2016. The letters of appointment provide for a one 
month notice period although the Group may terminate the 
appointment with immediate effect without notice or pay in lieu of 
notice if the non-executive director has committed any serious 
breach or non-observance of his or her obligations to the Group, is 
guilty of fraud or dishonesty, brings the Group or him/herself into 
disrepute or is disqualified as acting as a non-executive director, 
among other circumstances. Upon termination, the only 
remuneration a non-executive director is entitled to is accrued fees 
as at the date of termination, together with reimbursement of 
properly incurred expenses incurred prior to the termination date.
17. Legacy arrangements
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make any 
remuneration payments and payments for loss of office 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out 
above, where the terms of that payment were agreed before the 
Policy came into effect (including, without limitation, pursuant to 
awards granted before the Policy came into effect), or before the 
individual became a director of the Group (provided the payment was 
not in consideration for the individual becoming a director). In 
addition, the policy tables shall not have the effect of limiting any 
payment to a new recruit made under the recruitment policy set out 
in section 15 above.
18. Consideration of employment conditions within 
the Group
In accordance with prevailing commercial practice, the 
Remuneration Committee evaluates the compensation and 
conditions of employees of the Group in determining the Policy with 
respect to executive directors. The Remuneration Committee may 
engage external advisors to assist in analysing remuneration in the 
Group. Each year the Remuneration Committee approves the overall 
percentage pay out for compensation and material changes to 
employee benefit plans. Consistent with practice in the industry in 
which the Group operates, it is not the Group's policy to consult with 
staff on the pay of its directors.  
19. Minor changes
The Remuneration Committee may make, without the need for 
shareholder approval, minor amendments to the Policy for 
regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to 
take account of changes in legislation.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Chairman’s Letter
Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to present the Audit Committee report for the Group.
I invite you to read the results of these and other main activities of 
the Audit Committee in the report below.
Nicholas Dominic Haag
Chairman of the Audit Committee
28 March 2018
Committee Structure and Role
Since the Company’s incorporation in 2016, there have been two 
separate but inter-connected audit committees in the Group for 
each of the Company and the Bank, which have common 
membership and perform a joint function within the Group. In 
practice, we consider both audit committees as complementary and 
somewhat fungible with both of them being focused on optimising 
governance of the Group as a whole, especially because the Bank 
represents 98% of the Group’s total assets. Nevertheless, we 
continue to ensure that particular resolutions are passed by the 
appropriate audit committee with as little duplication as possible, 
while making sure that there is seamless co-operation between the 
two committees to avoid any gaps in overall scrutiny. For the 
purpose of this report, we refer to the two committees collectively as 
“the Audit Committee”.
The Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities include overseeing 
the Group’s financial reporting process, supervising the process of 
appointment of external auditors, reviewing the implementation of 
the Group’s accounting and reporting policies and practices, 
ensuring the integrity, accuracy and full disclosure of the Group’s 
financial condition (including the Group’s taxes) and assisting in the 
assessment of the ‘going concern’ status of the Group. The Audit 
Committee is also responsible for reviewing relevant content of the 
Group’s annual reports and interim statements, and supervising the 
Bank’s systems of internal control in relation to financial reporting 
and certain operational risks including internal investigations into 
control weaknesses. Moreover, the Audit Committee evaluates the 
management’s competence in all the above areas and ensures that 
they take necessary corrective actions in a timely manner to address 
any vulnerabilities.
In relation to the risk assessment function, the Group has a separate 
Board-level committee responsible for risk, ethics and compliance, 
the RECC, which is chaired by Nikoloz Enukidze, who is also a 
member of the Audit Committee. Nicholas Haag, the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee, is, in turn, a member of the RECC. Please see 
pages 60 to 69 for a description of the Group’s risk management 
framework and pages 123 to 125 for the RECC’s report.
Whilst there are synergies between the work of the Audit Committee 
and the RECC, and they share many of the same complex issues of 
judgement and policy, we continue to believe that there is a clear 
benefit in preserving a separate independent Audit Committee as 
well as a strong RECC. We recognise that there is, in any case, no 
clear dividing line between financial risk and other risks, but we 
acknowledge that the Audit Committee is more attuned to risks in 
financial reporting, whereas the RECC is responsible for monitoring 
on-going credit and other market risks. 
In addition to close cooperation with the RECC, several of the Audit 
Committee’s members, including the Chairman, also sit on the 
Remuneration Committee, which allows the Audit Committee to 
track remuneration policies and ensure that there are no incentives 
which could weaken controls or introduce Management bias in 
connection with loan provisioning and valuations.
The Audit Committee has adequate administrative resources from 
the Group’s and Board Secretariat and receives sufficient and timely 
materials from the Management both proactively and when we make 
additional information requests. The lines of communication with 
the Management are open with constructive, candid and continual 
dialogue taking place throughout the year.
Committee Composition, Expertise and Independence
At the end of 2017, the audit committee of the Company comprised 
five non-executive Directors: Nicholas Haag (Chairman), Eric J. 
Rajendra, Stephan Wilcke, Nikoloz Enukidze and Stefano Marsaglia. 
All members of the audit committee of the Company have been 
deemed as independent under the Code, which is applicable to 
companies listed on the premium segment of the LSE. We believe 
that the audit committee of the Company and all of its members 
continue to exercise fully independent judgement in all matters 
related to their functions. In addition, members of the audit 
committee continue to satisfy the director independence criteria as 
defined by the Georgian Law of Banks.
Committee Meetings
In 2017 the attendance level of members at meetings of the audit 
committee of the Company was 98%. The majority of meetings took 
place in London and were attended by members either physically in 
person or via teleconference. In case of the latter, relevant attendees 
participated from locations within the UK. The attendance of 
members at the Audit Committee meetings during the year 2017  
are set out in the Directors’ Governance statement on page 106.
The meetings of the Bank’s audit committee took place in both the 
UK and Georgia with the majority of meetings taking place in  149 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Georgia. The reason for this is that the Audit Committee is keen to 
maintain a high degree of interaction with a range of local staff 
employed by the Bank in operational, financial and control roles. 
This allows us to gather deeper insights into the Bank’s processes, 
culture and morale of staff, who have functions related to our audit 
work. This type of review cannot be so easily performed in the UK 
due to logistical reasons and the extra expense of having to bring a 
large number of the Bank’s employees to London on a regular basis. 
Attendance of meetings of the Bank’s Audit Committee in 2017 is set 
out in the Directors’ Governance statement on page 106.
All current members of the Audit Committee(see biographies on 
pages 114 to 117 of the Annual Report) are financially literate and 
possess a detailed understanding of the financial services sector, 
with backgrounds primarily in the banking industry in both the EU 
and emerging markets, as well as consultancy, risk management 
and IT. Most have served on (or chaired) other banks’ audit and risk 
committees, which provides them with the necessary expertise to 
guide and challenge the Board, the Management and external 
auditors. The Audit Committee, therefore, has sufficient recent and 
relevant expertise, in particular of the financial services industry, to 
operate effectively and it calls upon other expert internal and 
external resources as and when required. Moreover, the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee has the recent and relevant financial 
experience required by the Code to fulfil his responsibilities as a 
designated financial expert on the Audit Committee.
Although one member of the Audit Committee has a substantially 
full-time executive role on the management board of another 
non-conflicting bank and all other members spend much of their 
time on various supervisory-type boards, the Board believes that 
members of the Audit Committee have sufficient time to devote to 
their responsibilities towards the Group. Appropriate training is 
available to members of the Audit Committee and has recently 
included professional updates by external specialists on new 
accounting regulations, which are currently being implemented,  
and relevant developments in corporate governance and best 
practice, which training was attended by most members of the  
Audit Committee. We continue to review, in collaboration with the 
Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee, suitable 
medium-term succession plans for the Audit Committee, similar to 
the same process for all other committees of the Board. Our priority 
would be to select future members of the Audit Committee with a 
background in the audit industry or one with a relevant specialist 
background and knowledge, such as in cybersecurity.
The Committee is also acutely aware of the highest standards 
expected of disclosure, record-keeping and controls associated  
with the Company’s listing on the premium segment of the LSE.  
We will continue to work to ensure these standards are fully met  
and maintained.
Over the course of 2017 there were 8 formal meetings of the audit 
committee of the Company and the same number for the Bank’s 
audit committee, all of which were minuted. In addition, there were 
regular interim meetings via teleconference facilities, where 
members discussed a narrower agenda, mostly around planned 
releases of financial data. Members are also in regular e-mail 
correspondence with each other on various matters relating to the 
Audit Committee’s work.
During each formal meeting, the Audit Committee met in executive 
session without Management present. In addition, we typically also 
met with at least one member of the Management Board of the Bank 
responsible for a particular divisional line of business to seek 
feedback on issues that may have been highlighted in Internal Audit 
reports. This allows us to impress upon senior members of the 
Management the importance of minimising deficiencies and 
remedying any that do occur. We also typically met with other senior 
members of the Management, notably the CEO, CFO, COO, CIO and 
CRO. The Head of Internal Audit was present throughout every 
meeting. We have adopted a policy of inviting PwC to attend the 
entirety of our Audit Committee meetings (except for meetings that 
address topics sensitive to PwC, such as auditor appointments and 
fees) because we felt that this would assist with their understanding 
of the Company and the Group. This also allowed us to benefit from 
PwC’s wide-ranging expertise.
The audit committee of the Company met twice in or around each 
quarter of 2017, broadly in synch with the Bank’s quarterly financial 
reporting cycle. At least one such quarterly meeting coincided with 
the timing of our Board meetings and the Audit Committee was 
scheduled a day in advance of these meetings to ensure that we 
could formally present our summary findings to the Board. The 
Audit Committee used such reports for highlighting the scope for 
process improvement and inviting responses from the CEO or his 
senior team, which led to follow-up actions that were formally 
minuted by the Board.
The number of meetings of the audit committee of the Company 
doubled from that held in 2016, which reflects additional supervisory 
responsibilities arising from the Company’s listing on the premium 
segment of the LSE, its status as a “Public Interest Entity” under the 
Statutory Audit Directive (2006/43/EC) of the European Parliament 
and of the Council and its commitment to enhanced supervision. The 
Company became a “Public Interest Entity” for the first time in 2017. 
In 2017, there were no significant or enduring points of difference of 
opinion between the Audit Committee and PwC or between the Audit 
Committee and the Board or Management. 
Audit Committee Effectiveness
The Terms of Reference for the audit committee of the Company 
were approved by the Board on May 2016. The document is available 
on TBC’s website at www.tbcbankgroup.com The audit committee 
Policy of the Bank was revised and approved in March 2017 and 
approved by the Supervisory Board of the Bank in the same month.
In March 2018, the Audit Committee conducted an annual 
Effectiveness Self-Review using an extensive and customised 
questionnaire. In addition, the whole Board included in its wider 
Self-Assessment certain questions relating to the efficacy of the 
Audit Committee amongst other committees of the Board. Both the 
Audit Committee and the Board concluded that the former is 
constituted properly, operates effectively and carries out all its 
responsibilities as laid out in its Terms of Reference and Policy.
Integrity of Financial Statements
We have reviewed, with input from the External Auditor and in-house 
Finance, Risk and Internal Audit teams, all data and narrative 
comment and concluded that the Annual Report and full year 
financial statements give a complete, true, fair, balanced and  150 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
understandable view of the Group’s financial position and are 
consistent with the Committee’s understanding of the facts, and 
provide the information necessary for the Company’s shareholders 
and other stakeholders to assess the financial condition of the Group.
The Committee is conscious that the Group consists of the Company, 
which is listed on the premium segment of the LSE , and the Bank, 
which is the largest financial services company in the Georgian 
market, and it has legal and social responsibilities to the Company’s 
shareholders and other stakeholders of the Group. Our business is 
overwhelmingly tied to the performance of the Georgian economy. In 
2017 Georgia delivered a strong real GDP growth of 5.0%, an 
improvement on 2.8% growth in 2016. The Georgian government and 
third party forecasts for 2018 suggest growth of a similar magnitude 
may be achievable. At the timing of writing, the macro-economic 
outlook for Georgia looks more positive than it has been for several 
years with significant improvements in foreign trade and tourism, as 
well as development of important, and often multi-national, 
infrastructure projects, which indicate the potential for Georgia to 
become more of an international hub economy. Nevertheless, there 
is always a risk of a sudden downturn due to a changing local, 
regional or global environment and the Committee, like the RECC, 
tracks closely (on a weekly basis) relevant economic data for 
‘warning signs’.
We are equally vigilant in seeking any evidence of complacency 
which might lead to a risk of deterioration in internal standards. The 
Audit Committee will seek to ensure that any unexpected 
deterioration in the Georgian economy will trigger extra vigilance on 
our part in relation to financial controls and reporting risk since any 
challenging economic context potentially raises both credit and 
operational risks within the Bank. The recent adoption of IFRS9 in 
our view further supports the early revelation of any such potential 
deterioration in loan quality and it is being swiftly reflected in our 
models, with any necessary extra provisioning accounted for 
accordingly. The Group has always operated a conservative 
provisioning policy but the Audit Committee welcomes the extra 
discipline imposed by IFRS9 and the additional disclosures to the 
Group’s stakeholders.
The Audit Committee remains as focused as ever on ensuring the 
integrity of our financial releases and internal records. The Audit 
Committee pre-vets all audited and auditor-reviewed financial 
releases, as well as all other financial releases, before making 
recommendations to the Board to approve these. The Audit 
Committee holds formal discussions with the Management, in 
particular the CFO (and his finance team), about each of these 
releases, typically with a multi-stage drafting, review and approval 
process. We are also in regular communication with the External 
Auditor via both teleconference facilities and correspondence before 
approving any releases. We have extended the remit of Internal Audit 
which now undertakes its own assessment of financial and regulatory 
reporting to give the Audit Committee further assurance on the 
integrity of our reported numbers and, above all, the governance 
process involved in assembling and releasing our financial statements 
in the public domain. We also monitor the financial data published on 
the TBC Bank’s website to ensure its accuracy.
External Audit Team and Planning
The Audit Committee makes recommendations on the appointment 
(or potentially removal) and compensation of external auditors and 
seek to maximise the value of the external audit relationship. We 
assess and approve audit scope and frequency, make 
recommendations to auditors on areas for particular focus and 
receive and review key external audit reports.
The audit committee of the Company held multiple audit planning 
meetings with PwC in 2017, commencing this process in the middle 
of the year. The Audit Committee had the opportunity (without 
involvement of the Management) to highlight areas it wished the 
External Auditor to focus on, flagging relevant concerns and trends, 
and discussing the appropriate audit response.
The Audit Committee has a policy of regular quarterly face to face 
discussions with PwC as part of our formal meeting agendas, 
proactively and mutually addressing any material audit or control 
issues. In addition, the Chairman and often other members of the 
Audit Committee, had a similar number of more informal (i.e. not 
minuted) meetings with PwC at occasional but frequent intervals, 
which combined mutual audit planning/execution updates with some 
element of briefing or training to the Audit Committee’s members 
on the latest developments in accounting regulations and corporate 
governance, which included, in particular, PwC sharing with us 
experiences of best practice across their full international audit 
spectrum. This provided both parties with the opportunity for open 
dialogue.
Given the holding company structure of the Group, both the London 
and Tbilisi practices of PwC are fully involved in the audit process for 
the Group. PwC Georgia and PwC in Azerbaijan, which audits our 
small Azeri subsidiary, are both part of PwC’s Central and Eastern 
Europe network firm. In the opinion of the Audit Committee, this 
‘double coverage’ works well and provides some extra reassurance 
to us in terms of scrutiny of the Group’s financial and risk-
management processes. We also enjoy ready access to our audit 
engagement partner (Jeremy Foster) for the entire Group, who is 
aware of his overall responsibility and ultimate sign-off duties, and 
the cooperation and communication between the two audit practices 
is well coordinated with a common audit methodology. The London 
audit team coordinates the entire audit for the Group and the 
balance of PwC’s audit responsibilities is shifting somewhat from 
Tbilisi to London. We expect this trend to continue going forward. 
The Chairman and majority of the Audit Committee’s members are 
based in the UK and enjoy ready access to the audit team there.
In our view, Jeremy Foster has exhibited not only strong technical 
skills but also a good understanding of the Group’s business, the 
country and sector. He has also exhibited suitably robust challenge 
and professional scepticism in relation to the audit. The Audit 
Committee has shared its views on audit and partner quality with 
PwC’s own independent senior partner, who collects client feedback 
and seeks to maximise standards of service by PwC.
In 2017 we welcomed Agnieszka Accordi as the new PwC audit 
partner for the Bank’s audit. We are satisfied with the smooth 
transition from the previous longstanding PwC audit partner for the 
Bank and she has made a strong hands-on start to understanding 
the Bank’s business and audit issues and is also a subject-expert in 
areas of importance to us, in particular IFRS9. Agnieszka is based in 
Warsaw but, similar to Jeremy Foster, has already travelled to 
Georgia on a number of occasions. 151 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Areas of Focus for External Audit and Audit Committee
The audit coverage and the judgements about underlying audit 
materiality have been explained to us satisfactorily. We agreed with 
PwC an overall consolidated audit materiality sum of GEL19.7m for 
the Group compared to GEL15.8m in 2016. The increase is related to 
the further expansion in the Group’s size and profitability. We 
continue to believe that pre-tax profitability of 5% is a suitable and 
meaningful materiality basis for the Company, especially given the 
relatively stable performance of the Group’s profitability metric over 
the years.
In accordance with our normal practice, we have assessed the 
reasonableness and appropriateness of all critical accounting 
estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies. In the 
frequent planning meetings held between the Audit Committee and 
PwC, there were a number of areas of focus identified. The key 
accounting judgements and significant estimates were identified and 
have been addressed with appropriate resources, including the 
necessary involvement of specialists in these areas.
In particular, we agreed with PwC that the two most significant 
audit-related risks were the Management’s ability to override 
controls and the provisions for impairment of loans and guarantees. 
We also agreed with PwC an additional elevated risk in relation to 
the disclosure of the potential impact of IFRS9 given the complexity 
of determining such estimates and the requirement to guide the 
market as soon as valid estimates became available. Other risks in 
terms of areas of judgement that we asked PwC to focus on included 
accruals for litigation and claims, collateral values supporting the 
Group’s loan book, net realisable value of repossessed collateral, 
fair value of securities and derivatives, share based payments and 
impairment of goodwill.
Provisions and impairments
In terms of loan provisions, we have worked with PwC in verifying 
the current provisioning methodology used by the Bank, challenging 
these assumptions and examining individual (mostly corporate loan) 
exposures on the non-performing and ‘watch list’. We have 
confirmed the completeness of this ‘watch list’, which we note tends 
to be stable in composition without frequent additions that would 
indicate a deteriorating book or poor ‘capture’ of problem loans. We 
have also sought to use our judgement to back-test the reliability of 
the Bank’s previous impairment assumptions, which we have found 
to be reasonably conservative compared to observed reality, partly 
because the Georgian economic climate has proven to be more 
resilient than the Bank’s earlier assumptions. We note that in 2017 
we made significant recoveries from corporate loans that we had 
provisioned or written off.
The Audit Committee, benefiting from work streams led by the 
RECC, continues to monitor on a regular basis individually-assessed 
loans on the Bank’s ‘watch list’ but also collectively-assessed loans 
that are less than 90 days past due (and not yet classified as 
impaired) to calibrate any deterioration of credit quality that may 
feed through into impairments. Given the continued challenging 
macro economic situation in Azerbaijan, the Audit Committee has 
paid close attention to the portfolio quality of TBC Kredit, our Azeri 
subsidiary. We note that there has been some stabilisation in the 
quality of this portfolio since 2016.
Clearly, one of the biggest factors impacting and also reflecting the 
Georgian economy is the stability of the local Lari currency. The Lari 
has been prone to periods of volatility, particularly in early and late 
2017, which was, to some extent, affected by the seasonality of FX 
inflow and outflow among other things related to the tourism 
industry and energy imports. The exchange rate appears to have 
now stabilised and the Lari is currently trading at a higher level 
against the US$ than at the start of 2017, partly reflecting the 
apparent weak dollar policy of the US government.
Given the still highly dollarised nature of the Georgian economy and 
the Bank’s loan book, we invited PwC to scrutinise the 
Management’s judgements as to the continuing creditworthiness of 
those of the Group’s clients (including both retail and corporate) 
without matching dollar sources of income. In reviewing provisioning 
levels the Audit Committee has sought and received detailed data on 
such currency mismatches and the RECC has performed a 
deep-dive into this risk issue. We note that, in previous periods of 
national currency volatility, our assumptions regarding the impact of 
this on the quality of the loan book have proven reassuringly 
cautious on a back-tested basis and the periods of Lari weakness 
over 2017 were, in our view, not sustained enough per se to be 
reflected in changes to the quality of our portfolio. In addition, we 
note that the welcome “larisation” policy of the Georgian 
government has and will continue to diminish the credit and 
financial reporting risk.
Implementation of IFRS9
Whilst the new standard was not formally adopted until 1 January 2018, 
IFRS9 was clearly an audit priority for the Audit Committee in 2017. 
As noted above, this was almost by definition an area of “elevated 
risk” in the audit since the implications for the Group are significant 
(in the same way as for most European banks), with necessary 
anticipatory disclosure about the likely transitional impact and the 
inherent risk of misstatement.
In 2017, the Audit Committee, together with the RECC, oversaw the 
Group’s preparations for the implementation of IFRS9 which has been a 
complex project launched by the Group in the middle of 2016. Both the 
Audit Committee and the RECC at regular intervals invited the CFO, 
CRO and the internal dedicated Credit Risk and Finance team to provide 
them with updates and supporting materials. The Group worked with 
Deloitte, our project consultant and product vendor , throughout the year 
and the main inputs and outputs were shared with PwC.
We obtained confirmation that PwC, employing their accounting, 
modelling and IT specialists, have adequately identified the key 
sources of complexity, judgement and uncertainty in the Group’s 
estimates of expected credit losses under IFRS9. They have 
undertaken substantive testing of key model methodologies for 
completeness, availability and accuracy of the data flows and for key 
judgements and assumptions, as well as the governance and 
internal controls involved. We note, however, that there is limited 
historical loss data in the Georgian market. The Bank has 
undertaken ‘parallel runs’ (i.e. IFRS9 vs IAS39). We have also 
maintained a close dialogue on the subject with the NBG.
We anticipate that the Bank’s provisioning policies described above 
will enhance the Bank’s already robust approach to financial reporting 
on credit risk. There has been a lot written about the potential impact 
of IFRS9 being likely to result in higher provisioning and profit and  152 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
loss volatility, particularly amongst smaller banks. However , the Bank 
has a record of steady growth in earnings and we anticipate that the 
impact on our results may be somewhat less material. We recognise 
that the impact of IFRS9 will take time to calibrate across all across 
financial institutions and that there will be an element of “informed 
guesswork” (as it has been widely described) in financial reporting 
until the new standard is definitively established.
Readiness for other accounting standards
The Audit Committee has also looked at other accounting standards 
recently adopted or in the pipeline, most notably IFRS15 (which has 
applied since January 2018) on revenue recognition and IFRS16 
(which is expected to come into force from January 2019) on leases. 
IFRS 15 potentially changes the profile of revenue and in some cases 
cost recognition. However, we anticipate no material impact because 
most of the Group’s revenue will be outside the scope of the new 
standard (as the proportion of contractually “uncertain” revenue 
streams is small and, equally, the cost differential is also small) and 
this is reflected in the impact disclosure in our published 2017 
financial statements.
IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, 
presentation and disclosure of leases, which will become effective 
starting from January 2019. It will change the reporting standard of 
leasing transactions for the lessees. Given the low volume of transactions 
where the Group is the lessee, we do not anticipate any material 
impact on the financial statements of the Group. Under IFRS 16, the 
lessor accounting remains largely unchanged from IAS 17 and, 
hence, the change will have no impact on transactions where the Group 
is a lessor .
Management’s ability to override controls
In terms of the significant risk of Management’s overriding of controls, 
we note that this is a priority risk factor on all audit engagements, 
especially in a banking context because the Management is responsible 
for the design and operation of systems to prevent and detect fraud 
and, thus, it is in a unique position to manipulate accounting records. In 
response to this risk PwC conducted review of organisation-wide 
governance systems and overall control environment. We asked 
Internal Audit to pay special attention to the bedding down of controls in 
relation to the Group’s acquisition of Bank Republic. The operational 
merger was completed in May 2017 and this has several implications 
for audit in terms of process flow and the integration of differing bank 
systems. We invited PwC to analyse the integration and alignment of 
policies and procedures. The Audit Committee was satisfied that this 
integration has been essentially completed.
Deferred tax
Another particular focus area of the Audit Committee has been the 
de-recognition of deferred tax balances under changes in Georgian 
tax regulation. In May 2016, the government enacted changes to 
incentivise the reinvestment of corporate profits. The new code 
impacts the recognition and measurement principles of the Group’s 
income tax and also affects the Group’s deferred income tax assets/
liabilities. Whist this law will not come into effect for the banking 
sector until January 2019, it has a more immediate impact on 
deferred tax calculations. In 2016, the Group had a one-off income 
charge of GEL 17.9m related to this change and in 2017 the change 
decreased the effective tax rate from a potential 12% to 9% through 
reducing deferred tax liabilities relating to the period from 1 January 
2019. However, the potentially tax-free reinvestment of future profits 
will have a positive effect on lowering the Group’s future effective tax 
rate by several percentage points further, starting from 2019.
Reporting on the alternate performance measures
The Audit Committee is conscious of the recommendations of 
European authorities and the UK’s Financial Reporting Council (the 
“FRC") in connection with improving the reporting of alternate 
performance measures (“APMs”). We carefully track what APMs the 
Group uses in its financial reporting. The Group discloses a limited 
number of APMs, such as adjusted cost to income ratio, various 
return metrics and adjustments for the Bank Republic acquisition. We 
consider that most of these (for example, the return metrics pre- as 
well as post-provision) are in common usage and meaningful 
additions to our reporting designed to clarify rather than obfuscate 
our financial position and do not detract in any way from our core 
IFRS numbers. Some of them, such as for Bank Republic, are 
inherently time-limited in terms of usage.
Revised segment accounting methodology 
One other area that the Audit Committee intends to focus on in 2018, 
and has already discussed with the CFO, is the revised segment 
accounting methodology that the Group is changing from 1 January 
2018 because this has implications around divisional profitability and 
strategy, as well as touching on remuneration incentives.
External Audit Quality, Tender Assessment and 
Reappointment 
The Audit Committee is responsible for the assessment of the 
performance, objectivity and independence of the External Auditor 
and the delivery of a good quality audit. Each year the Audit 
Committee is required to consider the reappointment of the 
auditors, the suitability of the lead engagement partner, as well as 
the wider audit team, and the remuneration and terms of 
engagement for the chosen auditor. PwC have undertaken a 
comprehensive assessment of their independence, in accordance 
with the requirements of standards and relevant legislation.
PwC has been the Group’s External Auditor since 2008. 2017 marks 
the 10th year in which PwC has audited the Group. Consequently, the 
Audit Committee had extensive discussions in 2016 and 2017 
regarding the merits of conducting an external audit tender under the 
UK implementation of the EU Audit Regulations for Public Interest 
Entities (the “EU Regulations”). Given the Group’s recent 
incorporation of the Company and its listing on the premium segment 
of the LSE, the audit rotation rules permitted the 10-year ”audit clock” 
for the mandatory tendering of the Group audit to be re-set to start in 
2016, obviating any requirement for a mandatory audit tender in the 
foreseeable future. However , taking into account the existence of the 
Bank prior to the incorporation of the Company and the duration of 
our relationship with PwC, the Audit Committee evaluated, with input 
from the CFO, whether there would be a case nonetheless to initiate 
an audit tender . The Audit Committee concluded that it would be 
distracting to change auditor shortly after the Company’s listing on 
the premium segment of the LSE and given other important work 
streams for the Group’s finance team, such as the adoption of IFRS9. 
Accordingly, the Company has complied with the requirements of The 
Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the 
frequency of external auditor tenders for the financial year  
under review.

Additional Information Financial Statements Governance
We are also mindful that the availability of leading audit suppliers in 
the Georgian market is somewhat limited and further restricted by 
potential conflicts in respect of the provision of such services to 
other large Georgian banks, which makes a change of auditor more 
difficult but not impossible. In addition, we have taken into account 
the extra ‘safeguards’ of a relatively recently appointed lead 
engagement partner since 2016 ie Jeremy Foster), the shift of the 
centre of gravity for the audit to London from its historical base in 
Tbilisi and a new engagement partner for the Bank’s audit (ie 
Agnieszka Accordi) appointed in 2017. Consequently, last year we 
resolved to defer any decision whether to hold an audit tender and 
we expect that, subject to the finalisation of suitable contract terms 
and the Board approval, PwC will remain the Group’s External 
Auditor for 2018.
There is clearly an interesting ongoing global debate about the 
so-called “audit gap”, which is the occasional difference between 
expectations of users and auditors as to the responsibilities of the 
latter and the nature of the audit engagement. Leaving this aside, the 
Audit Committee has concluded that PwC have delivered a high 
quality audit. In 2017, PwC made reliable and effective judgements at 
all stages, identified and focused on areas of greatest risk and 
convincingly articulated their testing strategy. We welcomed the 
candour of the audit partners for both the Company and the Bank and 
the clarity of their observations in private and informal sessions. As 
noted above, we are confident in the technical and personal qualities 
displayed by Jeremy Foster and Agnieszka Accordi, and that they have 
deployed sufficient PwC human and automated (i.e. data analytics) 
resources and were well supported by experienced audit managers in 
both London and Tbilisi. We also note PwC’s proven continuing ability 
to meet our tight reporting deadlines in the context of a larger Group, 
the Company’s listing on the premium segment of the LSE and our 
acquiring the status of a FTSE 250 company. Feedback from our CFO 
and finance team has been positive expressing the view to the Audit 
Committee that PwC have demonstrated a good understanding of the 
Group’s business and the current economic environment in Georgia 
and have provided useful insight into corporate governance and good 
advice on the enhancement of disclosures in this Report. Equally, PwC 
have shared with us supportive insights into the Management as part 
of their audit findings.
In the meantime, both the Audit Committee and the Management 
consciously cultivate relationships with other prominent audit firms 
and some of their individual partners in London and Tbilisi and use 
the allocation of non-audit services as an opportunity to engage with 
and to ‘try out’ different firms and to familiarise some of them with 
the Company and our business. Audit quality will always be 
paramount in our selection of auditor.
External Audit Quality Validation
As noted in last year’s Report, FRC undertook a routine formal Audit 
Quality Review (“AQR”) of PwC’s audit of the Bank for the year 
ending December 2015. It is reassuring to us that the AQR confirmed 
that the audit was properly “compliant” and was awarded one of the 
FRC’s highest compliance categories. The AQR did not highlight any 
significant areas for improvement and nothing that brought into 
question the reappointment of PwC. Over the course of 2017, we 
have tracked progress in the minor follow up recommendations 
noted by the FRC in their AQR and implemented with PwC small 
changes in audit procedure (for example, acceleration of 
communication with this Committee).
External Audit Independence and Provision of  
Non-Audit Services
The Audit Committee is rigorous in ensuring that all non-audit 
assignments to our External Auditor do not jeopardise the latter’s 
proper independence of judgement. We will typically use our 
External Auditor only where such non-audit services are required by 
legislation to be undertaken by the incumbent auditor or where the 
service is a ‘by-product’ of the audit process. The Group’s policy as 
to the provision of non-audit services was updated in 2016 and is 
regularly reviewed to ensure that it continues to be appropriate. 
Essentially, all such engagements, without exception or derogation, 
are first recommended by the CFO and must be approved in advance 
by the Audit Committee. We will then use our External Auditor for 
non-audit services only where there is either a clear synergy with 
their audit role or where they offer superior competence or 
materially better commercial terms. No non-audit services were 
provided by PwC that are or will be “prohibited” in the foreseeable 
future by the UK’s implementation of relevant EU Regulations. We 
have a system in place for precisely tracking procurement and 
tendering for all non-audit fees irrespective of their size and scope.
PwC provide the financial audit both for the Company and the Bank. In 
2017 fees to PwC for total contracted audit-related work totalled 
US$877,000 (net of taxes), of which the fees attributed to the Group’s 
financial audit was US$645,000 with three-quarters for the Company’s 
audit and a quarter for the Bank’s audit. The balance of PwC’s fees 
related to additional financial reviews for both entities, audit of other 
subsidiaries and other miscellaneous audit-related work (such as 
provision of comfort on financial covenants). We also used PwC for tax 
audit work in our Azeri subsidiary after a full tender process.
Only 2% of the Group’s total spend with PwC in 2017 related to 
non-audit work. In addition, only 3% of the Group’s total non-audit 
services spend was awarded to PwC compared to 70% in 2016, which 
was then due to the exceptional work related to the Company’s listing 
on the premium segment of the LSE and a number of acquisition-
related transactions. The rest of the total non-audit services spend 
was shared between three other large firms. As stated above, we 
work with other firms not only to preserve auditor independence but 
also to build relations and user experience that will be useful when 
the Group decides to tender its audit contract in due course.
In terms of non-audit related services, the biggest consulting spend 
of 2017 (US$180,000) related to designing a methodology around 
IFSR9 with Deloitte being chosen following a tender of 5 firms and 
an open tender for fair valuation services was awarded to KPMG. In 
summary, total spend with the so-called ‘Big Four’ firms on 
contracts in 2017 amounted to c. US$1.2M. Nearly three-quarters of 
this was for audit-related work, all of which went to PwC. As regards 
the non-audit consulting spend, only US$20,000 of approximately 
US$300,000 was awarded to PwC (excluding c. US$8,000 paid for tax 
audit in our Azeri subsidiary), which was in respect of providing 
consulting services for implementing accounting rules in our leasing 
subsidiary with PwC winning on price and relevant experience.
The Audit Committee will remain mindful of the relatively new EU 
Regulations on capping the quantum of non-audit fees that can be 
billed in any one year to an external auditor (70% of the average 
audit fees billed in the last three consecutive years). We do not 
believe that the Company will have cause to breach these rules even 
in the event that PwC remains our External Auditor after 2018. 154 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
We note that there is a commercial banking relationship between 
PwC Georgia and the Bank but this is not material in size and it is 
conducted in the ordinary course of business and pre-dates the 
appointment of PwC as the Group’s auditors.
PwC have confirmed in writing their independence and that no 
“prohibited” non-audit services were provided. There were no 
independence issues raised by the FRC when they completed their 
AQR on the Company’s audit in 2016. We remain satisfied, taking 
account also of the views of Internal Audit and the Management, that 
PwC have a robust process for maintaining independence and 
monitoring such compliance in accordance with the FRC’s 2017 
Ethical Standards. In our view, PwC continue to offer an independent, 
professional and cost-effective service that is capable of detecting any 
audit irregularities. Any potential threats to auditor objectivity 
(overfamiliarity, self review etc.) are, we believe, contained by existing 
safeguards. In particular , we are convinced that the objectivity of the 
lead audit engagement partner and audit staff is not impaired. We 
reached this decision on the basis of PwC’s openness to challenge, 
our perception of their proper independence from the Management 
and absence of any material prior year financial restatements.
Internal Audit
The Audit Committee has continued its regular dialogue with 
Internal Audit during 2017. The Audit Committee relies heavily on 
Internal Audit to provide an objective and professionally sceptical view 
of how the Bank is handling a number of key financial and non-
financial reporting and record-keeping tasks. Whilst primary 
responsibility to manage risk always resides with the Management, 
Internal Audit’s role, acting in its capacity as the “third line of 
defence”, is to identify potential problems and recommend ways of 
improving risk management and internal control. The Audit 
Committee meets regularly with the Head of Internal Audit (i.e. the 
Chief Audit Executive (“CAE”)) with no members of the Management 
present during such meetings. The CAE always attends the entirety of 
our Audit Committee meetings. As Chairman of the Audit Committee, 
Nicholas Haag is in at least monthly (and often weekly) contact with 
the CAE, who functionally reports unambiguously to him.
Internal Audit’s Charter has been reviewed and approved in March 
2017. The Audit Committee routinely reviews Internal Audit’s remit 
and annual and rolling 3-year plans, on which it provides feedback 
and authorises any changes to their scope. We provide targets for 
and formal assessment of Internal Audit and ensure that it is 
effective, suitably embedded in the organisation and used and 
respected by the Management. The CAE routinely attends monthly 
Management Board meetings as an observer, makes a formal 
quarterly submission to the Audit Committee and delivers a formal 
status report on its work at every Board meeting as well as providing 
an annual summary Internal Audit report which presents an overall 
assessment of the effectiveness of the governance, risk and control 
framework within the Group and an analysis of themes and trends 
emerging from its work.
The Audit Committee solely determines Internal Audit’s budget and 
compensation including variable bonus payments to the CAE and her 
staff. The Audit Committee is also responsible for supervising the 
annual personal performance assessment of the CAE, drawing on 
input from peers, direct reports and senior members of the 
Management, including the CEO and the CFO.
We are satisfied that Internal Audit has sufficient human and 
financial resources to perform its role and the Audit Committee has, 
where necessary, requested additional funds for them to purchase 
the training and tools necessary to function effectively. The Audit 
Committee requires all Internal Audit executives to attend training 
and to take relevant international (Certified Internal Auditor) exams. 
Recently, the senior team of Internal Audit attended training in 
London at the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors.
In February 2018, the Committee conducted an assessment of the 
Internal Audit function and concluded that the department is 
suitably structured and proactively meets its assurance objectives. 
The quality of the Internal Audit function continues to improve. Our 
internal assessment of Internal Audit suggests that it is already in 
compliance with over 90% of best practice targets established by the 
Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors in its September 2017 
guidance on effective internal audit in the financial services sector 
and we expect to be 100% compliant by the end of 2018. We had 
planned to conduct an External Quality Assessment (“EQA”) of 
Internal Audit in 2017 but decided to delay this until 2018 in order to 
allow time for the merger of Bank Republic to be completed and 
integrated into the Group’s business and to ensure that a valid 
assessment of the combined departments could then be 
meaningfully undertaken. The merger of the two Internal Audit units 
has now been completed satisfactorily and the deputy head of 
internal audit at Bank Republic has joined the Bank as deputy CAE. 
We therefore intend to conduct an EQA of Internal Audit during the 
course of 2018.
We believe that Internal Audit has not only established its 
independence from the Management but feels properly empowered 
and motivated to perform its functions and carry out its duties. 
Internal Audit’s value is recognised by the Management, who have 
proactively requested (with sign off from the Audit Committee) their 
involvement in various projects and investigations.
At the behest of the Audit Committee, we are in the process of 
establishing a new Bank-wide rating system for Internal Audit’s 
audits, whereby we will fine-tune the scoring methodology that the 
latter uses to evaluate the quantum/severity of sampled anomalies 
found in branches and service centres in respect of various 
transactional and lending processes. We will then establish new 
thresholds to rank each of the Bank’s units into categories ranging 
from “good” to “unsatisfactory”. The intention is to establish clearer 
and fairer benchmarks for acceptable levels of identified (and often 
very minor) deficiencies. Internal Audit are also working with the 
Operational Audit department to establish a criticality-based 
hierarchy of processes, which will again determine the scoring 
outcome for different units within the Bank. There will be zero 
tolerance for any unmitigated critical process failures.
In addition to its regular workload, there were a number of one-off 
projects commissioned by the Audit Committee from Internal Audit 
in 2017. For example, we asked Internal Audit to re-validate 
processes around capturing and disclosing related party lending 
within the Group. In 2018, the Audit Committee has requested 
Internal Audit to confirm the adherence of the Bank to its approved 
risk tolerances. We have also asked Internal Audit to work jointly 
with the Risk department to create a more comprehensive Bank-
wide register of risks to ensure we have sufficiently captured and 
recorded all types risks, to which the Bank is exposed. In addition, 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED 155 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report  
Overview
Strategic Report  
Strategy & Performance
Additional Information Financial Statements Governance
we have asked Internal Audit in 2018 to undertake a ‘cultural audit’ 
of the Bank. As non-executive directors of a company, it is often hard 
to understand the prevailing culture at lower levels of an 
organisation yet this often determines the opportunity, incentives 
and pressures for staff, which may lead them to commit dishonest 
acts or to by-pass critical procedures and even to rationalise this 
behaviour. Therefore, the Audit Committee considers that such a 
cultural audit is essential to monitoring behavioural risks presented 
by the Bank’s most valuable asset, its human capital, and confirming 
that employees ‘live’ the ethical values espoused by the Company 
and the wider Group.
The Audit Committee has increasingly organised Internal Audit’s 
plan to be risk-weighted (i.e. investigate the higher risk priorities 
more frequently and in greater depth) and also more flexible, 
allowing it to conduct one-off projects where the Board or the 
Management wish it to undertake special investigations arising from 
situations where the Bank may have heightened vulnerability or has 
been the victim of fraud. While we are still some way from 
automated internal auditing, Internal Audit has invested in specialist 
software, which will enable it to speed up some of its more routine 
tasks, allowing it to concentrate on its most added-value functions. 
Internal Audit must always try to stay ahead of business 
developments in the same way as all other assurance functions and 
it must use the ‘power of data’ to deliver ‘intelligent audit’.
Control Environment
A sound system of internal control contributes to safeguarding the 
best interests of all stakeholders and the Group’s assets and 
liabilities. The Management is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal controls over the capturing, processing 
and reporting of financial information but the Audit Committee has 
responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness of these controls and for 
confirming that they are sufficiently robust to cope with changing 
economic conditions and continued strong growth in the Bank, with 
approximately 7 million branch transactions executed in 2017. We 
evaluate the Management’s identification of fraud risk and 
implementation of anti-fraud measures and supervise investigation of 
any alleged or suspected frauds brought to our attention. We seek to 
establish the right ‘tone at the top’ and to assess whether the Group is 
a high integrity organisation from top to bottom.
 The Audit Committee regularly reviews progress in this vital 
discipline and alerts the CEO, CFO, divisional heads and, if 
necessary, the entire Board where it occasionally sees intractable 
problems and insufficient commitment to continuous process 
improvement. The Audit Committee was pleased to note that in 2017 
there was a further improvement in the rate and speed of 
remediation of identified Internal Audit deficiencies, especially in the 
Group’s Retail segment.
In accordance with our mandate, we have reviewed the robustness 
of the Bank’s controls, working with our External Auditors, our 
Operational Risk department and Internal Audit. In the opinion of the 
Audit Committee, there is a proper system and allocation of 
responsibilities for day-to-day monitoring of financial controls within 
the Group and there have been no significant failings or weaknesses 
during 2017. We have also considered the risk of Management 
override of controls and discussed with PwC their assessment of 
this mandatory significant audit risk. We ensure that the 
remuneration of senior and middle members of the Management is 
calibrated to ensure that they are not incentivised to take unhealthy 
short-term risks to generate personal rewards.
The Audit Committee has had sight of the “management (internal 
control) letter” submitted by our External Auditor and has reviewed 
the Management’s response to it and discussed it directly with PwC. 
We also note that no non-standard representations have been 
requested from or provided to PwC in respect of the “management 
representation letter” signed by the Group’s CEO and CFO. Together 
with the RECC, we have received regular updates from the Chief 
Compliance Officer on the implementation of the Bank’s compliance 
programme, which we consider to be sufficiently robust.
Internal Audit seeks to complete audits of all the Bank’s key 
operating risks on a regular basis and this activity has continued in 
2017. In particular, we tracked very closely all deficiencies, both in 
terms of severity and trend, and scrutinised remediation follow-up 
with historic analyses being carefully maintained. The Bank’s units, 
which showed weaknesses are routinely re-inspected to confirm if 
improvements have been made and the Audit Committee is regularly 
updated on the results of these repeat audits.
The Audit Committee is increasingly holding not only senior 
members of the Management but also middle management 
executives of the Bank accountable for any recurring failures within 
their control. This active enforcement has been endorsed by the 
Board. The Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) in respect of meeting 
control targets and reducing identified audit deficiencies continue to 
be cascaded down to the local level and also included as KPIs for 
members of the Management Board of the Bank. The emphasis is on 
minimising and mitigating high priority process failings that may lead 
to real financial and reputational risk for the Bank and the Group as a 
whole. We agreed in 2017 to roll out governance-type KPIs in 2018 
across branch directors and managers, with a significant double digit 
percentage of their personal variable compensation being dependent 
on the scores their units achieve. By driving this cultural change, we 
believe this will help to diminish operational risk and improve 
behavioural norms. In addition, as noted above, we are in the process 
of establishing a new Internal Audit scoring system that sets clear 
thresholds on what level of ‘failure’ is unacceptable and which 
processes demand zero failure rates.
In 2017, the Audit Committee liaised closely with the RECC to undertake 
a deep-dive into the Operational Risk structures within the Bank, 
working with the new head of this department. One of the conclusions 
of this work was the need for a more streamlined approach to 
managing, investigating and reporting fraud risk events, especially 
given the historic dispersion of responsibilities in this regard.
As a matter of policy, the Audit Committee have sought this year to 
elevate the oversight of all the Bank’s geographic (e.g. TBC Kredit in 
Azerbaijan) and product (e.g. TBC Insurance, TBC Leasing, TBC Pay) 
subsidiaries with additional reporting to central functions, whilst not 
diminishing the authority of subsidiary executives. We have, for 
example, started an initiative to ensure that all best practice policies 
are rolled out universally and ‘policed’ by Internal Audit accordingly.
In 2016 the Bank’s ‘whistleblowing’ or anonymous hotline for staff 
and external entities went live, alerting the Bank to any potentially 
unsatisfactory practices. Arrangements are in place for 
proportionate and independent investigation of all such cases and  156 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
appropriate follow up actions. The Audit Committee reviews each 
reported case on an at least quarterly basis. Our experience over 
2017 has been that many of these cases have been small in scale 
and typically related to breaches of the Group’s behavioural code of 
conduct or have involved low-level disclosure of confidential 
customer information; few have been vexatious and all have been 
worthwhile ‘alarms’. Most importantly, we believe that our 
employees and customers have come to realise that ‘speaking up’ is 
valued and taken seriously.
IT, Cyber-security and Data Protection 
In 2017, the Audit Committee maintained its focus on IT issues, 
especially following the NBG’s request in 2016 that the Bank, as a 
systemic player in the local market, undertake an external IT 
resilience audit which it has passed. Against a backdrop of 
increasingly sophisticated global cyber-attacks, cybersecurity has 
risen towards the top of the Audit Committee’s and the Board’s 
agenda in 2017, not only to protect against risk of immediate losses 
but also to protect against business disruption and reputation risk. 
The Audit Committee has supervised an internal cyber ‘health 
check’ and gap analysis, and concluded that whilst there are areas 
for improvement, the risk environment is satisfactory and that we 
have sufficient prevention, detection and containment practices in 
place. Nevertheless, the Bank has initiated a plan to address certain 
areas for improvement and it is in the process of evaluating the 
availability and cost/benefit of taking out some form of cyber-risk 
insurance policy even though such policies have historically not 
been available for the Georgian market.
Internal Audit has an experienced IT auditor on its staff who has a 
particular specialisation in IT security and we believe that this helps 
to monitor and maintain IT security standards. The Management 
continuously seeks to raise risk standards within the organisation 
requiring almost all employees to pass an IT security awareness test 
covering vital vulnerabilities such as access control. In 2017, the 
Audit Committee also sponsored a review of IT governance within 
the Group, which has being undertaken by a specialist third party 
consultant and seeks primarily to validate the depth of alignment 
between the Group’s business and IT strategies.
The digitisation and collection and use of data is proceeding 
everywhere at an unprecedented rate and organisations face 
significant uncertainty over the extent and pace of regulatory change 
and genuine public integrity and privacy concerns. We are conscious 
that Georgia has just appointed a new data regulator, the office of 
the Personal Data Protection Inspector (“PDP”), who we understand 
are currently working on amendments to the local law in order to 
align it with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). 
It is also possible that the Bank may have to comply to some extent 
with the EU’s GDPR regulations and we are seeking legal advice on 
this but our expectation is, given that the Bank has only limited 
exports of data outside its non-EU operational markets, that the 
GDPR is unlikely to be triggered by the day-to-day operations of the 
Bank and it will be able to ring-fence itself against any breaches of 
these provisions.

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, TBC Bank Group PLC’s consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the consolidated and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the consolidated 
and the parent company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the consolidated financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (“Annual Report”), which comprise: the consolidated 
and separate statements of financial position as at 31 December 2017; the consolidated statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income, 
the consolidated and separate statements of cash flows, and the consolidated and separate statements of changes in equity for the year then 
ended; and the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for these opinions
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
ISAs (UK) are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We confirm that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the 
Group or the parent company.

Materiality
• Overall consolidated materiality: GEL19.7m (2016: GEL 15.8m) based on 5% of profit before tax.
• Overall parent company materiality: GEL 14.7m (2016: GEL 15.8m) based on 1% of total assets.
• Our scoping was driven by legal entity contribution to profit before tax and also by geographical location. 
This approach also ensures that we align our resources with the location of the key financial reporting 
functions and material operations of the Group. We also considered overall coverage in assessing the 
appropriateness of our scoping. Our primary location for scoping purposes is Tbilisi, Georgia.
• The area of focus which was of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial  
statements was:
- Impairment of loans and advances to customers.
There were no key audit matters to report on the audit of the parent company financial statements.
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it operates, and considered 
the risk of acts by the Group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed audit procedures at Group and 
significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than 
the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional 
misrepresentations, or through collusion. 
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
OF TBC BANK GROUP PLC 158 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the Group and parent company financial statements, 
including, but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules, UK tax legislation and the requirements of key regulators such as the 
Financial Conduct Authority in the UK and the National Bank of Georgia for the operations in Georgia. Our tests included, but were not limited to, 
review of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, review of correspondence with the regulators, review of 
correspondence with legal advisors, enquiries of management, and review of internal audit reports in so far as they related to the financial 
statements. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and 
regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether 
there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditor’s professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit;  
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Impairment of loans and advances to customers
Refer to page 175 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies),  
page 181 (Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements in Applying 
Accounting Policies), pages 182 -184 (note 5: New Accounting 
pronouncements), and pages 186 to 192 (note 9: Loans and advances 
to customers).
Impairment provisions are a key judgement representing 
management’s best estimate of the credit losses in the underlying 
loan portfolios. Determination of the appropriate provisions involves 
complex calculations and the effect of misstatement on the financial 
statements could be material.
Loss provisions are calculated on a collective basis for loan portfolios 
with similar characteristics, and this is done mainly using statistical 
models driven by both observable and management determined key 
inputs such as probabilities of default (“PD”) and the loss given
default (“LGD”).
Individual impairment assessment is performed where individually 
significant loans have unique characteristics that require judgement  
at a loan level to determine the present value of expected future cash 
flows and any resulting shortfall.
We have focused our work on the following key areas:
• Completeness of observed impaired loans and appropriateness of 
the assumptions used to estimate impairment events which have 
been incurred but not reported; and
• Calculation of the required impairment provisions based on 
estimated future cash flows, including the use of models and the 
critical assumptions and inputs used in those models.
We understood and evaluated the design of the key controls over  
the impairment processes and tested their operating effectiveness. 
These controls included:
• the governance over the impairment provisioning processes which 
includes review and approval and the review of key assumptions; 
and
• identification by management of impairment events and relevant 
loans showing indicators of impairment including other indicators 
such as forbearance.
We noted no significant exceptions in the design, implementation or 
operating effectiveness of these controls. Accordingly, we relied on 
them for the purposes of our audit. 
We assessed whether the impairment methodology was in line with 
IAS 39 requirements. In addition, we performed the following 
substantive procedures in response to the areas of focus.
We tested a sample of performing loans (including loans on 
management’s watch list) to evaluate whether impairment indicators 
existed as at the balance sheet date. This included evaluating the 
specific circumstances of the borrower, including the latest 
developments, the basis for measuring the impairment provision, and 
whether key judgements were appropriate. We did not identify any 
further impairment events not previously identified by management.
We tested individually significant exposures on a risk basis to assess the 
appropriateness of recorded impairment provisions for the Corporate 
and Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (‘MSME’) portfolios. We 
re-performed management’s impairment calculations, testing key inputs 
such as expected future cash flows and discount rates.
With respect to modelled provisions, we tested key assumptions 
including the PDs and LGDs used in the model calculations. We 
compared provisions against the historical performance and market 
data so as to assess the estimation accuracy of the key models and 
consider completeness of post model adjustments.
Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, we 
found management’s methodology, assumptions and judgements to 
be reasonable.

Strategic Report  
Overview
Strategic Report  
Strategy & Performance
Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
On 1 January 2018, the Group transitioned to the new financial 
instruments accounting standard IFRS 9, which replaced IAS 39.  
The most significant change for the Group under IFRS 9 relates to the 
provisions for impairment which is now on an expected loss basis, 
replacing the incurred loss provisioning under IAS 39. 
In order to meet the requirements of the new standard, significant 
changes have also been made to processes, models and related 
controls with effect from 1 January 2018. The estimated transition 
impact is disclosed in note 5 to the financial statements in accordance 
with IAS 8. The most significant change relates to the provisions for 
impairment, including changes to related systems, processes and 
controls.
IFRS 9 transition impact disclosure
In respect of the estimated impact of the adoption of IFRS 9, we 
understood and critically assessed classification and measurement 
decisions and the impairment models developed by the Group. This 
included using our credit modelling experts in our assessment of 
judgements and assumptions supporting the expected credit loss 
requirements of the new standard. 
We re-performed selected model calculations to confirm the model 
outputs, tested key data inputs and assessed the reasonableness of 
forward looking information incorporated into the impairment 
calculations, in particular, where proxies were adopted due to limited 
data in the market. 
Based on the evidence obtained, we found that the methodologies and 
key data inputs used within the models were appropriate, and that the 
model assumptions and related model outputs were reasonable. We 
also assessed the disclosure of the transition impact and consider 
this reasonable and in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industries in which the Group operates. 
TBC Bank Group’s banking and insurance activities are primarily carried out in Georgia, with small subsidiary operations in four other countries. 
The Group’s business activities comprise of 4 segments for which it manages and reports its operating results and financial position, namely 
Retail Banking, Corporate Banking, Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (‘MSME’), and the Corporate Centre. 
JSC TBC Bank is the largest subsidiary of the London listed Group. Its main operations are Retail and Commercial banking, with a small general 
leasing and insurance business, with all significant operations based in Georgia. Accounting functions and management of the Group are 
primarily based in Georgia, which represents 98% of the Group assets and 96% of profit before tax. We performed audit procedures over this 
component which is considered financially significant in the context of the Group, using a materiality of GEL 18.7m. We also performed other 
audit procedures including testing information technology general controls and other relevant controls related to financial reporting, to mitigate 
the risk of material misstatement.
Our audit approach and team was also designed to reflect the structure of the Group, and we therefore used component auditors in PwC Georgia, 
all of whom are familiar with the relevant businesses in their geographical locations, to audit the relevant component that was in scope for the 
Group audit. As part of the planning and execution of the audit, the UK audit team visited the significant component in Georgia on several 
occasions, in order to ensure that the procedures performed to support the Group audit were sufficient for our purposes. Specific audit 
procedures were also performed at the UK parent company, mainly related to the presentation of the Group financial statements, the 
consolidation process, taxation and elements of laws and regulation specific to the UK. Based on the procedures we performed over the reporting 
units our audit scoping/coverage accounted for 96% of revenue and 98% of total assets of the Group.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the 
individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
 Consolidated financial statements Parent company financial statements
Overall materiality GEL 19.7m (2016: GEL 15.8m) GEL 14.7m (2016: GEL 15.8m)
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax. 1% of total assets
Rationale for  
benchmark applied
We believe that profit before tax is the primary measure 
used by the shareholders in assessing the performance 
of the consolidated Group, and is a generally accepted 
auditing benchmark.
The parent company is a holding company with 
investments in the trading companies within the Group. 
The parent company’s performance is measured based 
on the valuation of these investments, and therefore total 
assets is considered an appropriate materiality 
benchmark. 160 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
OF TBC BANK GROUP PLC CONTINUED
For the component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The materiality 
allocated was GEL18.7m (2016: GEL 15.5m).
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 940,000 GEL (Group audit) 
(2016: 790,000 GEL) and 740,000 GEL (Parent company audit) (2016: 790,000 GEL) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our 
view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in respect of 
the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements and the directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and the 
parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least twelve months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to. However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s and parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to Going Concern in accordance 
with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. 
The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to 
conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on 
the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.  
We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 
have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs (UK) and 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below (required by 
ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated). 161 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report  
Overview

Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit,  
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 111 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on pages 111 - 112 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in 
scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking 
that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering 
whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment 
obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 113, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and parent company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and parent company obtained in 
the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 151 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a 
relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on pages 112 - 113, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors 
are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 162 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
OF TBC BANK GROUP PLC CONTINUED
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
We were appointed by the Audit Committee on 11 August 2016 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016. We were 
reappointed by the members at the Annual General Meeting on 5 June 2017 following the recommendation by the Audit Committee to audit the 
year ended 31 December 2017. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 2 years, covering the years ended 31 December 2016 to 31 
December 2017.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
31 DECEMBER 2017
1 Introduction
Principal activity. JSC TBC Bank (hereafter the “Bank”) was incorporated on 17 December 1992 and is domiciled in Georgia. The Bank is a joint 
stock company limited by shares and was set up in accordance with Georgian regulations. 
The Bank’s principal business activity is universal banking operations that include corporate, small and medium enterprises (“SME”), retail and

On 1 June 2016, TBC Bank Group PLC (“TBCG”), a public limited liability company, incorporated in England and Wales on 26 February 2016, 
launched the Tender Offer (the “Tender Offer”) to exchange its entire ordinary share capital for an equivalent number of the Bank’s ordinary 
shares and thus to acquire the entire issued share capital, including those shares represented by Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”), of the 
Bank. Following the successful completion of the Tender Offer on 4 August 2016, as of 31 December 2017 TBCG holds 98.67% of the share capital 
of the Bank, thus representing the Bank’s ultimate parent company. Together with the Bank and subsidiaries, TBCG makes up a group of

2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the separate financial statements of TBC Bank Group PLC, have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, as modified by the revaluation of premises, available-for-sale financial assets, the initial recognition of financial instruments based 
on fair value and identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination measured at their fair values at the acquisition 
date and financial instruments categorised as at fair value through profit or loss. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of 
the consolidated and separate financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, 
unless otherwise stated (refer to Note 3).
Going Concern. The Board of Directors of TBC Bank Group PLC has prepared these financial statements on a going concern basis. In making  
this judgement the management considered the Group’s financial position, current intentions, profitability of operations and access to financial 
resources. The management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
Consolidated financial statements. Subsidiaries are those investees, including structured entities, that the Group controls because it (i) has 
power to direct relevant activities of the investees that significantly affect their returns, (ii) has exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investees, and (iii) has the ability to use its power over the investees to affect the amount of investor’s returns. The existence 
and effect of substantive rights, including substantive potential voting rights, are considered when assessing whether the Group has power over 
another entity. For a right to be substantive, the holder must have practical ability to exercise that right when decisions about the direction of the 
relevant activities of the investee need to be made. The Group may have power over an investee even when it holds less than the majority of voting 
power in it. In such a case, the Group assesses the size of its voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders 
to determine if it has de-facto power over the investee. Protective rights of other investors, such as those that relate to fundamental changes of 
investee’s activities or apply only in exceptional circumstances, do not prevent the Group from controlling an investee. Subsidiaries are 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group, and are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases. 
Subsidiaries and associates. The TBC Bank Group PCL holds 98.67% of the Bank as of 31 December 2017. The consolidated financial statements

Business Combinations and Goodwill. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
at the fair value of the consideration, including contingent consideration, given at the date of exchange. Acquisition-related costs are recognised as an 
expense in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed 
in a business combination are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
The Group measures the non-controlling interest that represents the current ownership’s interest and entitles the holder to a proportionate 
share of net assets in the event of liquidation on a transaction by transaction basis, either at: (a) fair value, or (b) the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of net assets of the acquired entity. Non-controlling interests that are not present ownership interests are measured at 
fair value.
Goodwill is measured by deducting the acquiree’s net assets from the aggregate of the consideration transferred for the acquiree, the amount  
of non-controlling interest in the acquiree and fair value of an interest in the acquiree held immediately before the acquisition date. Any negative 
amount (“negative goodwill”) is recognised in profit or loss, after the management reassesses whether it identified all the assets acquired and all 
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, and reviews appropriateness of their measurement.
The consideration transferred for the acquiree is measured at the fair value of the assets given up, equity instruments issued and liabilities 
incurred or assumed, including fair value of assets or liabilities from contingent consideration arrangements, but excludes acquisition related 
costs such as advisory, legal, valuation and similar professional services.
Transaction costs incurred for issuing equity instruments are deducted from the equity; transaction costs incurred for issuing debt are deducted 
from its carrying amount and all other transaction costs associated with the acquisition are expensed.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated; unrealised losses are 
also eliminated unless the cost cannot be recovered. The Bank and all of its subsidiaries use uniform accounting policies consistent with the 
Group’s policies.
Non-controlling interest is that part of the net results and of the equity of a subsidiary attributable to interests that are not owned, directly or 
indirectly, by the Bank. Non-controlling interest forms a separate component of the Group’s equity.
Associates. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence (directly or indirectly), but not control, generally accompanying 
a shareholding of between 20 and 50 percent of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of 
accounting, and are initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition less accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. Dividends received from associates reduce the carrying value of the investments in associates. Other post-acquisition 
changes in Group’s share of net assets of an associate are recognised as follows: (i) the Group’s share of profits or losses of associates is 
recorded in the consolidated profit or loss for the year as share of result of associates, (ii) the Group’s share of other comprehensive income is 
recognised in other comprehensive income and presented separately, (iii); all other changes in the Group’s share of the carrying value of net 
assets of associates are recognised in profit or loss within the share of result of associates. However, when the Group’s share of losses in an 
associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, 
unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates; 
unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 173 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 
Disposals of subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures. When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest  
in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying 
amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any 
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of 
the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recycled to profit or loss. 
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
Financial instruments – key measurement terms. Depending on their classification financial instruments are carried at fair value, cost, or 
amortised cost as described below.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date. The best evidence of fair value is the price in an active market. An active market is one in which transactions for the 
asset or the liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The fair value of financial 
instruments traded in an active market is measured as the product of the quoted price for the individual asset or liability and the quantity owned 
by the entity. This is the case even if a market’s normal daily trading volume is not sufficient to absorb the quantity held and placing orders to sell 
the position in a single transaction might affect the quoted price.
A portfolio of financial derivatives or other financial assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market is measured at the fair value of  
a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the price that would be received to sell a net long position (ie an asset) for a 
particular risk exposure or paid to transfer a net short position (ie a liability) for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. This is applicable for assets carried at fair value on a recurring basis in case the Group: (a) manages 
the group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the entity’s net exposure to a particular market risk (or risks) or to the credit 
risk of a particular counterparty in accordance with the entity’s documented risk management or investment strategy; (b) it provides information 
on that basis about the group of assets and liabilities to the entity’s key management personnel; and (c) the market risks, including duration of the 
entity’s exposure to a particular market risk (or risks) arising from the financial assets and financial liabilities is substantially the same.
Valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or models based on recent arm’s length transactions or consideration of financial 
data of the investees are used to measure the fair value of certain financial instruments for which external market pricing information is not 
available. Fair value measurements are analysed by level in the fair value hierarchy as follows: (i) level one are measurements at quoted prices 
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (ii) level two measurements are valuations techniques with all material inputs 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and (iii) level three measurements 
are valuations not solely based on observable market data (that is, the measurement requires significant unobservable inputs). Transfers 
between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the end of the reporting period. Refer to Note 42.
Cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of the other consideration given to acquire an asset at the time of its 
acquisition and includes transaction costs. Measurement at cost is only applicable to investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted 
market price and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured and derivatives that are linked to and must be settled by the delivery of such 
unquoted equity instruments. Refer to Note 10.
Transaction costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial instrument. An incremental 
cost is one that would not have incurred if the transaction had not taken place. Transaction costs include fees and commissions paid to agents 
(including employees acting as selling agents), advisors, brokers and dealers, levies by regulatory agencies and securities exchanges, and transfer 
taxes and duties. Transaction costs do not include debt premiums or discounts, financing costs or internal administrative or holding costs.
Amortised cost is the amount at which the financial instrument was recognised at initial recognition less any principal repayments, plus accrued 
interest, and for financial assets less any write-down for incurred impairment losses. Accrued interest includes the amortisation of transaction 
costs deferred at initial recognition and of any premium or discount to maturity amount using the effective interest method. Accrued interest 
income and accrued interest expense, including both accrued coupon and amortised discount or premium (including fees deferred at origination, 
if any), are not presented separately and are included in the carrying values of related items in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The effective interest method is a method of allocating interest income or interest expense over the relevant period so as to achieve a constant 
periodic rate of interest (effective interest rate) on the carrying amount. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash payments or receipts (excluding future credit losses) through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period,  
if appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial instrument. The effective interest rate discounts cash flows of variable interest 
instruments to the next interest repricing date, except for the premium or discount which reflects the credit spread over the floating rate 
specified in the instrument, or other variables that are not reset to market rates. Such premiums or discounts are amortised over the whole 
expected life of the instrument. The present value calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an 
integral part of the effective interest rate (refer to income and expense recognition policy).  174 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
31 DECEMBER 2017
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 
Initial recognition of financial instruments. Trading securities, derivatives and other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are 
initially recorded at fair value. All other financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value plus the transaction costs. Fair value at initial 
recognition is best evidenced by the transaction price. A gain or a loss on initial recognition is only recorded if there is a difference between the 
fair value and the transaction price which can be evidenced by other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or by a 
valuation technique whose inputs include only data from observable markets.
All purchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery within the time frame set by regulation or market convention (“regular way” 
purchases and sales) are recorded at trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to deliver a financial asset. All other purchases are 
recognised when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Derecognition of financial assets. The Group derecognises financial assets when (a) the assets are redeemed or the rights to cash flows from  
the assets otherwise expired or (b) the Group has transferred the rights to the cash flows from the financial assets or entered into a qualifying 
pass-through arrangement while (i) also transferring substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets or (ii) neither transferring 
nor retaining substantially all risks and rewards of ownership but not retaining control. Control is retained if the counterparty does not have the 
practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party without needing to impose additional restrictions on the sale.
Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are items which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from the National Bank of Georgia (NBG), excluding 
mandatory reserves, and all interbank placements and interbank receivables with original maturities of less than three months. Funds restricted for a 
period of more than three months on origination are excluded from cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised cost.
The payments or receipts presented in the statement of cash flows represent the Group’s transfers of cash and cash equivalents, including 
amounts charged or credited to current accounts of the Group’s counterparties held with the Group, such as loan interest income or principal 
collected by charging the customer’s current account or interest payments or disbursement of loans credited to the customer’s current account, 
which represent cash or cash equivalent from the customer’s perspective.
Mandatory cash balances with the National Bank of Georgia. Mandatory cash balances with the NBG are carried at amortised cost and represent 
mandatory reserve deposits that are not available to finance the Group’s day to day operations. Hence they are not considered as part of cash and 
cash equivalents for the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Investment securities available for sale. This classification includes investment securities which the Group intends to hold for an indefinite 
period of time and which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices. The Group 
classifies investments as available for sale at the time of purchase.
Investment securities available for sale are carried at fair value. Interest income on available for sale debt securities is calculated using the 
effective interest method and recognised in profit or loss for the year. Dividends on available for sale equity instruments are recognised in profit 
or loss for the year when the Group’s right to receive payment is established and it is probable that the dividends will be collected. All other 
elements of changes in the fair value are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”) until the investment is derecognised or impaired,  
at which time the cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from OCI to profit or loss. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss when 
incurred as a result of one or more events (“loss events”) arising after the initial recognition of investment securities available for sale.
A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an equity security below its cost is an indicator that it is impaired. The cumulative 
impairment loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that asset 
previously recognised in profit or loss – is removed from equity and reclassified from OCI. Impairment losses on equity instruments are not 
reversed through profit or loss. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and the 
increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss is 
reversed through the current period’s profit or loss for the year.
Sale and repurchase agreements. Sale and repurchase agreements (“repo agreements”), which effectively provide a lender’s return to the 
counterparty, are treated as secured financing transactions. The lender provides funds to the borrower and receives security as collateral. 
Securities sold under such sale and repurchase agreements are not derecognised. The securities are not reclassified in the statement of 
financial position unless the transferee has, by contract, the right or custom to sell or repledge the securities, in which case they are reclassified 
as repurchase receivables. The corresponding liability is presented within amounts due to credit institutions. The repurchase agreements are 
short-term in nature. Available for sale securities or bonds carried at amortised cost reclassified to repurchase receivables continue to be carried 
at fair value or amortised cost respectively in accordance with the accounting policies for these categories of assets.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell (“reverse repo agreements”), which effectively provide a lender’s return to the Group, are 
recorded as due from other banks or loans and advances to customers, as appropriate. The difference between the sale and repurchase price  
is treated as interest income and accrued over the life of repo agreements using the effective interest rate method.  175 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Due from other banks. Amounts due from other banks are recorded when the Group advances money to counterparty banks with original 
maturity of more than three months and with no intention of trading the resulting unquoted non-derivative receivable due on fixed or 
determinable dates. Amounts due from other banks are carried at amortised cost. 
Loans and advances to customers. Loans and advances to customers are recorded when the Group advances money to purchase or originate an 
unquoted non-derivative receivable from a customer due on fixed or determinable dates and has no intention of trading the receivable. Loans and 
advances to customers are carried at amortised cost.
When financial assets are renegotiated and the renegotiated terms and conditions differ substantially from the previous terms, financial asset  
is derecognised and the new asset is initially recognised at its fair value.
Bonds carried at amortised cost. Investment securities that the Group intends to hold for an indefinite period and that may be sold in response  
to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices have been classified as available for sale investments in the 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014. In 2015 the Group has reassessed its intention with regard to some of the securities 
under this category and has identified certain investments that the Group has both the intention and ability to hold to maturity. Due to the fact 
that transactions for such securities do not take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
the securities are not considered to be quoted in an active market and were reclassified to loans and receivables rather than held to maturity 
investments. These securities are presented in the balance sheet under caption bonds carried at amortised cost.
When an available for sale financial asset with fixed maturity is reclassified to loans and receivables, the fair value of the financial asset on that 
date becomes its new amortised cost. Any previous gain or loss on that asset that has been recognised directly in other comprehensive income  
is amortised to profit and loss over the investment’s remaining life using the effective interest method.
Impairment of financial assets carried at amortised cost. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss when incurred as a result of one or 
more events (“loss events”) that happened after the initial recognition of the financial asset and which have an impact on the amount or timing of the 
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. The Group classifies its borrowers as 
significant and non-significant ones for impairment allowance estimation purposes and assesses for impairment individually or collectively. 
Specific qualitative and quantitative events are outlined for evidence of impairment of individually and collectively assessed borrowers in order to 
ensure that loss event is identified as early as possible. 
If there is evidence that an impairment loss event on significant credit exposures has been incurred, the Bank assesses the borrowers on an individual 
basis and measures the amount of the loss as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash 
flows discounted by the exposure’s original effective interest rate for fixed rate loans or current effective interest rate for variable rate loans. The Bank 
considers two types of sources for recoveries: cash recoveries and/or collateral recovery. For cash recoveries the estimated recoverable amount is 
equal to the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Collateral recoveries reflect the cash flows that may result from collateral foreclosure. 
The Bank uses its best estimates to assess future recoveries, applying scenario analysis and taking into account all relevant information available at 
the reporting date including adverse changes in general macroeconomic environment or the industry the borrower operates in.
If the Group determines that there is no objective evidence that an individually assessed financial asset incurred in impairment whether 
significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for 
impairment. For collective assessment purposes exposures are grouped into a homogenous risk pools based on similar credit risk 
characteristics. Common credit risk characteristics of the group include but are not limited to: type of counterparty (individual vs. business),  
type of product, past-due status of the exposure, restructuring status and type of collateral. 
In order to calculate impairment allowance for collectively assessed loans pools, the Bank estimates the following risk parameters: probability  
of default, cure rate, recovery rate, survival rate and loss given default, based on historical experience. In case of a change in either the internal 
or external environment and historical data no longer reflect the current situation, the Bank adjusts risk parameters on the basis of current 
observable data to reflect the effects of present conditions that did not affect past periods, and to remove the effects of past conditions that do  
no longer exist. 
If the terms of an impaired financial asset held at amortised cost are renegotiated or otherwise modified because of financial difficulties of the 
borrower or issuer, impairment is measured using the original effective interest rate before the modification of terms.
The Bank reverses previously recognised impairment loss if, once identified, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease is 
related to an objective event. The previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account through profit or loss.  
In order to reverse provisions for individually significant borrowers there should be objective evidence that the borrowers’ financial standing has 
improved or there is improvement in collateral coverage. For collectively assessed loans the Bank applies the notion of “quarantine period” 
defined as period necessary for an exposure to satisfy performing loans criteria’s in order to be reclassified in a performing loans pool.  176 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Repossessed collateral. Repossessed collateral represents non-financial assets acquired by the Group to settle overdue loans. The assets are 
initially recognised at fair value when acquired and included in premises and equipment, investment property or inventories within other assets 
depending on their nature and the Group’s intention in respect of recovery of these assets and are subsequently remeasured and accounted for in 
accordance with the accounting policies for these categories of assets. Inventories of repossessed assets are recorded at the lower of cost or net 
realisable value.
Credit related commitments. The Group enters into credit related commitments, including letters of credit and financial guarantees. Financial 
guarantees represent irrevocable assurances to make payments in the event that a customer cannot meet its obligations to third parties and 
carry the same credit risk as loans. Financial guarantees and commitments to provide a loan are initially recognised at their fair value, which is 
normally evidenced by the amount of fees received. This amount is amortised on a straight line basis over the life of the commitments, except for 
those to originate loans if it is probable that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement and does not expect to sell the resulting loan 
shortly after origination; Such loan commitment fees are deferred and included in the carrying value of the loan on initial recognition. At the end 
of each reporting period, the commitments are measured at the higher of (i) the unamortised balance of the amount at initial recognition and 
(ii) the best estimate of expenditure required to settle the commitment at the end of each reporting period.
Performance guarantees are contracts that provide compensation if another party fails to perform a contractual obligation. Such contracts do 
not transfer credit risk. Performance guarantees are recorded off-balance sheet at initiation. Fee income is recognised as earned over the 
lifetime of a respective contract. At the end of each reporting period, the provision for performance guarantee contracts are measured at the best 
estimate of expenditure required to settle the contract at the end of each reporting period, discounted to present value if the discounting effect 
is material.
The Bank has the contractual right to revert to its customer for recovering amounts paid to settle the performance guarantee contracts. Such 
amounts are recognised as loans and receivables.
Goodwill. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. The Group tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and 
whenever there are indications that goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating 
units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Such units or group of units represent the lowest level at 
which the Group monitors goodwill, and are not larger than an operating segment. Gains or losses on disposal of an operation within a cash 
generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated include the carrying amount of goodwill associated with the disposed operation. This is 
generally measured on the basis of the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit which is retained. 
Premises and equipment. Premises and equipment, except for land, buildings and construction in progress, are stated at cost, less accumulated 
depreciation and provision for impairment, where required. Cost of premises and equipment of acquired subsidiaries is the estimated fair value 
at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, land, buildings and construction in progress are carried at a revalued amount, being the fair value at the date of 
revaluation, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Revaluations are performed 
frequently enough to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair values at the end 
of reporting period.
Any revaluation surplus is credited to the revaluation reserve for premises and equipment included in equity, except to the extent that it reverses 
a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. In this case the increase is recognised in profit or loss to the 
extent of the decrease previously charged. A revaluation deficit is recognised in profit or loss, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous 
surplus on the same asset is recognised in other comprehensive income and reduces revaluation reserve for premises and equipment 
accumulated in equity. 
Depreciation on revalued buildings is charged to profit or loss. Upon disposal of revalued property, any revaluation reserve relating to the 
particular asset being sold or retired is transferred to retained earnings. 
Costs of minor repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred. Costs of replacing major parts or components of premises and equipment 
items are capitalised and the replaced part is retired.
If impaired, premises and equipment are written down to the higher of their value in use and fair value less costs to sell. The decrease in carrying 
amount is charged to profit or loss to the extent it exceeds the previous revaluation surplus in equity. An impairment loss recognised for an asset 
in prior years is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s value in use or fair value less costs to sell.
Gains and losses on disposals determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount are recognised in profit or loss.  177 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 
Depreciation. Land and construction in progress are not depreciated. Depreciation on other items of premises and equipment is calculated using 
the straight-line method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows: 
Premises    30 – 100 years;
Furniture and fixtures  5 – 8 years; 
Computers and office equipment 3 – 8 years;
Motor vehicles   4 – 5 years; 
Other equipment   2 – 10 years; and 
Leasehold improvements  The term of the underlying lease or if not defined, not more than 7 years.
The residual value of an asset is the estimated amount that the Group would currently obtain from disposal of the asset less the estimated costs 
of disposal, if the asset was already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life. The residual value of an asset is nil if the 
Group expects to use the asset until the end of its physical life. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if 
appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Investment property. Investment property is property that the Groups owns to earn rental income or for capital appreciation, or both, and that it 
does not occupy. 
Investment property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment, where required. It is amortised on a straight 
line basis over an expected useful life of 30 to 50 years. In case of any indication that the investment properties may be impaired, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount as the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell. The carrying amount of an investment property  
is written down to its recoverable amount through a charge to profit or loss for the year. An impairment loss recognised in prior years is reversed 
if there has been a subsequent change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount. 
Land included in investment property is not depreciated. Depreciation on other items of investment properties is calculated using the straight-
line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives of 30 to 50 years. Residual values of investment 
properties are estimated to be nil.
Earned rental income is recorded in profit or loss for the year within other operating income.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the 
expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. 
Intangible assets. All of the Group’s intangible assets have definite useful life and primarily include capitalised computer software and licenses. 
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. All other 
costs associated with computer software, eg its maintenance, are expensed when incurred. Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line 
basis over expected useful lives of 2 to 15 years.
Finance lease receivables (Investment in finance lease). Where the Group is a lessor in a lease that substantially transfers all risks and rewards 
incidental to ownership to the lessee, the assets leased out are presented as investments in finance leases and carried at the present value of the future 
lease payments. Investments in finance leases are initially recognised at commencement (when the lease term begins) using a discount rate determined 
at inception (the early date of the lease agreement and the date of commitment by the parties to the principal provisions of the lease).
The difference between the gross receivable and the present value represents unearned finance income. This income is recognised over the term 
of the lease using the net investment method (before tax), which reflects a constant periodic rate of return. Incremental costs directly attributable 
to negotiating and arranging the lease are included in the initial measurement of the finance lease receivable and reduce the amount of income 
recognised over the lease term. Finance income from leases is recorded within interest income in the profit or loss.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss when incurred as a result of one or more events (“loss events”) that took place after the initial 
recognition of investments in leases. The Group uses the same principal criteria to determine that there is objective evidence that an impairment 
loss has occurred as for loans carried at amortised costs disclosed earlier in this note. Impairment losses are recognised through an allowance 
account to write down the receivables’ net carrying amount to the present value of expected cash flows (which exclude future credit losses that 
have not been incurred) discounted at the interest rates implicit in the finance leases. The estimated future cash flows reflect the cash flows that 
may result from obtaining and selling the assets subject to the lease.
Receivables from terminated leases. The company recognises receivables from terminated contracts at the moment of lease contract 
termination. These receivables are recognised at amount comprising difference between fair value of repossessed assets and outstanding 
balance of net investment in finance lease. Receivables are accounted for at amortised cost less impairment. 178 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Prepayment for purchase of leasing assets. Prepayment for purchase of leasing assets comprises of interest bearing advance payments made 
to purchase assets for transfer into leases. Such advances are accounted for at amortised cost less impairment. On commencement of the 
leases, advances towards lease contracts are transferred into net investment in finance lease.
Insurance and reinsurance receivables. Insurance and reinsurance receivables are recognised based on insurance policy terms and measured 
at cost. The carrying value of insurance and reinsurance receivables is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable, with any impairment loss recorded in the consolidated statement of income. Reinsurance 
receivables primarily include balances due from both insurance and reinsurance companies for ceded insurance liabilities. Insurance premiums 
are recognised as revenue (earned premiums) proportionally over the period of coverage of respective insurance contracts. Premiums are shown 
before deduction of commission and are gross of any taxes or duties levied on premiums. Amounts due to reinsurers are estimated in a manner 
consistent with the associated reinsured policies and in accordance with the reinsurance contract. Premiums ceded and claims reimbursed are 
presented on a gross basis. 
An impairment review is performed on all reinsurance assets when an indication of impairment occurs. Reinsurance receivables are impaired only if there 
is objective evidence that the Group may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract that this can be measured reliably.
Liability adequacy test. Liability adequacy tests are performed at each balance sheet date to ensure the adequacy of recognised insurance 
liabilities net of related deferred acquisition costs. In performing the tests, current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, claims 
handling and administration costs in respect of claims, as well as investment income from assets backing such liabilities, are used. Where 
tests highlight a deficiency, insurance liabilities are increased with any deficiency being recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Due to credit institutions. Amount due to credit institutions are recorded when counterparty banks advance money or other assets to the Group. 
The non-derivative liability is carried at amortised cost. If the Group purchases its own debt, it is removed from the consolidated statement of 
financial position and the difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the consideration paid is included in gains or losses arising 
from retirement of debt.
Customer accounts. Customer accounts are non-derivative liabilities to individuals, state or corporate customers and are carried at amortised cost. 
Subordinated debt. Subordinated debt includes long-term non-derivative liabilities to international financial institutions and is carried at amortised cost. 
The repayment of subordinated debt ranks after all other creditors in case of liquidation and is included in the Bank’s “Tier 2” capital. 
Debt securities in issue. Debt securities in issue include promissory notes, bonds, certificates of deposit and debentures issued by the Group. 
Debt securities are stated at amortised cost. If the Group purchases its own debt securities in issue, they are removed from the consolidated 
statement of financial position and the difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the consideration paid is included in gains 
arising from retirement of debt.
Derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange contracts, interest rate futures, forward rate 
agreements, currency and interest rate swaps, currency and interest rate options are carried at their fair value. The Group also enters into 
offsetting deposits with its counterparty banks to exchange currencies. Such deposits, while legally separate, are aggregated and accounted for 
as a single derivative financial instrument (currency swap) on a net basis where (i) the deposits are entered into at the same time and in 
contemplation of one another, (ii) they have the same counterparty, (iii) they relate to the same risk, and (iv) there is no apparent business 
purpose for structuring the transactions separately that could not also have been accomplished in a single transaction. 
All derivative instruments are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value 
of derivative instruments are included in profit or loss. The Group does not apply hedge accounting.
Certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments are treated as separate derivative instruments when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract. 
Income taxes. Income taxes are provided in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the legislation enacted or substantively 
enacted by the end of reporting period in the respective territories that the Bank and its subsidiaries operate. The income tax charge/credit 
comprises of current tax and deferred tax and is recognised in profit or loss except if it is recognised directly in other comprehensive income 
because it relates to transactions that are also recognised, in the same or a different period, directly in other comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the amount expected-to-be-paid to or recovered from the tax authorities in respect of taxable profits or losses for the current and 
prior periods. Taxable profits or losses are based on estimates if consolidated financial statements are authorised prior to filing relevant tax 
returns. Taxes, other than on income, are recorded within administrative and other operating expenses. 179 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Deferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method for tax loss carry forwards and temporary differences arising between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. In accordance with the initial recognition 
exemption, deferred taxes are not recorded for temporary differences on initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction other than a 
business combination if the transaction, when initially recorded, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are not 
recorded for temporary differences on initial recognition of goodwill and subsequently for goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes. 
Deferred tax balances are measured at tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of reporting period that are expected to apply to the 
extent of time when the temporary differences will reverse or the tax loss carry forwards will be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
netted only within the individual companies of the Group. Deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry forwards are 
recorded only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductions can be utilised. 
Deferred income tax is provided on post-acquisition retained earnings of subsidiaries, except where the Group controls the subsidiary’s dividend 
policy and it is probable that the difference will not reverse through dividends or otherwise in the foreseeable future.
Uncertain tax positions. The Group’s uncertain tax positions are reassessed by the management at the end of each reporting period. Liabilities 
are recorded for income tax positions that are determined by the management as more likely than not to result in additional taxes being levied if 
the positions were to be challenged by the tax authorities. The assessment is based on the interpretation of tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of reporting period and any known Court or other rulings on such issues. Liabilities for penalties, interest and 
taxes other than on income are recognised based on the management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligations at the 
end of the reporting period. 
Provisions for liabilities and charges. Provisions for liabilities and charges are non-financial liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. They are 
accrued when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. 
Share capital. Ordinary shares with discretionary dividends are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new 
shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the 
par value of shares issued is recorded as share premium in equity.
Dividends. Dividends are recorded in equity in the period in which they are declared. Any dividends declared after the end of the reporting period 
and before the consolidated financial statements are authorised for issue, are disclosed in the subsequent events note. 
Income and expense recognition. Interest income and expense are recorded for all debt instruments on an accrual basis using the effective 
interest method. As part of interest income or expense this method defers all fees paid or received between the parties to the contract that are an 
integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. 
Fees integral to the effective interest rate include origination fees received or paid by the entity relating to the creation or acquisition of a financial 
asset or issuance of a financial liability, for example fees for evaluating creditworthiness, evaluating and recording guarantees or collateral, 
negotiating the terms of the instrument and for processing transaction documents. Commitment fees received by the Group to originate loans at 
market interest rates are integral to the effective interest rate if it is probable that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement and does 
not expect to sell the resulting loan shortly after origination. The Group does not designate loan commitments as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss.
When loans and other debt instruments become doubtful of collection, they are written down to present value of expected cash inflows and 
interest income is thereafter recorded for the unwinding of the present value discount based on the asset’s effective interest rate that was used to 
measure the impairment loss.
All other fees, commissions and other income and expense items are generally recorded on an accrual basis by reference to completion of the 
specific transaction assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided.
Commissions and fees arising from negotiating, or participating in the negotiation of a transaction for a third party, such as the acquisition of loans, 
shares or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses, that are earned on execution of the underlying transaction are recorded on its 
completion. Portfolio and other management advisory and service fees are recognised based on the applicable service contracts, usually on a 
time-proportion basis. Asset management fees related to investment funds are recorded rateably over the period the service is provided. The same 
principle is applied for wealth management, financial planning and custody services that are continuously provided over an extended period of time.
Foreign currency translation. The Group’s presentation currency is the Georgian Lari. TBCG’s and the Bank’s functional currency is the Georgian 
Lari. The functional currency of each of the Group’s consolidated entities is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency, converted at the rate of exchange ruling at the date 
of the transaction. 180 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
31 DECEMBER 2017
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into each entity’s functional currency at the official exchange rate of the territories where the Bank 
and its subsidiaries operate, at the respective reporting period. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions 
and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities into each entity’s functional currency at year-end official exchange rates are 
recognised in profit or loss. Translation at year-end rates does not apply to non-monetary items, including equity investments. The effects of 
exchange rate changes on the fair value of equity securities are recorded as part of the fair value gain or loss. 
The results and financial position of each group entity (the functional currency of none of which is a currency of a hyperinflationary economy) are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows: 
i. assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the end of the respective 
reporting period; 
ii. income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect 
of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); 
iii. components of equity are translated at the historic rate; and 
iv. all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
After losing control over a foreign operation, the exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to 
profit or loss for the year as part of the gain or loss on disposal. On partial disposal of a subsidiary without loss of control, the related portion of 
accumulated currency translation differences is reclassified to non-controlling interest within equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate. At 31 December 2017 the closing rate of exchange used for translating foreign currency balances was GBP 1 = 
3.5005 (2016: GBP 1 = GEL 3.2579; 2015: GBP 1 = GEL 3.5492); USD 1 = 2.5922 (2016: USD 1 = GEL 2.6468; 2015: USD 1 = GEL 2.3949); EUR 1 = 
3.1044 (2016: EUR 1 = GEL 2.7940; 2015: EUR 1 = GEL 2.6169). 
Offsetting. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated statement of financial position only when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to either settle on a net basis, or to realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Staff costs and related contributions. Wages, salaries, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits as well as the 
cash settled part of the share based payment schemes are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the 
Group’s employees. 
Earnings per share. Earnings per share (“EPS”) are determined by dividing the profit or loss attributable to owners of the Bank by the weighted 
average number of participating shares outstanding during the reporting year. 
Diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to 
assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. In calculating diluted EPS, non-vested ordinary shares are treated as outstanding on 
the grant date.
Segment reporting. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Group’s chief operating 
decision maker. Segments whose revenue, result or assets are ten percent or more of all the segments are reported separately.
Share based payments. A share-based payment arrangement is an agreement between the entity and another party (including an employee) that 
entitles the other party to receive cash or other assets of the entity for amounts that are based on the price (or value) of equity instruments (including 
shares or share options) of the entity or another group entity, or equity instruments (including shares or share options) of the entity or another group 
entity, provided the specified vesting conditions, if any, are met. Under the share-based compensation plan the Group receives services from the 
management as consideration for equity instruments of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the equity 
instruments is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by the reference to the fair value of the equity instruments 
granted, excluding the impact of any non-market service and performance vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in the 
assumptions about the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest. The total amount expensed is recognised over the vesting period, which is 
the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number 
of equity instruments that are expected to vest based on the non-marketing vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision of original 
estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Increase in equity on accrued shares resulting from the equity settled 
scheme is accounted for under share based payment reserve. Upon meeting vesting conditions, share based payment reserve attributable to the vested 
shares is transferred to share capital and share premium. When portions of a single grant vest on two or more dates the entity applies graded vesting for 
accounting of share based payment arrangement. Vesting period of each tranche of the grant ends when the employee owns the shares with no further 
service restrictions. Under graded vesting scheme the expense for earlier years is higher than for later years. Each tranche is expensed over its own 
service period with a credit entry being equity. 181 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

3 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements in Applying Accounting Policies
The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates 
and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on the management’s experience and other factors, including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The management also makes certain judgements, apart from those involving 
estimations, in the process of applying the accounting policies. Judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in 
the consolidated financial statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year include:
Impairment losses on loans and advances and finance lease receivables. The Group regularly reviews its loan portfolio and finance lease 
receivables to assess impairment. In determining whether an impairment loss should be recorded in the statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income, the Group concludes whether there is, or not, any observable data indicating a measurable decrease in the estimated 
future cash flows from a portfolio of loans or finance lease receivables before the decrease can be identified with an individual loan in that 
portfolio. This evidence may include observable data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers in a 
group, or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in the group. When scheduling future cash flows the 
management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics. The methodology and 
assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss 
estimates and actual loss experience. A 5% increase or decrease between actual loss experience and the loss estimates used will result in an 
additional or lower charge for loan loss impairment of GEL 11,393 thousand (2016: GEL 11,251 thousand; 2015: GEL 9,707 thousand) and 
additional charge for impairment of finance lease receivables of GEL 63 thousand (2016: GEL 57 thousand; 2015: GEL 37 thousand), respectively.
Impairment provisions for individually significant loans and leases are based on the estimate of discounted future cash flows of the individual 
loans and leases taking into account repayments and realisation of any assets held as collateral against the loan or the lease. A 5% increase or 
decrease in the actual future discounted cash flows from individually significant loans which could arise from a mixture of differences in amounts 
and timing of the cash flows will result in an additional or lower charge for loan loss provision of GEL 1,454 thousand (2016: GEL 2,701 thousand; 
2015: GEL 3,677 thousand), respectively. A 5% increase or decrease in the actual future discounted cash flows from individually significant leases 
which could arise from a mixture of differences in amounts and timing of the cash flows will result in an additional or lower charge for provision 
of GEL 14 thousand (2016: GEL 9 thousand; 2015: GEL 2 thousand), respectively.
Fair value of financial instruments. Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the consolidated statement of 
financial position cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of 
mathematical models. The inputs to these models employ observable market data. However, certain financial instruments are valued on the 
basis of valuation techniques featuring one or more significant market inputs that are unobservable, and for them the measurement of fair value 
is more judgemental.
Tax legislation. The Group is subject to corporate income taxes in several jurisdictions and the calculation of the Group’s tax charge and 
provisions for corporate income taxes necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement. Refer to Note 34.
4 Adoption of New or Revised Standards and Interpretations 
The adopted accounting policies are consistent with those of the previous financial year. There were no new or amended standards or 
interpretations that resulted in a change of the accounting policy. The new disclosures are included in Note 35 in accordance with Disclosure 
Initiative – Amendments to IAS 7 (issued on 29 January 2016 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017). 182 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Minor amendments to IFRSs
The IASB has published a number of minor amendments some of which has not yet been endorsed for use in the EU. The Group has not early 
adopted any of the amendments effective after 31 December 2017 and it expects they will have an insignificant effect, when adopted, on the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group and the separate financial statements of TBC Bank Group PLC.
Major new IFRSs
The IASB has published IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”, IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and IFRS 16 “Leases”, which have 
been endorsed for use in the EU.
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement” (amended in July 2014 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018). Key features of the new standard are:
• Financial assets are required to be classified into three measurement categories: (i) those to be measured subsequently at amortised cost, (ii) 
those to be measured subsequently at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and (iii) those to be measured subsequently at 
fair value through profit or loss (FVPL); 
• The classification for debt instruments is driven by the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and whether the contractual 
cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). If a debt instrument is held to collect, it may be carried at amortised 
cost if it also meets the SPPI requirement. Debt instruments in line with the SPPI requirement that are held in a portfolio where an entity both 
holds to collect assets’ cash flows and sells assets may be classified as FVOCI. Financial assets that do not contain cash flows that are SPPI 
must be measured at FVPL (for example, derivatives). Embedded derivatives are no longer separated from financial assets but will be 
included in assessing the SPPI condition;
• Investments in equity instruments are always measured at fair value. However, the management can make an irrevocable election to present 
changes in fair value in other comprehensive income, provided the instrument is not held for trading. If the equity instrument is held for 
trading, changes in fair value are presented in profit or loss;
• Most of the requirements in IAS 39 for classification and measurement of financial liabilities were carried forward unchanged to IFRS 9. The 
key difference is that an entity will be required to present the effects of changes in own credit risk of financial liabilities designated at fair 
value through profit or loss in other comprehensive income; 
• IFRS 9 introduces a new model for the recognition of impairment losses – the expected credit losses (ECL) model. There is a “three stage” 
approach which is based on the change in credit quality of financial assets since initial recognition. In practice, the new rules mean that 
entities will have to record an immediate loss equal to the 12-month ECL on initial recognition of financial assets that are not credit impaired 
(or lifetime ECL for trade receivables). In case of a significant increase in credit risk, impairment is measured using lifetime ECL rather than 
12-month ECL. The model includes operational simplifications for lease and trade receivables;
• Hedge accounting requirements were amended to align more closely the accounting with the risk management. The standard provides 
entities with an accounting policy choice between applying the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 and continuing to apply IAS 39 to all 
hedges because the standard currently does not address accounting for macro hedging.
Based on an analysis of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 December 2017 and on the basis of the facts and 
circumstances that exist at that date, the Management of the Group estimated the impact of GEL 63,734 thousand on its consolidated financial 
statements from the adoption of the new standard on 1 January 2018. The Group plans to use modified retrospective approach and anticipated 
impact of adoption will result in the decrease to shareholders’ equity.
IFRS 9 does not have any impact on Bank’s regulatory capital and capital adequacy ratios, which are calculated using local regulatory 
accounting standards. 183 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

guarantees resulting in 63.7 million increase in total provision level.
No significant changes are expected for financial liabilities.
Impairment of financial assets 
Per IFRS 9 impairment methodology, the Bank classifies its portfolio into three stages: 
• Stage I – assets for which no significant increase of credit risk since initial recognition is identified; 
• Stage II – assets for which significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition is identified;
• Stage III – credit-impaired exposures.
For stage I exposures the Bank creates 12 months expected credit losses, whereas for stage II and stage III lifetime expected credit losses are created. 
The key impact of IFRS 9 comes from Stage II classification and incorporation of forward looking information in allowance calculation. 
For the Stage II classification purposes the Bank applies both quantitative and the qualitative criteria including, but not limited to: 
• 30 DPD overdue;
• downgrade of the risk category of the borrower since initial recognition;
• deterioration of the probability of default parameter above the predefined threshold.
Under IFRS 9 methodology the Bank updated its default definition criteria as well in order to make it consistent with the Bank’s internal 
guidelines. Updated default definition includes criteria such as: (i) 90 DPD overdue, and (ii) other criteria indicating the borrower’s unlikeness to 
repay the liabilities. For Corporate and SME business borrowers the Bank applies borrower based default definition. As for the retail and macro 
segments facility level default definition is utilised with additional pulling effect criteria being applied.  184 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
31 DECEMBER 2017
5 New Accounting Pronouncements continued
Another significant driver of IFRS 9 impact on allowance level is incorporation of the forward looking information (FLI). The Bank incorporates 
forward looking information for both individual and collective assessment. For FLI purposes the Bank defines three scenarios, which are: 
• baseline (most likely);
• upside (better than most likely);
• downside (worse than most likely).
The Bank derives the baseline macro scenario and takes into account projections from various external sources – the National Bank of Georgia, 
Ministry of Finance, IMF as well as other IFIs, to ensure the alignment to the consensus market expectations. Upside and downside scenarios are 
defined based on the framework developed by the Bank’s macroeconomic unit. 
The Bank calculates expected impairment losses for each scenario. In order to come up with the final expected credit loss figures the bank 
applies probability weighted average approach where probabilities of each scenario are used as weights. 
The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature and 
extent of the Group’s disclosures about its financial instruments particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard.
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (issued on 28 May 2014 and effective for the periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). 
The new standard introduces the core principle that revenue must be recognised when the goods or services are transferred to the customer , at the 
transaction price. Any bundled goods or services that are distinct must be separately recognised, and any discounts or rebates on the contract price must 
generally be allocated to the separate elements. When the consideration varies for any reason, minimum amounts must be recognised if they are not at 
significant risk of reversal. Costs incurred to secure contracts with customers have to be capitalised and amortised over the period when the benefits of 
the contract are consumed. No material effect is expected on the Group due to introduction of the new standard. 
IFRS 16, Leases (issued on 13 January 2016 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019). The new standard sets out the 
principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. All leases result in the lessee obtaining the right to use an asset 
at the start of the lease and, if lease payments are made over time, also to access financing. Accordingly, IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of 
leases as either operating leases or finance leases as is required by IAS 17 and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Lessees will 
be required to recognise: (a) assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value; and 
(b) depreciation of lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the income statement. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor 
accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for 
those two types of leases differently. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its financial statements.
IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts” (issued on 18 May 2017 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021). IFRS 17 
replaces IFRS 4, which has given companies dispensation to carry on accounting for insurance contracts using existing practices. As a 
consequence, it was difficult for investors to compare and contrast the financial performance of otherwise similar insurance companies. IFRS 17 
is a single principle-based standard to account for all types of insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts that an insurer holds. The 
standard requires recognition and measurement of groups of insurance contracts at: (i) a risk-adjusted present value of the future cash flows (the 
fulfilment cash flows) that incorporates all of the available information about the fulfilment cash flows in a way that is consistent with observable 
market information; plus (if this value is a liability) or minus (if this value is an asset); (ii) an amount representing the unearned profit in the group 
of contracts (the contractual service margin). Insurers will be recognising the profit from a group of insurance contracts over the period they 
provide insurance coverage, and as they are released from risk. If a group of contracts is or becomes loss-making, an entity will be recognising 
the loss immediately The Group is currently assessing the impact of the interpretation on its financial statements.
IFRIC 22 “Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration” (issued on 8 December 2016 and effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018). This interpretation considers how to determine the date of the transaction when applying the standard on foreign 
currency transactions, IAS 21. The interpretation applies where an entity either pays or received consideration in advance for foreign 
currency-denominated contracts. The interpretation specifies that the date of transaction is the date on which the entity initially recognises the 
non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration. If there are multiple payments or 
receipts in advance, the Interpretation requires an entity to determine the date of transaction for each payment or receipt of advance 
consideration. No material effect is expected on the Group due to introduction of the new standard.
IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments” (issued on 7 June 2017 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2019). IAS 12 specifies how to account for current and deferred tax, but not how to reflect the effects of uncertainty. The interpretation clarifies 
how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. An entity should 
determine whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments based on 
which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. An entity should assume that a taxation authority will examine amounts it has a 
right to examine and have full knowledge of all related information when making those examinations. If an entity concludes it is not probable that 
the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of uncertainty will be reflected in determining the related taxable profit or  185 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

loss, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates, by using either the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on 
which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. An entity will reflect the effect of a change in facts and 
circumstances or of new information that affects the judgments or estimates required by the interpretation as a change in accounting estimate. 
Examples of changes in facts and circumstances or new information that can result in the reassessment of a judgment or estimate include, but 
are not limited to, examinations or actions by a taxation authority, changes in rules established by a taxation authority or the expiry of a taxation 
authority’s right to examine or reexamine a tax treatment. The absence of agreement or disagreement by a taxation authority with a tax 
treatment, in isolation, is unlikely to constitute a change in facts and circumstances or new information that affects the judgments and estimates 
required by the Interpretation. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the interpretation on its financial statements.

of amounts due from other banks. Interest rate analysis of due from other banks is disclosed in Note 36.
8 Mandatory cash balances with the National Bank of Georgia
Mandatory cash balances with the National Bank of Georgia (“NBG”) represent amounts deposited with the NBG. Resident financial institutions 
are required to maintain an interest-earning obligatory reserve with the NBG, the amount of which depends on the level of funds attracted by the 
financial institutions. The Group earned up to 5.0%, 0.6% and (0.4%) annual interest in GEL, USD and EUR respectively on mandatory reserve with 
NBG in 2017 (2016: 5.0%, 0.0% and (0.4%) in GEL, USD and EUR respectively). The Group did not earn annual interest on the mandatory reserve 
with the NBG for year ended 31 December 2015.
In September 2017 Fitch Ratings reaffirmed Georgia’s long-term foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at “BB-” with Stable 
Outlooks. The issue ratings on Georgia’s senior unsecured foreign- and local-currency bonds are also affirmed at “BB-”. The Country Ceiling is 
affirmed at “BB" and the Short-term foreign-currency IDR at “B".

Following the merger of Bank Republic with TBC Bank, the Group has reassessed its definition of segments as disclosed in Note 28. Some of the 
clients were reallocated to different segments. Relevant changes are applied to all periods presented in this report, except for the profit and loss 
items for the year ended 31 December 2015, as recalculation was impracticable. Therefore provision movement for the year ended 31 December 
2015 is per old segmentation and contains re-segmentation effect line to adjust opening provision levels for 1 January 2016. Balance sheet 
amounts as at 31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015 are comparable. As per current report, micro and SME loans are combined in one MSME 
category. Consumer loans include all retail loans, except mortgage loans. 187 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Loans and advances to customers written off in 2016 included loans to customers in the gross amount of GEL 9,830 thousand issued in 2016, a 
previously issued performance guarantee of GEL 0.14 thousand which was transformed into loan in 2016 and GEL 64,735 thousand issued in 
previous years.
At year-end 2016 the Bank updated its methodology for loan loss provisioning purposes to include impairment assessment of acquired portfolios. 
As per the upgraded methodology, an impairment allowance is not created on the initial recognition of purchased portfolio considering that 
expected losses are reflected in fair value of the portfolio. For the next reporting periods, the impairment allowance is recognised if the incurred 
losses at the reporting date have increased compared to the level of incurred losses at the moment of acquisition.
The Bank applies updated provisioning methodology since year-end 2015. The updated methodology enables the Bank to assess impairment 
allowances in an accurate manner, given granular segmentation of the portfolio and the various risk parameters applied. 
The credit portfolio is assessed for impairment on an individual and collective basis. For provisioning purposes, borrowers or groups of borrowers 
are classified as “significant” or “non-significant”. Borrowers with total liabilities of GEL 2 million or more are regarded as significant and 
assessed individually for impairment. In order to calculate the impairment allowance for collectively assessed loan pools, the certain risk 
parameters are estimated, based on various statistical models. 
Following the merger of Constanta Bank with TBC Bank, the Group has reassessed the segment definition as disclosed in Note 28. A few clients 
were reallocated to different segments. Relevant changes in the provision groups are highlighted in the table above under “Post-merger 
classification effect”. 188 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

In 2016, the Group reassessed the allocation of loans into the economic sectors. The Group has revised the sector split for 2015 in order to make 
it consistent with 2016 and 2017.
 
As of 31 December 2017 the Group had 142 borrowers (2016: 112 borrowers; 2015: 84 borrowers) with aggregated gross loan amounts above GEL 
5,000 thousand. The total aggregated amount of these loans was GEL 2,437,750 thousand (2016: GEL 1,900,916 thousand; 2015: GEL 1,378,892 
thousand) or 28.5% of the gross loan portfolio (2016: 25.8%; 2015: 29.7%). 189 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The retail segment in Note 28 includes the following classes from the above tables: consumer and mortgage.
The Group applied the portfolio provisioning methodology prescribed by IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and it 
created portfolio provisions for impairment losses that were incurred but have not been specifically identified with any individual loan by the end 
of reporting period.
The tables above provide an analysis of the loan portfolio based on credit quality. The Group’s policy for credit risk management purposes is to 
classify each loan as “neither past due nor impaired”, “past due but not impaired”, “individually assessed impaired loans” and “collectively 
assessed impaired loans”. The pool of “neither past due nor impaired loans” includes exposures that are not overdue and are not classified as 
impaired. “Past due but not impaired” loans include overdue performing loans but with no objective evidence of impairment identified. The 
classification includes as well triggered loans that are not impaired because the current value of the expected cash and collateral recoveries are 
sufficient for full repayment. “Individually assessed impaired loans” include exposures which were assessed for impairment on an individual 
basis, and an ad-hoc impairment allowance was created. “Collectively assessed impaired loans” include exposures for which objective evidence 
of impairment was identified and the respective collective impairment allowance was created. The Group conducts collective assessment of the 
borrowers on a monthly basis. As for the individual assessment, it is performed quarterly. 192 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The amount and type of collateral required depend on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty. There are three key types of collateral:
• Real estate;
• Movable property including fixed assets, inventory and precious metals;
• Financial assets including deposits, stocks, and third party guarantees.
The financial effect of collateral is presented by disclosing the collateral values separately for (i) those assets where collateral and other credit 
enhancements are equal to or exceed the assets’ carrying value (“over-collateralised assets”) and (ii) those assets where collateral and other 
credit enhancements are less than the assets’ carrying value (“under-collateralised assets”).

The effect of collateral is determined by comparing the fair value of collateral to outstanding gross loans and advances in the reporting date.
At the central level a specific unit manages collateral to ensure that they serve as an adequate mitigation for credit risk management purposes. 
In line with the Group’s internal policies, collateral provided to loans are evaluated by the Internal Appraisal Group (external reviewers are used in 
case of loans to related parties or specific cases when complex objects are appraised). The Internal Appraisal Group is part of the collateral 
management unit and, in order to ensure adequate and objective appraisal procedures, it is independent from the loan granting process. Real 
estate collateral of significant value is reevaluated annually by internal appraisers. Statistical methods are used to monitor the value of real 
estate collateral that are of non-significant value and other types of collaterals such as movable assets and precious metals.
Collateral values include the contractual price of third-party guarantees, which, due to their nature, are capped at the loan’s carrying value. The 
values of third-party guarantees in the tables above amounted to GEL 527,498 thousand, GEL 608,058 thousand and GEL 358,907 thousand as of 
31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. These third-party guarantees are not taken into consideration when assessing the impairment 
allowance. Refer to Note 42 for the estimated fair value of each class of loans and advances to customers. Interest rate analysis of loans and 
advances to customers is disclosed in Note 36. Information on related party balances is disclosed in Note 44. 193 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Impaired receivables include receivables on terminated leases and other receivables for which impairment provision was assessed individually. A 
receivable’s overdue status is a primary factor for the Group to consider a receivable as impaired. Receivables on terminated leases individually 
determined to be impaired are under-collateralised and their estimated fair value of collateral amounts to GEL 1,206 thousand (2016: GEL 2,039 
thousand; 2015: GEL 1,253 thousand). The remaining assets are not collateralised.

The Group applied the portfolio provisioning methodology prescribed by IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and 
created portfolio provisions for impairment losses that were incurred but have not been specifically identified with any individual lease by the 
reporting date. The Group’s policy is to classify each lease as “neither past due nor impaired” until specific objective evidence of impairment of 
the lease is identified. The primary factors taken into account to consider whether or not a lease is impaired are the deterioration of the lessee’s 
financial position, its overdue status, and liquidity of the leased asset.
The Group normally structures its finance lease contracts so that the lessee makes a minimum prepayment of 20% of the equipment purchase 
price at the inception of the lease term. The Group holds title to the leased assets during the lease term. The title to the asset under the finance 
lease contract is transferred to the lessees at the end of the contracts terms, including full repayment of lease payments. Generally the lease 
terms are up to five years.
The amount and type of collateral required depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty.  The main types of collateral 
obtained are:
• Leased assets (inventory and equipment);
• Down payment;
• Real estate properties;
• Third party guarantees.
The financial effect of collateral is presented by disclosing the collateral values separately for (i) those assets where collateral and other credit 
enhancements are equal to or exceed the assets’ carrying value (“over-collateralised assets”) and (ii) those assets where collateral and other 
credit enhancements are less than the assets’ carrying value (“under-collateralised assets”).

Inventories of repossessed collateral represent real estate assets and equipment acquired by the Group in settlement of impaired loans, other 
than those classified as investment property or premises and equipment. The Group expects to dispose these assets in the foreseeable future. 
Such assets are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at lower of cost and net realisable value. In 2017, collateral 
repossessed for settlement of impaired loans amounted to GEL 53 million (2016: GEL 39 million; 2015: GEL 34 million). 
With regards to certain inventories of repossessed collaterals, the Group has granted previous owners a right to repurchase the inventories at 
prices equal to or higher than the carrying value of the loan at the date of repossession. This right is usually effective for a period of 6 to 18 
months from the date of repossession, during this time the Group is obliged not to dispose of the repossessed collateral to third parties. As of 
31 December 2017, the carrying value of the inventories of repossessed collateral subjected to the repurchase agreement was GEL 11,170 
thousand (2016: GEL 20,342 thousand; 2015: GEL 23,639 thousand). 200 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Construction in progress consists of construction and refurbishment of branch premises and the Bank’s new headquarters. Upon completion, 
assets are to be transferred to premises. 
Premises were revalued to market value on 30 September 2015. The valuation was carried out by an independent firm of valuators which holds a 
recognised and relevant professional qualification and who have recent experience in valuation of assets of similar location and category. In the 
process of comparison, they have used three comparative analogues (registered sale and/or offer for sale), in which prices were applied 
adjustments based on the difference between subject assets and analogues. Most of the assets have been estimated by using the market 
approach/method due to the market situation, namely by existence of a sufficient number of registered sales and proposals by the date of 
valuation. At acquisition date valuation of Bank Republic’s assets has been performed. Fair value of respective assets disclosure is below.
The management considers that the fair value has not changed significantly between 30 September 2015 and 31 December 2017.

* Due to Bank Republic merger in 2017, carrying amount of goodwill was allocated across multiple CGUs of the Bank, that is also equal to the operating and reporting segments.
The recoverable amount of each CGU was determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections based 
on financial budgets approved by the management covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using 
the estimated growth rates stated below.
Assumptions used for value-in-use calculations to which the recoverable amount is most sensitive were:

Pre-tax discount rate 18.15% p.a. 19.50% p.a. –
** Assumptions related to JSC Bank Republic are similar for all related CGUs.
The management determined the budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its market expectations. The weighted average 
growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in the industry reports. The discount rates reflect specific risks related to the 
relevant CGUs.
If the revised estimated pre-tax discount rate applied to the discounted cash flows of CGU Bank Republic Retail had been 10 percentage points 
higher than the management’s estimates, the Group would not need to reduce the carrying value of either goodwill or carrying value of net assets 
of the CGU. Recoverable amount of Bank Republic Retail CGU exceeds its carrying amount by GEL 781,330 thousand. The CGU's carrying amount 
would equal its value in use at a discount rate of 29.92% p.a. 204 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

21 Provisions for Performance Guarantees, Credit Related Commitments and Liabilities and Charges continued
For letter of credits and guarantees allowance estimation purposes the Bank classifies borrowers as significant and non-significant ones. 
Triggered significant guarantees and letter of credits are assessed for impairment on an individual basis, whereas for not triggered significant 
and all non-significant ones the Bank estimates allowances applying statistical risk parameters, such as credit conversion factor and loss 
given default.
Undrawn credit lines are classified as committed and uncommitted exposures, with impairment allowance created for committed ones. The 
undrawn part of the credit lines is multiplied by the respective credit conversion factor and provisioned in the similar manner as corresponding 
on balance sheet exposures.
Provisions for liabilities, charges, performance guarantees and credit related commitments are primarily expected to be utilised within twelve 
months after the year-end.
Additions less releases recorded in profit or loss for “Other” provisions does not include gross change in total reserves for insurance claims in 
amount of GEL 1,621 thousands (2016: GEL 318 thousand) that are included in net claims incurred. Additions less releases recorded in profit or 
loss for provision for impairment of credit related commitments include provision for insurance receivables in the amount of GEL 542 thousand 
that are included in charges less releases recorded in profit or loss for “Other” provision.

On 4 March 2014, Shareholders of the Bank approved the spilt of the ordinary shares 250-for-1 and authorised the issue of additional 
10,445,387 shares. 
In June 2014, 19,684,322 shares of the Bank were sold in the form of Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs") on the London Stock Exchange (the 
“LSE") pursuant to an initial public offering to institutional investors. 7,692,308 shares in the form of GDRs were sold by the Bank while the 
balance was sold by the selling shareholders. Bank of New York (“BNY") acted as a depositary of these shares. Each GDR represented 1 ordinary 
share of the Bank.
On 4 August 2016, the Group completed the Tender Offer under which 49,159,880 of the Bank’s shares then outstanding or 98.21%, were 
converted into 49,159,880 shares of TBC Bank Group PLC (Note 1). 
As of 31 December 2017 the total authorised number of ordinary shares was 52,931,867 shares (31 December 2016: 52,166,703 shares; 
31 December 2015: 49,529,463 shares). Each share has a nominal value of one British Penny (31 December 2015: GEL 0.4 per share). All issued 
ordinary shares are fully paid and entitled to dividends.
Following the Admission (Note 1), TBCG's Directors undertook a reduction of capital in order to create distributable reserves for TBCG. The 
original difference between the fair value of the Bank’s shares and the nominal value of TBCG's shares was credited to the merger reserve 
created in connection with the Tender Offer. Each TBCG share had an original (Tender Offer) nominal value of GBP 5.00 and the minimum 
premium amount required by the Company Act 2006 of GEL 565,030 thousand was transferred to share premium. Following the capital cut the 
nominal value of TBCG shares was reduced to GBP 0.01. The capital cut created a new reserve on the statement of TBCG's financial position 
(comprising of the reduction of the original nominal value from GBP 5.00 to GBP 0.01 per share) amounting to GEL 745,637 thousand. The 
reduction represents a legal and accounting adjustment and did not, in itself, have any direct impact on TBCG shares’ market value. As a result of 
the reduction, the Group’s total additional paid-in capital outstanding at the time became distributable to the shareholders and was fully 
reclassified to retained earnings.
These transactions were treated as a reorganisation of an existing entity that has not changed the substance of the reporting entity. The 
consolidated financial statements of TBCG are presented using the values from the consolidated financial statements of JSC TBC Bank. On the 
date that TBCG became the new parent of the Group, the statutory amounts of share capital and share premium of the Company have been 
recognised through an adjustment in the Statement of Changes in Equity under the heading “Change of parent company to TBCG". The resulting 
difference has been recognised as a component of equity under the heading ‘‘Group reorganisation reserve’’.
On 5 June 2017, at the annual general meeting TBC Bank Group PLC's shareholders agreed on a dividend of GEL 1.42 per share, based on the 
2016 audited financial statements. The dividend was recorded on 9 June 2017 and on 14 July 2017 shareholders received the payment of the total 
GEL 74,809 dividends.  210 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

On 25 April 2016, at the annual general meeting JSC TBC Bank’s shareholders agreed on a dividend of GEL 1.09 per share, based on the 2015 
audited financial statements. The dividend was recorded on 3 May 2016 and on 11 May 2016 shareholders received the payment of the total 
GEL 54,560 thousand dividends. 
On 19 May 2015, at the annual general meeting JSC TBC Bank’s shareholders agreed on a dividend of GEL 0.79 per share, based on the 2014 
audited financial statements. The dividend was recorded on 26 May 2015 and on 2 June 2015 shareholders received the payment of the total 
GEL 39,128 thousand dividends.
26 Share Based Payments
June 2013 arrangement:
In June 2013, the Bank’s Supervisory Board approved a new management compensation scheme for the years 2013 - 2015 and authorised a 
maximum of 4,150 new shares to be issued in accordance with the scheme. The authorised number of new shares has increased to 1,037,500 in 
order to reflect the share split 250-for-1 approved by the shareholders on 4 March 2014. According to the scheme, each year, (subject to 
predefined performance conditions) a certain number of shares were awarded to the top management and some of the middle managers of 
the Group.
The performance evaluation is divided into (i) team goals and (ii) individual performance indicators. The total number of the shares to be awarded 
(legally transferred) depends on meeting the team goals and the book value per share according to the audited IFRS consolidated financial 
statements of the Group for the year preceding the award date. The team goals primarily focus on meeting the target for growth, profitability and 
portfolio quality metrics set by the Supervisory Board as well as compliance with certain regulatory requirements. The total number of shares in 
the bonus pool depends on achieving the team goals. Individual performance indicators are defined on an individual basis and are used to 
calculate the number of shares to be awarded to each employee out of the total bonus pool. Once awarded, these shares carry service conditions 
and, before those conditions are met, are eligible to dividends. However, they do not carry voting rights and cannot be sold or transferred to third 
parties. Service conditions foresee continuous employment until the gradual transfer of the full title to the scheme participants is complete. 
Shares for each of the 2013, 2014 and 2015 tranche gradually ran over on the second, third and fourth year following the performance appraisal. 
Eighty percent of the shares were vested in the fourth year after being awarded. Under this compensation system the total vesting period extends 
to June 2019. 
Under the new management compensation scheme, both shareholders and Supervisory Board hold put options on the shares to be awarded. In 
addition, they both hold put options on all bonus shares awarded under the previous share based payment arrangements. All the put options 
became null and void upon the listing on the LSE in June 2014. At no point of the operation of the share based payment scheme did the 
management expect the put options to be exercised. Consequently, the scheme was accounted for as equity-settled scheme and no obligation 
was recognised for the put-options.
In 2013 the Group considered 20 June as the grant date. Based on the management’s expectation of performance and service conditions, 732,000 
shares have been granted and will be gradually awarded to the members of the described scheme. An external evaluator assessed the fair value 
per share at the grant date at GEL 13.93 adjusted for the effect of 250-for-1 share split Income and market approaches were applied for the 
evaluation. The market approach involved an estimate of the market capitalisation to book value of equity multiple and deal price to book value of 
equity multiple for comparable banks. When selecting comparable banks, the appraiser chose lenders operating in the Black Sea region and 
Central and Eastern Europe with a portfolio mix and growth priorities similar to TBC Bank. The income approach involved discounting free cash 
flows to equity estimated over a 10-year horizon. When developing the projections, the following major assumptions were made:
• Over the 2013 - 2023 periods, the compound annual growth rate was assumed at 15.2% for loans and at 15.1% for customer accounts;
• The spread on the Bank’s customer business was assumed to gradually decline from an estimated 10.2% in 2013 to stabilize at 5.8% by 2021;
• Over 2013 - 2023 period, non-interest income was forecast to average 1.8% of customer volume (ie gross loans and deposits);
• Year-on-year growth in various components of employee’s compensation was assumed at 37.6% - 56.0% in 2014, 2.4% - 9.8% in 2015 and was 
then assumed to gradually decline to 2.1% - 3.6% in 2023. Year-on-year growth in administrative expenses was assumed at 38.3% in 2014, 
10.4% in 2015 and to gradually decline to 3.3% in 2023;
• The Bank’s terminal value was estimated using the Gordon growth model, applying US long-term inflation forecast (2.1%) as the Bank’s 
terminal cash flows growth rate; 
• Bank’s cost of equity was estimated at 15.10%. 
The final valuation was based on the income approach and the market one was used to check the results obtained by the former. The calculated 
value of Bank’s equity was then divided by the number of ordinary shares issued as of date and further reduced with the discount for lack 
of control.  211 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

June 2015 arrangement:
In June 2015, the Bank’s Supervisory Board approved a new management compensation scheme for the top and middle management and it 
accordingly authorised the issue of a maximum 3,115,890 new shares. The new system will be enforced from 2015 through 2018, replacing the 
system introduced in June 2013 – the performance evaluation as well as the respective compensation for 2015 year-end results will be paid 
under the new system. According to the scheme, each year, subject to predefined performance conditions, a certain number of shares will be 
awarded to the Group’s top managers and most of the middle ones. The performance features key performance indicators (KPIs) divided into 
(i) corporate and (ii) individual. The corporate KPIs are mainly related to achieving profitability, efficiency, and portfolio quality metrics set by the 
Supervisory Board as well as non-financial indicators with regards to customers’ experience and employees’ engagement. The individual 
performance indicators are set on an individual basis and are used to calculate the number of shares to be awarded to each employee. According 
to the scheme, members of top management will also receive the fixed number of shares. Once awarded, all shares carry service conditions and, 
before those conditions are met, are eligible to dividends; however they do not carry voting rights and cannot be sold or transferred to 
third parties.
Service conditions foresee continuous employment until the gradual transfer of the full title to the scheme participants is complete. Shares for 
each of the 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 tranche gradually ran over on the second, third and fourth year following the performance appraisal. Eighty 
percent of the shares were vested in the fourth year after being awarded. Under this compensation system the total vesting period extends to 
March 2022. 
In 2015 the Group considered 17 June as the grant date. Based on the management’s estimate of reached targets, as of 31 December 2015 
1,908,960 shares were granted. The shares will be gradually awarded to the members as per the described scheme. At the grant date the fair 
value amounted to GEL 24.64 per share, as quoted on the London Stock Exchange.
Following the listing on the Premium segment of the London Stock Exchange, the share-based payment scheme was updated, and TBC Bank 
Group PLC distributes its shares to the scheme’s participants. The shares’ value is recharged to the JSC TBC Bank. As a result, the accounting of 
the scheme did not change in the consolidated financial statements. 
The Bank also pays personal income tax on behalf of equity settled scheme beneficiaries, which is accounted as cash settled part. Tabular 
information on both of the schemes is given below:

Staff costs related to equity settled part of the share based payment schemes are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis 
over the vesting period of each relevant tranche and corresponding entry is credited to share based payment reserve in equity.
On 31 December 2017 based on level of achievement of key performance indicators the management has reassessed the number of shares that 
will have to be issued to the participants of the share based payment system and decreased estimated number of shares to vest by 13,100 (31 
December 2016: 11,904 shares; 31 December 2015: 75,016 shares). 212 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

28 Segment Analysis
The Management Board (the “Board) is the chief operating decision maker and it reviews the Group’s internal reporting in order to assess the 
performance and to allocate resources. Following the merger of Bank Republic with TBC Bank, the Group has reassessed its definition of 
segments as disclosed in this note. Some of the clients were reallocated to different segments. As per current report, micro and SME loans are 
combined in one MSME category. Consumer loans include all retail loans, except mortgage loans. Comparative information as of 31 December 
2016 has been updated respectively. Comparative information as of 31 December 2015 has not been updated due to impracticability.
The operating segments according to the new definition are now determined as follows:
• Corporate – all business customers with an annual revenue of GEL 8.0 million or more or who have been granted a loan in an amount 
equivalent to USD 1.5 million or more. Some other business customers may also be assigned to the Corporate segment on a 
discretionary basis;
• Micro, small and medium enterprises – all business customers who are not included in Corporate segment. Some other customers may also 
be assigned to the MSME segment on a discretionary basis;
• Retail – all individual customers not included in the other categories;
• Corporate Centre and Other Operations – comprises of the Treasury, other support and back office functions, and non-banking subsidiaries of 
the Group.
For the profit and loss items for the year ended 31 December 2015 the recalculation was impracticable. The operating segments for the year 
ended 31 December 2015 are as follows:
• Corporate – business customers with an annual revenue of GEL 8.0 million or more or who have been granted a loan in an amount equivalent 
to USD 1.5 million or more. Some other significant legal entity customers may also be assigned to the corporate segment on a discretionary 
basis; for example clients that the Group assessed as having strong growth potential;
• Micro, small and medium enterprises – all business customers who are not included in Corporate segment. Some other customers may also 
be assigned to the MSME segment on a discretionary basis;
• Retail – all individual customers of the Group as well as customers that have been granted gold-pawn loans;
• Corporate Centre and Other Operations – comprises of the Treasury, other support and back office functions, and non-banking subsidiaries of 
the Group.
Statement of financial position amounts as at 31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015 are comparable.
The Board of Directors assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of adjusted profit before income tax.  213 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

banks, credit unions, insurance organisations, microfinance organisations and pawnshops) until that profit is distributed in a form of dividend or 
other forms of profit distributions. Once dividend is paid, 15% income tax is payable at the moment of the dividend payment, regardless of 
whether in monetary or non-monetary form, to the foreign non-resident legal entities and foreign and domestic individuals. The dividends paid 
out to the resident legal entities are tax exempted. Apart from dividends’ distribution, the tax is still payable on expenses or other payments 
incurred not related to economic activities, free delivery of goods/services and/or transfer of funds and representation costs that exceed the 
maximum amount determined by the Income Tax Code of Georgia, in the same month they are incurred.
As of 31 December 2017, deferred tax assets/liabilities are remeasured to the amounts that are estimated to be utilised in the period from 1 
January 2018 to 31 December 2018. 221 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

In the context of the Group’s current structure and Georgian tax legislation, tax losses and current tax assets of different group companies may 
not be offset against current tax liabilities and taxable profits of other group companies and, accordingly, taxes may accrue even where there is a 
consolidated tax loss. Therefore, deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when they relate to the same taxable entity and the same 
taxation authority.

36 Financial and Other Risk Management
TBC Bank Group’s strong risk governance reflects the importance placed by the Board and the Group’s Risks, Ethics and Compliance Committee 
on shaping the risk strategy and managing credit, financial and non-financial risks. All components necessary for comprehensive risk 
governance are embedded into risk organisation structure: enterprise risk management; credit, financial and non-financial risks management; 
risk reporting & supporting IT infrastructure; cross-risk analytical tools and techniques such as capital adequacy management and stress-
testing. Comprehensive, transparent and prudent risk governance facilitates understanding and trust from multiple stakeholders, ensures 
sustainability and resiliency of the business model and positioning of risk management as Group’s competitive advantage and strategic enabler. 
The TBC Bank Group’s governance structure ensures adequate oversight and accountabilities as well as clear segregation of duties. The Risks, 
Ethics and Compliance Committee is responsible for taking all the day-to-day decisions relating to the Group apart from those that are reserved 
for the Board. Namely, the committee carries out following duties: 1) Review and assessment of the Group’s risk management strategy, risk 
appetite and tolerance, risk management system and risk policies; 2) Review and monitoring of the processes for compliance with laws, 
regulations and ethical codes of practice; 3) monitoring of the remediation of internal control deficiencies identified by internal and external 
auditors around compliance, ethics and risk management functions; 4) Annual self-assessment of the committee’s performance and reporting of 
the results to the Board; 5) Review of the key risk management framework and other policy documents and make recommendations to the Board 
for their approval. 
On the Bank level, risk management is the duty of the Supervisory Board, which has the overall responsibility to set the tone at the top and 
monitor compliance with established objectives. At the same time, the Management Board governs and directs Groups’ daily activities. 
Both the Supervisory Board and the Management Board have established dedicated risk committees. The Risk, Ethics and Compliance 
Committee of Supervisory Board approves Bank’s Risk Appetite, supervises risk profile and risk governance practice within the Bank while the 
Audit Committee is responsible for implementation of key accounting policies and facilitation of activities of internal and external auditors. The 
Management Board Risk Committee is established to guide group-wide risk management activities and monitor major risk trends to make sure 
risk profile complies with the established Risk Appetite of the Group. The Operational Risk Committee makes decisions related to operational 
risk governance while the Asset-Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for implementation of ALM policies. 
The Board, the Supervisory Board and Senior Management govern risk objectives through Risk Appetite Statement (“RAS”) which sets desired 
risk profile and respective risk limits for different economic environments. Risk Appetite (“RA”) establishes monitoring and reporting 
responsibilities as well as escalation paths for different trigger events and limit breaches which as well prompt risk teams to establish and 
implement agreed mitigation actions. In order to effectively implement Risk Appetite in the Group’s day-to-day operations, the RA metrics are 
cascaded into more granular business unit level limits. That way risk allocation is established across different segments and activities. The Board 
level oversight coupled with the permanent involvement of the Senior Management in TBC Group risk management ensures the clarity regarding 
risk objectives, intense monitoring of risk profile against risk appetite, prompt escalation of risk-related concerns and establishment of 
remediation actions. 
The daily management of individual risks is based on the principle of the three lines of defense. While business lines are primary risk owners, 
risk teams assume the function of the second line defense. This role is performed through sanctioning transactions as well as tools and 
techniques for risk identification, analysis, measurement, monitoring and reporting. The committees are established at operational levels in 
charge of making transaction-level decisions that comprise of components of clear and sophisticated delegations of the authority framework 
based on “four-eye principle”. All new products/projects go through the risk teams to assure risks are analysed comprehensively. 
Such control arrangements guarantee that the Bank takes informed risk-taking decisions that are adequately priced, avoiding taking risks that 
are beyond the Group’s established threshold. Within the Risk Organisation the below teams manage the credit, liquidity, market, operational and 
other non-financial risks:
• Enterprise Risk Management (ERM);
• Credit Risk Management;
• Underwriting (Credit sanctioning);
• Restructuring and Collections;
• Financial Risk Management;
• Operational Risk Management. 224 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The strong and independent structure enables fulfillment of all the required risk management functions within the second line of defense by 
highly skilled professionals with a balanced mix of credentials in banking and real sectors both on the local and international markets. 
In addition to the above-mentioned risk teams, the Compliance Department (reporting directly to CEO) is specifically in charge of AML and 
compliance risk management. As the third line of defense, the Internal Audit Department provides an independent and objective assurance and 
recommendations to the Group that facilitates further improvement of operations and risk management. 
For the management of each significant risk, the Bank puts in place specific policies and procedures, governance tools and techniques, 
methodologies for risk identification, assessment and quantification. Sound risk reporting systems and IT infrastructure are important tools for 
efficient risk management of TBC Bank. Thus, significant emphasis and investments are made by the Bank to constantly drive the development of 
required solutions. Comprehensive reporting framework is in place for the Management Board, the Supervisory Board and the Board that 
enables intense oversight over risk developments and taking early remedial actions upon necessity. 
Beyond the described risk governance components, the compensation system features one of the most significant tools for introducing incentives 
for staff, aligned with the Bank’s long-term interests to generate sustainable risk-adjusted returns. The risk Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) 
are incorporated into both the business line and the risk staff remunerations. The performance management framework differentiates risk staff 
incentives to safeguard the independence from business areas that they supervise and at the same time enable attraction and maintenance of 
qualified professionals. For that purpose, the Bank overweighs risk KPIs for risk and control staff and caps the share of variable remuneration. 
Credit risk: The Group is exposed to credit risk, which is the risk that a customer or counterparty will be unable to meet its obligation to settle 
outstanding amounts. The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises as a result of its lending operations and other transactions with counterparties 
giving rise to financial assets. Maximum exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet items equals their carrying values. For maximum exposure 
on off-balance sheet commitments refer to Note 38. 
Credit risks include: risks arising from transactions with individual counterparties, concentration risk, currency-induced credit risks and 
residual risks.
• Risks arising from transactions with individual counterparties are the loss risk related to default or non-fulfillment of contracts due to 
deterioration in the counterparty’s credit quality. 
• Concentration risk is the risk related to the quality deterioration due to large exposures provided to single borrowers or a group of connected. 
borrowers, or loan concentration in certain economic industries.
• Currency-induced credit risks relate to risks arising from foreign currency-denominated loans in the Group’s portfolio.
• Residual risks result from applying credit risk-mitigation techniques, which could not satisfy expectation in relation to received collateral.
Comprehensive risk management methods and processes are established as part of the Group’s risk management framework to manage credit 
risk effectively. The main principles for the Group’s credit risk management are: establish a prudent credit risk environment; operate under a 
sound credit-granting process; and maintain efficient processes for credit risk identification, measurement, control and monitoring. Respective 
policies and procedures establish a framework for lending decisions reflecting the Group’s tolerance for credit risk. This framework includes 
detailed and formalised credit evaluation and collateral appraisal processes, administration and documentation, credit approval authorities at 
various levels, counterparty and industry concentration limits, and clearly defined roles and responsibilities of entities and staff involved in the 
origination, monitoring and management of credit. 
Credit Approval: The Group strives to ensure a sound credit-granting process by establishing well-defined credit granting criteria and building up 
an efficient process for the comprehensive assessment of a borrower’s risk profile. The concept of three lines of defense is embedded in the 
credit risk assessment framework, with a clear segregation of duties among the parties involved in the credit assessment process.
The credit assessment process differs across segments, being further differentiated across various product types reflecting the different natures 
of these asset classes. Corporate, SME and larger retail and micro loans are assessed on an individual basis with thorough analysis of the 
borrower’s creditworthiness and structure of the loan; whereas smaller retail and micro loans are mostly assessed in an automated way applying 
respective scoring models for the loan approval. Lending guidelines for business borrowers have been tailored to individual economic sectors, 
outlining key lending criteria and target ratios within each industry.
The Loan Approval Committees are responsible to review the credit applications and approve the credit products. Different Loan Approval 
Committees with clearly defined delegation authority are in place for the approval of credit exposures to Corporate, SME, Retail and Micro 
customers (except those products which are assessed applying scorecards).  The composition of a Loan Approval Committee depends on 
aggregated liabilities of the borrower and the borrower’s risk profile. Credit risk managers (as members of respective Loan Approval 
Committees) ensure that the borrower and the proposed credit exposure risks are thoroughly analysed. A loan to the Bank’s top 20 borrowers or 
exceeding 5% of the Bank’s regulatory capital requires the review and the approval of the Supervisory Board’s Risk, Ethics and Compliance 
Committee. This committee also approves transactions with related parties resulting in exposures to individuals and legal entities exceeding GEL 
150 and 200 thousand, respectively. 225 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Credit Risk Monitoring: The Group’s risk management policies and processes are designed to identify and analyse risk in a timely manner, and 
monitor adherence to predefined limits by means of reliable and timely data. The Group dedicates considerable resources to gain a clear and 
accurate understanding of the credit risk faced across various business segments. The Group uses a robust monitoring system to react timely to 
macro and micro developments, identify weaknesses in the credit portfolio and outline solutions to make informed risk management decisions. 
Monitoring processes are tailored to the specifics of individual segments, as well encompassing individual credit exposures, overall portfolio 
performance and external trends that may impact the portfolio’s risk profile. Early warning signals serve as an important early alert system for 
the detection of credit deteriorations, leading to mitigating actions.
Reports relating to the credit quality of the credit portfolio are presented to the Board’s Risk, Ethics and Compliance Committees on a quarterly 
basis. By comparing current data with historical figures and analysing forecasts, the management believes that it is capable of identifying risks 
and responding to them by amending its policies in a timely manner.
Credit Risk Mitigation: Credit decisions are based primarily on the borrower’s repayment capacity and creditworthiness; in addition, the Group 
uses credit risk mitigation tools such as collateral and guarantees to reduce the credit risk. The reliance that can be placed on these mitigation 
factors is carefully assessed for legal certainty and enforceability, market valuation of collateral and counterparty risk of the guarantor. 
A centralised unit for collateral management governs the Group’s view and strategy in relation to collateral management and ensures that 
collateral serves as an adequate mitigating factor for credit risk management purposes. The collateral management framework consists of a 
sound independent appraisal process, haircut system throughout the underwriting process, monitoring and revaluations.
Credit Risk Restructuring and Collection: A comprehensive portfolio supervision system is in place to identify weakened or problem credit 
exposures in a timely manner and to take prompt remedial actions. Dedicated restructuring units manage weakened borrowers across all 
business segments. The primary goal of the restructuring units is to rehabilitate the borrower and return to the performing category. The 
sophistication and complexity of the rehabilitation process differs based on the type and size of exposure. 
A centralised monitoring team monitors retail borrowers in delinquency, which coupled with branches’ efforts, are aimed at maximising 
collection. The specialised software is applied for early collection processes management. Specific strategies are tailored to different sub-groups 
of customers, reflecting respective risk levels, so that greater effort is dedicated to customers with a higher risk profile.  
Dedicated recovery units manage loans with higher risk profile. Corporate and SME borrowers are transferred to a recovery unit in case of a 
strong probability that a material portion of the principal amount will not be paid and the main stream of recovery is no longer the borrower’s 
cash flow. Retail and micro loans are generally transferred to the recovery unit or external collection agencies (in the case of unsecured loans) at 
90 days overdue, although they may be transferred earlier if it is evident that the borrower is unable to repay the loan.
Geographical risk concentrations: Assets, liabilities, credit related commitments and performance guarantees have generally been attributed to 
geographic regions based on the country in which the counterparty is located. Balances legally outstanding to/from off-shore companies which 
are closely related to Georgian counterparties are allocated to the caption “Georgia”. Cash on hand and premises and equipment have been 
allocated based on the country in which they are physically held. 226 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

from movements in market prices. This risk is principally made up of (a) risks pertaining to interest rate instruments and equities in the trading 
book and (b) foreign exchange rate risk (or currency risk) and commodities risk throughout the Bank. The Bank’s strategy is not to be involved in 
trading book activity or investments in commodities. Accordingly, the Bank’s exposure to market risk is primarily limited to foreign exchange rate 
risk in the structural book. 
Currency risk: Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates, which can affect the value of a 
financial instrument. This risk stems from the open currency positions created due to mismatches in foreign currency assets and liabilities. The 
NBG requires the Bank to monitor both balance-sheet and total aggregate (including off-balance sheet) open currency positions and to maintain 
the latter within 20% of the Bank’s regulatory capital. As of 31 December 2017, the Bank maintained an aggregate open currency position of 1.5% 
of regulatory capital (2016: 3.2%; 2015: 1.6%). The Asset-Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) has set limits on the level of exposure by 
currency as well as on aggregate exposure positions which are more conservative than those set by the NBG. The Bank’s compliance with such 
limits is monitored daily by the heads of the Treasury and Financial Risk Management Departments.  229 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Currency risk management framework is governed through the Market Risk Management Policy, market risk management procedure and 
relevant methodologies. Under the ICAAP framework the Bank developed methodology for allocating capital charges for FX risk following Basel 
guidelines. The table below summarises the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk at the balance sheet date. While managing 
open currency position the Group considers all provisions to be denominated in the local currency. Gross amount of currency swap deposits is

To assess the currency risk the Bank performs a value-at-risk (“VAR”) sensitivity analysis on a quarterly basis. The analysis calculates the effect 
on the Group’s income determined by possible worst movement of currency rates against the Georgian Lari, with all other variables held 
constant. To identify the maximum expected losses resulting from currency fluctuations, a 99% confidence level is defined based on the monthly 
variations in exchange rates over a 3-year look-back period. During the years ended 31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015, the sensitivity analysis 
did not reveal any significant potential effect on the Group’s equity:

Interest rate risk: Interest rate risk arises from potential changes in the market interest rates that can adversely affect the fair value or future 
cash flows of the financial instrument. This risk can arise from maturity mismatches of assets and liabilities, as well as from the repricing 
characteristics of such assets and liabilities. 
The Bank’s deposits and the most loans are at fixed interest rates, while a portion of the Bank’s borrowings is at a floating interest rate. The 
Bank’s floating rate borrowings are, to a certain extent, hedged by the NBG paying a floating rate on the minimum reserves that the Bank holds 
with the NBG. The Bank has also entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to mitigate interest rate risk. Furthermore, many of the 
Bank’s loans to customers contain a clause allowing it to adjust the interest rate on the loan in case of adverse interest rate movements, thereby 
limiting the Bank’s exposure to interest rate risk. The management also believes that the Bank’s interest rate margins provide a reasonable 
buffer to mitigate the effect of possible adverse interest rate movements.  230 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The table below summarises the Group’s exposure to interest rate risks. It illustrates the aggregated amounts of the Group’s financial assets and 
liabilities at the amounts monitored by the management and categorised by the earlier of contractual interest repricing or maturity dates. 
Currency and interest rate swaps are not netted when assessing the Group’s exposure to interest rate risks. Therefore, total financial assets and 
liabilities below are not traceable with either balance sheet or other financial risk management tables. The tables consider both reserves placed 
with NBG and Interest bearing Nostro accounts. Income on NBG reserves and Nostros are calculated as benchmark minus margin whereby for 
benchmark Federal funds rate and ECB rates are considered in case of USD and EUR respectively. Therefore, they have impact on the TBC’s Net 
interest income in case of both upward and downward shift of interest rates.

liabilities. Other comprehensive income would have been GEL 6,131 thousand higher (2016: GEL 1,516 thousand; 2015: GEL 927 thousand), as a 
result of an increase in the fair value of fixed rate financial assets classified as available for sale and repurchase receivables.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher, with all other variables held constant, profit would have been GEL 7.4 million lower (2016:

income would have been GEL 5,861 thousand lower (2016: GEL 2,118 thousand; 2015: GEL 911 thousand), as a result of decrease in the fair value 
of fixed rate financial assets classified as available for sale.
With the assistance of Ernst & Young LLC the Bank has developed an advanced model to manage the interest rate risk on a standalone basis. The 
interest rate risk analysis is performed monthly by the Financial Risk Management Department.
The Bank calculates the impact of changes in interest rates using both Net Interest Income and Economic Value sensitivity. Net Interest Income 
sensitivity measures the impact of a change of interest rates along the various maturities on the yield curve on the net interest revenue for the 
nearest year. Economic Value measures the impact of a change of interest rates along the various maturities on the yield curve on the present 
value of the Group’s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. When performing Net Interest Income and Economic Value sensitivity 
analysis, the Bank uses parallel shifts in interest rates as well as number of different scenarios. Under the ICAAP framework, TBC Bank reserves 
capital in the amount of the adverse effect of possible parallel yield curve shift scenarios on net interest income over a one-year period for Basel 
II Pillar 2 capital calculation purposes.
In order to manage Interest Rate risk the Bank establishes appropriate limits. The Bank monitors compliance with the limits and prepares 
forecasts. ALCO decides on actions that are necessary for effective interest rate risk management and follows up on the implementation. Periodic 
reporting is done to Management Board and the Board’s Risk, Ethics and Compliance Committee.
Liquidity Risk: The liquidity risk is the risk that TBC Bank either does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet all of its 
obligations and commitments as they fall due, or can access those resources only at a high cost. The risk is managed by the Financial Risk 
Management and Treasury Departments and is monitored by the ALCO.
The principal objectives of the TBC Bank’s liquidity risk management policy are to: (i) ensure the availability of funds in order to meet claims arising 
from total liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments, both actual and contingent, at an economic price; (ii) recognise any structural mismatch 
existing within TBC Bank’s statement of financial position and set monitoring ratios to manage funding in line with well-balanced growth; and (iii) 
monitor liquidity and funding on an ongoing basis to ensure that approved business targets are met without compromising the risk profile of the Bank.
The liquidity risk is categorised into two risk types: the funding liquidity risk and the market liquidity risk.  231 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Funding liquidity risk is the risk that TBC will not be able to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected current and future cash flow and 
collateral needs without affecting either its daily operations or its financial condition. To manage funding liquidity risk TBC Bank internally 
developed Liquidity Coverage ratio and a Net Stable Funding ratio models, both under Basel III guidelines. In addition the Bank performs stress 
tests and “what-if” scenario analysis and minimum liquidity ratio defined by the NBG. In 2017, for liquidity risk management purposes National 
Bank of Georgia introduced Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“NBG LCR”), where in addition to Basel III guidelines conservative approaches were applied 
to Mandatory Reserves’ weighting and to the deposits’ withdrawal rates depending on the clients group’s concentration. From September 2017 
the Bank also monitors compliance with NBG LCR limits.
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio is used to help manage short-term liquidity risks. The Bank’s liquidity risk management framework is designed to 
comprehensively project cash flows arising from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items over certain time buckets and ensure that NBG 
LCR limits, are met on a daily basis. TBC Bank also stress tests the results of liquidity through large shock scenarios provided by the NBG.
The Net Stable Funding ratio is used for long-term liquidity risk management to promote resilience over a longer time horizon by creating 
additional incentives for TBC Bank to rely on more stable sources of funding on a continuous basis. The Bank also sets deposit concentration 
limits for large deposits and deposits of non-Georgian residents in its deposit portfolio.
 
Net Stable Funding ratio is calculated based on the IFRS consolidated financial statements. In addition, for internal purposes TBC Bank 
calculates NSFR ratio on the basis of standalone financial statements prepared in accordance with NBG’s accounting rules.
The management believes that a strong and diversified funding structure is one of TBC Bank’s differentiators. The Bank relies on relatively stable 
deposits from Georgia as the main source of funding. In order to maintain and further enhance the liability structure TBC Bank sets the targets 
for retail deposits in its strategy and sets the loan to deposit ratio limits. 
The loan to deposit ratio (defined as total value of net loans divided by total value of deposits) stood at 106.5%, 110.5% and 106.4%, at 
31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively.
Market liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank cannot easily offset or eliminate a position at the then-current market price because of inadequate 
market depth or market disruption. To manage it, TBC Bank follows Basel III guidelines on high-quality liquidity asset eligibility in order to ensure 
that the Bank’s high-quality liquid assets can be sold without causing a significant movement in the price and with minimum loss of value. 
In addition, TBC Bank has a liquidity contingency plan, which is part of the Bank’s overall prudential liquidity policy and is designed to ensure 
that TBC Bank is able to meet its funding and liquidity requirements and maintain its core business operations in deteriorating liquidity conditions 
that could arise outside the ordinary course of its business. 
The Bank calculates its liquidity ratios on a daily basis in accordance with the NBG’s requirements. 
The Liquidity Ratio: The limit is set by the NBG for average liquidity ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of average liquid assets to average 
liabilities for the respective month, including borrowings from financial institutions and part of off-balance sheet liabilities with residual maturity 
up to 6 months. 
NBG LCR is calculated by reference to the qualified liquid assets divided by 30-day cash net outflows defined as per NBG guidelines. The limit is 
set by the NBG as per total LCR also by currency (GEL, FX). To promote larisation in the country of Georgia, NBG defines a lower limit for GEL 
LCR than that for FX LCR. In addition, NBG mandatory Regulatory reserves in FX currency is only considered at 75% per LCR calculation 
purposes. NBG guidelines apply higher withdrawal rates to the deposits and off-balance instruments depending on the clients group’s 
concentration than those rates defined per Basel III requirements.
As of 31 December the ratios were well above the prudential limit set by the NBG as follows:
2017 2016 2015
Average Liquidity Ratio 32.5% 30.8% 34.4%
Total Liquidity Coverage Ratio 112,72% – –
GEL Liquidity Coverage Ratio 95.62% – –
FX Liquidity Coverage Ratio 122.88% – –
According to daily cash flow forecasts and the surplus in liquidity standing, the Treasury Department places funds in short-term liquid assets, 
largely made up of short-term risk-free securities, interbank deposits and other interbank facilities, to ensure that sufficient liquidity is 
maintained within the Group as a whole.  232 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The undiscounted financial liability analysis gap does not reflect the historical stability of the current accounts. Their liquidation has historically 
taken place over a longer period than the one indicated in the tables above. These balances are included in amounts due in less than three 
months in the tables above. 
Term Deposits included in the customer accounts are classified based on remaining contractual maturities, according to the Georgian Civil Code, 
however, individuals have the right to withdraw their deposits prior to maturity if they partially or fully forfeit their right to accrued interest and 
the Group is obliged to repay such deposits upon the depositor’s demand. Based on the Bank’s deposit retention history, the management does 
not expect that many customers will require repayment on the earliest possible date; accordingly, the table does not reflect the management’s 
expectations as to actual cash outflows.
The Group does not use the above undiscounted maturity analysis to manage liquidity. Instead, the Group monitors the liquidity gap analysis 
based on the expected maturities. In particular, the customers’ deposits are distributed in the given maturity gaps following their 
behavioural analysis.

In order to assess the possible outflow of the bank’s customer accounts management applied value-at-risk analysis. The statistical data was 
used on the basis of a holding period of one month for a look-back period of five years with a confidence level of 99%. The value at risk analysis 
was performed for the following maturity gaps: (0-1 months), (0-3 months), (0-6 months) and (0-12 months), based on which the maximum 
percentage of deposits’ outflow was calculated.
Management believes that in spite of a substantial portion of customers’ accounts being on demand, diversification of these deposits by number 
and type of depositors, and the past experience of the Group would indicate that these customer accounts provide a long-term and stable source 
of funding for the Group. Moreover, the Group’s liquidity risk management includes estimation of maturities for its current deposits. The estimate 
is based on statistical methods applied to historic information on the fluctuations of customer account balances.
Operating environment: Most of the Group’s business is based in Georgia. Emerging economies, such as Georgia’s, are subject to rapid change 
and are vulnerable to global market conditions and economic downturns. As a consequence, operations in Georgia may be exposed to certain 
risks that are not typically associated with those in developed markets. Nevertheless, over the last few years the Georgian government has 
embarked on a number of civil, criminal, tax, administrative and commercial reforms that have positively affected the overall investment climate 
of the country. Today Georgia has an international reputation as a country with a favourable investment environment. Georgia continued to 
progress in the report “Doing Business 2018” by the World Bank (WB) and International Financing Corporation (IFC), ranking as the 9th easiest 
country in the world to do business (out of 190), up by 7 steps compared to the previous year rankings. The country improved its ranking in almost 
all categories, confirming its position as a regional leader and outperforming most of the EU economies. Georgia also boasts low corruption 
levels, a low tax burden, and high transparency of its institutions according to the number of surveys by international institutions. 
The domestic economic environment remains stable and the banking sector continues to grow, supported by broader macroeconomic stability 
and attractive business climate. 
GDP growth stood at 5.0% YoY growth in 2017. Growth was broad based across different sectors of the economy and was mostly driven by 
construction, trade and repairs, real estate, transport and communications sectors.  236 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Economic recovery in almost all trading partner countries of Georgia continues to underpin growth in export, tourism and remittances inflows. 
Exports of goods went up by 29.1% YoY in 2017, growth was diversified across different regions. Exports increased most to CIS countries 
(+60.0% YoY), exports continued to grow to EU (+13.0% YoY) as well as to other countries (+12.2% YoY). Imports of goods also went up by 9.4%, 
making the balance of trade in goods worsen slightly by 1.4% YoY in 2017. 
Tourism inflows went up by an estimated 28.0% YoY with the total number of visitors exceeding 7.5 million. Sharp growth in tourism revenues 
have a sizeable positive impact on Georgia’s Current Account balance. 
Remittance inflows increased by 19.8% YoY in 2017, with remittances up by 15.1% YoY from EU and 15.6% YoY from CIS countries. Growth of 
remittances from other countries stood at 31.3% YoY. In the latter group of countries Israel and Turkey had the highest contribution to growth as 
remittances from these countries went up by 96.1% YoY and 25.6% YoY, respectively. 
Given the positive trend in external inflows, CA balance improved markedly, in the first 9 months of 2017 CA deficit as a % of GDP stood at 7.1% 
compared to the 11.2% over the same period last year. 
Annual CPI inflation peaked in June, 2017 at 7.1% and declined slightly to 6.7% by the end of 2017. Increased excise taxes in the beginning of 
2017, higher oil prices and depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate of GEL were among the factors that kept inflation close to 7% by 
the end of the year. To address above target inflation, NBG increased policy rate by 0.25 PP from 7% to 7.25% in December, 2017. Overall, in 2017 
NBG raised policy rate by 0.75 PP, from 6.5% in the beginning of 2017 to 7.25% by the end of 2017. 
Fiscal deficit narrowed from 3.9% in 2016 to an estimated 3.8% in 2017, in line with the government’s strategy to gradually bring down the budget 
deficit below 3% over the medium term. Reduction in budget deficit mostly reflected better than expected growth of tax revenues as well as more 
prudent approach towards current spending. Budget project for 2018 envisages further reduction of budget deficit to c. 3% of GDP, which should 
further strengthen the fiscal position of the country. 
37 Management of Capital
The Group’s objectives in terms of capital management are to maintain appropriate levels of capital to support the business strategy, meet 
regulatory and stress testing-related requirements and safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally, the Group’s 
capital management objectives entail ensuring that the Bank complies with the capital requirements set by the Basel Capital Accord 1988 capital 
adequacy ratios as stipulated by borrowing agreements. The compliance with capital adequacy ratios set by the NBG is monitored monthly with 
the reports outlining their calculation and are reviewed and signed by the Bank’s CFO and Deputy CFO.
The Bank and the Group complied with all its internally and externally imposed capital requirements throughout 2015, 2016 and 2017.
In December 2017, the NBG has introduced updated capital framework that is more compliant with Basel III guidelines. Under updated capital 
framework capital requirements are divided into Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 buffers. Details regarding the capital buffers are outlined below:
• The capital conservation buffer (which was incorporated in minimum capital requirements) is separated and set at 2.5%;
• A systemic risk buffer will be introduced for systematically important banks over the 4 years period;
• A countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at 0%;
• A currency induced credit risk (CICR) buffer replaced conservative weighting for un-hedged FX loans denominated in foreign currencies;
• Concentration buffer for sectoral and single borrower exposure will be introduced; 
• A net stress buffer will be introduced based on stress testing results provided by the Group;
• A General Risk-assessment Programme (GRAPE) buffer defined by the regulator, will be applied based on the Bank’s specific risks.
In addition, based on the updated methodology, specific PTI (payment to income) and LTV (loan to value) thresholds were introduced. For the 
exposures which do not fall into pre-defined limits for PTI and LTV ratios, higher risk weights were applied.
NBG Basel I Capital adequacy ratio
Under the NBG Basel I capital requirements set by the NBG in 2017 banks have to maintain a ratio of regulatory capital to risk weighted assets 
(“statutory capital ratio”) above the minimum level of 9.6% and a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets above the minimum level of 6.4%. 
No additional add-ons are in place. In mid-2015, the NBG removed previously established 3% capital add-on. 2017 is the last phase for Basel I 
and will be ruled out fully from January 2018.
The regulatory capital is based on the Bank’s standalone reports prepared in accordance with the NBG accounting rules: 237 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Legal proceedings. When determining the level of provision to be set up with regards to such claims, or the amount (not subject to provisioning) 
to be disclosed in the financial statements, the management seeks both internal and external professional advice. The management believes that 
the provision recorded in these financial statements is adequate and the amount (not subject to provisioning) need not be disclosed as it will not 
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or the results of future operations of the Group.
Tax legislation. Georgian and Azerbaijani tax and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur 
frequently. The management’s interpretation of the legislation as applied to the Group’s transactions and activity may be challenged by the 
relevant authorities. Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities in respect of taxes for five calendar years preceding the review 
period. To respond to the risks, the Group has engaged external tax specialists to carry out periodic reviews of Group’s taxation policies and tax 
filings. The Group’s management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and the Group’s tax and customs 
positions will be sustained. Accordingly, as of 31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015 no provision for potential tax liabilities has been recorded. 242 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

38 Contingencies and Commitments continued
Operating lease commitments: Where the Group is the lessee, as of 31 December 2017, the future minimum lease payments under non-
cancellable operating leases over the next year amounted to GEL 6,479 thousand (31 December 2016: 5,016 thousand; 31 December 2015: 
4,891 thousand). 
Compliance with covenants: The Group is subject to certain covenants primarily related to its borrowings. Non-compliance with such covenants 
may result in negative consequences for the Group including growth in the cost of borrowings and declaration of default. In April 2017, the group 
had breached one of the covenants with a foreign financial institution lender . The group has obtained the waiver from the financial institution in June 
2017, whereby the breach was retrospectively waived. As of 31 December 2016, TBC Kredit had breached certain borrowing covenants agreed with 
foreign financial institution lenders. The major reason for the breach was the drastic devaluation of Azerbaijani Manat in February and December 
2015. The Group was in compliance with all other covenants as of 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. The Group was in compliance with all 
covenants as of 31 December 2015. 
Credit related commitments and financial guarantees: The primary purpose of these instruments is to ensure that funds are available to a 
customer as required. Financial guarantees and standby letters of credit, which represent the irrevocable assurances that the Group will make 
payments in the event that a customer cannot meet its obligations to third parties, carry the same credit risk as loans. Documentary and 
commercial letters of credit, that are written undertakings by the Group on behalf of a customer authorising a third party to draw drafts on the 
Group up to a stipulated amount under specific terms and conditions, are collateralised by the underlying shipments of goods to which they relate 
or cash deposits and therefore carry less risk than a direct borrowing.
Commitments to extend credit represent unused portions of authorisations to prolong credit in the form of loans, guarantees or letters of credit. 
With respect to credit risk on commitments to extend credit, the Group is potentially exposed to a loss in an amount equal to the total unused 
commitments. However, the likely amount of loss is lower than the total unused commitments since most commitments to extend credit are 
contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards. The Group monitors the term to maturity of credit related commitments 
because longer-term commitments generally have a greater degree of credit risk than shorter-term ones.
Performance guarantees: Performance guarantees are contracts that provide compensation in case of another party failing to perform a 
contractual obligation. Such contracts do not transfer credit risk. The risk under the performance guarantee contracts is the possibility that the 
insured event occurs (ie: the failure to perform the contractual obligation by another party). The key risks the Group faces are significant 
fluctuations in the frequency and severity of payments incurred on such contracts, relative to expectations.
Outstanding credit related commitments and performance guarantees are as follows:

The total outstanding contractual amount of undrawn credit lines, letters of credit, and guarantees does not necessarily represent future cash 
requirements, as these financial instruments may expire or terminate without being funded. Non-cancellable commitments as of 31 December 
2017 were GEL 389,148 thousand (2016: GEL 169,831 thousand; 2015: GEL 136,867 thousand).
Fair value of credit related commitments and financial guarantees were GEL 8,239 thousand as of 31 December 2017 (2016: GEL 8,049 thousand; 
2015: GEL 5,589 thousand). Total credit related commitments and performance guarantees are denominated in currencies as follows:

Foreign Exchange Forwards and gross settled currency swaps. Foreign exchange derivative financial instruments the Group entered are 
generally traded in an over-the-counter market with professional counterparties on standardised contractual terms and conditions. Derivatives 
have potentially favourable (assets) or unfavourable (liabilities) conditions as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates or other variables relative to their terms. The aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly 
from time to time.
The table below sets out fair values, at the balance sheet date, of currencies receivable or payable under foreign exchange forwards contracts 
and gross settled currency swaps the Group entered. The table reflects gross positions before the netting of any counterparty positions (and 
payments) and covers the contracts with settlement dates after the respective balance sheet date. The contracts are short term by their nature.

Interest rate swaps. In March 2010 TBC Bank entered into an interest rate swap agreement, to hedge floating interest rate on its subordinated 
debt. The hedge covers the payment of floating rate interest payments with the notional principal of USD 44,000 thousand. The swap expires in 
November 2018. At the reporting date the fair value of interest rate swaps was estimated to be negative GEL 267 thousand (2016: negative GEL 
1,055 thousand; 2015: negative GEL 2,303 thousand).

The fair values in the level 2 and level 3 of fair value hierarchy were estimated using the discounted cash flows valuation technique. The fair value 
of unquoted fixed interest rate instruments was calculated based on estimated future cash flows expected to be received discounted at current 
interest rates for new instruments with similar credit risk and remaining maturity. The fair value of investment properties was estimated using 
market comparatives (refer to Note 3). 
Amounts due to credit institutions were discounted at the Group’s own incremental borrowing rate. Liabilities due on demand were discounted 
from the first date that the Group could be required to pay the amount. 
There were no changes in the valuation technique for the level 2 and level 3 measurements of assets and liabilities not measured at fair values in 
the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: none; 2015: none). 250 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

43 Presentation of Financial Instruments by Measurement Category
For the measurement purposes, IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition of Measurement, classifies financial assets into the following 
categories: (a) loans and receivables; (b) available for sale financial assets; (c) financial assets held to maturity; and (d) financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss (“FVTPL ”). Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss have two subcategories: (i) assets designated as such 
upon initial recognition, and (ii) those classified as held for trading. In addition, finance lease receivables form a separate category. The following 
table provides a reconciliation of classes of financial assets with these measurement categories as of 31 December 2017:

44 Related Party Transactions
Pursuant to IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”, parties are generally considered to be related if the parties are under common control or one 
party has the ability to control the other or it can exercise significant influence over the other party in taking financial or operational decisions. In 
considering each possible related party relationship, attention is directed to the substance of the relationship, not merely the legal form. Parties 
with more than 10% of ownership stake in the TBCG or with representatives in the Board of Directors are considered as Significant Shareholders. 
The key management personnel include members of TBCG’s Board of Directors, the Management Board of the Bank and their close 
family members. 
Transactions between TBC Bank Group PLC and its subsidiaries also meet the definition of related party transactions. Where these are 
eliminated on consolidation, they are not disclosed in the Group Financial Statements.
