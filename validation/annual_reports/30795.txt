Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 Results
The Group’s underlying profit for the year 
increased by 3.5% to £140.5m (2016: 
£135.8m), on revenue which improved by 
11% to £1.6bn (2016: £1.45bn). The Group’s 
statutory profit before tax increased by 13% 
to £112.4m (2016: £99.8m).
Overview
Savills delivered a further strong performance 
in 2017 . In addition to substantial commercial 
transaction volumes in both the UK and a 
number of Asian and European markets, 
the relative resilience of Savills UK 
Residential transaction business, which 
achieved year-on-year revenue growth in 
challenging markets, was of particular note. 
This again demonstrated the importance of 
Savills strengths in prime markets of many 
of the world’s key cities where we increased 
market share. Currency movements also 
had a positive effect on the Group 
contributing approximately £3.9m in 
underlying profit and £2.8m in statutory 
profit before tax on translation.
Our Transaction Advisory revenue grew by 
13%, our Consultancy business revenue by 
14% and our Property Management revenue 
by 9%, including the full year effect of the 
2016 UK acquisition of GBR Phoenix Beard. 
Against the uncertain backdrop of world 
markets, Savills Commercial Transaction 
business grew revenue by 15% with strong 
performances in many markets including the 
UK and significant growth in the Asia Pacific 
region, in particular, Hong Kong, China, 
Japan and Australia. Our Residential 
businesses withstood challenging conditions 
achieving revenue growth of over 6%. Finally, 
Savills Investment Management Assets under 
Management (‘AUM’) increased to £14.6bn 
(2016: £13.9bn). Investment Management 
revenue declined as anticipated, reflecting the 
reduced level of disposal transactions from 
the liquidating SEB German Open Ended 
Funds we inherited as part of the acquisition 
of SEB Asset Management in 2015.
The reduction in transaction fees in the 
Investment Management business, together 
with a decline in the volume of larger 
complex transactions in the US and the 
costs of expansion in a number of markets 
restricted the underlying profit margin to 
8.8% (2016: 9.4%). The statutory pre-tax 
profit margin remained stable at 7.0% (2016: 
6.9%), with lower acquisition-related costs 
and profits on disposal of investments 
offsetting the aforementioned expansion 
costs and decline in the US business.

Savills plc  Report and Accounts 2017 Business development
Savills strategy is to be a leading advisor in 
the key markets in which we operate. Our 
global strategy is delivered locally by our 
experts on the ground with flexibility to 
adapt quickly to changes in circumstances 
and opportunities. They are supported by 
our regional and cross-border investment 
and occupier services specialists. Over the 
last few years we have acquired a number 
of complementary businesses and added 
teams and individual hires to our strong 
core business. 
During 2017, we continued to build our US 
presence with the acquisition of Cresa 
Orange County, a tenant representation 
business in California and the hire of a 
significant new capital markets team in New 
York. In Asia Pacific, we made some 
significant hires in investment sales teams in 
Beijing and Shanghai. In Continental Europe, 
the acquisitions of Aguirre Newman in Spain, 
Larry Smith in Italy and SB management in 
the Czech Republic and the recruitment of 
Industrial teams in Amsterdam and Warsaw 
further strengthened our presence across 
the continent. In the UK, we completed a 
number of team hires across our business 
lines together with the acquisitions of a 
residential lettings business (Granville 
Residential Ltd – Marlow) and a 
commercially focused business in Guernsey 
(Montagu Evans Channel Islands Ltd).
Emerging technology continues to be a focal 
area in the real estate industry and also for 
our business. We have continued to invest in 
our own technology platform in order both to 
deliver innovative solutions to our clients 
through data analysis and insight and to 
drive internal efficiencies. One example is  
the formation of Workthere.com, Savills 
innovative response to the changing 
requirements of occupiers seeking serviced 
office/co-working space in global cities.
In addition, we have reviewed a significant 
number of investment opportunities in the 
field of emerging technology and our 
proprietary investment arm, Grosvenor Hill 
Ventures (“GHV”), has made a number of 
investments in promising technology 
opportunities. GHV comprises a small 
technology team led by the Group CFO  
with a remit to support external technology-
based businesses with the capability of 
significantly enhancing or disrupting 
traditional business models in real estate 
services. Our largest investment to date is  
in YOPA, the digital hybrid residential UK 
estate agent. During the last 12 months it 
has grown to become the 10th largest agent  
in the UK. We have also invested in 
Proportunity, an Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) 
based start-up focused on real estate 
valuation. Finally, in December we invested  
in VuCity, the first digital “smart Cities” 
platform which is focused on making 
planning applications faster and easier for 
sponsors and Local Authorities to progress.
Board
The Board of Savills announced in January 
that Jeremy Helsby will retire as Group Chief 
Executive at the end of 2018 after a 39 year 
career at Savills, 1 1 of them as Group Chief 
Executive. Jeremy will be succeeded by Mark 
Ridley, currently CEO of Savills UK and Europe, 
with effect from 1 January 2019. Mark will join 
the Board of Savills plc as Deputy Group Chief 
Executive on 1 May 2018.
Dividends
An initial interim dividend of 4.65p per share 
(2016: 4.4p) amounting to £6.3m was paid 
on 4 October 2017, and a final ordinary 
dividend of 10.45p (2016: 10.1p) is 
recommended, making the ordinary 
dividend 15.1p for the year (2016: 14.5p). In 
addition, a supplemental interim dividend of 
15.1p (2016: 14.5p) was declared, based 
upon the underlying performance of our 
Transaction Advisory business. Taken 
together, the ordinary and supplemental 
dividends comprise an aggregate 
distribution for the year of 30.2p per share, 
representing an increase of 4% on the 2016 
aggregate dividend of 29.0p. The final 
ordinary dividend of 10.45p per ordinary 
share will, subject to shareholders’ approval 
at the Annual General Meeting on 8 May 
2018, be paid alongside the supplemental 
interim dividend of 15.1p per share on 
14 May 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at 13 April 2018.

I would like to express my thanks to all  
our staff worldwide for their hard work, 
commitment and continued focus on client 
service, enabling the Group to deliver this 
record performance in 2017. 
Outlook
We have made a solid start to 2018 with a 
pipeline of business carried over from last 
year in many markets, although this is 
against the backdrop of heightened market 
uncertainty, geopolitical risks and rising 
interest rates. We anticipate some tempering 
of the strong transaction volumes of recent 
times in some markets. However, at this 
early stage in the year our expectations for 
2018 currently remain unchanged.

Case Study
Stratford, London
Savills acted on behalf of Blackstone and Catalyst Capital on the disposal of 
The Stratford Centre in London. Prior to sale, the investment team provided 
long-term, strategic advice to the vendor. At the point of the sale the 206,000 
sq ft (28,428 sq m) asset was fully let to retailers including Sainsbury’s, Lidl, 
New Look and Boots and benefitted from planning consent for 587 residential 
units. Savills was able to seamlessly combine residential and retail market 
capabilities to fully promote the asset management and development 
potential of the scheme. The highly targeted marketing campaign resulted in  
a sale for £141.5m, a significant premium to the asking terms and reflecting  
a sub 5% NIY.

Savills plc  Report and Accounts 2017 Spotlight on Europe 
The European economy enjoyed the strongest period of 
economic growth in more than a decade, despite lingering 
political uncertainty. Business expansion continued to drive 
office demand, often driven by the tech sector and by 
M&A activity.
Consumer confidence was improving with demand for prime 
high streets driven by Fashion, Sports, Beauty and Technology 
brands, opening large inspirational flagship/lifestyle stores, as 
well as by the expanding presence of F&B. Additionally big box 
retailers were experimenting with smaller stores in tight, fast 
growing urban locations, with the additional benefit of easier 
pick-up and delivery services for online orders. 
Demand for logistics space has been rising across Europe, 
driven by improved economic conditions, rising trade volumes, 
and expanding e-commerce. Last mile logistics strengthened 
demand for mid-sized distribution centres, while the need for 
large-scale distribution centres in traditional logistics hubs 
continued to grow.
In 2017 the total investment volume across our markets totalled 
€234bn, a 7% increase year on year thanks to strong investment 
growth in the second half of the year. Cross border investment 
accounted for over 50% of the total (compared to 44% the 
previous year), with Asian investors overtaking the US to become 
the largest overseas investors in Europe. Offices continue to be 
the asset class of choice accounting for 46% of the total 
investment volume. However, lack of stock and competitive 
pricing was driving investors to other asset classes. Of particular 
note, the industrial sector saw the biggest increase in investor 
demand accounting for 15% of the total investment volume, up 
from 11% in 2016 and 9% in 2015.

Savills plc 
Report and Accounts 2017 Spotlight on UK 
The commercial property investment market in the UK surprised on the upside in 2017 , 
with turnover for the full year of just under £66bn against our forecast at the start of 2017 
of £55bn. This meant that 2017 was the second best year on record, a surprising result 
given the negativity around Brexit that was rife at the start of last year.
Just under half of last year’s acquisitions were by non-domestic investors, with this 
proportion rising to 80% in the Greater London market. The single most active source 
of capital was Asia Pacific, whose investors put over £13bn into the UK market, much 
of which went to London. However, both European and American investors also 
invested more in the UK in 2017 than they had in 2016.
While the office market remained the most active of the three main sectors last year, 
the biggest growth in activity was in the industrial sector where the global appetite for 
income security combined with an enthusiasm for the growth prospects for 
distribution property. Other income-producing asset classes also saw a sharp 
increase in investor demand last year.
Occupational demand improved year on year in the office markets both inside and 
outside London, with steady take-up and low supply remaining the theme in the 
industrial sector. Retail markets remained challenged by cautious tenant demand.
Price growth across the UK’s residential markets slowed in 2017. Buyer sentiment was 
affected by underlying political and economic uncertainty and the prospect of gradual 
increases to the cost of debt over the medium term. The focus of residential 
investment continued to shift away from private individuals toward institutions as the 
build to rent sector continued to gather momentum, while the fiscal and regulatory 
environment for buy to let investors became less hospitable.
On the flip side, the residential development sector benefitted from continued 
Government support and a strong political focus on increasing housing delivery.
The prime housing markets continued to remain price sensitive, not least because of 
greater exposure to transactional and other capital taxes, particularly for overseas 
buyers. Values in the prime central London market fell by a further 4.0% over the course 
of the year, meaning that they sat 15.9% below their 2014 peak at the end of 2017 . 
Elsewhere price adjustments have been much less significant, though prices for high 
value homes fell marginally across the commuter zone. However, transaction levels over 
£1m remained relatively robust, particularly in the markets outside of London.

Savills plc 
Report and Accounts 2017
Governance Strategic report Overview Financial statements Spotlight on North America 
A strengthening US economy, particularly in tech and industrial 
sectors, compensated for slowing international investment.  
US economic growth in 2017 outpaced the previous year 
significantly, with real GDP rising by 2.3%, versus 1.5% in 2016. 
Overall commercial leasing activity slowed slightly in 2017 in 
major US markets such as Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, 
San Francisco/Silicon Valley and Washington, DC. Demand for 
office space, however, increased in the energy-dependent 
markets of Houston and Denver, as well as in the Sunbelt 
markets of Atlanta, Austin and Dallas. Asking rent remained 
relatively stable in most major markets in 2017. The exception 
to this was in several significant tech markets (Austin, Boston, 
San Francisco/Silicon Valley) which all experienced 5% or 
higher growth in asking rent. 
Investment sales activity declined for the second straight year. 
However the tech markets (Boston, San Francisco/Silicon 
Valley and Seattle) continued to be strong and there was 
increased investment activity in secondary markets (Charlotte, 
Raleigh/Durham, Nashville, Pittsburgh and Portland). Investor 
interest in the industrial sector remained high — it was the only 
asset class to see sales volumes increase in 2017. 
Case Study
W.W. Norton
Savills Studley advised publisher W.W. Norton on a short-term  
lease extension and expansion while conducting a thorough  
search for alternative locations. With viable options in hand, the 
team then helped W.W. Norton secure a long-term lease renewal 
for 95,000 sq ft in its prime Midtown Manhattan location at an 
aggressive rent, including a substantial work allowance to cover  
a staged renovation.
Market insights continued
Spotlight on Asia 
Across both developed and emerging Asia a broadly positive 
economic environment alongside a stable political landscape 
saw markets continue to perform well during 2017 as low 
interest rates and ample liquidity proved to be broadly 
supportive of both transactions volumes and asset prices. 
Despite concerns over debt levels in China and slowing 
growth, as well as a greater propensity for protectionism in 
some regional markets, no single risk factor succeeded in 
undermining investor confidence in local real estate. The 
appetite for land in Asia’s rapidly changing cities remained 
undimmed and sales of development sites hit record levels in 
2017 led by China. Hong Kong also saw a notable growth in 
land sales (+78% YoY) supported by buyers from the mainland.
Sales of income producing assets surged during the year 
despite exceptionally low yields and a scarcity of good quality 
stock. We note that investors are also beginning to explore a 
broader realm of asset classes beyond simply office and retail. 
In Japan, Asia’s second largest market, investors took a greater 
interest in second tier cities such as Osaka and Yokohama, 
driven partly by heavily compressed yields in Tokyo. The appeal 
of Australia endured for the security of its more mature 
commercial markets but scarcity and historically low yields had 
a negative impact on volumes. Cross border activity remained 
a feature of the Asia-Pacific markets in 2017 and while activity 
from European and North American investors slowed, Asian 
investors took up the slack. Both Hong Kong and Singapore 
have remained important financial intermediaries for global real 
estate capital flowing into and out of the region.

168 private equity real estate funds raised total capital of 
$93bn in 2017, a drop from the $117bn raised in 2016. 
However, the average amount raised in final closings by private 
closed ended funds rose from $496m in 2016 to $533m. The 
fall in number of closed ended private funds was the fifth 
straight year of declines, from a high of 339 funds closing in 
2013. However, this fall in number of closed funds is not 
matched by a fall in private equity dry powder, with Preqin 
reporting that there was $249bn dry powder available versus 
$238bn 12 months prior. However, 47% of funds closed in 
2017 did not meet their fund raising targets – a five year high. 
The weight of money and continued improvement of occupier 
market fundamentals continued to see capital values increase 
while yields decrease. PERE noted that the trend for more 
opportunistic and value added funds fell in 2017, from 63% to 
60% of investors strategies. Increase in debt funds grew 
substantially, from 18% in 2016 to 29% in 2017. 
Investors continued to look to North America for investments, 
with 41% of funds for the continent. Europe was the second 
biggest focus, with 24% of all funds European focused, 
continuing an increase in interest in the continent. From 
2011–13, Europe accounted for 19% of capital. From 2014–17, 
this has risen to 27%. The largest funds continued to gain in 
market share, with the six largest funds in the market 
accounting for nearly half of capital sought by the top 20.

2017 saw the launch of Nordic Fund III – Retail, a closed ended fund 
targeting Core+ retail in capital and regional cities across Sweden, 
Finland, Denmark and Norway. It targets dominant/under-managed 
assets including retail warehouse parks, local food anchored 
shopping centres and high street stores. It is a follow on fund to 
Nordic Fund I – Retail, which outperformed its benchmark by 2.6% 
over 5 years, and is led by a local team of 15 investment

Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 Key operating highlights
Strength in key commercial markets, 
geographical diversity and the resilience  
of our residential businesses drove an 
improved performance for Savills in 2017. 
• Transaction Advisory revenues up 13%. 
Strong performances in the UK and Asia 
Pacific including Hong Kong, China, 
Australia and Japan. 
• Growth in revenues in Continental Europe 
with profits impacted by start-up costs in 
the Czech Republic and recruitment 
there and in the Netherlands. 
• Savills Studley’s revenue up 6% but 
profitability impacted by investment in a 
new capital markets team in New York.
• Further growth from our less-
transactional services with Consultancy 
revenue up 14% and Property 
Management revenue up 9%.
• Savills Investment Management 
performed ahead of our expectations, 
with AUM up 5% to £14.6bn.
Overall the Group increased underlying profit 
by 3.5% to £140.5m (2015: £135.8m). 
On a statutory basis, profit before tax 
increased 13% to £112.4m (2016: £99.8m).
Savills geographic and business diversity 
were key to achieving the year’s result.

On a constant currency* basis Group revenue grew by 7% to £1,551.6m, underlying profit 
grew by 1% to £136.6m and statutory profit before tax grew by 10% to £109.6m. Our Asia 
Pacific business represented 35% of Group revenue (2016: 34%) and our overseas

Overall, our Commercial and Residential Transaction Advisory business revenues together 
represented 47% of Group revenue (2016: 46%). Of this, the Residential Transaction Advisory 
business represented 11% of Group revenue (2016: 11%). Our Property and Facilities 
Management businesses continued to perform well, growing overall revenue by 9% and 
represented 32% of Group revenue (2016: 33%). Our Consultancy businesses represented 
17% of revenue (2016: 17%) where improved performances within the UK were supported by 
an increase in valuation work in our international operations. There was a reduction of revenues 
in the Investment Management business of 8%, which had been anticipated due to the 
exceptionally high level of disposals in 2016 from the SEB German Open Ended funds, which 
are in liquidation. Investment Management revenue represented 4% of Group revenue in the 
year (2016: 5%). 
People
The UK business won a number of national awards including Residential Advisor of the Year 
at the 2017 Estates Gazette Awards, Commercial Agent of the Year at the 2017 Props 
Award, Industrial Agency Team of the Year at the Property Week Awards 2017, Times 
Graduate Employer of Choice in property for the eleventh year and No.1 Real Estate Super 
brand for the ninth consecutive year. Savills were also awarded European Broker of the Year 
at the Property Investor Europe (PIE) awards, and in Hong Kong won Best Deal of the Year 
for the sale of the West and East Towers of One Harbour Gate at the RICS Hong Kong 
Awards, an international award honouring outstanding achievement for the real estate 
industry in Hong Kong. Savills Investment Management was also recognised with three 
funds winning best performer awards from MSCI/IPF and Property Investor Europe during 
the year. These awards are a testament to the strength of our people and I thank them all for 
their continued commitment, loyalty and hard work.

Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview

Savills plc  Report and Accounts 2017 The Savills Group advises on commercial, rural, residential  
and leisure property. We also provide corporate finance advice, 
investment management and a range of property-related 
financial services. Operations are conducted internationally 
through four business streams:
2017 clearly demonstrated both the 
importance of having a breadth of 
transactional business around the 
world, and our strong market position 
in the main real estate transactional 
markets/sectors. 
In the UK the commercial leasing and 
investment markets performed better than 
expected in 2017 , as both occupiers and 
investors adopted a more realistic view of how 
and where Brexit-related risks might fall. Of 
particular note was the very strong 
performance of our commercial teams in Asia 
Pacific, in particular in Hong Kong, China, 
Australia and Japan. The Savills Global 
Residential business also proved highly 
resilient in challenging markets, contributing 
to the increase in revenue and profit delivered 
by our Transaction Advisory business as a 
whole. Revenue grew by 13% to £746.2m 
(2016: £660.8m) and underlying profit 
increased by 2% to £81.5m (2016: £80.0m). 
The effect of significant business 
development costs in the US, including the 
recruitment of a New York capital markets 
team, reduced the underlying profit margin 
of the Transaction Advisory business as a 
whole to 10.9% (2016: 12.1%).
UK Residential
Our UK Residential business revenue grew by 
4% to £128.9m (2016: £124.4m). In the 
second-hand estate agency business, 
revenues benefited from a growth in the 
average sales value, which was 6.9% higher 
than in 2016, along with a slightly higher 
average fee charged, offsetting a fall in the 
number of exchanges, (down 3% on 2016).  
In the “Core” London market, the number of 
exchanges grew by 4%, helped by a fall in 
average values, whereas outside the capital, 
which represents 55% of second hand 
agency residential revenue, the opposite 
trend occurred with the number of exchanges 
down 5%, as a result of higher property 
prices. In both regions revenues increased 
approximately 4% on 2016.
In the new homes business, revenue grew 
by 2%, reflecting a growth in average 
transaction value of 3%, despite a 7% 
reduction in the number of exchanges.
Whilst there was muted activity in the UK 
farmland market, pending clarification on trade 
and subsidies post-Brexit, there was continued 
demand for amenity estates, especially across 
the South and South West of England. 
Our Residential Capital Markets team saw 
significant institutional investor appetite in 
student housing and private rented sector 
markets. This resulted in revenue growth  
of almost 25%, although planning delays  
and construction market challenges 
represent significant supply side constraints 
in these markets.
As a result of the above factors, the UK 
Residential Transaction Advisory business 
recorded a 7% increase in underlying profits 
to £18.7m (2016: £17.5m).
Asia Pacific Residential
The Residential Transaction Advisory 
business in Asia is focused primarily on new 
development, secondary sales and leasing 
of prime properties in selected markets. It 
excludes mixed use developments, which 
are accounted for within the Commercial 
Transaction Advisory business. Overall, the 
Asia Pacific Residential business increased 
revenues by 16% to £44.3m (2016: £38.1m) 
which represented an 11% increase in 
constant currency. This was principally 
driven by a number of high end residential 
sales in Hong Kong and an increase in 
project sales in Singapore where the 
residential market began to show signs of 
recovery following government relaxation of

18 certain cooling measures. Our residential 
business in Australia was restructured during 
the year resulting in reduced revenues but 
improved profitability. In China, the 
Government continues to impose restrictions 
on second home ownership, impacting 
negatively both sales and profitability. The 
net effect of all these factors resulted in a 
94% increase in underlying profit to £6.4m 
(2016: £3.3m), 88% in constant currency.
Asia Pacific Commercial
The Asia Pacific Commercial business 
performed strongly in 2017 , driven by 
improved revenue and profitability in Hong 
Kong, Japan, Australia and Mainland China. 
The Hong Kong market continued to be 
attractive to Mainland Chinese investors and 
our market share remained strong at 
approximately 40%. In Japan, transactional 
revenue increased by 75% following the 
completion of several significant transactions. 
In Australia the impact of previous investment 
in new talent coupled with the restructuring 
under the new leadership team resulted in an 
increase in market share, improving both 
revenue and profitability. Over the past 18 
months, we have invested significantly into 
our investment sales team in Mainland China, 
particularly in Shanghai and Beijing, the 
benefit of which came through in 2017 as 
both transaction volumes and market share 
increased. The Singapore performance  
was negatively impacted by a reduction  
in investment volumes and commercial 
leasing fees. 
Reported revenue rose by 30% to £168.4m 
(2016: £129.7m) which represented a 24% 
increase in constant currency. 
The positive effect of higher volumes  
offset business development and service 
expansion costs in the region, leading  
the Asia Pacific Commercial Transaction 
Advisory business to record a 31% increase 
in underlying profit to £26.9m (2016: 
£20.6m). This represented a 25% increase 
in constant currency. 
UK Commercial
Revenue from UK commercial transactions 
increased 18% to £101.6m (2016: £86.0m). 
Most commercial leasing and investment 
markets performed better than anticipated in 
2017 , as both occupiers and investors 
adopted a more realistic view of how and 
where Brexit-related risks might fall. The 
overall investment volume into UK commercial 
property in 2017 was just under £66bn, a 
27% increase on the year before. The 
importance of non-domestic investors was 
significant, with £31bn invested in the UK last 
year by non-domestic investors (the second 
highest volume historically). In the London 
office market the proportion was even higher, 
with 80% of investment coming from 
non-domestic investors and £8.4bn from Asia 
Pacific alone. Savills was the leading adviser 
in London for the second year in succession, 
with a market share of 30%.
Generally, investors remained heavily biased 
towards asset classes that offer comparative 
income security, and this meant that logistics 
and alternative asset classes rose in 
popularity offsetting a decline in activity in 
retail, particularly shopping centres.
The occupational markets also performed 
well, with office leasing activity in central 
London 24% up year-on-year. Furthermore, 
the total office take-up in the top six regional 
cities in the UK reached its highest ever level 
in 2017, due to a combination of a natural 
ripple effect outwards from London and the 
South East, and a degree of insulation 
against the potential Brexit risk.
The logistics sector was many investors’ 
sector of choice in 2017, although 
occupational take-up was at its long-term 
average level. Availability of prime logistics 
space remains tight across the UK, and this 
will support both rents and land prices 
going forward. Retail remained a fairly 
binary sector in 2017, with tourist-focused 
markets like London and Edinburgh 
performing well due to the effects of the 
weak pound, while the rest of the UK 
remained flat in the face of falling real 
earnings growth for UK consumers.
The strength of our national Commercial 
transaction business, supported by our 
strong international network, led to a 17% 
increase in underlying profit to £17.2m  
(2016: £14.7m).
North America
During the year, we continued to build on our 
North American tenant representation 
platform, Savills Studley, through both 
recruitment and bolt-on acquisitions. Our 
North American revenue grew by 6% to 
£224.8m (2016: £211.1m). In constant 
currency this equated to a year-on-year 
increase of 2%. Savills Studley executed 
transaction volumes 24% higher than the 
previous year, which largely offset a 
significant reduction in the large complex 
transactions for which this business is noted. 
Much of this is deferral through uncertainty 
rather than cancellation and the pipeline of 
activity for 2018 is robust. 
A number of cities and regions such as 
Southern California, San Francisco, and 
Philadelphia enjoyed strong performances 
during the year. The performance of these 
offices helped offset the effect of deferrals 
which particularly affected the Washington 
DC region in respect of Government-
related transactions.
These factors, together with the significant 
investment made in assembling and 
supporting our new New York Capital 
markets team and the lag effect of team lifts 
in California and Denver, led to a decrease  
in North American underlying profit of 59% 
to £7.8m (2016: £18.9m), a 60% decline in 
constant currency.
Continental Europe
The Continental European Commercial 
Transaction Advisory business grew 
revenue by 9% to £78.2m (2016: £71.5m). 
This was driven by the continued strength 
of our Irish business across both Investment 
and Leasing/Tenant Rep and strong 
performances from Germany, the 
Netherlands, Spain and Italy. The 
performance was also set against 
developing Logistics expertise in the 
Netherlands and Poland as well as 
significant investment in opening an office  
in Czech Republic, building Investment and 
Leasing capabilities through team lifts there.
During the year we continued to build on our 
Continental European platform with the 
acquisitions of Larry Smith in Italy and on the 
29 December 2017, the acquisition of Aguirre 
Newman in Spain.
As a result of these additional costs, the 
Continental European Transaction Advisory 
business recorded an underlying profit of 
£4.5m (2016: £5.0m), 10% lower than in 
2016, 22% on a constant currency basis.

Property and Facilities Management
Our Property and Facilities Management businesses continued to  
perform well, growing revenue by 9% (5% in constant currency) to  
£513.1m (2016: £472.8m). Underlying profit increased by 7% to £25.3m  
(2016: £23.6m), 5% in constant currency.
Asia Pacific
The Asia Pacific region grew revenue by 
10% (5% in constant currency) to £300.9m 
(2016: £273.8m). The Property and Facilities 
Management business is a significant 
strength in the region, representing 53%  
of Savills Asia Pacific revenue and 
complementing our Transaction Advisory 
businesses. The total square footage under 
management in the region was up 5%  
to approximately 1.49bn sq ft (2016: 
approximately 1.41bn sq ft), primarily due to 
new contracts in Mainland China and Hong 
Kong. In Hong Kong, which represented 
approximately 55% of Asia Pacific Property 
and Facilities Management revenue, the 
business grew revenue by 7% in local 
currency. Overall the underlying profit of  
the Asia Pacific Property Management 
business grew 6% (2% in constant 
currency) to £15.4m (2016: £14.5m).
UK
Overall, our UK Property Management 
teams, comprising Commercial, Residential 
and Rural, grew reported revenue by 4% to 
£165.8m (2016: £158.9m). Following 
completion of the integration of the business 
of Smiths Gore, approximately £20.0m of 
revenue and £1.6m of underlying profit, 
which had hitherto been recognised in the 
rural property management business, was 
reallocated to the other business segments; 
adjusting for this, like-for-like revenue growth 
was approximately 17%. The Residential 
management business and the UK 
Commercial business together grew area 
under management by 22% to 
approximately 353m sq ft (2016: 289m sq ft). 
Our Residential Property Management 
businesses, including Lettings, increased 
revenue by 8%. Underlying profit for the UK 
Property Management business grew 4%  
to £11.7m (2016: £11.3m).
Continental Europe
In Continental Europe revenue grew by 16% 
(8% in constant currency) to £46.4m (2016: 
£40.1m) with growth particularly in Ireland, 
France, the Netherlands and Poland 
offsetting lower revenues in Sweden. In 
addition, the Larry Smith acquisition in Italy 
contributed revenues of £1.9m. By the year 
end the total area under management had 
increased by 94% to 106.9m sq ft, with Larry 
Smith contributing 5m sq ft and Aguirre 
Newman, in Spain, which completed on 29 
December 2017, adding a further 38m sq ft. 
The net effect of these factors was an 
improvement in the underlying loss for the 
year to £1.8m (2016: loss £2.2m).
Global Consultancy revenue increased 
by 14% to £273.1m (2016: £240.3m), 12% 
in constant currency, and underlying 
profit grew by 20% to £31.0m (2016: 
£25.9m), 12% in constant currency.
UK
Consultancy service revenue in the UK was 
up 12% at £204.9m (2016: £183.1m). There 
were strong performances in the planning 
and development teams, along with 
revenue growth in building and project 
consultancy, hotels and leisure and lease 
consultancy. Following completion of the 
integration of the business of Smiths Gore, 
approximately £14.0m of revenue and 
£1.2m of underlying profit, which had 
hitherto been recognised in the rural 
property management business, was 
reallocated to the Consultancy business 
segments. Overall underlying profit from  
the UK Consultancy business increased  
by 8% to £23.9m (2016: £22.2m).
Asia Pacific
Revenue in the Asia Pacific Consultancy 
business increased by 21% to £45.7m 
(2016: £37.9m), 14% in constant currency. 
There was significant growth in Hong Kong 
and also in China, where revenues were 
well ahead of 2016 in both the valuation and 
research consultancy teams. There were 
also improving trends in Australia, South 
Korea, Singapore and Vietnam. 
Consequently, underlying profit increased 
by 113% to £5.1m (2016: £2.4m), 104%  
up on a constant currency basis.
Continental Europe
Our Continental European Consultancy 
business, which principally comprises 
valuation and underwriting advisory 
services, increased revenue by 17% (9%  
in constant currency) to £22.5m (2016: 
£19.3m). In particular, there were stronger 
performances in Germany, France, the 
Netherlands and Spain. Underlying profit 
increased by 54% (38% in constant 
currency) to £2.0m (2016: £1.3m).

Savills plc 
Report and Accounts 2016 Following Savills Investment Management’s 
record result in 2016, the expected decrease 
in disposal activity from the liquidating SEB 
German Open Ended Funds caused revenue 
to decrease by 8% (11% in constant 
currency) to £66.5m (2016: £72.0m). This 
generated an underlying profit of £13.3m 
(2016: £17.6m). Assets under management 
(‘AUM’) increased to £14.6bn (2016: 
£13.9bn), as the £1.9bn of new capital raised 
in the year outweighed the effect of 
liquidation distributions to unit holders of the 
former SEB German Open Ended Funds. 
Transactions of approximately £4.8bn (2016: 
£4.4bn) were executed on behalf of fund 
investors, a record annual volume. This 
included £2.58bn of disposals and £2.23bn 
of acquisitions.
Investment performance continued strongly 
with the majority of our Fund products 
continuing to exceed their benchmarks over 
a five year term. Indeed this performance 
was recognised publicly when three funds 
won significant awards during the year: The 
Charities Property Fund was named Core 
Fund of the year by Property Investor 
Europe; The Diageo Core Fund was the best 
performing segregated Pension Fund (above 
£350m) at the MSCI/IPF Awards; and The 
Boccaccio Fund was the best performing 
Italian Specialist Fund at the MSCI European 
Property Investment Awards.

Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017  
Underlying profit margin
Underlying profit margin decreased to  
8.8% (2016: 9.4%), reflecting a decline in 
substantial transaction activity in the US,  
the anticipated reduction in Investment 
Management profits following the reduced 
level of disposal transactions from the SEB 
German Open Ended Funds and the costs 
of expansion in a number of regions.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year reduced to 
£31.3m (2016: £32.1m), reflecting an 
effective tax rate on statutory profit before 
tax of 27.8% (2016: 32.1%). The 
improvement in the 2017 effective tax rate 
is primarily due to the reduction in non-
deductible acquisition costs, with the final 
consideration for the Studley acquisition 
paid in May 2017. In both years, the 
Group’s effective reported tax rate is higher 
than the UK effective rate of tax of 19.25% 
(2016: 20.0%), reflecting the effect of these 
non-deductible acquisition costs and the 
geographic diversity of the Group’s profits.
The underlying effective tax rate at 25.8% 
(2016: 26.1%) was lower primarily because 
of the reduction in the rate of UK tax.
Restructuring, acquisition- 
related costs and goodwill
During the year the Group recognised a 
total of £29.0m in restructuring and 
acquisition-related costs (2016: £34.5m). 
These comprised an aggregate 
restructuring charge of £7.7m primarily in 
relation to the integration of the GBR 
Phoenix Beard, Smiths Gore and SEB 
acquisitions (2016: £5.8m) and acquisition-
related costs of £21.3m (2016: £28.7m). 
These costs consist of £2.1m (2016: £1.5m) 
of transaction related costs and £1.4m 
in respect of Savills Investment 
Management’s 2014 acquisition of 
Merchant Capital (2016: £3.9m). In addition, 
there was a £17.8m (2016: £23.3m) charge 
for future consideration payments which 
are contingent on the continuity of 
recipients’ employment in the future.  
The majority of this charge relates to the 
2014 acquisition of Studley. 
At the year end, an impairment review 
established that a charge of £2.3m (2016: 
nil) was recognised relating to the goodwill 
on the Group’s Swedish property 
management business. The residual  
value of goodwill relating to the Swedish 
business is not considered material.
These charges have been excluded from 
the calculation of underlying profit in line 
with Group policy. 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share increased 20%  
to 58.8p (2016: 48.8p), reflecting a 20% 
increase in statutory profit after tax. 
Adjusted on a consistent basis for 
exceptional restructuring, acquisition-
related costs, impairment charges, profits 
and losses on disposals, certain share-
based payment adjustments and 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
(excluding software), underlying basic 
earnings per share increased by 5% to 
75.8p (2016: 72.5p).
Fully diluted earnings per share increased 
by 21% to 57.5p (2016: 47.7p). The 
underlying fully diluted earnings per share 
increased by 4% to 74.1p (2016: 71.0p).
Cash resources, borrowings  
and liquidity
Year end gross cash and cash equivalents 
decreased 7% to £208.8m (2016: £223.6m).  
 
This principally reflected higher acquisition 
activity in the year, in particular the final 
payment of $67.4m to former partners of 
Studley and the initial payment of €54.3m for 
the acquisition of Aguirre Newman on 29 
December 2017 (consisting of €42.0m of the 
initial purchase price, with the excess being 
working capital adjustments). 
Gross borrowings at year end increased to 
£110.2m (2016: £35.8m). These principally 
comprise £106.0m drawn under the 
Group’s multi-currency revolving credit 
facility (‘RCF’).
Cash is typically retained in a number  
of subsidiaries in order to meet the 
requirements of commercial contracts or 
capital adequacy. In addition, cash in 
certain territories is retained to meet future 
growth requirements where to remit it 
would result in the Group suffering 
withholding taxes.
The Group’s net inflow of cash is typically 
greater in the second half of the year. This 
is as a result of seasonality in trading and 
the major cash outflows associated with 
dividends, profit related remuneration 
payments and related payroll taxes in the 
first half. The Group cash inflow for the year 
from operating activities was £111.7m 
(2016: £93.3m) reflecting the Group’s 
increased operating profits. As much of the 
Group’s revenue is transactional in nature, 
the Board’s strategy is to maintain low 
levels of gearing, but retain sufficient credit 
facilities to enable it to meet cash 
requirements during the year and finance 
the majority of business development 
opportunities as they arise. The Group has 
a RCF of £300.0m, with an accordion 
facility of a further £60.0m, which expires 
on 15 December 2020. 
Underlying basic

Savills plc  Report and Accounts 2017 Capital and shareholders’ interests
During the year 0.2m shares (2016: nil) were 
issued to participants under the 
Performance Share Plan. 1.9m (2016: 1.9m) 
new shares were issued in the final 
instalment of deferred consideration for the 
acquisition of Studley. The total number of 
ordinary shares in issue at 31 December 
2017 was 141.9m (2016: 139.8m). 
Savills Pension Scheme
The funding level of the Savills Pension 
Scheme in the UK, which is closed to future 
service-based accrual, improved during the 
year as a result of an increase in the value of 
the plan assets and contributions made 
during the year. The plan deficit at the year 
end amounted to £19.5m (2016: £40.8m).
Net assets
Net assets as at 31 December 2017 were 
£441.7m (2016: £407.0m). This movement 
reflected increased tangible assets and 
receivables derived from the Group’s 
trading performance and the effect of 
acquisitions, primarily Aguirre Newman. 
Key performance indicators (‘KPIs’)
The Group uses a number of KPIs to 
measure its performance and review the 
impact of management strategies.  
These KPIs are detailed under the Key 
Performance Indicators section on pages 
14 and 15. The Group continues to review 
the mix of KPIs to ensure that these best 
measure its performance against its 
strategic objectives, in both financial and 
non-financial areas.
Financial policies and risk 
management
The Group has financial risk management 
policies which cover financial risks 
considered material to the Group’s 
operations and results. These policies are 
subject to continuous review in light of 
developing regulation, accounting standards 
and practice. Compliance with these policies 
is mandatory for all Group companies and is 
reviewed regularly by the Board. Refer to 
Note 3 to the financial statements for further 
information on financial risk management.
Treasury policies and objectives
The Group Treasury policy is designed to 
reduce the financial risks faced by the 
Group, which primarily relate to funding and 
liquidity, interest rate exposure and currency 
rate exposures. The Group does not engage 
in trades of a speculative nature and only 
uses derivative financial instruments to 
hedge certain risk exposures. The Group’s 
financial instruments comprise borrowings, 
cash and liquid resources and various other 
items such as trade receivables and trade 
payables that arise directly from its 
operations. Surplus cash balances are 
generally held with A rated banks or better.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through  
a mixture of retained profits and bank 
borrowings, at both fixed and floating 
interest rates. Borrowings issued at variable 
rates expose the Group cash flow to 
interest rate risk, which is partially offset by 
cash held at variable rates. Borrowings 
issued at fixed rates expose the Group to 
fair value interest rate risk. Group policy is 
to maintain at least 70% of its borrowings in 
fixed rate instruments. 
Liquidity risk
The Group prepares an annual funding 
plan which is approved by the Board and 
sets out the Group’s expected financing 
requirements for the next 12 months. 
These requirements are ordinarily 
expected to be met through existing  
cash balances, loan facilities and  
expected cash flows for the year.
Foreign currency
The Group operates internationally and is 
exposed to foreign exchange risks. As 
both revenue and costs in each location 
are generally denominated in the same 
currency, transaction related risks are 
relatively low and generally associated with 
intra group activities. Consequently, the 
overriding foreign currency risk relates to 
the translation of overseas profits and 
losses into sterling on consolidation.  
The Group does not actively seek to hedge 
risks arising from foreign currency 
translations due to their non-cash nature. 
In a period when sterling weakened 
against all major currencies, the net impact 
of foreign exchange rate movements 
represented a £48.4m increase in revenue 
(2016: £90.6m increase) and an increase of 
£3.9m in underlying profit (2016: £9.0m 
increase). Refer to Note 3.2 to the financial 
statements for further information on 
foreign exchange risk.

Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 Risks and uncertainties facing the business
Identifying and managing our risks 
The Board determines the Group’s appetite 
for risk in pursuit of strategic objectives, and 
the level of risk that can be taken by the 
Group and its operating companies. Savills 
businesses worldwide are responsible for 
executing their activities in accordance with 
the risk appetite set by the Board, 
complemented by the Code of Conduct, 
Group policies and delegated authority limits.
Risk is assessed across the Group using a 
systematic risk management model covering 
both external and internal factors and the 
potential impact and likelihood of those risks 
occurring. Risk assessments are 
incorporated into risk registers at Group and 
business level, which evolve to reflect the 
reduction/increase in identified risks and the 
emergence of new risks. Where it is 
considered that a risk can be mitigated 
further to the benefit of the business, 
responsibilities are assigned and action 
plans are agreed. 
The Group Director of Risk & Assurance 
facilitates the risk assessment and evaluation 
process with Group and regional /business 
unit management on behalf of the Board and 
challenges risk findings and the internal 
control framework to ensure that these are 
effective. Group policies and delegated 
authority levels set by the Board provide the 
basis against which risks are reviewed and 
escalated to the appropriate level within the 
Group, up to and including the Board, for 
review and confirmation.
We have a clear framework for identifying 
and managing risk, both at an operational 
and strategic level. Our risk identification and 
mitigation processes have been designed to 
be appropriate to the ever-changing 
environments in which we operate. 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of risk 
management and internal control. Risk management is 
recognised as an integral part of the Group’s activities.

Economic/country 
risks, particularly the 
impact of a global 
economic downturn
Change from 2016 
Increase
Strategic objective:  
Geographic diversification/ 
Financial strength
Global market conditions are currently 
volatile, with economic uncertainty in 
some sectors and markets, particularly 
the UK after the Brexit vote, the threat by 
the US to impose tariffs and the perceived 
increased risk of the US/North Korea 
tensions escalating with consequential 
economic impact. Group earnings and/
or our financial condition could be 
adversely affected by these and other 
macro-economic uncertainties. Savills 
operates in a number of countries where 
the transactional business is the largest 
component and thereby increases the level 
of economic risk. 
There is a currency risk from operating in a 
large number of countries.
The strength of Savills business and brand and the focus on 
client service. 
Our strategy of diversifying our service offering and 
geographic spread mitigates the impact on the business of 
economic downturns and weak market conditions in specific 
geographies, but these factors cannot entirely mitigate the 
overall risk to earnings. To manage these risks, we continually 
focus on our cost base and seek to improve operational 
efficiencies. 
Contingency plans are in place to enable us to respond 
quickly to market information and economic trends. Continual 
monitoring of market conditions and market changes against 
our Group strategy, supported by the reforecasting and 
reporting in all of our businesses, are key to our ability to 
respond rapidly to changes in our operating environment. 
The actual impacts of Brexit are still unclear, but we are 
monitoring developments closely.
Our exposure to countries with economies which are currently 
weak is balanced by our business in more stable markets. 
When considering new market entry we undertake due 
diligence including the impact assessment of political and 
economic issues in that particular country.
We manage currency risk in local operations through natural 
hedging and matching revenue and costs in the same currency.

reduction in market share and/or a decline 
in revenue. Our focus is on retaining existing 
clients as well as engaging with new clients. 
Our service offering continuously evolves 
and improves to meet the changing needs 
of our clients.
To remain competitive in all markets, we continue to promote 
and differentiate our strengths whilst focusing on providing the 
quality of service that our clients require. 
We continue to invest in the development of client relationships 
globally and associated systems/digital technology to support 
our client service offering.

Legal risk
Change from 2016 
No change
Strategic objective:  
Financial strength/Commitment  
to clients
Failure to fulfil our legal or contractual 
obligations to clients could subject the 
Group to action and/or claims from clients. 
The adverse outcome of such actions/
claims could negatively impact our 
reputation, financial condition and/or the 
results of our businesses. For example:
•  in accepting client engagements, Group 
companies may be subject to duty of 
care obligations. Failure to satisfy these 
obligations could result in claims being 
made against the relevant operating 
Company;
•  in our Property Management business, 
we may be responsible for appointing 
third party contractors that provide 
construction and engineering services. 
Failure to discharge these responsibilities 
in accordance with our obligations could 
result in claims being made against the 
operating companies;
•  in our valuation consultancy businesses, 
we can be subject to claims alleging the 
over-valuation of properties.
The Group has a range of policies in place including client 
acceptance, legal and regulatory compliance, procurement, 
contractor management and valuation. 
We have Best Practice groups, policies, procedures and 
training which are designed to deliver the relevant contractual 
obligations and thereby mitigate against the risk of such 
actions/claims being made and where such claims occur,  
to limit liability, particularly in relation to consultancy services 
such as valuations. Such policies are regularly reviewed.
The Group maintains professional indemnity insurance to 
respond to and mitigate the Group’s financial exposure to  
such claims.
As described below, our strong emphasis on appropriate 
business conduct by all our employees, contractors and 
associates further mitigates this risk.

Strategic objective:  
Financial strength/Commitment  
to clients
Major failures in our IT systems may result 
in client service being interrupted or data 
being lost/corrupted causing damage to our 
reputation and consequential client and/or 
revenue loss.
There is a risk that an attack on our 
infrastructure by a malicious individual or 
group could be successful and impact the 
availability of critical systems.
Specific back-up and resilience requirements are built into 
our systems. Our critical infrastructure is set up so far as is 
reasonably practical to prevent unauthorised access and 
reduce the likelihood and impact of a successful attack.
Our data centres are accredited to international information 
security standards.
Business continuity and disaster recovery plans are in place to 
cover the residual risks that cannot be mitigated.
We are continuously reviewing our resilience to cyber security 
attacks due to the constant threat.

Strategic objective:  
Business diversification/Geographical

We operate in international markets that 
may present business conduct-related risks 
involving, for example, fraud, bribery or 
corruption.
Failure by the Group and its employees to 
observe the highest standards of integrity and 
conduct in dealing with clients, suppliers and 
other stakeholders could result in civil and/
or criminal penalties, regulatory sanction, 
debarring and/or reputational damage.
We have programmes to promote compliance with our Code of 
Conduct, particularly in areas of higher risk such as procurement.
We have a zero tolerance approach to breaches of our Code of 
Conduct.

regulatory 
environment

Strategic objective:  
Commitment to clients
We are required to meet a broad range of regulatory 
compliance requirements in each of the markets in which 
we operate. For example: 
•  some of our operations have regulatory licences;
•  in the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) 
regulates the conduct of Savills Capital Advisors 
and, both generally and in relation to the Alternative 
Investment Fund Managers Directive, Savills 
Investment Management, and the insurance 
intermediary services provided to clients by Savills 
UK; our businesses are regulated by The Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors (‘RICS’);
•  Savills Investment Management entities are variously 
regulated by the Bank of Italy, FCA in Japan, BaFin in 
Germany and CSSF in Luxembourg;
•  various countries, corporate entities and individuals 
are subject to financial sanctions, which require 
continuous monitoring in response to global events.
Failure to satisfy regulatory compliance requirements 
may result in fines being imposed, adverse publicity, 
brand/reputation damage and ultimately the withdrawal 
of regulatory approvals.
We also have a number of key statutory obligations 
including the protection of the health, safety and 
welfare of our staff and others affected by our activities. 
Environmental reporting requirements place  
data-gathering responsibilities on our business in 
common with other listed companies. Our current 
priorities are on achieving readiness for the General 
Data Protection Regulation.
Our Group Policy Framework, which sets out  
our standards for professional, regulatory,  
statutory compliance and business conduct,  
is reviewed regularly.
To support this Framework each business has  
its own regulatory and statutory compliance resources 
who monitor regulatory developments and maintain 
the internal processes and controls required to fulfil our 
compliance obligations. 
Our compliance environment, at all levels, is subject  
to regular review by internal audit and external 
assurance providers.

The structuring and integration of acquisitions is critical 
to realising the benefits sought. People, systems and

We apply the Group acquisitions policy and 
procedures and use professional advisers in the  
due diligence process, and allocate responsibility and 
accountability to individuals for integration. Post-
acquisition reporting keeps the Board aware  
of progress against plan.
Viability Statement 
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) requires the Company to issue a viability statement stating whether the Board believes that the 
Group is able to continue to operate and meet its liabilities, taking into account its current position and principal risks. In accordance with the Code, 
the Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three-year period to 31 December 2020, taking account of the Group’s current position 
and the potential impact of the principal risks documented in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 35. This longer-term assessment supports the 
Board’s statements on both viability, as set out below, and going concern as set out on page 50.
The Directors have concluded that the three-year period is appropriate for this assessment being consistent with the period covered by the 
Group’s strategic plan and the cyclical nature of property markets.
In assessing viability the Directors considered a number of factors including the resilience of the Group, taking account of its current position 
and prospects, the Group’s strategic plan, the principal risks and uncertainties facing the business and the Board’s risk appetite as detailed 
in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 35. The strategy and associated principal risks which underpin the Group’s three-year plan, are 
reviewed by the Directors at least annually. The Directors also satisfied themselves that they have the evidence necessary to support the 
statement in terms of the effectiveness of the internal control environment in place to mitigate risk.
Sensitivity analysis was undertaken on the three year plan, including financing projections, to flex the financial forecasts under a variety of 
scenarios, which involve applying different assumptions to the underlying forecast both individually and in aggregate, including assessing the 
potential impact of a severe economic downturn analogous to that experienced during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008/09. The results of this 
sensitivity analysis showed that the Group would be able to withstand the impact of such scenarios over the period of the financial forecast.
Performance against the three year plan is monitored on an ongoing basis, including regular Board briefings provided by the Heads of the 
Principal Businesses on the progress made by those businesses. These reviews consider both the market opportunity and the associated 
risks. These risks are considered within the Board’s risk appetite framework. 
Based on the results of this review, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period ending 31 December 2020. 
The Directors also considered it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis as explained in Note 2. 1 to the accounts.

Savills plc  Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate Responsibility
Savills is committed to being a good 
corporate citizen in all aspects of its 
operations and activities. The Company, 
therefore, holds itself accountable for  
its social, environmental and economic 
impacts on the people and places  
where it does business. 
All of our businesses are required to  
comply with local legal standards as an 
absolute minimum.
We endeavour to manage our impact in a 
responsible and sustainable manner. To fulfil 
this aim the Group actively embraces  
a range of policies and practices that aim to 
foster a positive approach towards corporate 
responsibility as an integral part of our 
day-to-day activities.
We focus on those key areas where we 
believe we can make a difference and our 
localised approach provides the flexibility 
required to have meaning and impact at a 
local level. At Savills, we learn through 
experience and we actively encourage our 
businesses to share their experiences and 
develop best practice to ensure that we 
continue to improve as an organisation.
Responsibility for our CR programme sits with 
the Group Chief Executive and the Board. CR 
strategy is co-ordinated by our CR Steering 
Group, comprising senior representatives from 
a range of businesses and central teams. The 
strategy is implemented and delivered at 
country level focusing on four aspects of CR 
which we believe are key to the success of our 
business and where we believe we can make 
the most difference: People, Clients, 
Environment and Community. Through a 
localised approach and by focusing on these 
key areas we give our businesses the freedom 
to adapt quickly and to respond at a local level 
to new opportunities in the markets in which 
they operate. The Board receives annual and 
ad hoc updates on CR activities and progress. 
To ensure that we can readily identify emerging 
issues and respond to them on a timely basis, 
we continue to include the consideration of 
CR-related issues in our Key Risk Registers.

30 Our People
Developing our people for  
the long term
We want people to grow their careers at 
Savills and develop the skills and talent 
needed to grow our business. We firmly 
believe in the value of developing future 
talent from within the Group and the wider 
business community and we are working 
hard to help nurture the entrepreneurs and 
leaders of the future.
We continue to invest significantly in the 
development of all our people, for whom  
we recognise that career development and 
progression is very important.
We deliver training and development in all 
areas including management and leadership, 
client and business skills and professional 
and technical skills. We recognise that 
personal development occurs in many ways 
and we encourage all our staff to attend 
conferences, internal events, and participate 
in projects to supplement their Continuous 
Professional Development (‘CPD’). 
For example, in the UK, the format of our 
training varies from one-hour masterclasses, 
webinars, and video content, to two-day 
pitching courses and management and 
leadership workshops. We encourage and 
support all our staff to complete their CPD 
and all our internal courses/programmes have 
CPD points associated with them. All of this is 
supported by a dedicated training team, who 
offer individual career development advice 
and a dedicated page on the Company 
intranet which pulls together all the 
information our people need to plan their 
personal development. In order to manage 
individual development and ongoing learning, 
we have launched a Learning Management 
System (LMS) in the UK. The LMS is mobile 
compatible, allows individuals to track and 
manage their development, watch video 
podcasts and download course materials.
In Asia, we are progressively extending our 
CPD programme, tailoring it as appropriate 
to best meet local requirements. 
We have also extended our CPD programme 
across the US.
Our graduates are our future leaders. They 
are given responsibility from the day they join 
the business, in teams which highly value 
their contribution, allowing them to be 
involved in some of the world’s most 
high-profile transactions and developments. 
Graduates are surrounded by experienced 
professionals and team members from 
whom they can seek advice and learn. 
Individual achievement is rewarded and 
Savills looks for graduates with 
entrepreneurial flair and diverse skills. In the 
UK, Savills were proud to be named The 
Times Graduate Employer of choice for 
Property for the 11th year in a row and we 
continue to see a record number of 
applicants for this and our student summer 
scheme and work placement programmes. 
In 2017 Savills was also ranked 83 (up 11 
places) in the Times Top 100 Graduate 
Employers and number 1 on “Rate my 
Placement” for our summer scheme 
programme. We continue to work with some 
of our UK industry peers, the Changing the 
Face of Property (‘CTFOP’ group), on 
initiatives such as an apprenticeship 
programme to offer jobs to school leavers.
In the US, Savills we implemented a Young 
Leaders Programme and our Savills Studley 
Academy, a multi-year business mentorship 
programme aimed at harnessing the talent 
of the rising stars, is now in it’s second year.
In 2017, in Asia Pacific, we ran four Inspire 
courses in Greater China, North Asia, South 
East Asia and Australia; a two-year course 
for emerging leaders of the business who will 
be assigned a lifetime mentor and schooled 
in the art of business leadership. In 2018 we 
are launching the Inspire Programme for the 
next generation of leaders in the business. 
It is our vision to be the real estate 
advisor of choice in our selected 
markets and deliver superior financial 
performance and this can only be 
achieved through the dedication, 
commitment and excellence of 
our people. 
Our people strategy remains focused on 
supporting delivery of the highest standards 
of client service through motivated and 
engaged people. We believe that a positive 
culture is essential to high quality client 
service. This positive culture is encapsulated 
in our business philosophy and our values. 
Our reputation has been built on our people 
and we believe that staff whose behaviours 
reflect in our business philosophy deliver the 
excellent client service that we strive to 
provide. Our business philosophy also 
captures our commitment to ethical, 
professional and responsible conduct and our 
entrepreneurial, value-enhancing approach.
Our people strategy highlights are set out 
below.
Employee engagement 
We continue to focus on employee 
engagement through a number of areas of 
focus. For example, in the UK we are 
improving the capability of our leaders and 
managers through our key programmes 
Empower, Engage and Inspire. We have 
improved the clarity of our reward and 
benefits through the use of a new Total 
Reward Statement, so that all our employees 
clearly see the full reward package. We take 
employee wellbeing seriously and have 
introduced a wellbeing programme, which 
includes Savills focused events and 
committing to the Time to Change pledge, for 
increased recognition of mental health in the 
workplace, on World Mental Health Day.

Our People continued
A diverse and inclusive culture 
We look to create an inclusive culture in which 
difference is accepted and valued. We believe 
that our inclusive approach gives us a 
competitive advantage and underpins the 
success of our business by giving us the ability 
to select our people from the highest quality 
individuals in the widest available pool of talent.
Our people come from a wide range of 
backgrounds and have a diverse range of 
skills and experience. We believe that we 
have created a culture in which those skills, 
experience and perspectives are nurtured 
and encouraged. As an example of our 
commitment to diversity, in the UK we are 
focused on increasing the diversity of our 
business in order to reflect the needs of our 
clients and have achieved the RICS Equality 
Mark. We are fully engaged in a diversity 
programme ‘Changing the Face of Property’ 
which focuses on improving diversity across 
social and economic background, disability, 
LBGT, age and gender. We have also 
improved our maternity policy, introduced 
mentoring and coaching for women and held 
a number of events with clients and keynote 
speakers. In addition, we proactively review 
our promotions to ensure that the numbers 
going forward for promotion, by gender, are 
in line with the make-up of the division. For 
the LBGT network, we have held a number 
of events, participated in the London Pride 
March and we are now listed on the 
Stonewall Diversity Index.
We believe that creating an inclusive and 
diverse culture supports the attraction and 
retention of talented people and supports 
effective performance. We respect our 
people for who they are, their knowledge, 
skills and experience as individuals and as 
valued members of the Savills team. We 
work together to bring out the best in each 
other and to sustain the strong working 
relationship ethic that has nurtured our ‘can 
do’ attitude. As at 31 December 2017 our 
total global workforce of 35,398 colleagues 
comprised 19,327 males and 16,071 
females. Of these, 184 were senior 
executives (163 males, 21 females) 
comprising members of the Group Executive 
Board and Board members of the corporate 
entities whose financial information is 
incorporated in the Group’s 2017 
consolidated accounts in this Annual Report. 
The Company’s Board of Directors 
comprised seven members – six males  
and one female.
The UK Government has introduced 
legislation that will require employers with 
250 or more UK employees to disclose 
information on their gender pay gap. The 
gender pay picture for Savills UK, calculated 
in accordance with the published 
requirements has been published on  
the Savills UK’s website. 
UK – Savills Diversity Group 
One of our initiatives was to launch a Diversity Group in the UK which is now in its 
third year. The objective is to highlight the diversity of our business and ensure that we 
are communicating clearly and effectively about our people and our clients. This year 
has seen a number of significant activities for our Diversity group. We have launched 
“unconscious bias” training led by the UK Executive Committee, which is now part of 
all development programmes including Company induction. Wellbeing and mental 
health have also been key areas of focus. Other Initiatives which the Diversity Group 
continue to be involved in include:
1. Savills with schools
Our current graduates attend a local state secondary school to deliver presentations about 
careers in property. This highlights the variety of roles in real estate as well as opportunities 
for students to engage on an individual basis.
2. Careers in property
Savills Graduate team collate a guide to the real estate industry, looking at careers in  
the industry from governing bodies, educational institutions and employers to provide 
candidates with a comprehensive guide to joining the industry. This is currently shared 
with all UK university careers services in the UK. We also support the Property Needs  
You and Urban Plan campaigns in schools.
3. Apprenticeships
Savills Surveying Apprentices join teams across the UK. After six years in the business 
they will gain their BSc in Real Estate and their full MRICS status.
4.Changing the Face of Property (CTFOP)
We continue to be a member of the CTFOP group, a collaboration of employers, 
governing bodies and education providers who work together to raise awareness of the 
industry, and drive equality. We attend the Skills London as well as a number of career 
fairs, and supported the Trailblazer Apprenticeship scheme with RICS. We also ran a 
number of internal diversity events for our Gender and LGBT groups. We also 
participated in the London Pride March with the rest of the CTFOP companies.
As an organisation committed to diversity in its 
workforce, we will continue to strengthen our 
policies, processes and practices to develop 
our diversity and inclusion plans within the 
Group’s markets and geographies, in 
alignment with our corporate goals. We will 
continue to endeavour to improve the 
representation of women at Board and senior 
levels within the organisation and to sustain an 
inclusive culture in which all talent can thrive.
Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017
32 Excellent client service is at the core  
of our business. We strive to develop 
strong, long-term partnerships with our 
clients and to deliver an exceptional and 
personal client experience which is 
tailored to our clients’ requirements and 
needs. We do this by ensuring we have 
specialist teams who can deliver the 
best quality advice throughout the 
property life cycle. We work hard to 
ensure that in managing our client 
relationships we are solutions-oriented, 
pro-active and focused on excellent 
client communication. 
Gaining a deep understanding of our clients’ 
businesses through an ongoing dialogue is 
fundamental to delivering a service which 
meets their needs. Client review meetings are 
a vital part of our approach to client care. We 
invest in an independent client review 
programme to understand how well we plan 
and execute the services we provide, how well 
we communicate and what additional value 
we give our clients. This provides an important 
independent rating of the standard of our client 
service which is reviewed regularly and used 
to refine the Savills client experience. 
In the UK, for example, Savills top clients have 
a dedicated client relationship lead (client 
advocate) whose core responsibility is to act 
as a focal point for client servicing enquiries, 
and, in particular, to allow any service issues 
on current instructions to be quickly identified 
and addressed. These client advocates also 
play a key role in reviewing our performance 
with our clients, in tandem with the client 
review programme, ensuring we understand 
where we have met or exceeded expectations 
and those areas in which we can do better. 
Ultimately this approach provides a complete 
insight into our clients’ priorities so that we can 
make the appropriate skills, expertise and 
resources available. 
We recognise that there are clients that 
benefit from a full Savills service offering.  
To deliver the best value to these clients we 
have a client management programme in 
place with a dedicated Client Relationship 
Management (‘CRM’) team. Each of these 
clients has a tailored client care plan which 
includes a review of the current year, key 
client priorities, client communications and 
interactions, financials and importantly, 
agreed actions and responsibilities. Our  
client teams are further supported by a 
central client management system which 
consolidates client data into readily 
accessible client intelligence reports, ensuring 
we are providing the joined up approach  
our clients expect. 
We are progressively extending this approach 
globally, tailored to meet local requirements.
Our Clients
Across our global business Savills is 
committed to reducing the impact that 
our operations have on the natural 
environment and to minimising the risk 
of injury and ill health staff and others 
who are affected by our businesses by 
providing safe and healthy working 
environments.
Safe working practices form an integral part 
of our day-to-day business and we aim to find 
practical solutions to health and safety risks. 
To this end, our safety strategy is focused on 
priorities such as reducing occupational 
exposure to workplace hazards, maintaining 
regulatory compliance and seeking to 
continuously develop and strengthen our 
health and safety arrangements.
Environmental impact
Across our global business, Savills is 
committed to reducing the impact that our 
operations have on the natural environment. 
By actively seeking to reduce our 
environmental impact, we are able to achieve 
increased operational efficiencies and 
savings, both internally and for our clients. 
As one of the leading real estate advisors, 
Savills acknowledges the importance of 
demonstrating leadership in this area. This 
includes measuring, and being accountable 
for, our global environmental impact. 
For example, in Australia, we engage 
proactively with several key industry and 
not-for-profit environmental groups, including 
Property Council Australia, The Green 
Building Council and Sydney’s Better  
Building Partnership. 
As part of this continuing drive to mitigate our 
impacts, and as a hallmark of quality, our 
offices continue to work to secure ISO14001 
2004 status: the international standard for 
environmental management systems. 255 
Savills teams in the UK have now achieved this 
accreditation. During 2018 the accreditations 
in place will transition to the revised 2015 
edition of the 140001 international standard. 
In Hong Kong, Savills continues to participate 
in various environmental protection activities, 
such as Chinese New Year Waste Electrical 
and Electronic Equipment Recycling 
Collection Services (awards were obtained by 
25 our managed buildings), Wood Recycling 
and Tree Conservation Scheme and a 
scheme on Source Separation of Commercial 
and Industrial Waste.
In the UK, Savills has worked to improve the 
environmental performance of its own office 
estate through a series of waste and energy 
management initiatives. During 2017, Savills 
moved to a national contract for the disposal 
of non-hazardous waste streams, the new 
contract currently covers 75% of some 127 
offices. Moving to a national contract has 
enabled the introduction of enhanced 
recycling facilities at a local level, as well as 
additional control over the final destination  
of our waste, avoiding landfill disposal 
wherever possible.
Greenhouse gas emissions 
Our Greenhouse Gas Emissions Statement 
includes all emission sources required under 
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 for 
the financial year to 31 December 2017, 
compared against our baseline year to 
31 December 2013. For comparative 
purposes, data is also shown for our 
previous reporting year, 2016. 
Scope
We continue to expand the scope of our 
data collection regularly. In consequence, 
we are now reporting on GHG emissions at 
a more granular level from our UK, Europe, 
US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong 
Kong, Japan, Singapore, and key Chinese 
operations. In subsequent years, we will 
continue to strive to add to this list where 
emission activities are found to be material 
and where reliable activity data is available. 
Our Responsibility to the Environment

S a v ill s p l c  
Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Methodology
To coordinate the collection of GHG data 
worldwide, a network of Environmental 
Reporting Nominees (ERN) has been 
established, reporting to the Group Legal 
Director & Company Secretary. Specialist 
third party verified environmental reporting 
software has been adopted by this network 
to ease data collection, ensure data quality, 
disseminate results effectively, and complete 
emission calculations more efficiently. 
The adopted reporting methodology is the 
GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard. Through the ERN 
network we have attempted to calculate 
greenhouse gas emissions using actual 
activity data for the reporting period, 
wherever possible. In the instances where 
Corporate Responsibility continued
Our Responsibility to the Environment continued
activity data was not found to be wholly 
reliable or readily available, we have 
determined the relevant emissions by using  
a range of standard carbon accounting 
measures, including extrapolating data and 
use of indicator based estimation (floor area 
and head count). To allow easier comparison 
between reporting locations and year on year 
results, a standardised per capita intensity 
ratio (based on the number of full-time 
equivalent employees) has been utilised. We 
consider that this is the most effective means 
of reflecting our wide range of activities in a 
quantifiable common factor. 
As evident in the table below, our total 
emissions decreased by approximately  
4.49% in 2017 .
The corresponding figures for our per capita 
intensity ratio show a 7 .7% reduction 
compared to the previous year, which is 
particularly pleasing given our global FTE 
numbers increased by more than 3% during 
the reporting period. When measured against 
our base year of 2013, this now represents an 
improvement of more than 20%.
This substantial reduction has been achieved 
through progressive initiatives to improve the 
environmental efficiency of our offices, 
including more energy efficient lighting, better 
climate control and IT upgrades. These 
measures are complemented by broader 
sustainability strategies at the corporate level 
and include the application of green building 
principles during the selection/refurbishment 
of our occupied spaces, space consolidation, 
and the continued focus on improving energy 
metering/monitoring.

Commitment
Savills is confident in making 
continued steady reductions to our 
corporate environmental footprint in 
the coming years. To that end, the 
Group Executive Board, in October 
2017, resolved to adopt a global 
objective of a 5% total global reduction 
target over a 3 year period, calculated 
against the 2016 reported GHG 
emissions figures, normalised by 
utilising the Full Time Equivalent (FTE) 
year average employee numbers.

Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Chairman’s introduction
The Main Principles of the Code provide the 
framework for the reporting model which we 
continue to use. Our approach to: 
• Leadership is set out on pages 40 to 46
• Effectiveness is described on  
pages 47 to 49;
• Relations with Shareholders and  
Other Stakeholders is described on  
page 50; and
• Accountability is described on  
pages 50 to 55.
The Board is committed to maintaining the 
highest standards of corporate governance, 
which are fundamental to discharging our 
responsibilities. As Chairman, it is my role to 
ensure the highest standards of governance 
are promoted by the Board and to ensure 
that the Group is governed and managed in 
the best interests of shareholders and wider 
stakeholders. This includes encouraging 
open discussion and constructive challenge. 
In this report, we set out our governance 
framework and explain how robust and 
effective corporate governance practices 
enable the Group to deliver its strategy and 
create long-term shareholder value. Further 
information on our strategy and business 
model can be found on pages 2 to 35.  
To support the Board, in 2017 we extended 
the remit of the Nomination Governance 
Committee to include the monitoring of the 
Company’s compliance with applicable 
codes and other requirements of corporate 
governance and the Committee was 
renamed the Nomination & Governance 
Committee.
We continue to work hard to maintain a 
culture where ‘doing the right thing’ is at the 
core of how we do business. As custodian  
of Savills culture the Board demands 
openness and transparency to maintain an 
environment in which honesty, integrity and 
fairness are valued and practised by our 
people every day. The Board’s behaviour and 
the values it demonstrates set the tone to 
guide our people’s behaviour and ensure that 
we live by and demonstrate the right values 
which in turn enable entrepreneurial and 
prudent management to deliver long-term 
success for the Group and its stakeholders.

to introduce our 2017 Corporate 
Governance Report. Governance best 
practice continues to evolve and in this

Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and

Committees have operated in 2017.”
38
Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 It is important in my role as Chairman to 
ensure that the Board has the right blend of 
skills and experience. As an international 
business, we benefit from our Non-
Executive Directors’ knowledge of and 
involvement with other businesses in Hong 
Kong and China, Europe and the US. At 
least half of the Board members throughout 
the year were Independent Non-Executive 
Directors (excluding me, as Chairman). The 
details of their skills and experience are, 
along with those of the other Board 
members, set out on pages 44 and 45.  
In accordance with the Code, each Director 
will stand for re-election at the 2018 AGM  
on 8 May 2018. The Board also reviews 
Non-Executive Director independence on  
an annual basis and takes into account the 
individual’s experience, their behaviour at 
Board meetings and their contribution to 
unbiased and independent debate. The 
Board considers that all of the Non-
Executive Directors bring considerable 
management expertise and strong 
independent oversight. All of the Non-
Executive Directors are considered by the 
Board to be independent, including Charles 
McVeigh, notwithstanding his long service.
The Board is committed to a culture that 
attracts and retains talented people to deliver 
outstanding performance and further 
enhance the success of the Group.  
The Board recognises the benefits of having 
diversity across all areas of the Group. We are 
committed to eliminating discrimination and 
encouraging diversity amongst our people. 
Our aims are that our business will be truly 
representative of all sections of society and 
that each employee feels respected and able 
to give their best. The Company’s policy on 
diversity applies across all levels of the Group 
and further details of the policy can be found 
in the Corporate Responsibility (‘CR’) section 
on pages 30 to 35.
During the year, the Audit Committee 
reviewed the FRC’s Guidance on Audit 
Committees. The Audit Committee was  
satisfied that the Company complies with 
the 2016 Code, and has considered the 
Guidance on Audit Committees.
At our AGM in 2017, we received support  
for our Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
Policy from 99% of Shareholders voting. 
The 2017 Remuneration Report (pages 58  
to 73) provides a summary of the Policy 
approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM 
and a detailed review of the Remuneration 
Committee’s activities, and bonus and share 
scheme performance, in 2017. 
We believe that engaging with our 
Shareholders and encouraging an open, 
meaningful dialogue between Shareholders 
and the Company is vital to ensuring mutual 
understanding. We are in regular contact 
with our major Shareholders and potential 
Shareholders through a regular, scheduled 
programme of meetings as part of our 
continuing commitment to this open and 
transparent dialogue. You can read more 
about Shareholder engagement on page 50 
and in the meantime, my fellow Directors 
and I look forward to continued dialogue  
and meeting with Shareholders at our AGM 
in May where I will be happy to answer any 
further questions.
Overall I remain happy with the Board’s 
activity across our governance agenda. 
However, we will continue to challenge 
ourselves and the business and to consider 
and to learn from our decisions to ensure 
that we build upon the existing strength of 
our governance structure.
Nicholas Ferguson CBE
Chairman of Savills plc
14 March 2018
In line with the requirements of the  
Code we continue to test the Board’s 
effectiveness and performance annually 
through a formal evaluation. 
This is facilitated by an independent external 
consultant at least once every three years. 
JCA Consultants externally facilitated the 
review in 2016, so this year’s evaluation was 
conducted in-house, led by the Chairman and 
facilitated by the Group legal director & 
Company Secretary. The process, key 
conclusions and areas of focus for 2018 are 
set out on page 49. Following this review, I am 
satisfied that the Board continues to perform 
effectively and in particular I am confident that 
the Board has the right balance of skills, 
experience and diversity of personality to 
continue to encourage open, transparent 
debate and challenge. 
The Board recognises the recommended 
term for Non-Executive Directors within the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and it is 
mindful of the need for suitable succession. 
In 2018 we have started the process of 
recruiting a further Non-Executive Director. 
On 16 January 2018 we announced that, 
after 11 years in the role, Jeremy Helsby 
intended to retire as Group Chief Executive 
Officer at the end of the 2018 financial year. 
During 2017 the Board, through the 
Nomination & Governance Committee, 
completed the process to recruit his 
successor. Following a comprehensive 
review, it was agreed that Mark Ridley, 
currently CEO of Savills UK and Europe, 
should be offered the role of Group Chief 
Executive Officer with effect from 1 January 
2019, and to join the Board as an additional 
Executive Director and Deputy Group Chief 
Executive Officer effective from 1 May 2018.

How the Board Operates
The Board has formally adopted a schedule of matters reserved to it for decision. A full schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s decision 
along with the Terms of Reference of the Board’s principal Committees can be found on the Company’s website at www.savills.com/en/
company-information/corporate-governance.aspx.
The Board and Committee meetings are structured to allow open discussion. To enable the Board to discharge its duties, each Director 
receives appropriate and timely information. Board papers are circulated electronically via a secure portal, giving Directors sufficient time 
to consider and digest their contents. When unable to be present in person, Directors may attend by audio or video conference.  
When Directors are unable to attend a Board or Committee meeting, their views on the key items of business to be considered at that 
meeting are relayed in advance to the Chairman of that meeting in order that these can be presented at the meeting and be considered  
in the debate. 
Regular attendance at Board meetings by the Heads of Principal Businesses on matters of significance ensures that the Board has the 
opportunity to discuss business risks and opportunities with leaders from across the Group. The Group Legal Director & Company 
Secretary provides the Board with updates and reports covering legal developments and regulatory changes. The Chairman, together  
with the Group Legal Director & Company Secretary, ensures that the Directors receive management information, including financial, 
operating and strategic reports, in advance of Board meetings. 
At its meetings during the year, the Board discharged its responsibilities and received updates on the Group’s financial performance,  
key management changes, material new projects, investment proposals, financial plans, and legal and regulatory updates.

Nomination & Governance Committee Report
The Nomination & Governance Committee (“Committee”) has an important role 
to play in ensuring that the Board and its principal Committees have the right mix 
of skills, experience and diversity to deliver Group strategy and to create value. 
The Committee keeps under review and evaluates the composition of the Board 
and its Committees to maintain the appropriate balance of skills, knowledge and 
independence to be able to function effectively.
Committee meetings 
The Committee met three times during 2017 and each meeting had 
full attendance. Members of the Committee also attend the 
Company’s AGM at which there is an opportunity to meet with 
Shareholders. Any other Director, the Group Legal Director & 
Company Secretary or an external advisor may be invited by the 
Committee to attend the meetings from time to time, as appropriate. 
Committee Terms of Reference
During the year the remit of the Committee was extended to 
include the monitoring of the Company’s compliance with 
applicable Codes and other requirements of Corporate 
Governance and the Committee was renamed the Nomination & 
Governance Committee. The revised Terms of Reference for the 
Committee to this effect were submitted to the Board for formal 
approval and adopted on 15 June 2017.
Board composition and balance
Balance of Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors
 Non-Executive Chairman – 1 
 Non-Executive Directors – 4 
 Executive Directors – 2
Length of tenure of Non-Executive Directors
 0–4 years – 3   5–9 years – 1   10+ years – 1
At all times during the year at least half of the Board members, excluding the Chairman, were 
Independent Non-Executive Directors.
Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of Chairman and Group Chief Executive are distinct and 
separate and their roles and responsibilities are clearly established. 
The Chairman leads the Board and has particular responsibility for 
the effectiveness of the Group’s governance. In promoting a culture 
of openness he ensures the effective engagement and contribution 
of all Executive and Non-Executive Directors. To help ensure a 
proper dialogue with all Directors, the Chairman meets periodically 
with the Directors individually and the Non-Executive Directors as a 
group (and without the Executive Directors). The Group Chief 
Executive has responsibility for all Group businesses and acts in 
accordance with the authority delegated by the Board. There are a 
number of areas where the Board has delegated specific 
responsibility to management, including responsibility for the 
operational management of the Group’s businesses as well as 
reviewing strategic issues and risk matters in advance of these 
being considered by the Board and/or its Committees. The Board 
considers that throughout the year the Company was in full 
compliance with the Code.
Assessment of the Independence of Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman is committed to ensuring the Board comprises a 
majority of Independent Non-Executive Directors who objectively 
challenge management, balanced against the need to ensure 
continuity in the Board. On an annual basis, the Board reviews the 
independence of its Non-Executive Directors, particularly those 
with long service. The Non-Executive Directors are responsible for 
bringing independent and objective judgement and scrutiny to 
matters before the Board and its Committees. The Board considers 
that all of the Non-Executive Directors bring considerable expertise, 
strong independent oversight and continue to and are Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, being independent of management and 
having no business or other relationship which could interfere 
materially with the exercise of their judgement. In particular, 
notwithstanding his long service on the Board, the Board continues 
to consider that Charles McVeigh remains entirely independent in 
character and judgement. His experience provides valuable insight, 
knowledge and continuity. The Board recognises the benefit of 
progressively refreshing its membership and therefore is 
commencing the search for a Non-Executive Director in 2018.
Time commitment and conflicts
The Board is satisfied that the Chairman and each of the Non-
Executive Directors committed sufficient time during the year to 
enable them to fulfil their duties as Directors of the Company.

Savills plc  Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Effectiveness continued
The Companies Act 2006 places a duty on 
each Director to avoid a situation in which he 
or she has or can have a direct or indirect 
interest which conflicts or may conflict with 
the interests of the Company. A Director will 
not be in breach of that duty if the relevant 
matter has been authorised by the other 
Directors in accordance with the Articles. 
The Board has adopted a set of guiding 
principles on managing conflicts and 
approved a process for identifying current 
and future actual and potential conflicts of 
interest. The Nomination & Governance 
Committee review authorised conflicts at 
least annually or if and when a new potential 
conflict situation was identified or a potential 
conflict situation materialised. During 2017, 
actual and potential conflicts of interest that 
were identified by each Director were 
subsequently authorised by the Nomination 
& Governance Committee, subject to 
appropriate conditions in accordance with 
the guiding principles. Procedures adopted 
to deal with conflicts of interest continue to 
operate effectively and the Board’s 
authorisation powers continue to be 
exercised properly in accordance with the 
Company’s Articles of Association.
Committee activities during the year
The Committee has standing items that it 
considers regularly under its Terms of 
Reference; for example, the Committee 
considered and approved Directors’ 
potential conflicts of interest and reviewed its 
own Terms of Reference (which are reviewed 
at least annually or as required, eg to reflect 
changes to the Code or as a result of 
changes in regulations or best practice).
Group Chief Executive Succession
On 16 January 2018 we announced that, after 
1 1 years in the role, Jeremy Helsby would retire 
as Group Chief Executive Officer at the end of 
the 2018 financial year. During the 2017 
financial year the Board, through the 
Committee, commenced the process to 
identify and appoint a new Group Chief 
Executive Officer who would succeed Jeremy 
Helsby effective 1 January 2019. The process, 
which included evaluation of the merits of 
selecting an external candidate, was 
undertaken by the Committee and led by the 
Chairman. The Committee undertook a series 
of reviews to scope out the key skills, 
experience, characteristics and requirements 
for the role. The Committee agreed that, taking 
into account all relevant available information, 
Mark Ridley, currently Chief Executive of Savills 
UK and Europe,was the strongest candidate. A 
meeting of the Committee formally considered 
Mark Ridley’s suitability for the role. The 
Committee noted his considerable existing 
knowledge of the Group (as a member of the 
Group Executive Board since its establishment 
in 2008) and its business and his proven track 
record as Chief Executive of Savills UK  
(since 2008) & Europe (since 2013). The 
Committee unanimously concluded that it 
should recommend that Mark Ridley be 
offered the role of Group Chief Executive 
Officer with effect from 1 January 2019, and 
that he should join the Board as an additional 
Executive Director and Deputy Group Chief 
Executive Officer effective from 1 May 2018. 
Further details on Mark Ridley’s skills and 
experience is set out on page 46.
In addition, and specifically during the year, 
the Committee: 
• reviewed the Group’s senior level 
succession plans to ensure that these 
remained appropriate;
• reviewed and approved the succession 
plan for senior management in the UK 
businesses to be implemented on Mark 
Ridley’s appointment to the Board as 
Deputy Group Chief Executive; 
• considered Board succession planning 
including the tenure, mix and diversity of 
skills and experience of the existing 
Board Members in the context of the 
Group’s strategy;
• considered the proposed reappointment 
of the Non-Executive Directors, before 
making a recommendation to the Board 
that each Non-Executive be proposed to 
shareholders for re-election at the 2018 
AGM; and
• considered and authorised the Directors’ 
actual and potential conflict of interests.
In consultation with the Chairmen of the 
Board Committees, the Nomination & 
Governance Committee will continue to 
monitor the needs of the Board and its 
Committees in the context of the delivery  
of the Group’s strategy, with the aim of 
ensuring that the Group’s succession 
planning policy evolves such that there is an 
identifiable supply of talent and experience 
available to the Board and its Committees 
from which to select successors.
Board composition, succession 
planning and diversity
Board succession is a key topic at Committee 
meetings and we recognise the importance of 
planning for the future and of having 
succession plans in place which introduce 
new skills and perspectives to the Board and 
which complement the experience of the 
existing Board members. The Committee 
continues to keep the Board’s composition 
under review and considers how that 
composition might be enhanced to ensure 
that the Board continues to best meet the 
needs of the Company and its Shareholders. 
The biographies of the Board members 
appear on pages 44 and 45.
The Committee has sought to maintain a 
balance of skills and experience on the Board 
and its Committees. The Company adopts a 
formal, rigorous and transparent procedure 
for the appointment of new Directors and key 
senior executives and we continue to recruit 
based on merit with consideration given to 
diversity in its widest sense. Before making an 
appointment, the Committee assesses the 
balance of skills, knowledge, independence, 
experience and diversity of the Board and, in 
view of this assessment, will draw up a 
description of the role and competencies 
needed, with a view to appointing the 
best-placed individual for the role. In making  
a recommendation to the Board on a 
Non-Executive Director appointment, the 
Nomination & Governance Committee 
specifically considers the expected time 
commitment of the proposed Non-Executive 
Director and other commitments they may 
already have. The Company uses recruitment 
consultants to assist the Committee in 
delivering its objectives and responsibilities 
and the search firms are required to present a 
mix of suitable male and female candidates. 
No Director is involved in decisions regarding 
his or her own succession. 
The Committee is aware that the number of 
women on Boards remains a topic for debate 
for companies and regulators. We fully agree 
with the spirit and aspirations of the Davies 
Report to increase the number of women on 
company Boards. All appointments to the 
Board are made on merit and within this 
context, whilst having regard to the 
recommendations of the Davies Report,  
the Board continues to view diversity in the 
widest sense, with a view to appointing the 
best-placed individual for the role. Appointing 
the best people to the Board is critical to the 
success of the Company and our focus 
remains on attracting the right talent and skills 
irrespective of gender or diversity.

Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 We have noted the recommendation in the Hampton Alexander 
Review published in 2016 that a target of 33% female Board  
representation be achieved by FTSE 350 companies by 2020,  
and also the recommendations of the Parker Review Committee  
published in October 2017 relating to ethnic diversity on Boards.
In relation to the Non-Executive Directors, in 2018 we will commence 
the search for a further Non-Executive Director. In this search the 
Board is conscious of its objective of further strengthening diversity  
at Board level.

Board effectiveness review This year’s process
The Board recognises that it continually 
needs to monitor and improve its 
performance. In line with the effective 
governance requirements of the Code, the 
Board reviews its own performance and that 
of the Directors and of its Committees 
annually.
An externally facilitated Board evaluation was carried out in 2016 facilitated by Alice 
Perkins of JCA. This year’s annual review was facilitated by the Group Legal Director & 
Company Secretary. 
In relation to the 2017 evaluation, each Director and the Group Legal Director & Company 
Secretary completed a questionnaire and the Chairman collated and presented the 
responses of the evaluation for consideration by the Board. 
Conclusions from the 2017 review Areas of focus for 2018
The conclusion from this year’s evaluation 
was that the Board and its Committees 
continued to operate to a high standard and 
continued to provide effective leadership and 
exert the required levels of governance and 
control. 
The review had reconfirmed the need to 
ensure that effective succession plans were 
in place at Board, Group Executive Board 
and Business Executive Committee level. 
This will be a key focus in 2018.
To ensure that the Board and Nomination & Governance Committee have good visibility 
over the business leaders at Business Executive Committee level, the Board will to meet 
with senior management at business level more regularly;
To ensure that the Board maintains a good understanding of investor views, the Board will 
undertake formal six monthly reviews, facilitated by the Company’s brokers, of the investor 
feedback after the Full and Half Year Results and the AGM. The Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director to continue to offer themselves to investors to receive feedback in 
relation to performance or governance issues following the publication of the Group’s full 
year results and notice being given convening the AGM, in addition to being available as 
necessary to investors if concerns could not be addressed to the Executive Directors;
The Board to continue to review its procedures, effectiveness and development and to 
seek to improve and evolve its standards of performance.
As a result of the evaluation, the Board considers the performance of each Director to be effective and concluded that both the Board and 
its Committees continue to provide effective leadership and exert the required levels of governance and control. Shareholders would 
therefore be recommended to re-elect Board Members at the AGM in May. 
Board Development
To ensure a full understanding of Savills and its businesses, 
following their appointment to the Board, each Director undergoes a 
comprehensive and tailored induction programme which introduces 
the Director to the Group’s businesses, its operations, strategic 
plans and key risks. New Directors are also provided with 
information on relevant share dealing policies, Directors’ duties, 
Company policies and governance. The induction also includes one 
to one briefings from the Heads of the Principal Businesses and an 
introduction to each Group business’s development strategy. 
The Group Legal Director & Company Secretary, whose appointment is 
a matter reserved for the Board, is responsible for advising and 
supporting the Chairman and the Board on company law and 
corporate governance matters and for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed, as well as ensuring that there is a smooth flow of 
information to enable effective decision making. The Group Legal 
Director & Company Secretary is further responsible for ensuring that 
the Directors receive regular updates on developments in legal and 
regulatory matters. All the Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Group Legal Director & Company Secretary and 
through him have access, if required, to independent professional 
advice in respect of their duties at the Company’s expense.

Savills plc  Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Accountability
Internal control and risk management
The principal risks and uncertainties faced 
by the Group and the associated mitigating 
actions for these are set out on pages 25  
to 29. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s systems of risk management and 
internal control across the Group and  
for reviewing their effectiveness. This 
responsibility includes the determination  
of the nature and extent of the principal  
risks the Board is willing to take to achieve  
its strategic objectives and for ensuring  
that an appropriate culture has been 
embedded throughout the organisation.  
Risk management is implemented from the 
top down. The Board is supported by the 
Audit Committee in discharging its oversight  
duties with regard to internal control and  
risk management. 
Whilst the Board is responsible for ensuring 
that an appropriate culture has been 
embedded throughout the organisation and 
establishing and maintaining the Group’s 
system of risk management and internal 
control to safeguard Shareholders’ 
investments and the Group’s assets (and for 
reviewing the effectiveness of this system), 
such a system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The 
Board has established an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
Group’s principal risks. The Board’s attitude 
and appetite to risk is communicated to the 
Group’s businesses through the strategy 
planning processes. The Audit Committee 
monitors the ongoing status and progress of 
action plans against key risks on a regular 
basis and reports its findings to the Board. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors considered likely to affect its 
future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Strategic Report 
on pages 2 to 35. The financial position of 
the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described on 
page 23. In addition, Note 3 to the financial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its 
capital, its financial risk management 
objectives, details of its financial instruments 
and hedging activities, and its exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial 
resources, including a £300m committed 
revolving credit facility (augmented by a £60m 
‘accordion’ option which can be activated to 
increase the facility to £360m) that extends to 
December 2020. The Group has a broad 
geographic presence, service offering and 
extensive client spread ensuring that the 
Group is not over-dependent on one 
geography, service line or client. As a 
consequence, the Directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully.
After making appropriate enquiries, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue as a going concern for 
at least 12 months from the date of this 
Report. Accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the 
Report and Accounts. 
Dialogue with Shareholders
In accordance with the Code, the Board 
recognises the importance of 
communication with its Shareholders and 
fully supports the principles encouraging 
dialogue between companies and their 
Shareholders in the Code. The Group Chief 
Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer 
have primary responsibility for investor 
relations and lead a regular programme of 
meetings and presentations with analysts 
and investors. This includes presentations 
following the publication of the Company’s 
full and half year results. This programme 
maintains a continuous two-way dialogue 
between the Company and Shareholders, 
and helps to ensure that the Board is aware 
of Shareholders’ views on a timely basis. The 
full Board is kept informed of any issues 
raised at these meetings and the views of 
Shareholders on a regular basis to ensure 
that they understand the views of 
Shareholders. The Board also normally 
receives feedback twice each year from its 
corporate brokers on investors’ and the 
market’s perceptions of the Company. The 
Chairman and the Senior Independent 
Director are also available to meet 
Shareholders if so required. The Company 
has enjoyed and is appreciative of the 
significant Shareholder support that it has 
had in recent years in relation to the Group’s 
Remuneration Policy and continues to 
welcome Shareholder views with regard to 
the Group’s Remuneration Policy. 
The AGM provides the Board with a valuable 
opportunity to communicate with private 
Shareholders and is generally attended by all 
of the Directors. Shareholders are given the 
opportunity to ask questions before and 
during the meeting and to meet Directors 
following the conclusion of the formal part of 
the meeting. In accordance with the Code, 
the level and manner of voting of proxies 
lodged on each resolution at the AGM is 
declared at the meeting and published on 
the Company’s website. The notice of the 
AGM is sent out at least 20 working days 
before the meeting and at least 14 working 
days notice is given before other general 
meetings in accordance with the Code.
Details of the resolutions to be proposed at 
the 2018 AGM in May can be found in the 
AGM Notice which accompanies this Report 
and Accounts.
In accordance with the Articles of 
Association, electronic and paper proxy 
appointments and voting instructions must 
be received not later than 48 hours before a 
general meeting.
The Group’s website includes a specific 
investor relations section containing all RNS 
announcements, share price information and 
annual reports available for download. The 
Company has taken advantage of the 
provisions within the Companies Act 2006 
which allow communications with 
Shareholders to be made electronically 
where Shareholders have not requested 
hard copy documentation. Details of the 
information available to Shareholders can be 
found on page 153.

Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 As Chair of the Audit Committee (the 
“Committee”), I am pleased to present the 
Audit Committee’s report for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2017. The aim of 
this report is to explain the work undertaken 
by the Committee during the year and how it 
has met the disclosure requirements as set 
out in the 2016 Corporate Governance Code 
(the ‘Code’) and what it has done to address 
continued regulatory change. The key 
matters considered in the year are set out on 
pages 53 and 54. The report provides an 
overview of the significant issues that the 
Audit Committee assessed and details the 
Committee’s major considerations and 
activities during the 2017 financial year in 
ensuring that the Company’s governance 
processes remain appropriate, robust, of a 
high standard and are rigorously applied. 
The Committee has a key role in ensuring 
the integrity of the Group’s financial 
statements, internal controls and the 
effectiveness of its risk management 
processes. The Committee also has a role in 
representing the interests of Shareholders by 
monitoring the activities and conduct of 
management and the auditors. 
During the year, the Committee focused on 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls and reviewed the principal risks, to 
ensure the alignment of these with the 
Company’s strategic objectives. It monitored 
the effectiveness of the control environment 
through the review of reports from Internal 
Audit, management and the External Auditor 
and ensured the quality of the Company’s 
financial reporting by reviewing the 2016 
Report and Accounts and the 2017 Half Year 
Financial Statements. The Audit Committee 
also reviewed the Company’s 2017 Annual 
Report. The Committee also considered the 
processes supporting the assessment of the 
Group’s longer-term solvency and liquidity in 
support of the viability statement. Looking 
ahead, the Committee will continue to monitor 
changes in regulation and continue to focus 
on the audit, assurance and risk processes 
within the Principal Businesses. The 
Committee considered its compliance with 
the Code and the FRC Guidance on Audit 
Committees. The Committee believes that it 
has addressed both the spirit and the 
requirements of both.
The members of the Committee need to 
have the right balance of skills and 
experience to deliver its responsibilities. 
During the year, the Board carried out an 
internally facilitated evaluation of its 
performance and that of its Committees. 
The Board is satisfied that the Committee 
members possess relevant experience and 
appropriate levels of independence and that 
its members have the depth of financial and 
commercial experience across various 
industries which is essential for the effective 
working of the Committee. 
At the request of the Board, the Committee 
has reviewed the content of this year’s 
Annual Report and Accounts and has 
advised the Board that, in its opinion, the 
Report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and it provides the 
information necessary for Shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy.
The Committee noted the unqualified 
opinion from the External Auditor on the 
2017 Annual Report.

Role of the Committee
The Committee is authorised to investigate 
any matter within its Terms of Reference  
(a copy of which can be found in the 
governance section of the Company’s 
website at www.savills.com/en/company-
information/corporate-governance.aspx).  
The Terms of Reference were reviewed and 
updated in June 2017. The Committee has 
access to the services of the Group Legal 
Director & Company Secretary and, where 
necessary, the authority to obtain external 
legal or other independent professional 
advice to fulfil its duties. 
The Committee’s key role is to assist the 
Board in discharging its duties and 
responsibilities for financial reporting, internal 
control, the effectiveness of the risk 
management process and in making 
recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment of the External Auditor.  
The Committee is responsible for the scope 
and results of the External Audit work, its 
cost effectiveness and for ensuring the 
independence and objectivity of the External 
Auditor. The Committee is also responsible 
for reviewing the Group’s whistle-blowing 
arrangements as they relate to matters of 
financial integrity, including ensuring that 
appropriate arrangements are in place for 
employees to be able to raise, in confidence, 
matters of alleged financial improprieties and 
for ensuring that appropriate follow-up 
actions are taken.
Composition 
The Committee is a fundamental element of 
the Company’s governance framework. The 
Committee is chaired by Liz Hewitt. Three 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, Liz 
Hewitt, Tim Freshwater and Rupert Robson 
are members of the Committee. Members of 
the Committee are appointed by the Board 
following recommendations by the 
Nomination & Governance Committee and 
membership is reviewed annually by the 
Nomination & Governance Committee as 
part of the annual Board performance 
evaluation. There were no changes to the 
membership of the Committee during the 
2017 financial year. As at 31 December 2017 
and up to the date of this Report, the 
Committee comprised entirely Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The Committee 
members collectively have a broad range of 
financial and commercial experiences that 
enables them to provide oversight of both 
financial and risk matters, and to advise the 
Board accordingly. The Board considers that 
Liz Hewitt, as Chair of the Committee, 
possesses recent and relevant financial 
experience and that all Committee members 
have relevant financial experience as 
required by the Code. Biographical details  
of the Committee members are shown on 
pages 44 and 45.
The Company provides an induction 
programme for new Committee members 
which includes an overview of the business, 
its financial dynamics and risks, and 
meetings with senior management. 
Committee members are expected to have 
an understanding of the principles of, and 
recent developments in, financial reporting 
and internal controls, risk management, and 
Internal and external audit roles and 
responsibilities.
Engagement
The Chair of the Committee meets informally, 
and is in regular contact with the Group Chief 
Financial Officer, Group Director of Risk 
Assurance and the Group Legal Director & 
Company Secretary and prior to each 
Committee meeting, meets with each of 
them and the External Auditor individually. 
In addition to its members, a standing 
invitation has been extended by the 
Committee to the Non-Executive Chairman 
and Group Chief Executive Officer to attend 
the Committee’s meetings. The Group Chief 
Financial Officer, Group Financial Controller, 
Group Director of Risk & Assurance, Group 
Legal Director & Company Secretary and the 
External Auditor attend each of the 
Committee’s meetings. Other senior 
executives from across the Group are invited 
to present reports to assist the Audit 
Committee in discharging its duties. At least 
once a year, the Committee meets with the 
External Auditor and the Group Director of 
Risk & Assurance without management 
being present. 
The Chair of the Committee also attends the AGM to respond to shareholder questions on its activities. 
The Committee met four times during the year and reports to the Board after each Committee meeting. Attendance at meetings during 2017 
is shown in the table below:

Tim Freshwater January 2012 4 4 100%
Rupert Robson June 2015 4 4 100%
During the year, in addition to its established 
review processes, the Committee 
considered and reviewed a number of other 
areas. These included updates on the risk 
and internal control environments within the 
Group’s Asia Pacific, European and UK 
businesses as well as the effectiveness of 
the Tax & Treasury functions. In addition, 
with the increasing pace of technological 
change, the Committee considered and 
reviewed the Group’s IT strategy, 
complementing the Board’s review of the 
Group’s Technology Strategy, with particular 
focus on cyber security. The Committee 
specifically considered the processes and 
assessment of the Group’s prospects and 
viability made by management to support 
the viability statement which can be found at 
page 29. The Committee’s review included 
consideration of the time period adopted, 
the processes supporting the assessment of 
the Group’s longer-term solvency and 
liquidity which support the viability 
statement. The Committee considered and 
provided input into the determination of 
which of the Group’s principal risks might 
have an impact on the Group’s longer-term 
solvency and liquidity. It also reviewed the 
results of management’s scenario modelling, 
including severe downside modelling, and 
the stress testing of those financial models 
supporting the viability analysis and 
challenged management as to the 
appropriateness of the assumptions made.

Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 Activities of the Committee
To enable the Committee to carry out its duties and responsibilities effectively it works to a structured programme of activities and meetings 
aligned with the annual financial reporting cycle. This includes items that the Committee considers regularly in accordance with its Terms 
of Reference. In addition to its core work, the Committee undertakes additional work in response to the evolving audit and external 
reporting landscape. 
The Committee relies on information and support from management across the business, receiving reports and presentations from business 
management, the Heads of Key Group functions, Internal Audit and the External Auditor, which it challenges as appropriate. Following each 
meeting, the Committee Chair reports on the main discussion points and any actions arising from these to the Board.

Savills plc  Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Accountability continued
During the year the Financial Reporting Council’s Corporate Reporting Review Team (‘CRRT’) carried out a review of the Company’s Annual 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2016. The response by the Company to the request for information was discussed with the Chair of 
the Audit Committee prior to responding to the CRRT. Details of the enquiry raised by the CRRT and the Company’s response thereto were 
also considered by the Committee. The CRRT have closed their enquiries with no requirements to restate any disclosures. Undertakings 
were given to enhance certain disclosures in the future in response to the CRRT review. The Committee was satisfied that the enhancements 
proposed and agreed with the CRRT have been appropriately incorporated in the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended 
31 December 2017.
As part of its monitoring of the integrity of the financial statements, the Committee considers the appropriateness of the accounting policies 
proposed for adoption and whether management has made appropriate estimates and judgements. To support its decision-making, the 
Committee seeks support from the External Auditor in these areas. The key reporting judgements considered by the Committee and 
discussed with the External Auditor during the year were:
In performing its review of effectiveness, 
the Committee reviewed and assessed the 
following reports and activities:
• Internal Audit reports on the review of the 
controls across the Group and its 
monitoring of management actions 
arising from these reviews;
• management’s own assessment of risk 
and the performance of the system of 
risk management and internal control 
during 2017;
• reports from the Group Director of Risk  
& Assurance including reports on 
Group-wide risk assessment activity and 
annual self-assessment findings; and
• reports from the External Auditor on any 
issues identified during the course of 
their work.
The Committee and the Board considered 
that the information received was sufficient 
to enable a review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal controls in accordance with 
the FRC’s Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting. 
Internal Audit
During 2017, Internal Audit services were 
delivered by the Group’s Director of Internal 
Audit with support in delivery by EY. The 
Board’s responsibility for internal control and 
risk is detailed on page 43 and is 
incorporated into this Report by reference.
The Committee approved the annual Group 
audit plan, and received progress against 
that plan during the year. The Committee 
ensured that Internal Audit was appropriately 
resourced with the skills and experience 
relevant to the operations of the Group and 
that information was made available to it to 
enable it to fulfil its mandate to the 
appropriate professional standards. 
The Committee reviewed Internal Audit 
reports on a regular basis and the Group 
Director of Risk & Assurance attended 
meetings and presented to the Committee. 
The Committee monitors the status of 
internal audit recommendations and 
management’s responsiveness to their 
implementation and challenge both Internal 
Audit and management where appropriate 
to provide assurance that the control 
environment is robust and effective.  
In assessing the performance of Internal 
Audit, the Committee considered and 
monitored its effectiveness in the context of 
the Company’s risk management system 
and took into account management’s 
assessment of and responsiveness to the 
Internal Auditor’s findings and 
recommendations and reports from the 
External Auditor on any issues identified 
during the course of their work. 
Internal Control and Risk 
Management
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, 
undertook a robust review of the 
effectiveness of the system of risk 
management and internal control. 
Matter considered Action
Impairment of 
goodwill
The Committee received reports from management on the carrying value of the Group’s businesses, including goodwill. 
The Committee reviewed management’s recommendations, which were also considered by the External Auditor. After 
review, the Committee was satisfied with the assumptions and judgements applied by management and, with the 
support of the External Auditor, concluded that, other than the impairment charge of £2.3m recognised against Sweden, 
no further impairment of carrying values was required.
Aguirre Newman 
acquisition
The Committee considered the accounting treatment of the acquisition of Aguirre Newman by the Group on  
29 December 2017 for a total acquisition consideration provisionally determined at £55.1m, with £48.2m settled in 
cash on completion and the remainder relating to the discounted value of deferred consideration of £6.9m payable in 
five equal annual instalments from December 2018. A further £15.5m is payable in five equal annual instalments from 
December 2018 subject to executive Shareholders remaining actively engaged in the business over a period of up to  
five years. With respect to management’s fair value exercise (which is provisional at 31 December 2017), following 
review, the Committee was satisfied with the recognition of the £3.4m of separate intangible assets. 
Provisions for 
litigation
The Committee reviewed the provisions held in relation to significant legal matters and assessed the appropriateness 
of these as at 31 December 2017 taking into account the Group’s insurance cover and the advice received from 
external counsel to ensure that appropriate provision had been made. The Committee agreed with the position taken by 
management in respect of these matters.
Debtor 
recoverability 
The Committee considered the recoverability of trader receivables and was satisfied that there were no issues arising
Compliance 
with regulatory 
requirements 
During the year the Committee reviewed the Group’s policies and procedures around regulatory risks including but not 
limited to:
Whistleblowing reports; and
Anti-bribery and corruption. 
After review, the Committee was satisfied that no material regulatory fines or penalties had been incurred and that no 
significant issues had been identified in this area. 
54
Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 External Audit
The Committee has primary responsibility for 
overseeing the relationship with the External 
Auditor, including assessing the External 
Auditor’s performance, independence and 
effectiveness, recommending the 
appointment, reappointment or removal of 
the External Auditor, and negotiating and 
agreeing the external audit fees. The 
Committee holds private meetings with the 
External Auditor at the March and August 
Committee meetings to provide additional 
opportunity for open dialogue and feedback 
to/from the Committee and the External 
Auditor without management being present. 
The Committee chair also meets with the 
external lead audit partner outside the formal 
Committee process throughout the year. 
The Committee monitored the performance 
of the External Auditor during the year  
and carried out a review of the effectiveness 
of the External Audit process and 
considered the reappointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) and 
the appropriateness of its fees. The review 
covers a broad range of matters including 
amongst other matters, the quality of staff, 
its expertise, resources and the 
independence of the audit. The Committee 
considered the External Audit plan for the 
year and assessed how the External Auditor 
had performed. In deciding whether to 
recommend the reappointment of PwC, the 
Committee considered the robustness of 
their challenge and findings on areas which 
require judgement, the strength and depth of 
the lead partners and feedback from the 
Group’s management. 
The Committee formally concluded the 
assessment of the performance of the 
External Auditor at the December 
Committee meeting and made a 
corresponding recommendation on the 
appointment of PwC for the forthcoming 
financial year to the Board. Shareholders 
formally appoint the External Auditor at the 
AGM in May. There were no significant 
findings arising from the evaluation this year 
and the Committee concluded that both the 
audit and the audit process were effective. 
The Committee considered the 
appropriateness of the reappointment of 
PwC as the Group’s External Auditor and it 
was satisfied that it should recommend to 
the Board their reappointment as the 
Group’s External Auditor. 
In light of the assessment and review 
undertaken during the year, the Board 
endorsed the Committee’s recommendation 
that PwC be re-appointed as the External 
Auditor for a further year and that their 
re-appointment would be put to the 
shareholders at the 2018 AGM. 
PwC has been the Company’s Auditor 
since 2001, following a tender for the 
External Audit. The senior partner 
responsible is rotated every five years to 
ensure objectivity and the last lead partner 
change took place at the close of the 2015 
audit. The Committee continues to review 
the auditor appointment and the need to 
tender the audit, ensuring compliance with 
the Code. The Committee has considered 
the timing of a potential External Audit 
tender timetable and processes and 
concluded that the tender process should 
take place at the end of the next lead audit 
partner term in 2020. The Committee is 
satisfied that the proposed retender of audit 
services in 2020 was in the best interests of 
the shareholders of the Company.
An important aspect of managing the 
External Auditor relationship, and of the 
annual effectiveness review, is ensuring that 
there are adequate safeguards to protect 
auditor objectivity and independence. In 
conducting its annual assessment, the 
Committee reviews the External Auditor’s 
own policies and procedures for 
safeguarding its objectivity and 
independence. The Committee’s 
assessment of PwC’s independence is 
underpinned by the Group’s policy on the 
use of PwC for the provision of non-audit 
services. In accordance with the Group’s 
policy in place to 31 December 2017, the 
following non-audit services were not 
provided by the External Auditor:
• bookkeeping or other services related to 
the accounting records or financial 
statements;
• taxation services (except for de minimis 
amounts, outside of Europe and outside 
the scope of the Group audit);
• financial information systems design and 
implementation;
• Internal Audit outsourcing services;
• management functions or human 
resources advice; or
• advising on senior executive (including 
Executive Director) remuneration.
To further safeguard the independence of the 
Company’s External Auditor and the integrity 
of the audit process, recruitment of senior 
employees from the External Auditor is not 
allowed for an appropriate period after they 
cease to provide services to the Company. 
During the year, PwC was paid £1.8m for 
audit services and £0.8m for non-audit 
services, principally for advice on 
transaction-related matters. Details of the 
fees paid to the External Auditor can be 
found in Note 72 on page 108. During the 
financial year ending 31 December 2017, 
contracts for non-audit services in excess of 
£0.1m require Committee approval and the 
Chair of the Audit Committee is notified of 
new instructions for the delivery of non-audit 
services below this level.
The Committee was satisfied that in view of 
their knowledge and experience of the 
Company, that when PwC was used, it was 
best placed to provide such non-audit 
services and that their objectivity and 
independence had not been impaired by 
reason of this further work. In line with the 
Company’s policy for the financial year 
ending 31 December 2017 on the provision 
of non-audit work, the Committee reviewed 
the provision of non-audit work provided by 
the External Auditor on a case-by-case 
basis. The Committee was satisfied that the 
overall levels of audit related and non-audit 
fees were not material relative to the income 
of the External Auditor firm as a whole. 
The restrictions (FRC’s Revised Ethical 
Standard for Auditors June 2016) on the 
supply of non-audit services that the 
External Auditor can provide, including the 
cap on the amount of non-audit fees that 
can be billed and a list of prohibited services, 
were effective for the Group from 1 January 
2017. As a result the Group’s policy on using 
the External Auditor for non-audit 
engagements was reviewed in 2016 and 
subsequently amended to reflect these 
additional restrictions. As part of the Group’s 
monitoring system, all non-audit instructions 
with the External Auditor must be approved 
by either the Group Chief Financial Officer or 
the Group Financial Controller and 
management must seek approval from the 
Committee for all non-audit contracts in 
excess of £0.1m. The Group’s policy also 
requires that non-audit fees must not exceed 
70% of the average External Audit fees billed 
over the previous three years. 
The Directors confirm that, insofar as they 
are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which PwC is unaware and 
each Director has taken the steps that ought 
to have been taken as a Director to be aware 
of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that PwC is aware of that 
information.

Savills plc  Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
The UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (the “Code”) is the standard against which we measured ourselves in 2017 and the Board fully 
supports the principles set out in the Code. The Main Principles have been applied as follows:
A. Leadership 
A1 The Board’s Role
The Board met formally eight times during 
the year with specific focus on strategy, 
performance, leadership and risk, 
governance and finance. There is a schedule 
of matters reserved for the Board.
A2 Clear Division of Responsibilities
The roles of the Chairman and Group Chief 
Executive are clearly defined. The Chairman, 
Nicholas Ferguson, is responsible for the 
leadership and effectiveness of the Board, 
and the Group Chief Executive, Jeremy 
Helsby is responsible for leading the 
day-to-day management of the Group within 
the strategy set by the Board.
A3 Role of the Chairman
The Chairman sets the Board’s agenda, 
manages the meeting timetable (in 
conjunction with the Group Legal Director & 
Company Secretary) and promotes a culture 
of open and constructive dialogue during 
meetings.
The Chairman, on appointment, met and 
continues to meet the independence criteria 
set out in B.1.1 of the Code.
A4 Role of the Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman promotes an open and 
constructive environment in the boardroom 
and actively invites the Non-Executive 
Directors’ views. The Non-Executive 
Directors provide objective, constructive and 
rigorous challenge to management and meet 
regularly in the absence of the Executive 
Directors.
B. Effectiveness 
B1 The Board’s Composition
The Board is made up of a majority of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, 
excluding the Chairman.
The Board has determined that each 
Non-Executive Director is independent in 
character and judgement, commits sufficient 
time and energy to the role, and continues to 
make a valuable contribution to the Board 
and its Committees, including Charles 
McVeigh, notwithstanding his long service.
The Nomination & Governance Committee’s 
primary objective is to review the 
composition of the Board. In making 
appointments to the Board, the Nomination 
& Governance Committee assesses the
balance of skills, knowledge, independence, 
experience and diversity required in order to 
maintain an effective Board. 
B2 Board appointments
The Nomination & Governance Committee 
leads the appointment of new Directors to 
the Board. 
B3 Time commitment
On appointment, Directors are notified of the 
time commitment expected of them.
The Non-Executive Directors have ensured 
that they have sufficient time to carry out 
their duties.
B4 Development
To ensure a full understanding of Savills and 
its businesses, on appointment each new 
Director undergoes a comprehensive and 
tailored induction programme which 
introduces the Director to the Group’s 
businesses, its operations, strategic plans, 
key risks and its governance policies. The 
induction also includes one to one meetings 
with the Heads of the Principal Businesses 
and an introduction to each Group 
business's development strategy.
B5 Provision of information and support
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, 
each Director received appropriate and 
timely information, including detailed papers 
in advance of Board meetings.
Each Director has access to the advice and 
services of the Group Legal Director & 
Company Secretary and through him have 
access to independent professional advice 
in respect of their duties at the Company’s 
expense.
B6 Board and Committee performance 
evaluation
During 2017, the Board’s annual evaluation 
was led by the Chairman and facilitated by 
the Group Legal Director & Company 
Secretary. The process and key findings are 
explained on page 49 of the Annual Report. 
B7 Re-election of the Directors
All Directors are subject to election by 
Shareholders at the AGM. All Directors will 
stand for re-election by Shareholders at the 
AGM on 8 May 2018. Directors’ biographies 
are set out on pages 44 to 45 of the Annual 
Report, enabling Shareholders to take an 
informed decision when determining their 
re-election
C. Accountablity 
C1 Financial and business reporting
The Strategic Report is set out on pages 2  
to 35 of the Annual Report and provides 
information about the performance of the 
Group, the business model, strategy and the 
principal risks and uncertainties.
The Directors’ going concern statement is 
given on page 50 of the Annual Report. 
C2 Risk management and internal 
control 
The Board sets out the Group’s risk appetite 
and, through the Audit Committee, annually 
reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems. 
The Directors carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks including 
those that would threaten the business 
model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. Those risks and how they are being 
managed or mitigated is set out in the 
Annual Report at pages 25 to 29. 
Taking account of the Company’s current 
position and principal risks, the Directors 
assessed the viability of the Group over a 
three-year period. The Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will 
be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the three-year 
period. The viability statement is set out on 
page 29 of the Annual Report. 
The Board monitors the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems 
and, at least annually, carries out a review of 
the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of 
internal control, covering all material controls, 
including financial, operational and 
compliance. The activities of the Audit 
Committee are summarised on pages 51 
and 55 of the Annual Report.
C3 Audit Committee and Auditors
The Board has satisfied itself that Liz Hewitt 
has recent and relevant financial experience 
and is confident that the collective 
experience of the members enables it to be 
effective. The fact that a person has been 
identified as having recent and relevant 
financial experience does not impose 
additional duties, obligations or  
responsibilities on that Audit Committee 
member. The Committee also has access to 
the financial expertise of the Group and its 
external and internal auditors and can seek 
further professional advice at the Company’s 
expense, if required.
56
Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 The Group Legal Director & Company 
Secretary ensures that it receives information 
and papers in a timely manner to enable full 
and proper consideration of agenda items. 
These agenda items are agreed in advance 
in its annual meeting activity plan. 
The main roles and responsibilities of the 
Audit Committee are set out in written Terms 
of Reference which are available on our 
website. The Committee is authorised to 
investigate any matter within its Terms of 
Reference and has access to the services of 
the Group Legal Director & Company 
Secretary and, where necessary, the 
authority to obtain external legal or other 
independent professional advice in the 
fulfilment of its duties.
The Committee has responsibility for reviewing 
the Group’s whistleblowing arrangements, 
including ensuring that appropriate 
arrangements are in place for employees to be 
able to raise, in confidence, matters of alleged 
impropriety, and for ensuring that appropriate 
follow-up actions are taken.
The Audit Committee’s role is to assist the 
Board in discharging its duties and 
responsibilities for financial reporting, internal 
control and in making recommendations to 
the Board on the appointment of the 
independent External Auditors. The 
Committee is responsible for the scope and 
results of the audit work, its cost 
effectiveness and the independence and 
objectivity of the External Auditors.
C4 Tenure of Auditor 
At the 2017 AGM, shareholders approved 
the re-appointment of PwC as the 
Company’s External Auditor.
The Audit Committee has assessed whether 
suitable accounting policies have been 
adopted and whether management have 
made appropriate judgements and 
estimates. The main areas of judgement 
considered by the Committee during 2017 
are presented on page 54 of the Annual 
Report. The Audit Committee keeps under 
review the independence and objectivity of 
the External Auditor, including the review  
of audit fee proposals and non-audit fees. 
The Committee reported on how the 
effectiveness of PwC was assessed for  
the 2017 financial year on page 55 of the 
Annual Report. 
D. Renumeration 
D1 Levels and components of 
remuneration
The Group’s focus and business policy is 
founded on the premise that staff in the real 
estate advisory sector are motivated through 
highly incentive-based (and therefore variable) 
remuneration consistent with the Group’s 
partnership style culture, which also ensures 
that the Group’s reward arrangements are 
consistent with – and sensitive to – the 
cyclical nature of real estate markets. 
The Group’s Remuneration Policy is 
designed to deliver these objectives and to 
provide the reward potential necessary for 
the Company to attract, retain and motivate 
the high-calibre individuals on whom its 
continued growth and development depend. 
Reflecting this philosophy, the salaries for the 
Executive Directors, Group Executive Board 
members and senior fee-earners are set 
significantly below market medians for similar 
businesses, with a greater emphasis on the 
performance-related elements of profit share 
and/or, outside of the UK, commission in the 
total reward package. 
The Committee is mindful of its responsibility 
to reward appropriately, but not excessively, 
and rigorously assesses competitive 
positioning in setting remuneration and 
determining targets to ensure that reward 
properly reflects performance, that it 
supports the delivery of our strategic and 
operational objectives and that it is fair to 
management and Shareholders alike. 
The Remuneration Policy was reviewed in 
2016/17 and approved by Shareholders at 
the 2017 AGM (as required by the Directors 
Remuneration Regulations 2013).
D2 Procedure
The Remuneration Committee is principally 
responsible for determining Company policy 
on senior executive remuneration and for 
setting the remuneration arrangements of 
the Executive Directors and reviewing those 
of the members of the Group Executive 
Board. The Committee (excluding the 
Non-Executive Chairman) also determines 
the level of fees payable to the Non-
Executive Chairman. 
The Committee is advised by FIT 
Remuneration Consultants LLP, who provide 
an independent commentary on matters 
under consideration by the Committee and 
updates on market developments, legislative 
requirements and best practice, and 
internally by the Group Legal Director & 
Company Secretary.
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of 
reference are available on our website. An 
overview of what the Committee has done 
during the year is provided on pages 58 to 
73 of the Annual Report.
E. Relations with Shareholders
E1 Shareholder engagement and 
dialogue
The Group Chief Executive Officer and 
Group Chief Financial Officer lead a regular 
programme of meetings and presentations 
with analysts and investors, including 
presentations following the publication of 
the Company’s full and half year results. 
This programme maintains a continuous 
two-way dialogue between the Company 
and Shareholders, and helps to ensure 
that the Board is aware of Shareholders’ 
views on a timely basis. The Board also 
normally receives feedback twice each 
year from the Company’s corporate 
brokers on investors’ and the market’s 
perceptions of the Company.
The Chairman and the Senior Independent 
Director are also available to meet with 
Shareholders if so required.
E2 Constructive use of the general 
meetings
The AGM provides the Board with a valuable 
opportunity to communicate with private 
Shareholders and is generally attended by  
all of the Directors. 
The Notice of Meeting and related papers for 
the AGM are sent to Shareholders at least 20 
working days before the meeting.

The Policy is designed to deliver these 
objectives and to provide the reward potential 
necessary for the Company to attract, retain 
and motivate the high-calibre individuals on 
whom its continued growth and development 
depend. Reflecting this philosophy, the 
salaries for the Executive Directors, Group 
Executive Board members and senior 
fee-earners are set significantly below market 
medians for similar businesses, with a greater 
emphasis on the performance-related 
elements of profit share and/or, outside the 
UK, commission in the total reward package. 
The Committee is mindful of its responsibility 
to reward appropriately, but not excessively. 
As such, it places great emphasis on the 
calibration of Executive Director remuneration 
and structure against internal relativities, 
whilst also rigorously assessing competitive 
positioning in setting remuneration. Finally, it 
determines targets to ensure that reward 
properly reflects performance, that it supports 
the delivery of our strategic and operational 
objectives and that it is fair to management 
and Shareholders alike. Overall, we continue 
to expect employment costs over the cycle to 
be in the range of 65%–70% of revenues. 
*  The dividend cost for 2017 comprises the cost of the final dividend recommended by the Board (amounting to £14.3m), payment of which is subject to shareholder approval at the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) scheduled to be held on 8 May 2018, the cost of the supplemental dividend (£20.6m) declared by the Board on 15 March 2018 (payable to shareholders on the 
Register of Members as at 13 April 2018) and the interim dividend (£6.3m) paid on 4 October 2017.
**   Executive Director remuneration comprises the remuneration paid to the Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer job holders between 1 January 2013 and 
31 December 2017. Since 1 July 2010 the Executive Director representation on the Board has comprised these job holders.

2013–2017 Overview
“ On behalf of the Board, I am pleased  
to introduce our 2017 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report (the ‘Report’) which 
sets out Savills philosophy and policy in 
relation to Directors’ remuneration and  
how this was implemented in the year 
ended 31 December 2017 . ”
Included within this Report we have 
summarised the Remuneration Policy 
(‘Policy’) approved by shareholders at the 
2017 AGM rather than reproduce the Policy in 
full. This gives an overview on the directors’ 
annual remuneration framework and the full 
Policy is available on our website. The Annual 
Report on Directors’ Remuneration will be 
presented to Shareholders for approval at the 
AGM on 8 May 2018.
Our remuneration philosophy 
As previously reported, our long-standing 
focus and business philosophy is founded on 
the premise that staff in our sector are 
motivated through highly incentive and 
performance based (and, therefore, variable) 
remuneration consistent with our partnership 
style culture. We firmly believe that this 
approach best aligns shareholders’ and 
management’s interests and incentivises 
superior performance and the creation of 
long-term shareholder value. This approach 
also ensures that our reward arrangements 
are consistent with and sensitive to the 
cyclical nature of real estate markets.
Governance
This Report has been 
prepared on behalf of the 
Board by the Remuneration 
Committee (the ‘Committee’) 
in accordance with the 
requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and the 
Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 
2013 (‘Regulations’) and the 
auditable disclosures referred 
to in the External Auditor’s 
Report on pages 78 to 84 as 
specified by the UK Listing 
Authority and the Regulations.

Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 2017 performance and remuneration
Annual performance-related profit share
Savills delivered excellent performance in 
2017, against the backdrop of heightened 
uncertainty over global economic prospects, 
geopolitical risks and rising interest rates, 
with particularly strong performances in our 
transactional businesses in the UK, and in a 
number of European and Asia Pacific 
markets and the relative resilience of Savills 
UK Residential transaction business is of 
particular note.
Key financial highlights for the year included: 
• Revenue of £1.6bn, representing growth 
of 11% on 2016;
• Underlying profit before tax of £140.5m 
which represented 3.5% growth on  
2016 and;
• Transaction Advisory revenues up 13%, 
Consultancy revenues by 14% and 
Property Management by 9%
We further progressed our strategy of  
being the leading advisor in the key markets in 
which we operate, by adding complementary 
businesses and teams to our strong core 
business. In particular during 2017 we:
• continued to build our US platform with 
the acquisition of Cresa Orange County, a 
tenant rep business in California, and the 
hire of a significant new capital markets 
team in New York;
• strengthened our investment sales teams 
in Beijing and Shanghai with significant 
new hires;
• in Europe, acquired Aguirre Newman in 
Spain, Larry Smith in Italy and SB 
Property Services in the Czech Republic, 
along with the recruitment of industrial 
teams in Amsterdam and Warsaw; and 
• continued to invest in our own technology 
platform, and invested in promising 
external technology based businesses 
which have the potential to significantly 
enhance or disrupt traditional business 
models in the real estate sector.
At the beginning of 2017 , the Committee set 
stretching financial targets for the 75% of the 
performance-related profit share relating to the 
delivery of Underlying Profit before Tax 
(‘UPBT’). The Group delivered a very strong 
financial performance in 2017 , notwithstanding 
the market uncertainties noted above. As 
such, the Executive Directors received 77% of 
the maximum potential award in relation to 
financial performance. This compares with an 
allocation of 100% of the maximum potential 
award in relation to financial performance in the 
previous year. The absolute amount of this 
element of the bonus is accordingly down  
by approximately 15%. In relation to the  
objectives-based element which accounts for 
up to 25% of annual award, the Executive 
Directors were deemed to have performed 
towards the top end of their personal strategic 
and operational objectives. Full details of the 
annual performance-related profit share 
awards approved by the Committee for the 
Executive Directors are included along with the 
other elements of remuneration in the total 
remuneration table on page 62 of this Report.
2018 remuneration
We were very pleased that shareholders 
gave over 98% approval to our renewal of 
our Policy at the 2017 AGM and we are not 
seeking to amend our Policy at the 2018 
AGM. An overview of the key decisions for 
2018 is as follows:
• Base salaries: we have an established 
approach of offering low base salaries, 
relative to market medians (which approach 
applies to the Executive Directors, Group 
Executive Board Members and other senior 
fee earners). Salaries continue to be 
reviewed each year (although not 
necessarily increased; where an increase is 
agreed in principle but not implemented, 
the notionally increased base salary 
(“Reference Salary”) will be used as the 
base when future salary increases are 
considered). For 2018, the Committee 
approved a 2.5% increase in base salaries 
(applied to the Executive Directors’ 
Reference Salaries as at 1 March 2017) for 
the Executive Directors effective 1 March 
2018. 
• Benefits & pension: no changes are 
proposed and these continue to be set 
below market rates.
• Annual performance-related profit share: in 
line with our Policy, the maximum 
opportunity for 2018 is increased in line with 
the increase in RPI for 2017 . For 2018, the 
cap on the profit share opportunity will 
therefore be, for the Group Chief Executive 
Officer, £2. 134m and for the Group Chief 
Financial Officer, £1.6m, being 4. 1% higher 
than the cap applying in 2017 , reflecting 
year on year growth in RPI (2017 caps: 
Group CEO £2.05m; Group CFO 
£1.5375m). Annual awards will continue to 
be determined as follows:
 •  75% based on a Group UPBT 
performance 
 •   25% on the achievement of pre-set 
personal strategic and operational 
objectives 
• The Group UPBT payment scale will be 
adjusted for any acquisitions/disposals in 
the year which impact Group UPBT by 
more than 7.5% (on an annualised basis). 
In such cases the scale will be adjusted 
to neutralise the benefit of any overage 
above the 7.5% level.
• Performance Share Plan: annual grant to 
be made at the existing award levels of 
200% of base salary for the Group Chief 
Executive Officer and the Group Chief 
Financial Officer. The EPS growth and 
relative total shareholder return targets 
will remain unchanged from those 
applying in 2017, but are subject to 
ongoing review to ensure that these 
continue to provide meaningful targets in 
the light of market developments and the 
Group’s strategic objectives. 
Director changes
As announced on 16 January 2018, Mark 
Ridley, currently CEO of Savills UK and Europe, 
will become an Executive Director on 1 May 
2018 joining the Board then as Deputy Group 
Chief Executive and will succeed Jeremy 
Helsby upon the latter’s retirement as Group 
Chief Executive Officer effective 1 January 
2019. As Deputy Group Chief Executive, 
effective 1 May 2018 the remuneration 
package will consist of a salary of £255k p.a. 
and an annual performance-related profit 
share maximum opportunity of £1.867m, with 
75% based on a mixture of Group UPBT 
performance and 25% on the achievement of 
pre-set personal strategic and operational 
objectives (in 2018, both salary and the 
performance related profit share opportunity 
will be pro-rated to reflect the 1 May 2018 
appointment date). He will also receive a 
Performance Share Plan grant in line with the 
other Executive Directors. Upon Mark Ridley’s 
appointment as Group Chief Executive Officer, 
the package will be increased to the same level 
as that of the outgoing CEO (subject to any 
inflation-related adjustments to salary and/or 
bonus potential).
Following his retirement from the Board at the 
end of 2018, Jeremy Helsby will remain an 
advisor to the Company supporting the 
management team of the Savills US business.
Governance developments
As a Committee, we continue to monitor 
best practice developments in executive 
remuneration and consider whether any 
amendments to the Policy are appropriate. 
The Committee is appreciative of the 
significant Shareholder support that it has 
enjoyed in recent years and welcomed 
Shareholders’ endorsement of the 2016 
Annual Remuneration Report along with the 
renewal of the Policy at the 2017 AGM. We 
hope that you find this year’s Annual 
Remuneration Report equally clear and 
informative and that you will continue to 
support us by voting in favour of the 
resolution at this year’s AGM on 8 May 2018.

Role of the Committee 
The principal role of the Committee is to support the Group to 
achieve its strategic objectives by designing a remuneration policy 
consistent with the Group’s business model such that we have the 
ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate the high-calibre 
individuals needed to deliver the Group’s strategy while promoting 
the long-term interests of the Company. The Committee also 
considers the broader implications of the Policy to mitigate any 
potential environmental, social or governance implications. The 
Committee is responsible for the broad policy governing senior staff 
pay and remuneration. It sets the actual levels of all elements of the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors and reviews that of Group 
Executive Board members. The Policy remains under periodic 
review to ensure that it remains consistent with the Company’s scale 
and scope of operations, supports business strategy and growth 
plans and helps drive the creation of shareholder value. The 
Committee also oversees the operation of Savills’ employee share 
schemes.

As at 31 December 2017 and up to the date of this Report, the 
Committee comprises the Independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Biographical details relating to each of the Committee members are 
shown on pages 44 and 45.
The Committee met four times during the year. The principal agenda 
items considered by the Committee during the year were as follows:
• reconfirming the Group’s Policy in the context of best practice 
and corporate governance developments;
• agreeing performance targets for both the annual performance-
related profit share and Performance Share Plan awards;
• preparing an Annual Remuneration Report consistent with the 
legislation relating to executive remuneration;
• agreeing the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors, 
including the proposed package for the Deputy Group Chief 
Executive and reviewing those of Group Executive Board 
members; and
• approving the grant of Performance Share Plan awards.
Advisors to the Committee
In determining Executive Director remuneration, the Committee has 
access to detailed external information and research on market 
trends and peer practice provided by its independent external 
advisor, FIT Remuneration Consultants. FIT Remuneration 
Consultants are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group, 
and adhere to the voluntary code of conduct in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK. FIT Remuneration Consultants’ 
fees are based on a time and material basis, within the parameters 
of an overall annual budget. In 2017, FIT Remuneration Consultants 
received fees of £57,703 plus VAT in relation to advice provided to 
the Committee. FIT Remuneration Consultants provided no other 
services to the Group during the year.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received from FIT 
Remuneration Consultants during the year was entirely objective  
and independent. The Committee will continue to keep these 
arrangements under review to ensure that they remain appropriate 
to the needs of the Committee in developing remuneration policy  
to support the delivery of Group strategy.
The Committee is also advised internally by the Group Legal Director 
& Company Secretary (save in relation to matters concerning his 
own remuneration).
Given the fundamental role that remuneration plays in the success  
of the Group, in terms of the recruitment, motivation and retention of 
high-quality staff, the Group Chief Executive Officer attends 
meetings by invitation and is consulted on the remuneration  
package of the Group Chief Financial Officer.
Terms of Reference
The Committee’s Terms of Reference, which are reviewed annually, 
or by exception to take account of regulatory changes or best 
practice, are available from the Group Legal Director & Company 
Secretary upon request or can be viewed on the Company’s website 
(www.savills.com).
60
Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 The Group’s remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors, Group Executive Board members and senior fee-earners are structured 
to provide a competitive mix of variable performance-related (ie annual performance profit share and longer-term incentives) and fixed 
remuneration (principally base salary) to reflect individual and corporate performance. The objective is to set targets which provide an 
appropriate balance between being achievable and stretching. 
In determining the remuneration of the Executive Directors and reviewing that of the Group Executive Board members, the Committee 
reviews the role and responsibility of the individual, their performance, the arrangements applying across the wider employee group and 
internal pay relativities. It also considers sector and broader market practice in the context of the prevailing economic conditions and 
corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues.
Overview of the Policy
A summary of the Policy for Executive Directors and how it will be applied for 2018 is set out below. 
Element Summary of approach Application of Policy for 2018
Base salary Base salaries are set significantly below market 
median levels, in line with the Group’s philosophy to 
place greater emphasis on variable, performance-
related remuneration.
• The Committee has approved an increase in the 
base salaries of the Executive Directors of 2.5% 
(which will be applied to 2017 ‘Reference Salaries’) 
effective 1 March 2018.
• Salaries in 2018 will therefore be as follows 
• Group Chief Executive Officer: £289,000
• Deputy Group Chief Executive Officer (effective  
1 May 2018): £255,000
• Group Chief Financial Officer: £221,000
Pension Pension benefits are provided through a Group 
personal pension plan, as a non-pensionable salary 
supplement or as a contribution to a personal 
pension arrangement. 
The CEO receives a pension from the legacy defined 
benefit pension plan but no longer accrues benefits 
under the plan.
Pension contributions/salary supplements for 2018 are:
• Group Chief Executive Officer: 14% of salary
• Deputy Group Chief Executive Officer (effective 
1 May 2018): 14% of salary
• Group Chief Financial Officer: 18% of salary
Benefits Benefits include:
Medical insurance benefits;

Annual performance- 
related profit share
Reflects the Group’s annual profit performance  
and personal performance against pre-set objectives 
and overall contribution.
In line with the Group’s philosophy that there is 
greater emphasis (than under listed company norms) 
on variable performance-related pay. Consequently, 
50% of any award payable above an amount equal  
to base salary is deferred into shares for three years.
Malus and clawback provisions apply. 
The maximum potential annual profit share awards for 
2018 are:
• Group Chief Executive Officer: £2.134m
• Deputy Group Chief Executive Officer (effective 
1 May 2018): £1.867m (pro-rated)
• Group Chief Financial Officer: £1.6m.
For 2018 profit share awards, 75% will be based on 
the Group’s annual profit performance and 25% will 
be based on the delivery of strategic and operational 
performance goals. The Committee reserves its ability 
to vary these proportions or apply different/additional 
measures in future years. 
Performance Share Plan Awards of shares are made subject to a three-year 
performance period. Any vested awards will then be 
subject to an additional two-year holding period.
The maximum award potential remains at 200% of 
base salary, subject to an overall annual maximum of 
shares with a value of £1m on award per participant. 
Malus and clawback provisions apply.
The awards for 2018 will be up to 200% of base salary.
For 2018 Performance Share Plan awards, 50% of 
the award will vest subject to Earnings Per Share 
performance and 50% will vest subject to relative 
TSR performance against the FTSE Mid 250 Index 
(excluding investment trusts).
Share Ownership 
Guidelines
Achieved through share purchase and/or retention 
of any after-tax shares which vest pursuant to the 
Group’s share plans until the guideline is met.
500% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive 
Officer, (effective 1 May 2018) Deputy Chief Executive 
Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer.

based on the number of shares that will vest and the three month average share price for the period to 31 December 2017 (949.2p per share). For 2016, the value shown has been updated to 
reflect the actual market sale price at the date of vesting which was 868.1p per share and Dividend Shares. The estimates provided for long-term share-based reward in last year’s report in 
respect of 2016 were: Jeremy Helsby £259,665 and Simon Shaw £144,256. The actual value has been split between the relevant value on the date of the original award of the relevant shares  
(the PSP – performance element) and subsequent increase in value (PSP – share price appreciation).

Performance-related remuneration for 2017
Annual performance-related profit share
UPBT performance-related element
The following near-term performance measures applied to the 2017 annual performance-related profit share arrangements:
75% of the award was based on profit performance, defined as UPBT performance. The Committee set targets at a level which were 
significantly higher than the previous year. The target range and Savills performance were as follows:
Minimum (0% of element) Mid-point (62.5% of element)
Maximum target 
 (100% of element) Savills UPBT performance Bonus award (% of element)
£96m £128m £160m £140.5m 77%
There was straight-line vesting between minimum, mid-point and maximum.
Reflecting the Group’s very strong performance in 2017, awards at 77% of the maximum potential were earned by the Executive Directors  
in respect of the UPBT performance-related element (2016: 100%). 
The remaining 25% of annual performance-related profit share awards was based on individual performance against key strategic and 
operational objectives. The Executive Directors were each awarded 90% of this 25%.
62
Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 The Committee set strategic and operational objectives for the Executive Directors which were aligned with value creation for Savills.
Details of Jeremy Helsby’s achievement against the key objectives set included the following:
• building out the Group’s US Capital Markets offering and driving the continued development of Savills Studley’s tenant rep and occupier 
services platforms;
• developing a long-term incentive plan for senior management and fee earners in Savills Studley to align further fee earners’ and 
shareholders’ interests;
• further strengthening and broadening the management team across Asia;
• continuing the expansion of Savills European platform by strengthening teams and broadening its geographic and service line  
offerings through selective acquisitions, principally Aguirre Newman in Spain, Larry Smith in Italy and SB Property Services in the  
Czech Republic; and
• enhancing further the Group’s cross-border offering, to ensure the provision of seamless servicing to clients seeking advice or support 
outside of their home market.
Details of Simon Shaw’s achievement against the key objectives set included the following:

For Jeremy Helsby and Simon Shaw, in line with the Policy, 50% of their overall awards, above an amount equal to their respective base 
salaries, was deferred for a further three-year period in the form of shares. 
Long-term incentives
The PSP award granted in 2015 will vest in April 2018, subject to performance in the three years to 31 December 2017. Following an 
assessment of Savills performance against targets set at grant, the Committee determined that 84.1% of the award should vest.  
The targets and Savills performance were as follows:

Operation of Policy in 2018
Base salary 
The Committee approved a 2.5% salary increase (against 2017 Reference Salaries) for the Executive Directors for 2018, effective  
1 March 2018. The base salaries of the Executive Directors effective 1 March 2018 are therefore as follows:
• Group Chief Executive Officer: £289,000 p.a.; 
• Group Deputy Chief Executive Officer: £255,000 p.a. (effective 1 May 2018); and
• Group Chief Financial Officer: £221,000 p.a..
In line with our Policy, the base salaries for the Executive Directors continue to be positioned significantly below market median against  
the FTSE 250.
Variable remuneration
Annual performance-related profit share
The maximum annual performance-related profit share opportunity for 2018 will be:
• £2.134m for the Group Chief Executive Officer;
• £1.867m for the Group Deputy Chief Executive Officer (effective 1 May 2018); and
• £1.6m for the Group Chief Financial Officer.
For the 2018 performance-related profit share, 75% of award potential will reflect the Group’s UPBT performance and 25% of award potential 
will reflect delivery against a mix of personal, strategic and operational objectives. 
The Committee considers prospective disclosure of individual objectives to be commercially sensitive and disclosure will therefore be on a 
retrospective basis.
The Committee retains a general discretion to reduce the pay-out level to reflect exceptional events over the performance period.
Performance Share Plan 
The remuneration policy is for maximum awards of 200% of base salary. The PSP awards for 2018 will be up to two times each Executive 
Director’s base salary.
Awards will vest subject to the satisfaction of EPS targets for 50% of the award as follows:
• 25% (ie threshold) of the element to vest if the Company’s EPS growth is RPI plus 3% p.a. compounded;
• 100% (ie the maximum) of the element to vest if the Company’s EPS growth is RPI plus 8% p.a. compounded or more; and with straight-
line vesting between the two points.
The Committee considers that if EPS growth of RPI plus 8% p.a. were achieved from the strong 2017 EPS base starting position, this would 
represent outstanding performance for shareholders.
The other 50% of the award will vest subject to the satisfaction of relative TSR performance versus the FTSE Mid 250 Index (excluding 
investment trusts) (‘the Index’) as follows:
• 25% (ie threshold) of the element to vest if the Group’s TSR performance equals that of the Index;
• 100% (ie the maximum) of the element to vest if the Group’s TSR performance outperforms the Index by 8% p.a.; and with straight-line 
vesting between the two points.
The awards made to Executive Directors will also be subject to a holding period so that any PSP awards for which the performance vesting 
conditions are satisfied will not normally be released for a further two years from the third anniversary of the original award date. Dividend 
accrual for PSP awards will continue until the end of the holding period.

• Tax comprises corporation tax, employers’ social security and business rates and equivalent payments.
• The dividend cost for 2017 comprises the cost of the final dividend recommended by the Board (amounting to £14.3m), payment of which 
is subject to shareholder approval at the Company’s AGM scheduled to be held on 8 May 2018, the cost of the supplemental dividend 
(£20.6m) declared by the Board on 15 March 2018 (payable to shareholders on the Register of Members as at 13 April 2018) and the 
interim dividend (£6.3m) paid on 4 October 2017 and is based on the number of shares in issue as at 31 December 2017.
• Executive Director remuneration is the remuneration paid to the Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer role 
holders and comprises basic salaries, profit share, social security costs, pension costs and share-based payments.
Total shareholder return and Group Chief Executive Officer remuneration 
The total shareholder return delivered by the Company over the last nine years is shown in the chart below. Over this period the Company 
has delivered total shareholder return of 22% per annum (FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts): 18% per annum; FTSE 350 Super Sector 
Real Estate: 10% per annum). Savills was ranked 54th by TSR performance in the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts) and ranked 
second (of 18 companies) by performance in the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate over the nine years to 31 December 2017.
The Board believes that the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) remains the most appropriate index against which to compare TSR 
over the medium term as it is an index of companies of similar size to Savills. Savills TSR relative to that of the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real 
Estate Index is also shown, as this index better reflects conditions in real estate markets over recent years.

1.  Salary, benefits and bonus is compared against full-time equivalent UK employees. The UK workforce was chosen as a suitable comparator group as Jeremy Helsby is based in the UK 
(notwithstanding his global role and responsibilities) and is in line with Policy benefits which vary across the Group by reference to local market conditions and practice. (Audited information.)
2. The base salary for the Group Chief Executive Officer continues to be positioned significantly below the market median against the FTSE 250.
Pensions disclosure 
From March 2015, the Group Chief Executive Officer has received a non-pensionable salary supplement equal to 14% of pensionable 
earnings. The Group Deputy Chief Executive Officer receives an equivalent salary supplement. For the Group Chief Financial Officer,  
the Company contributes 18% per annum of pensionable earnings to his personal pension plan. 
The Group Chief Executive Officer no longer accrues a pension benefit under the Savills Defined Benefit Pension Plan (The ‘Plan’).

During the year, the aggregate gain on the exercise of share options and shares vested was £1,775,128. The mid-market closing price of the 
shares at 29 December 2017, the last business day of the year, was 993p and the range during the year was 687p to 993p.
Exit payments
No Executive Director left the Company during the year ended 31 December 2017. No payments for compensation for loss of office were 
paid to, or receivable by, any Director for that or any earlier year.
External Directorships
Savills recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive Directors of other companies. Such non-executive 
duties can broaden experience and knowledge which can benefit Savills. Subject to approval by the Board and any conditions which it might 
impose, the Executive Directors and Group Executive Board members are allowed to accept external non-executive Directorships and retain 
the fees received, provided that these appointments are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest. For non-executive Directorships which are 
considered to arise by virtue of an Executive Director’s or Group Executive Board member’s position within Savills, the fees are paid directly 
to Savills. 
During 2017, Simon Shaw received a fee of £30,000 in relation to his continuing appointment as Non-Executive Chairman of Synairgen plc 
which he was permitted to keep (as this appointment is not linked to his role within the Company).

The following sets out the table of remuneration elements from the Remuneration Policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 2017 
AGM. To provide consistency with the remainder of the Report, salaries shown are 2018 salaries and annual performance-related profit 
share levels have been updated for the operation of the Policy in 2018.
Purpose and  
link to strategy Operation Potential Performance measures
Base salary
• A core component 
of the total reward 
package, which 
package overall 
is designed to 
attract, motivate 
and retain 
individuals of the 
highest quality.
The Committee considers base 
salary levels annually taking into 
consideration:
• the Group’s philosophy to place 
greater emphasis on variable 
performance-related remuneration
• the individual’s experience
• the size and scope of the role
• the general level of salary reviews 
across the Group
• appropriate external market 
competitive data.
Set significantly below market median levels with 
greater emphasis on the performance-related  
elements of reward. For 2018, the Committee approved 
an increase in base salaries (which was applied to 2017 
Reference Salaries) of 2.5% effective  
1 March 2018 as follows:
• Group Chief Executive Officer: £289,000
• Deputy Group Chief Executive Officer: £255,000 
• Group Chief Financial Officer: £221,000 
The Committee retains the flexibility to award base 
salary increases taking into consideration the factors 
considered as part of the annual review. Although base 
salaries are reviewed annually, in line with the Group’s 
philosophy, the Committee may elect to only notionally 
rather than actually increase base salaries for Executive 
Directors. In such circumstances this notionally 
increased Reference Salary would be used as the base 
for future base salary increases. 
The annual base salary for any existing Executive 
Director shall not exceed £500,000.
n/a
Pension
• Provides 
appropriate 
retirement 
benefits.
• Rewards 
sustained 
contribution.
Defined contribution pension 
arrangements are provided.
HMRC approved salary and profit 
share sacrifice arrangements are in 
place. Pension benefits are provided 
either through a Group personal 
pension plan, as a non-pensionable 
salary supplement, contribution to a 
personal pension arrangement,  
or equivalent arrangement for 
overseas jurisdictions.
For 2018 the pension contributions/supplements are:
• Group Chief Executive Officer: 
14% of annual base salary.
• Deputy Group Chief Executive Officer: 
14% of annual base salary.
• Group Chief Financial Officer: 
18% of annual base salary.
As part of the funding arrangements agreed when 
Savills’ Defined Benefit Pension Plan (‘the Plan’) was 
closed to future accrual in 2010, the Group Chief 
Executive Officer receives a minimum contribution of 
14%. The maximum contribution will be no more than 
the maximum contribution for all other former members 
of the plan. The maximum annual pension contribution 
for the current Chief Financial Officer is 18%.
The Plan is closed to future accruals. However, legacy 
arrangements will be honoured.
New recruits would normally participate in defined 
contribution arrangements or take a non-pensionable 
salary supplement. 
The level of contribution would be determined at the 
time of appointment and may be set at a higher level 
than that set out above, although a contribution limit of 
20% of annual base salary per Executive Director has 
been set for the duration of this Policy. For international 
appointments, the Committee may determine that 
alternative pension provisions will operate, and when 
determining arrangements, the Committee will have 
regard to the cost of the arrangements, market practice 
in the relevant international jurisdiction and the pension 
arrangements received elsewhere in the Group.

Benefits
• To provide market 
competitive 
benefits.
Benefits currently comprise:
• Medical insurance benefits
• Car/car allowance
• Permanent Health Insurance
• Life insurance
Other benefits may be provided  
if the Committee considers  
it appropriate.
Where an Executive Director is 
located in a different international 
jurisdiction, benefits may reflect 
market practice in that jurisdiction.
In the event that an existing 
Executive Director or new 
Executive Director is required 
by the Group to relocate, other 
benefits may be provided including 
(but not limited to) a relocation 
allowance, housing allowance  
and tax equalisation.
Car allowance (currently up to a 
maximum of £9,000 p.a.).
There is no overall maximum as the 
cost of insurance benefits depends 
on the individual’s circumstances, 
but the provision of taxable benefits 
will normally operate within an annual 
limit of 30% of an Executive Director’s 
annual base salary. 
The Committee will monitor the 
costs in practice and ensure that the 
overall costs do not increase by more 
than the Committee considers to be 
reasonable in all the circumstances
Relocation expenses are subject 
to a maximum limit of £200,000 
(£300,000 in the case of an 
international relocation) plus,  
if relevant, the cost of  
tax equalisation.
n/a
Annual performance-related profit share
• To encourage 
the achievement 
of challenging 
financial, strategic 
and/or operational 
targets.
• Further alignment 
with Shareholders’ 
interests through 
deferral of a 
significant amount 
of any award into 
shares.
Annual profit share awards 
reflect the Group’s annual profit 
performance and personal 
performance and contribution.
Awards are delivered part in cash 
and part in shares subject to a 
minimum cash threshold of 100% 
of annual salary. Thereafter, 50% of 
any award is delivered in shares.
The share element of any award is 
normally deferred for a period of 
three years.
The number of shares in that 
part of the award deferred for 
three years is increased at the 
time of vesting to reflect the value 
of dividends declared over the 
deferral period. Alternatively the 
cash equivalent is paid.
The Committee may exercise 
its judgement to adjust (on a 
downwards only basis) individual 
annual bonus payouts should 
they not reflect overall business 
performance or individual 
contribution.
Malus/clawback provisions apply, 
allowing for the reduction of awards 
as explained in the notes to  
this table.
In line with the Group’s philosophy, 
there is greater emphasis on variable 
performance-related pay, while base 
salaries are set significantly below 
market median levels.
The maximum potential annual profit 
share awards for 2018 are:
• £2.134m for the Group Chief 
Executive Officer.
• £1.867m for the Deputy Group  
Chief Executive Officer.
• £1.6m for the Group Chief  
Financial Officer.
For a new executive director the 
Committee would determine the 
appropriate normal maximum 
taking into account the role and 
responsibility, subject to a maximum 
of £2.134m p.a.
Each of these caps will increase in line 
with the rate of any increase in RPI  
for the preceding financial year (if  
there is no increase in RPI, the cap  
will remain unchanged).
For 2018 the weighting will be 75% in 
relation to the Group’s annual profit 
performance, defined as underlying profit 
before tax performance, and 25% in relation 
to delivery against a mix of personal, 
strategic and operational objectives. The 
Committee reserves the right to vary these 
proportions in subsequent years and/or to 
add additional or substitute measures to 
ensure that incentive remains appropriate  
to business strategy.
The scale for the profit share element of any 
award will be disclosed annually in arrears.
Unless the Committee determines 
otherwise, this scale will normally be 
adjusted for any acquisitions/disposals  
in a single year which impact (on an 
annualised basis) UPBT by more than 7.5%. 
In such cases the scale will be adjusted to 
neutralise the benefit of any overage above 
the 7.5% level. 
If there is significant transaction that results 
in the scale becoming inappropriate then 
Shareholders will be consulted about any 
adjustment to the scale. 
The award potential at threshold is 25%.  
As the arrangement is an annual profit  
share there is no pre-set award level for  
on-target performance.

Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Purpose and  
link to strategy Operation Potential Performance measures
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
• To drive and 
reward the delivery 
of longer-term 
sustainable 
shareholder value, 
aid retention 
and ensure 
alignment of senior 
management 
and shareholder 
interests.
Awards of shares subject to a performance 
period of normally no less than three years. 
A holding period will apply so that Executive 
Directors may not normally exercise vested 
PSP awards until the fifth anniversary of the 
award date.
PSP awards may be in the form of nil cost 
options or conditional awards over shares. 
Awards may incorporate an award of  
tax-advantaged Company Share Option  
Plan options.
The Committee awards dividend equivalents 
on a reinvested basis in respect of dividends 
paid over the vesting or any subsequent 
holding period.
Malus/clawback provisions apply, allowing  
for the reduction of awards as explained  
in the notes to this table.
The Committee may adjust vesting of 
awards if it considers that the outcome 
of the measurement of the performance 
conditions does not accurately reflect the 
underlying performance or financial health 
of the Company. In the event the Committee 
proposed to make an upward adjustment, 
the Committee would consult with major 
shareholders in advance. The Committee may 
adjust or amend awards in accordance with 
the PSP rules.
Maximum annual award potential 
of 200% of salary (plan rules limit).
Subject to an overall maximum of 
£1m per annum per participant.
For a new Executive Director, the 
Committee would determine the 
appropriate normal maximum 
taking into account the role 
and responsibility, subject to a 
maximum of 200% of base salary 
p.a. (or if lower £1m p.a.).
Performance conditions for future 
awards are reviewed annually to 
ensure that the measures and 
their targets remain appropriate 
to business strategy and are 
sufficiently challenging, and that the 
relative balance of the performance 
measures remains appropriate 
for properly incentivising and 
rewarding the creation of longer-term 
sustainable Shareholder value.
Performance conditions are currently 
based on two measures:
• Relative TSR against the FTSE 
250 (excluding investment trusts) 
or other appropriate comparator 
group
• Earnings per share.
The Committee may review the 
performance measures for the PSP 
to ensure they remain aligned to 
the strategy. The Committee would 
consult with major shareholders in 
advance of a change in performance 
measures used for the PSP.
No more than 25% of an award vests 
for threshold performance.
UK tax advantaged all-employee share plans
• Share plans 
available to all UK 
employees in the 
Group who satisfy 
the statutory 
requirements.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate 
in any of the Group’s all-employee share plans 
on the same terms as other UK employees.

accordance with statutory limits. 
The Company does not presently

Shareholding Guidelines
• To encourage 
share ownership 
by the Executive 
Directors and 
ensure interests 
are aligned.
Executive Directors are expected to purchase 
and/or retain all shares (net of tax) which vest 
under the Group’s share plans (or any other 
discretionary long-term incentive arrangement 
introduced in the future) until such time as they 
hold a specified value of shares.
Only beneficially owned shares and vested 
share awards (including PSP vested awards 
subject to a holding period discounted for 
anticipated tax liabilities) may be counted for 
the purposes of the guidelines. Share awards 
do not count towards this requirement prior  
to vesting.
Once shareholding guidelines have been met, 
individuals are expected to retain these levels 
as a minimum. The Committee will review 
shareholdings annually in the context  
of this Policy.

72
Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 Malus and clawback 
Malus (being the forfeiture of unvested awards) and clawback (being the ability of the Company to reclaim paid amounts as a debt) 
provisions apply to the annual performance-related profit share and the PSP. These provisions may be applied where the Committee 
considers it appropriate to do so following: a material misstatement of the Group’s financial results; serious misconduct by the individual; a 
factual error in calculating an award or vesting; and other exceptional developments which have an actual or potential material adverse effect 
on the value or reputation of the Group as determined by the Committee.
Clawback will apply for a two-year period post the vesting of awards. In the event of a regulatory or criminal inquiry being ongoing at that 
point, the clawback period will be extended to a six-month period post the conclusion of such an inquiry.
Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors
Approach to fees Operation Other items
Fees for the Chairman and other  
Non-Executive Directors are set at an 
appropriate level taking into consideration 
individual roles and responsibilities, the time 
commitment required and external  
market practice.
Fees will generally be increased annually in 
line with increases in RPI over the previous 
12 months.
All fees for membership of the Board 
are subject to the maximum payable to 
Non-Executive Directors as stated in the 
Company’s Articles of Association (currently 
£500,000 for the Chairman and NED 
base fees) and within an additional limit 
determined by the Non-Executive Chairman 
and the Executive Directors on behalf of 
the Board of £200,000 for any additional 
responsibility or other special fees.
Fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors 
are determined by the Non-Executive 
Chairman and the Executive Directors on 
behalf of the Board. 
Fees payable to the Chairman are 
determined by the Committee.
The Non-Executive Director fee policy  
is to pay:
• a basic fee for membership of the Board
• Committee chairmanship and Senior 
Independent Director fees to reflect 
the additional responsibilities and time 
commitment of the roles.
The Chairman receives an all-inclusive fee 
for the role. 
Additional fees for membership of a 
Committee or chairmanship or membership 
of subsidiary boards or other fixed fees may 
be introduced, if considered appropriate.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to 
participate in any of the Group’s incentive 
arrangements or share schemes.
Non-Executive Directors do not currently 
receive any taxable benefits (however, they 
are covered by Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance).
Expenses incurred in the performance  
of Non-Executive duties for the Company 
may be reimbursed or paid for directly  
by the Company, including any tax due  
on the benefits.
Additional benefits may be provided  
in the future if the Board considered  
this appropriate.

Share capital and major

The issued share capital of the Company  
as at 31 December 2017 comprised 
141,931,341 2.5p ordinary shares, details of 
which may be found on pages 137 and 138.
The Company has only one class of share 
capital formed of ordinary shares. All shares 
forming part of the ordinary share capital 
have the same rights and each carries  
one vote. 
Votes may be exercised for general meetings 
of the company, by members in person, by 
proxy or by corporate representatives (in 
relation to corporate members). The Articles 
provide a deadline for the submission of 
proxy forms (electronically or by paper) of not 
less than 48 hours before the time appointed 
for the holding of the general meeting or the 
adjourned meeting (as the case may be).
There are no unusual restrictions on the 
transfer of ordinary shares. The Directors 
may refuse to register a transfer of a 
certificated share unless the instrument of 
transfer is: (i) lodged at the registered office 
of the Company or any other place as the 
Board may decide accompanied by the 
certificate for the shares to be transferred 
and such other evidence as the Directors 
may reasonably require to show the right of 
the transferor to make the transfer; or (ii) in 
respect of only one class of shares.
The Directors may also refuse to register a 
transfer of a share (whether certificated or 
uncertificated), whether fully paid or not, in 
favour of more than four persons jointly.
As at 31 December 2017 the Company had 
been notified of the following interests in the 
Company’s ordinary share capital in

Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 Purchase of own shares
In accordance with the Listing Rules, at the 
AGM on 9 May 2017 shareholders gave 
authority for a limited purchase of Savills 
shares of up to 10% of the issued share 
capital of the company. During the year, no 
shares were purchased under the authority.
The Board proposes to seek shareholder 
approval at the AGM on 8 May 2018 to 
renew the Company’s authority to make 
market purchases of its own ordinary shares 
of 2.5p each for cancellation or to be held in 
treasury. Details of the proposed resolution 
are included in the Notice of AGM circulated 
to shareholders with this Annual Report (the 
‘AGM Notice’).
Change of control
There are no significant agreements which 
take effect, alter or terminate in the event of 
change of control of the Company except 
that under its banking arrangements, a 
change of control may trigger an early 
repayment obligation.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles are governed by 
relevant statutes and may be amended by 
special resolution of the shareholders in a 
general meeting.
The Company’s rules about the appointment 
and replacement of Directors are contained 
in the Articles. The powers of the Directors 
are determined by UK legislation and the 
Articles in force from time to time.
Unless determined by ordinary resolution of 
the Company, the number of Directors shall 
be not less than three and not more than 18. 
A Director is not required to hold any shares 
in the Company by way of qualification. 
However, as more fully described on page 
72, in accordance with Board policy, the 
members of the GEB (which includes the 
Executive Directors) are expected to build-up 
and maintain a shareholding in the 
Company. The Board may appoint any 
person to be a Director and such Director 
shall hold office only until the next AGM 
when he or she shall then be eligible for 
reappointment by the shareholders. The 
Articles provide that each Director shall retire 
from office at the third AGM after the AGM at 
which he or she was last elected. A retiring 
Director shall be eligible for re-election. 
However, in accordance with the Code, all 
Directors of the Company are subject to 
annual re-election.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM is to be held at 33 Margaret Street, 
London W1G 0JD at 12 noon on 8 May 2018; 
details are contained in the AGM Notice 
circulated to shareholders with this Report.
Half Year Report
Like many other listed public companies, we 
no longer circulate printed Half Year reports 
to shareholders. Instead, Half Year results 
statements are published on the Company’s 
website. This is consistent with our target to 
reduce printing and distribution costs.
Political contributions
The Company made no political 
contributions during the year (2016: £nil).
Employees’ policies and 
involvement
The Directors recognise that the quality, 
commitment and motivation of Savills staff 
are key elements to the success of the 
Group. See pages 31 and 32 for more 
information as to employee engagement.
The Group provides regular updates covering 
performance, developments and progress to 
employees through regular newsletters, video 
addresses, the Group’s intranet, social media 
and through formal and informal briefings. 
These arrangements also aim at ensuring that 
all of our staff understand our strategy and to 
build knowledge on the part of employees of 
matters affecting the performance of the 
Group. The Group also consults with 
employees so as to ascertain their views in 
relation to decisions which are likely to affect 
their interests.
Employees are able to share in the Group’s 
success through performance-related profit 
share schemes (see page 71 for more 
details) and for UK employees (including 
Executive Directors), share plans which 
include a Sharesave Scheme and a Share 
Incentive Plan (‘SIP’). The Sharesave 
Scheme is an HMRC-approved save-as-
you-earn share option scheme which allows 
participants to purchase shares out of the 
proceeds of a linked savings contract at a 
price set at the time of the option grant. 
Participants may elect to save up to £500 
per month and options may normally be 
exercised in the six months following the 
maturity of the linked three-year savings 
contract. The potential for extending the 
Sharesave Scheme internationally remains 
under consideration. The SIP is also 
HMRC-approved and through which 
participants may make regular purchases of 
shares (up to the current statutory limit of 
£150 per month) from pre-tax income. 
Shares under the SIP normally vest after five 
years, free from income tax and national 
insurance contributions.
Human rights and equal 
opportunities
We support the principles of the UN 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
the Core Principles of the International 
Labour Organization.
It is Group policy to provide employment on 
an equal basis irrespective of gender, sexual 
orientation, marital or civil partner status, 
gender reassignment, race, colour, 
nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion 
or belief, disability or age. In particular, the 
Group gives full consideration to applications 
for employment from disabled persons. 
Where existing employees become disabled, 
it is the Group’s policy, wherever practicable, 
to provide continuing employment and to 
provide training and career development and 
promotion to disabled employees.
Independent Auditors
In accordance with Section 489 of the CA 
2006, a resolution for the reappointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Auditors of 
the Company will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.
Whistleblowing
The Group encourages staff to report any 
concerns which they feel need to be brought 
to the attention of management. Whistle-
blowing procedures, which are published on 
the Group’s intranet site, are available to staff 
who are concerned about possible 
impropriety, financial or otherwise, and who 
may wish to ensure that action is taken 
without fear of victimisation or reprisal.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Details of the Group’s global greenhouse gas 
emissions for the financial year under review 
can be found on page 34 and are 
incorporated into this Report by reference.

Savills plc  Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Directors’ responsibilities
Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulation. 
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group and parent 
Company financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union. Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and parent Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Group and parent 
Company for that period. In preparing the 
financial statements, the Directors are 
required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently; 
• state whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in  
the financial statements; 
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and 
• prepare the financial statements on  
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and parent Company will continue in 
business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
parent Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and parent 
Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. 
The Directors are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
parent Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Group  
and parent Company’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group and parent Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed on pages 44 and 45 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
• the Group and parent Company financial 
statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group and profit 
of the parent Company; and 
• the Directors’ Report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Group 
and parent Company, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces. 
In the case of each Director in office at the 
date the Directors’ Report is approved: 
• so far as the director is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Group and parent Company’s auditors 
are unaware; and 
• they have taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as a Director in order 
to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the 
Group and parent Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.
On behalf of the Board
Jeremy Helsby
Group Chief Executive
Chris Lee
Group Legal Director & Company Secretary
Forward-looking statements 
Forward-looking statements have been 
made by the Directors in good faith 
using information up until the date on 
which they approved the Annual Report 
and Accounts. Forward-looking 
statements should be regarded with 
caution due to uncertainties in 
economic trends and business risks.

Report on the audit of the 
financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Savills plc’s Group financial 
statements and Company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s 
profit and the Group’s and the 
Company’s cash flows for the year then 
ended;
• have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union and, as regards the 
Company’s financial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, 
included within the Report and Accounts (the 
“Annual Report”), which comprise: the 
Consolidated and Company statements of 
financial position as at 31 December 2017; 
the Consolidated income statement, the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, the Consolidated and Company 
statements of changes in equity and the 
Consolidated and Company statements of 
cash flows for the year then ended; and the 
notes to the financial statements, which 
include a description of the significant 
accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting 
to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK) ('ISAs (UK)') and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further 
described in the Auditors’ responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in 
accordance with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the 
FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to 
listed public interest entities, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we 
declare that non-audit services prohibited by 
the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group or the Company.
Other than those disclosed in the Directors’

Our audit approach
Context
Savills plc is listed on the London Stock 
Exchange and is structured across four 
business lines: Transactional Advisory, 
Property Consultancy, Property and Facilities 
Management, and Investment Management 
Services. The Group financial statements are 
a consolidation of reporting units that make 
up the four business lines, spread across four 
geographical regions: UK, North America, 
Europe and Asia Pacific.
Overview
Materiality
• Overall Group materiality: £7.0 million 
(2016: £6.8 million), based on 5% of 
Group underlying profit before tax as 
defined in note 2.2 to the financial 
statements.
• Overall parent company materiality: £2.3 
million (2016: £2.3 million), based on 1% 
of total assets.
Audit scope
• We conducted audit work in the UK, 
Germany, Spain, US, Hong Kong, China, 
South Korea, Singapore, Japan and 
Australia, and across all four of the 
Group’s business lines.
• Audits of the complete financial 
information were performed on the 
businesses in the UK, US, Hong Kong, 
Shanghai (China Central), Australia and 
South Korea, as well as the German 
Investment Management business. 
• We carried out procedures on parts of 
the business which accounted for 86% 
(2016: 83%) of Group revenues and 91% 
(2016: 92%) of Group underlying profit 
before tax. 
Key audit matters
• Goodwill impairment assessment – 
particularly for European businesses  
and the US (Group)
• Risk of fraud in revenue recognition in 
relation to cut-off for transaction income 
in the investment management and 
transactional advisory businesses

• Provisions for litigation (Group)
• Recoverability of trade receivables 
(Group)
• Regulatory compliance obligations 
(Group and Company)
• Accounting for acquisition of Aguirre 
Newman (Group)
The scope of our audit
As part of planning our audit, we 
determined materiality and assessed the 
risks of material misstatement in the 
financial statements. In particular, we 
looked at where the directors made 
subjective judgements, for example in 
respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are 
inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and 
regulatory framework applicable to the 
group and the industry in which it operates, 
and considered the risk of acts by the Group 
which were contrary to applicable laws and 
regulations, including fraud. We designed 
audit procedures at Group and significant 
component level to respond to the risk, 
recognising that the risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement due to fraud is higher 
than the risk of not detecting one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve deliberate 
concealment by, for example, forgery or 
intentional misrepresentations, or through 
collusion. We focused on laws and 
regulations that could give rise to a material 
misstatement in the Group and Company 
financial statements, including those relating 
to financial services and real estate services 
across the Group. Our tests included 
discussing compliance with internal legal 
counsel, reviewing correspondence with the 
Group’s solicitors and examining litigation 
costs incurred by the Group over the 
financial year. There are inherent limitations 
in the audit procedures described above 
and the further removed non-compliance 
with laws and regulations is from the events 
and transactions reflected in the financial 
statements, the less likely we would become 
aware of it. We did not identify any key audit 
matters relating to irregularities, including 
fraud. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override 
of internal controls, including testing journals 
and evaluating whether there was evidence 
of bias by the Directors that represented a 
risk of material misstatement due to fraud.  79

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Goodwill impairment assessment – particularly for 
European businesses and the US (Group) 
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 94 and 
(Significant Accounting policies) and pages 119 to 121 (notes).
The Group carried £351.3m of goodwill at 31 December 2017 
(2016: £309.8m) of which £57.8m related to new acquisitions  
made during 2017.
The carrying value of goodwill is contingent on future cash flows 
of the underlying cash generating units (‘CGUs’) and there is a risk 
that if these cash flows do not meet the Directors’ expectations, the 
goodwill will be impaired.
The Group’s performance in Europe improved during 2017 with the 
exception of Sweden, where an impairment charge of £2.3m was 
recognised reflecting recent performance in challenging market 
conditions. After the impairment charge, the value of the Sweden 
CGU at 31 December 2017 was £2.7m. There was significant 
headroom in management’s impairment models for the other 
European CGUs.
We focused our assessment on the US, which holds £148.1m of 
goodwill and other intangible assets, as the profitability of that 
business declined in 2017. 
Focusing on the US and Sweden businesses, we evaluated and 
challenged the Directors’ future cash flow forecasts and the process 
by which they were drawn up, and tested the underlying value in use 
calculations. We compared management’s forecast with the latest 
Board-approved budget and found them to be consistent.
We challenged:
• the key assumptions for short and long term growth rates in the 
forecasts by comparing them with historical results, as well as 
economic and industry forecasts for the relevant international 
property markets; and
• the discount rate used in the calculations by assessing the cost  
of capital for the Group and comparable organisations, and 
assessed the specific risk premium applied to each CGU 
in question.
We performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions within 
the cash flow forecasts. This included sensitising the discount 
rate applied to the future cash flows, and the short and longer 
term growth rates and profit margins. We ascertained the extent 
to which a reduction in these assumptions both individually or in 
aggregate would result in goodwill impairment, and considered 
the likelihood of such events occurring. We did not regard this to 
be reasonably possible.
We were satisfied that the impairment charge recorded in Sweden 
was reasonable and that no other goodwill impairments were 
required in the 2017 financial statements.
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition in relation to cut-off 
for transaction income in the investment management  
and transactional advisory businesses (Group) 
Refer to page 98 (note 2 to the financial statements) for the  
Directors’ disclosures of the related accounting policies,  
judgments and estimates.
Our specific audit focus was on the risk that revenue may be 
recorded in the incorrect period in respect of transaction fees in the 
transactional advisory and investment management businesses, in 
light of the incentive schemes for management in those businesses 
designed to reward performance.
The recognition of revenue is largely dependent on the date the 
underlying transaction is deemed to be completed, which is typically 
the point at which unconditional exchange has been achieved.
For material transactions, we evaluated the commercial rationale and 
the revenue recognition process adopted and determined that the 
related revenue had been recorded on a consistent basis across the 
Group in accordance with Group policies and applicable IFRSs.
We tested a sample of revenue transactions to underlying contracts 
and third party completion documentation, for example, property 
sales completion statements, or asset or property management 
contracts, determining that these sales had taken place and were 
recorded in the correct period. 
There were no material issues identified by our testing of revenue 
recognition in the period. 80

Provisions for litigation (Group) 
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 97 (Significant 
Accounting Policies) and page 105 (notes).
The Group is subject to a number of legal claims in the normal 
course of business. The calculation of provisions against these 
claims is judgmental, given the range of possible outcomes on 
each claim. The number of new claims has continued to decline 
in recent years.
Our audit procedures took into account both the potential exposure 
and the extent to which liabilities are likely to crystallise, as well as 
the adequacy of the insurance cover held by the Group.
 In order to assess the accuracy and completeness of the provisions 
held at the balance sheet date, we performed the following 
procedures:
• Obtained and read the legal claim letters and accompanying third 
party documentation received by the Group;
• Obtained and read the legal insurance contract, and verified that 
the terms were appropriately accounted for;
• Met with the Group’s internal and external legal counsels to 
consider in detail a number of cases, including the potential 
exposure after taking into account the Group’s insurance cover;
• Checked the amounts and other details in respect of each new 
claim to the relevant supporting documentation;
• Reviewed the outcome of prior year estimates of litigation 
provisions to help assess the reliability of the estimates this year;
• Reviewed the legal cases settled during the year and, where 
relevant, traced the related cash payments to bank statements; 
and
• Examined board minutes, legal expenses incurred during the year 
and any litigation-related matters arising after the year-end.
We determined based on these procedures that the Directors 
had made reasonable judgments in their assessment process for 
determining the level of provision held.
Our procedures did not identify any further legal cases other than 
those identified by management.
Recoverability of trade receivables (Group)
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 95 (Significant 
Accounting Policies) and page 130 (notes).
The Group is exposed to a risk of default in respect of trade 
receivables, and there is therefore a risk that the net valuation of 
receivables could be overstated. This risk is factored into our audit 
approach with respect to the provision against trade receivables.
In order to test the recoverability of trade receivables, we performed 
the following procedures:
• Requested confirmations for a sample of client debtor balances;
• Where a response to our request was not received, we sought to 
agree the relevant trade receivables balances to post year end 
cash receipts;
• Where both a response and cash had not been received post 
year-end, we performed alternative procedures, by agreeing 
amounts recorded to underlying sales contracts and completion 
documentation;
• Discussed and assessed the reasons that the amounts were not 
yet paid with local management teams. We also evaluated the 
Group's credit control procedures, and assessed the ageing 
profile of trade receivables, focusing on older debts;
• We challenged management as to the recoverability of the older, 
unprovided amounts, corroborating management explanations 
with underlying documentation and correspondence with the 
customer; and
• We inspected management’s bad debt provision calculations and 
ensured that these were consistent with Group policy, and that 
they provided appropriate cover over older uncollected debts
We did not encounter any issues through these audit procedures that 
indicated further provisioning against trade receivables was required.
Based upon the above, we are satisfied that management had taken 
reasonable judgments that were supported by the available evidence 
in respect of the relevant receivables.

Regulatory compliance obligations (Group and Company) 
The Group is subject to Financial Services, Chartered Surveyor, tax, 
anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws and regulations across 
a number of jurisdictions in which it operates.
The Company is subject to those laws and regulations applicable  
in the UK.
Failure to comply with any of these applicable laws and regulations 
could have a material impact on the results of the Group and the 
reputation for integrity on which it relies.
The Directors did not identify any material instances of non-
compliance in the year.
We updated our understanding of the legal and regulatory framework 
within which the Group operates, discussed the Group’s approach 
to regulatory compliance with management and with internal legal 
counsel, and evaluated management’s internal control procedures.
We considered that appropriate procedures are in place to identify 
any instances of non-compliance that would have a material impact 
on the results and reputation of the business.
We read relevant correspondence with regulators to support 
management’s assertions, as well as board minutes and internal 
audit reports. We examined legal expense accounts and considered 
the results of our audit work in other areas to determine whether 
there was any evidence of non-compliance with applicable laws  
and regulations.
We identified no evidence of such instances of non-compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations.
Accounting for acquisition of Aguirre Newman (Group) 
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 94 (Significant 
Accounting Policies) and page 126 (notes).
The Group completed the acquisition of Aguirre Newman, a 
Spanish real estate advisory business, on 29 December 2017.
The acquisition did not include Aguirre Newman’s South American 
business, which was carved out of the acquisition balance sheet. 
Accounting for the acquisition required a provisional fair value 
exercise, including valuing separately identifiable intangible assets. 
This can be a particularly subjective process, given the range of 
assumptions that are adopted to determine the valuations, including 
the applicable discount rate used in the fair value calculations.
Based on an exercise performed by external valuation experts, 
the Directors identified £3.4m of intangibles relating to Aguirre 
Newman’s brand, order back-log and its customer contracts  
and relationships.
In order to test the components of the acquisition, we performed the 
following procedures:
• Reviewed technical papers prepared by management in respect 
of the acquisition and inspected all relevant contracts and 
information;
• Tested the adjustments made to carve out the net assets of the 
Aguirre Newman South American business from the acquired 
balance sheet;
• Assessed the provisional fair value calculation of the assets 
acquired, including assessing the completeness and quantum of 
adjustments made by management;
• Reviewed the work performed on the purchase price allocations 
by management’s external experts, to ensure that the relevant 
intangible assets have been appropriately identified and 
reasonably valued;
• Evaluated the competency and objectivity of management’s 
external valuation expert;
• Challenged the key assumptions used in the valuation model, 
including the discount rate
• Challenged management’s identification and valuation of other 
known and contingent liabilities associated with Aguirre Newman;
• Understood what management have done to assess the control 
environment of the entity and align accounting practices; and
Based upon the above, we are satisfied that the Directors had  
taken reasonable judgments in accounting for the acquisition of 
Aguirre Newman. 82

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which 
they operate.
Taken together, our full scope audit procedures accounted for 86% (2016: 83%) of Group revenues and 91% (2016: 92%) of Group 
underlying profit before tax.
The Group’s accounting process is structured around a local finance function in each of the territories in which the Group operates. In 
Europe, these functions maintain their own accounting records and controls and report to a Head Office finance team in the UK through 
submission of management reporting packs. In Asia Pacific, these functions similarly report to a regional finance team in Hong Kong, and in 
the US the local functions report to the US finance team in New York. At a Group level, a separate finance team consolidates the reporting 
packs of Europe, Asia Pacific, UK, North America and the central functions.
In our view, due to their significance and/or risk characteristics, as defined in our areas of focus, those businesses in the UK and US, Hong 
Kong, Shanghai (China Central) and Australia within the Asia Pacific region, and the German Investment Management business, required an 
audit of their complete financial information. We used component auditors from PwC network firms who are familiar with the local laws and 
regulations in each of the identified territories outside the UK to perform this audit work. 
Specific risk-based audit procedures were performed by local teams in Beijing, Chengdu, Tokyo and Singapore, focusing on revenue and 
receivables based on the audit risks we had identified in these areas. Specific audit procedures were also performed by a local team in 
Spain over the Aguirre Newman balance sheet, following the acquisition on 29 December 2017.
Based upon Group materiality, we did not carry out detailed audit procedures on Savills Europe other than Aguirre Newman. Local audit 
teams perform statutory audits of subsidiary companies in Europe where required by local legislation. These audits were carried out to the 
same timetable as the Group audit and, accordingly, we were able to incorporate the results of their work into our overall risk assessment. 
In order to direct and supervise the Group audit, the Group engagement team sent detailed instructions to significant component audit 
teams. This included communication of the areas of focus above and other required communications. The Group engagement team held 
regular meetings throughout the year with all significant component audit teams. The Group team visited the audit teams located at the 
Savills Asia Pacific head office in Hong Kong, given the significance of this region to the Group, the US head office in New York, and also 
visited Savills regional offices in Shanghai and Beijing. This ensured that we had a comprehensive understanding of the results of their work 
– particularly insofar as it related to the identified areas of focus.
The Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of complex items were audited by the Group engagement team at 
the head office. These included pensions, tax and share-based payments.
Taken together, these procedures gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on 
the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate 
on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Overall materiality £7.0 million (2016: £6.8 million). £2.3 million (2016: £2.3 million).
How we 
determined it
5% of Group underlying profit before tax as defined in note 2.2 to the 
financial statements.
1% of total assets of the Company.
Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied
Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality by 
applying a benchmark of 5% of underlying profit before tax. We believe 
that underlying profit before tax is the most appropriate measure as 
it eliminates any disproportionate effect of exceptional charges and 
provides a consistent year-on-year basis for our work. It is the key 
measure used by management and the Group’s investors.
We determined that as the Company is a 
non-trading holding company, total assets 
to be an appropriate benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of 
materiality allocated across components was between £1.0 million and £5.7 million. Certain components were audited to a local statutory 
audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.3 million (Group audit) 
(2016: £0.3 million) and £0.3 million (Company audit) (2016: £0.3 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
respect of the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and the directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the 
Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at  
least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to. As not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, this statement 
is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and 
Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to Going Concern in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report 
thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any 
form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to 
conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based 
on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that 
fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 
2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs 
(UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below 
(required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did 
not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency  
or liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The Directors’ confirmation on page 26 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The Directors’ explanation on page 29 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope 
than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the 
statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the 
statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course 
of the audit. (Listing Rules) 84
Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our 
responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the Directors, on 
page 76, that they consider the Annual 
Report taken as a whole to be fair, 
balanced and understandable, and 
provides the information necessary for  
the members to assess the Group’s and 
Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge of the 
Group and Company obtained in the 
course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 
54 describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to 
the Audit Committee.
• The Directors’ statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the Code 
does not properly disclose a departure 
from a relevant provision of the Code 
specified, under the Listing Rules, for 
review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the 
financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibility Statement set out on page 76, 
the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in 
accordance with the applicable framework 
and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. The Directors are also 
responsible for such internal control as they 
determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the 
Directors are responsible for assessing the 
Group’s and the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as 
applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Directors either intend 
to liquidate the Group or the Company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit  
of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditors’ report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements is 
located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.
org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This 
description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has 
been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person 
to whom this report is shown or into whose 
hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception 
reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit; 
or
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the Company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; 
or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
• the Company financial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee, we were appointed by the 
members on 30 April 2001 to audit the 
financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2002 and subsequent 
financial periods. The period of our total 
uninterrupted engagement is 16 years,

Notes to the financial statements
Y ear ended 31 December 201 7
1. General information
Savills plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’) is a global real estate services Group. The Group operates through  
a network of offices in the UK, Continental Europe, Asia Pacific, North America, Africa and the Middle East. Savills is listed on the London 
Stock Exchange and employs 34,429 staff worldwide.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is  
33 Margaret Street, London W1G 0JD.
These consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 14 March 2018.
2. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies  
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated, and are also applicable to the parent Company.
2.1 Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS 
Interpretations Committee interpretations as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable  
to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation  
of available-for-sale investments and derivative financial instruments.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and for management 
to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or 
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 5.
2.2 Use of non-GAAP measures
The Group believes that the consistent presentation of underlying profit before tax, underlying effective tax rate, underlying basic earnings 
per share and underlying diluted earnings per share provides additional useful information to shareholders on the underlying trends and 
comparable performance of the Group over time. The ‘underlying’ measures are also used by Savills for internal performance analysis and 
incentive compensation arrangements for employees. All the adjustments made to the GAAP measures are considered exceptional and/or 
non-operational in nature. These terms are not defined terms under IFRS and may therefore not be comparable with similarly-titled profit 
measures reported by other companies. They are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures.
The term ‘underlying’ refers to the relevant measure of profit, earnings or taxation being reported excluding the impact (pre and post-tax 
where applicable) of the following items:
• amortisation of acquired intangible assets (excluding software);
• the difference between IFRS 2 charges related to outstanding bonus-related deferred share awards and the estimated value of the 
current year bonus pool expected to be allocated to deferred share awards (refer to Note 8 for further explanation);
• items that are considered exceptional by size or nature including restructuring costs, impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and 
investments and profits or losses arising on disposals of subsidiaries and other investments; and
• significant acquisition costs related to business combinations.
The underlying effective tax rate represents the underlying income tax expense expressed as a percentage of underlying profit before tax. 
The underlying income tax expense is the income tax expense excluding the tax effect of the adjustments made to arrive at underlying profit 
before tax and other tax effects related to these adjustments.
Underlying basic earnings per share and underlying diluted earnings per share both utilise the underlying profit after tax measure instead of 
GAAP earnings. The weighted average number of shares remain the same as the GAAP measure. 
A reconciliation between GAAP and underlying measures are set out in Note 8 (underlying profit before tax) and Note 14.2 (underlying basic 
earnings per share and underlying diluted earnings per share).
The Group also refers to revenue and underlying profit on a constant currency basis which are both non-GAAP measures. Constant 
currency results are calculated by translating the current year revenue and underlying profit using the prior year exchange rates. 
This measure allows the Group to assess the results of the current year compared to the prior year, excluding the impact of foreign 
currency movements. 92

Y ear ended 31 December 201 7
2. Accounting policies continued
2.3 Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, together with the Group’s share of 
results of its associates and joint ventures.
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries 
are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Profits 
and losses resulting from inter-company transactions that are recognised in assets are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries 
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Investments in subsidiaries held by the Company are held at cost, less any provision for impairment.
(b) Acquisition of subsidiaries
The Group applies the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the 
acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair 
values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, 
either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration only 
applies to situations where contingent payments are not dependent on future employment of vendors. Payments dependent on future employment 
are expensed to the income statement over the relevant period of employment as required by IFRS 3 (revised). Subsequent changes to the fair 
value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 in profit or loss. Contingent 
consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
(c) Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions – that is, as 
transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share 
acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests 
are also recorded in equity.
(d) Disposal of subsidiaries
When the Group ceases to control any retained interest in a subsidiary, the entity is remeasured to its fair value at the date when control is 
lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of 
subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related 
assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
(e) Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 
20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity 
method, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of 
the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill (net of any accumulated 
impairment loss) identified on acquisition (see Note 17.1).
The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. Dividends received or receivable from associates are recognised as a reduction in the 
carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, 
including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies 
of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 
The carrying amount of associates is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in Note 2.9. 93

Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview
(f) Joint arrangements
The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11 investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations 
or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint 
arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, the 
investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the profit  
or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition.
The Group’s share of its joint venture’s post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. Dividends received or receivable from joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in 
the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the joint ventures 
(which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the Group does not 
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint 
ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
The carrying amount of joint ventures is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in Note 2.9.
2.4 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief 
operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been 
identified as the Group Executive Board.
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns  
that are different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within  
a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other  
economic environments.
As the Group is strongly affected by both differences in the types of services it provides and the geographical areas in which it operates, the 
matrix approach of disclosing both the business and geographical segments format is used.
Revenues and expenses are allocated to segments on the basis that they are directly attributable or the relevant portion can be allocated on 
a reasonable basis.
2.5 Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which 
is also the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other 
comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss and are recognised in 
the income statement, except for available-for-sale equity investments, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary 
items carried at historical cost are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
(c) Group entities
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the 
Group’s presentational currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising from this translation of 
foreign operations are taken directly to the foreign exchange reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant 
amount in the foreign exchange reserve is transferred to the income statement. 
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.  94

2.6 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes 
expenditure directly attributable to acquisition.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that the future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Provision for depreciation is made at rates calculated on a straight-line basis to write-off the assets over their estimated useful lives 
as follows:
Freehold property 50 years
Short leasehold property (less than 50 years) Over unexpired term of lease 
Equipment and motor vehicles 3–10 years
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated 
recoverable amount.
2.7 Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of a subsidiary or associate over the Group’s share of the fair value of identifiable 
net assets acquired.
In respect of associates, goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which 
the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of value-in-use and fair value less costs of 
disposal. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or 
groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The Group 
allocates goodwill to each business segment in the geographical region in which it operates (Note 15).
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
2.8 Intangible assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations and incremental contract costs are valued at fair value on acquisition and 
amortised over the useful life. Fair value on acquisition is determined by third party valuation where the acquisition is significant.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. 
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the 
Group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
• it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
• management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;
• there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
• it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;
• adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and
• the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. 95
S a v ill s p l c  
Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview
Amortisation charges are spread on a straight-line basis over the period of the assets’ estimated useful lives as follows:
Customer relationships 3–15 years
Order backlogs 2 years
Contracts – investment, property management and other existing business contracts 2–20 years
Brands 2 years
Computer software 3–5 years
Acquired investment management contracts relating to open-ended funds have been attributed indefinite useful lives, reflecting the open-
ended nature of the funds, the Group’s intention to continue with the management of the funds for the foreseeable future and the 
expectation that these contracts are expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group for this foreseeable period. 
2.9 Impairment of other non-financial assets
Assets that have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation or depreciation and are tested annually for impairment or whenever 
an indicator of impairment exists. Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever an 
indicator of impairment exists. An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the higher of the asset’s  
fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible 
reversal at each reporting date.
Value-in-use is determined using the discounted cash flow method, with an appropriate discount rate to reflect market rates and specific 
risks associated with the asset.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
(cash-generating units). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
2.10 Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s statement of financial position at fair value when the Group becomes party  
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Subsequent measurement depends on the classification and is discussed in paragraphs 
2.11–2.16.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. On derecognition of a financial asset in 
its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of consideration received is recognised in profit or loss. 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. The 
difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. 
2.11 Available-for-sale investments
Available-for-sale investments are stated at fair value, with changes in fair value being recognised in other comprehensive income. When 
such investments are disposed or become impaired, the accumulated gains and losses, previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income, are recognised in the income statement.
2.12 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for impairment. 
Receivables are discounted where the time value of money is material.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will 
enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is 
impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the 
income statement within ‘other operating expenses’. When a trade receivable is uncollected, it is written off against the allowance 
account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against ‘other operating expenses’ in 
the income statement. 96

2.13 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call with banks, together with other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less and working capital overdrafts, which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. Bank overdrafts are included under borrowings in the statement of financial position.
2.14 Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
2.15 Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. 
Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
2.16 Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. 
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and if so, the 
nature of the item being hedged.
Certain derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. In these cases, changes in the fair value of all derivative instruments are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
2.17 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. When share capital is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, including directly attributable 
costs, is recognised as a charge to equity. Repurchased shares which are not cancelled, or shares purchased for the Employee Benefit 
Trust, are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.
2.18 Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the 
countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in 
tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on 
the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the 
initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. 
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and 
are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except for deferred income 
tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income tax levied by the same taxation authority on either the same 
taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. 97

2.19 Pension obligations
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 
Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the 
fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined 
benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on 
one or more factors, such as age, years of service and compensation.
The asset or liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outflows.
The defined benefit scheme charge consists of net interest costs, past service costs and the impact of any settlements or curtailments and 
is charged as an expense as they fall due.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group also operates a defined contribution Group Personal Pension Plan for new entrants and a number of defined contribution 
individual pension plans. Contributions in respect of defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement when  
they are payable. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. Prepaid contributions are 
recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
The net defined benefit cost is allocated amongst participating Group subsidiaries on the basis of pensionable salaries.
2.20 Share-based payments
The Group operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the 
grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
All equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Fair value is predominantly measured by use of the 
Actuarial Binomial option pricing model. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that 
are expected to vest. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to vest 
based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Any cash proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised.
2.21 Employee Benefit Trust and Savills Rabbi Trust
The Company has established the Savills plc 1992 Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’) and the Savills Rabbi Trust (the ‘Rabbi Trust’), the 
purposes of which are to grant awards to employees, to acquire shares in the Company pursuant to the Savills Deferred Share Bonus Plan 
and the Savills Deferred Share Plan and to hold shares in the Company for subsequent transfer to employees on the vesting of the awards 
granted under the schemes. The assets and liabilities of the EBT and Rabbi Trust are included in the Group statement of financial position. 
Investments in the Group’s own shares are shown as a deduction from equity.
2.22 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that  
the Group will be required to settle that obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the 
effect is material.
(a) Professional indemnity claims
Provisions on professional indemnity claims are recognised when it is probable that the Group will be required to settle claims against it as a 
result of a past event and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. The Group recognises a provision up to the limit of its 
self-insured liabilities in respect of any claim, with the excess of any self-insured element settled by professional indemnity insurance cover. 
The professional indemnity insurance cover is spread across a panel of insurers so that it is highly unlikely that the Group would be liable for 
any settlement in excess of the self-insured element of any given claim. As a result, the amount of the claim in excess of the self-insured 
element is not included in the professional indemnity claims provision.  98

(b) Dilapidation provisions
The Group is required to perform dilapidation repairs and restore properties to agreed specifications on leased properties prior to the 
properties being vacated at the end of their lease term. Provision for such cost is made where a legal obligation is identified and the liability 
can be reasonably quantified.
(c) Onerous leases
A provision is recognised where the costs of meeting the obligations under a lease contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be 
received and is measured as the net least cost of exiting the contract, being the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or 
penalties arising from the failure to fulfil it.
(d) Restructuring provision
A provision is recognised when there is a present constructive obligation to meet the costs of restructure. This arises when there is a detailed 
formal plan for the restructuring, identifying at least the business or part of the business concerned, principal locations affected and the 
location, function and approximate number of employees to be compensated for terminating their services and when the plan has been 
communicated to those affected by it, raising an expectation that the plan will be carried out.
2.23 Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of services in the ordinary course of the 
Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax and amounts due to third parties and after elimination of revenue within 
the Group.
(a) Residential transactional fees
Generally, where contracts are unconditional, revenue is recognised on exchange of contracts. However, for new home developments 
revenue is recognised on a staged basis, following the terms of the contract, to reflect the Group’s obligations to find a buyer and to further 
support the client after exchange of contracts through to completion of the build and contract, which can be a number of years later. For 
these developments, revenue recognition commences when the underlying contracts are exchanged, with total revenue from the contract 
recognised by the date of completion.
(b) Commercial transactional fees
Generally, revenue is recognised on the date of completion or when unconditional contracts have been exchanged.
(c) Property consultancy
Revenue in respect of property consultancy represents commissions and fees recognised on a time basis, fixed fee or percentage of 
completion. Percentage of completion is principally measured by the proportion of actual costs incurred in relation to the best estimate  
of total costs expected for completion of the contract.
(d) Property and facilities management
Revenue represents fees earned for managing properties and providing facilities and is generally recognised in the period the services are 
provided using a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.
(e) Investment management
Revenue represents commissions and fees receivable, net of marketing costs in accordance with the relevant fee agreements.
Annual management fees are recognised, gross of costs, in the period to which the service has been provided, in accordance with the 
contracted fee agreements. Transaction fees are recognised on the date of completion of a purchase or sale transaction. Distribution fees 
are recognised on the completion of a signed subscription agreement and performance fees are recognised as earned and when approved 
by the fund.
(f) Work in progress
Work in progress generally relates to consultancy revenue and is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes an 
appropriate proportion of overheads.
(g) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
(h) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
(i) Other income
Other income includes interest and dividend income on available-for-sale investments plus fair value gains and losses on assets at fair  
value through profit or loss. 99

Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview
2.24 Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
finance leases.
Finance lease assets are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments at inception of the lease. The assets are then depreciated over the lower of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives of 
the assets.
The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases are included as liabilities in the statement of financial position. Leasing 
payments comprise capital and finance elements and the finance element is charged to the income statement.
The annual payments under all other lease agreements (operating leases) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into the operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
A lease is classified as onerous where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits 
expected to be received under it.
2.25 Dividends
Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
2.26 Adoption of standards, amendments and interpretations to standards
Standards, amendments and interpretations endorsed by the EU and mandatorily effective for the first time for the financial year beginning  
1 January 2017 that are not relevant or considered to have a significant impact on the Group and its financial statements include the following:
Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative
Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
The following standards and amendments to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, 
and have not been early adopted:
• IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ (‘IFRS 15’), including amendments, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018. The standard establishes a principles based approach for revenue recognition and is based on the concept of 
recognising revenue for obligations only when they are satisfied and the control of goods or services is transferred. It applies to all 
contracts with customers, except those in the scope of other standards. It replaces the separate models for goods, services and 
construction contracts under the current accounting standards. The implementation of IFRS 15 will result in some refinement in the timing 
of recognition of investment management performance fees and the amortisation period for contract costs however the impact of this 
refinement is not material.
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, including amendments, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. This 
standard addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. It replaces the guidance in 
IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement 
model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income and fair value through profit and loss. The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model and the 
contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred 
loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the 
recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. The 
Group’s available-for-sale investments will be renamed in accordance with IFRS 9, with the only change in accounting treatment being 
that fair value re-measurements in reserves will not be recycled to the income statement upon disposal of the investment. Otherwise, the 
application of IFRS 9 will not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. 
• IFRS 16, ‘Leases’, effective for the accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The standard addresses the classification, 
measurement and recognition of leases with the objective of ensuring that lessees and lessors provide relevant information that faithfully 
represents those transactions. The standard supersedes IAS 17 ‘Leases’. The standard is expected to have a significant impact on the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group. On adoption, lease agreements will give rise to both a right of use asset and a lease 
liability for future lease payables. Depreciation of the right of use asset will be recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis, 
with interest recognised on the lease liability. This will result in a change to the profile of the net charge taken to the income statement 
over the life of the lease. These charges will replace the lease costs currently charged to the income statement. The Group continues to 
assess the full impact of IFRS 16, however, the impact will greatly depend on the facts and circumstances at the time of adoption and 
upon transition choices adopted. It is therefore not yet practicable to provide a reliable estimate of the financial impact on the Group’s 
consolidated results.
Other standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not discussed above are not relevant or considered significant to 
the Group. 100

3. Financial risk management
3.1 Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks. The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the 
adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group uses financial instruments to manage material foreign currency and 
interest rate risk.
The treasury function is responsible for implementing risk management policies applied by the Group and has a policy and procedures 
manual that sets out specific guidelines on financial risks and the use of financial instruments to manage these.
3.2 Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risks primarily with respect to the euro, Hong Kong dollar and US 
dollar. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign 
operations. When there is a material committed foreign currency exposure the foreign exchange risk will be hedged. The Group may finance 
some overseas investments through the use of foreign currency borrowings. The Group does not actively seek to hedge risks arising from 
foreign currency translations due to their non-cash nature and the high costs associated with such hedging.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared for the major currencies to which the Group is exposed. Recent historical movements in these 
currencies has been considered and it has been concluded that a 5–10% movement in rates is a reasonable benchmark.
For the years ended 31 December, if the average currency conversion rates against sterling for the year had changed with all other variables 
held constant, the Group post-tax profit for the year would have increased or decreased as shown below:

3.3 Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest-bearing assets and liabilities. The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank 
borrowings, at both fixed and floating interest rates. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group cash flow to interest rate risk, 
which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. Group 
policy is to maintain at least 70% of its borrowings in fixed rate instruments.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, if the average interest rate for the year had changed with all other variables held constant, the 
Group’s post-tax profit for the year and equity would have increased or decreased as shown below:
£m
Increase in interest rates
+0.5% +1.0% +1.5% +2.0%

2016
Estimated impact on post-tax profit and equity (0.5) (0.5) (0.2) (0.2)
The rationale behind the 2.0% sensitivity analysis is based upon historic trends in interest rate movements and the short-term expectation 
that any increase or decrease greater than 2.0% is unlikely to occur.
3.4 Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale investments, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks 
and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to clients, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. The Group 
has policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before engaging with them. A risk control framework is used to 
assess the credit quality of clients, taking into account financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits for banks and financial institutions are set based on external ratings and in accordance with limits set by the Board.  
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
As at the reporting date, no significant credit risk existed in relation to banking counterparties. No credit limits were exceeded during the 
reporting year, and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties. There were no other significant 
receivables or individual trade receivable balances as at 31 December 2017. Refer to Note 19 for information on the credit quality of trade 
receivables and the maximum exposure to credit risk arising on outstanding receivables from clients.

3.5 Liquidity risk
The Group maintains appropriate committed facilities to ensure the Group has sufficient funds available for operations and expansion.  
The Group prepares an annual funding plan approved by the Board which sets out the Group’s expected financing requirements for the

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve comprising undrawn borrowing facilities (Note 22) and cash and cash 
equivalents (Note 20) on the basis of expected cash flow. This is carried out at local level in the operating companies of the Group in 
accordance with Group practice as well as on a Group consolidated basis.

3.6 Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• to safeguard the Group’s ability to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and
• to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2016. 
Savills plc is not subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements, with the exception of its regulated entities within the Savills 
Investment Management group and its FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) regulated entity, Savills Capital Advisors Ltd, in the UK. All 
regulated entities complied with the relevant capital requirements during the year ended 31 December 2017. The Savills Investment 
Management group has regulated entities in the UK, Jersey, Luxembourg, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and the US. For 
more information on Savills Investment Management group’s regulated entities and regulatory requirements, please visit www.savillsim.com. 
In order to maintain an optimal capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Board has put in place a distribution policy which takes into account the degree of maintainability of the Group’s different profit streams 
and the Group’s overall exposure to cyclical Transaction Advisory profits, as well as the requirement to maintain a certain level of cash 
resources for working capital and corporate development purposes. The Board will recommend an ordinary dividend broadly reflecting the 
profits derived from the Group’s less volatile businesses. In addition, when profits from the cyclical Transaction Advisory business are strong, 
the Board will consider and, if appropriate, recommend the payment of a supplemental dividend alongside the final ordinary dividend. The 
value of any such supplemental dividend will vary depending on the performance of the Group’s Transaction Advisory business and the 
Group’s anticipated working capital and corporate development requirements through the cycle. It is intended that, in normal circumstances, 
the combined value of the ordinary and supplemental dividends declared in respect of any year are covered at least 1.5 times by statutory 
retained earnings and/or at least 2.0 times by underlying profits after taxation. The Group complied with this policy throughout the year.  103

Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview
The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally, if required, to meet anticipated funding requirements. These borrowings, together with cash 
generated from operations, are then on-lent or contributed as equity to certain subsidiaries. The Board of Directors monitors a number of 
debt measures on a rolling forward 12-month basis including: gross cash by location; gross debt by location; cash subject to restrictions; 
total debt servicing cost to operating profit; gross borrowings as a percentage of EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation); and forecast headroom against available facilities. These internal measures indicate the levels of debt that the Group has and 
are closely monitored to ensure compliance with banking covenants and to confirm that the Group has sufficient unused facilities. The Group 
complied with all banking covenants throughout the year and met all internal counterparty exposure limits set by the Board.
The capital structure is as follows:

Total liabilities – 0.3 – 0.3
Level 1 instruments are those whose fair values are based on quoted market prices. The Group has no Level 1 instruments.
The fair value of unlisted available-for-sale investments is determined using valuation techniques using observable market data where 
available and rely as little as possible on entity estimates. The fair value of investment funds is based on underlying asset values determined 
by the Fund Manager’s audited annual financial statements. The fair value of other unlisted investments is based on price earnings models. 
These instruments are included in Level 2.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by using valuation techniques using observable market data. The fair value  
of derivative financial instruments is based on the market value of similar instruments with similar maturities. These instruments are included 
in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. The Group has no Level 
3 instruments. 105

5. Critical accounting estimates and management judgements
5.1 Accounting estimates
Estimates are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, current market conditions and other factors including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as a result 
of new information or more experience. The estimates that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts  
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
(a) Pension benefits
The present value of the defined benefit pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis  
using a number of assumptions including the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension 
obligations. The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the 
Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid 
and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. Other key assumptions for pension obligations are 
based in part on current market conditions. Additional information is disclosed in Note 10.2.
(b) Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.  
There are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Where the final tax outcome of these matters  
is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the 
period in which such determination is made.
(c) Deferred taxes
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the 
future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted. Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the future 
financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised, especially with regard 
to the extent that future taxable profits will be available against which losses can be utilised. 
(d) Valuation of intangible assets and useful life
The Group has made assumptions in relation to the potential future cash flows to be determined from separable intangible assets acquired 
as part of business combinations. This assessment involves assumptions relating to potential future revenues, appropriate discount rates 
and the useful life of such assets. These assumptions impact the income statement over the useful life of the intangible asset.
(e) Provisions
The Group and its subsidiaries are party to various legal claims. Provisions made within these financial statements and further details are 
contained in Note 24.1. Additional claims could be made which might not be covered by existing provisions or by insurance as detailed in 
Note 28.
5.2 Management judgements
In the course of preparing the financial statements, no judgements have been made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies, other than those involving estimations, that have had a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. 106

6. Segment analysis
Operating segments reflect internal management reporting to the Group’s chief operating decision maker, defined as the Group Executive 
Board (GEB). The operating segments are determined based on differences in the nature of their services. Geographical location also 
strongly affects the Group and both are therefore disclosed. The reportable operating segments derive their revenue primarily from 
property-related services. Refer to the Group overview on page 3 and the segmental reviews on pages 18 to 21 for further information  
on revenue sources.
Operations are based in four main geographical areas. The UK is the home of the parent Company with segment operations throughout  
the region. Asia Pacific segment operations are based in Hong Kong, Macau, China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore,  
Vietnam, Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar. Continental Europe segment operations are based in Germany, France, Spain, the 
Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Italy, Ireland, Poland and Czech Republic. North America segment operations are based in a number of 
states throughout the US and in Canada. The sales location of the client is not materially different from the location where fees are received 
and where the segment assets are located.
Within the UK, both commercial and residential services are provided. Other geographical areas, although largely commercial-based, also 
provide residential services, in particular Hong Kong, China, Vietnam, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan and Thailand.
The GEB assesses the performance of operating segments based on a measure of underlying profit before tax which adjusts reported 
pre-tax profit by profit/(loss) on disposals, share-based payment adjustment, significant restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs, 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets (excluding software) and impairments. Segmental assets and liabilities are not measured or 
reported to the GEB, but non-current assets are disclosed geographically on page 107.

The adjustment for share-based payments relates to the impact of the accounting standard for share-based compensation. The annual 
bonus is paid in a mixture of cash and deferred shares and the proportions can vary from one year to another. Under IFRS, the deferred 
share element is amortised to the income statement over the vesting period whilst the cash element is expensed in the year. The adjustment 
above addresses this by adding to or deducting from profit the difference between the IFRS 2 charge in relation to outstanding bonus-
related share awards and the estimated value of the current year bonus pool to be awarded in deferred shares. This adjustment is made to 
align the underlying staff cost in the year with the revenue recognised in the same period.
An impairment charge of £2.3m was recognised in the year relating to the goodwill of the Group’s Swedish property management business. 
Refer to Note 15 for further details. 
Profit on disposal includes profits recognised in relation to the disposals of the Group’s available-for-sale investments, SPF Private Clients 
Limited (£5.3m) and Cordea Savills German Retail Fund (£0.6m).
Restructuring costs includes costs of integration activities in relation to recent significant business acquisitions (primarily GBR Phoenix Beard 
and Smiths Gore in the UK and Savills Investment Management’s acquisition of SEB). 
Acquisition-related costs include £10.2m of provisions for the future payments in relation to the acquisition of Studley, Inc. which are expensed 
through the income statement to reflect the requirement for the recipients to remain actively engaged in the business at the payment date. 
Acquisition-related costs also include £1.4m for payments in relation to Savills Investment Management’s acquisition of Merchant Capital (Japan) 
in May 2014, £2.1m of transaction related costs (primarily Aguirre Newman and Larry Smith) and £7 .6m of provisions for future payments relating 
to acquisitions in the UK (primarily GBR Phoenix Beard and Smiths Gore) and North America. 110

10. Pension schemes
10.1 Defined contribution plans
The Group operates the Savills UK Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme, a number of defined contribution individual 
pension plans and a Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme in Hong Kong, to which it contributes. The total pension charges in respect of these 
plans were £26.9m (2016: £23.0m). The amount outstanding as at 31 December 2017 in relation to defined contribution schemes is £1.9m 
(2016: £1.5m).
10.2 Defined benefit plan 
The Group operates two defined benefit plans.
The Pension Plan of Savills (the ‘UK Plan’) is a UK-based plan which provided final salary pension benefits to some employees, but was 
closed with regard to future service-based benefit accrual with effect from 31 March 2010. From 1 April 2010, pension benefits for former 
employees of the UK Plan are provided through the Group’s defined contribution Personal Pension Plan.
The UK Plan is administered by a separate Trust that is legally separated from the Company. The board of the pension fund is composed of 
six trustees. The board of the pension fund is required by law and by its Article of Association to act in the interest of the fund and of all 
relevant stakeholders in the scheme. The board of the pension fund is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the 
fund. The contributions are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations.
A full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan was carried out as at 31 March 2016 and has been updated to 31 December 2017 by a qualified 
independent actuary.
The Savills Fund Management GMBH Plan (the ‘SFM Plan’) is a Germany-based plan which provides final salary benefits to 17 active 
employees and 97 former employees. The plan is closed to future service-based benefit accrual.
The SFM Plan is administered by an external Trust that is legally separated from the Company. The Trust Agreement requires the trustee to 
maintain the plan assets in the interest of the beneficiaries of the plan and to fulfil their pension entitlements in the event of insolvency to the 
extent of the plan assets held. The Investment Committee of the fund, advised by expert investment managers, is responsible for the 
investment policy with regards to the assets of the fund. The contributions are determined based on the annual valuations of an independent 
qualified actuary.
A full actuarial valuation of the SFM Plan was carried out as at 31 December 2017 by a qualified independent actuary.

Assumptions regarding future mortality are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience. These 
assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at age 60:
SFM Plan UK Plan
2017 2016 2017 2016 
Retiring at the end of the reporting year – Male 83.9 84.1 88.8 88.7
– Female 88.4 88.2 90.3 90.3
Retiring 20 years after the end of the reporting year – Male 86.6 86.5 91.0 90.9
– Female 91.0 90.8 92.7 92.7
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the principal assumptions is:
SFM Plan UK Plan
Impact on present value of  
scheme obligations £m
Impact on present value of  
scheme obligations £m
0.1% increase in discount rates (0.2) (7.1)
0.1% increase in inflation rate 0.2 4.0
0.1% increase in salary increase rate – 0.7
1 year increase in life expectancy 0.6 11.6
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that 
the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. 
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation 
liability recognised in the statement of financial position.
Plan assets are comprised as follows:
SFM Plan UK Plan
2017 2016 2017 2016
£m % £m % £m % £m %
Equity instruments – – – – 92.4 33% 98.1 38%

No Plan assets are the Group’s own financial instruments or property occupied or used by the Group. The fair values of the above equity and 
debt instruments are determined based on quoted market prices in active markets. Although the UK Plan does not invest directly in the 
Group’s financial instruments, it does invest in passive equity funds, so will have some exposure to FTSE All Share, hence indirectly to the 
Savills share price. 115
S a v ill s p l c  
Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview
Through the defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
(a) Asset volatility
The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield, this 
will create a deficit. The Plan holds a significant proportion of equities and investment funds, which are expected to outperform corporate 
bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short term.
(b) Changes in bond yields
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Plan’s liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the 
Plan’s bond holdings.
(c) Inflation risk
Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the Plan’s assets are either unaffected by or are loosely correlated with inflation, 
meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
(d) Life expectancy
The majority of the Plan’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an 
increase in the Plan’s liabilities. 
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the year ending 31 December 2018 are £9.0m. The Company expects to 
contribute £0.5m.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 22 years for the UK Plan and 18 years for the SFM Plan.

14. Earnings per share
14.1 Basic and diluted earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) are based on the profit attributable to owners of the Company and the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding the shares held by the EBT, 4,819,684 shares (2016: 5,706,307 shares) and the Rabbi 
Trust, 800,000 shares (2016: nil).
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of dilutive 
potential ordinary shares, being the share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price  
of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year and where performance conditions have been met.

The Directors regard the adjustments on the previous table necessary to give a fair picture of the underlying results of the Group for the year. 
The adjustment for share-based payment relates to the impact of the accounting standard for share-based compensation.
The annual bonus is paid in a mixture of cash and deferred shares and the proportions can vary from one year to another. Under IFRS the 
deferred share element is amortised to the income statement over the vesting period whilst the cash element is expensed in the year. The 
adjustment above addresses this by adding to or deducting from profit the difference between the IFRS 2 charge and the effective value of 
the annual share award in order to better match the underlying staff costs in the year with the revenue recognised in the same period.
The gross amounts of the above adjustments (Note 8) are amortisation of acquired intangible assets (excluding software) £3.9m (2016: 
£4.0m), impairment of goodwill of £2.3m (2016: £nil), share-based payment adjustment £1.2m credit (2016: £2.4m credit), restructuring costs 
of £7.7m (2016: £5.8m), net profit on disposals of £5.9m (2016: £0.1m), acquisition-related costs of £21.3m (2016: £28.7m). 119

15. Goodwill and intangible assets continued
During the year, goodwill and intangible assets were tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. Goodwill and intangible assets are 
allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) identified according to country of operation and business segment. In most cases, 
the CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation and these have been separately assessed and tested. A segment-level summary of the 
allocation of goodwill and indefinite useful life intangible assets is presented below:

15.1 Method of impairment testing
All recoverable amounts were determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use discounted cash flow projections 
based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by management covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year 
period are extrapolated using a terminal value. There was a £2.3m impairment charge recognised against goodwill and intangible assets 
arising from the annual impairment tests conducted (2016: £nil).
15.2 Assumptions
(a) Market conditions
In general, the models used assume that the property markets in which the Group operates (which drive its revenue growth) will remain stable.
(b) Discount rate
The discount rate applied to cash flows of each CGU is based on the Group’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (‘WACC’). WACC is the 
average cost of sources of financing (debt and equity), each of which is weighted by its respective use.
Key inputs to the WACC calculation are the risk-free rate, the equity market risk premium (the return that Savills shares provide over the 
risk-free rate), beta (reflecting the risk of the Group relative to the market as a whole) and the Group’s borrowing rates.
Group WACC was adjusted for risk relative to the country in which the assets were located. The risk-adjusted discount range of rates used in 
each region for impairment testing are as follows:
 2017 
Discount rate range 
 2016 
Discount rate range 
United Kingdom 10.0% 10.0%
Continental Europe 10.0% 10.0%
Asia Pacific 11.2%–18.1% 11.6%–18.1%
North America 10.0% 10.0% 121
S a v ill s p l c  
Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview
(c) Long-term growth rate
To forecast beyond the five years covered by detailed forecasts, a terminal value was calculated, using average long-term growth rates.  
The rates are based on the long-term growth rate in the countries in which the Group operates. The long-term growth rates used in each 
region for impairment testing are as follows:
2017 
Long-term growth 
rate range
2016 
Long-term growth 
rate range
United Kingdom 2.0% 1.5%
Continental Europe 1.4%–2.6% 1.5%
Asia Pacific 0.8%–5.7% 0.8%–5.7%
North America 2.3% 2.3%
15.3 Impairment charge
Following impairment testing, a £2.3m charge has been recognised through the income statement (2016: £nil) relating to goodwill on the 
Group’s Swedish property management business. The Swedish business operates under the European transactional and property 
management segments. Key assumptions of the discounted cash flow analysis are consistent with the above assumptions in Note 15.2.  
The residual value of goodwill relating to the Group’s Swedish business is not material. 
15.4 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The level of impairment is a reflection of best estimates in arriving at value-in-use, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash 
flow projections. Nonetheless, there are no CGUs for which management considers a reasonable possible change in a key assumption 
would give rise to an impairment apart from the Group’s Swedish business, which was partially impaired during the year. 
Future impairments on goodwill and intangible assets relating to any of the Group’s investments may be impacted by the following factors:
Market conditions – the expectations for future market conditions are key assumptions in the determination of the cash flow projections. For 
the purposes of the impairment tests, management expects the markets to remain stable.
Cost base – the cost base assumptions reflect 2017’s costs with limited growth in the fixed cost base going forward. Commissions and profit 
shares are correlated to the Group’s revenue and profits and the percentage payout. These are assumed to be consistent with existing rates.

(a) Aguirre Newman SA (‘Aguirre Newman’)
On 29 December 2017 the Group acquired 100% of the equity of Aguirre Newman SA, the leading Spanish independent real estate advisory 
business. The business provides agency, investment, management, architectural, consultancy, valuation, planning, corporate finance and 
asset management services. Combined with the Group’s existing Spanish business, the Group will benefit from a leading market position 
across all sectors in Spain and Portugal. 
Total acquisition consideration has provisionally been determined at £55.1m, with £48.2m settled in cash on completion and the remainder 
relating to the discounted value of deferred consideration of £6.9m payable in five equal annual instalments from December 2018.
A further £15.5m is payable in five equal annual instalments from December 2018, subject to the executive shareholders remaining actively 
engaged in the business over a period of up to five years. As required by IFRS 3 (revised) these payments will be expensed to the income 
statement over the relevant period of active engagement.
Transaction costs of £1.4m were also expensed as incurred to the income statement.
Goodwill of £40.5m and intangible assets of £3.4m relating to brand, customer relationships, customer contracts and order backlog have 
been provisionally determined. Goodwill is attributed to the experience, reputation and expertise of the fee-earners and is not expected to  
be deductible for tax purposes.
The business was acquired at the end of the financial year, and consequently did not contribute to the Group's revenues or underlying 
profits. Had the acquisition been made at the beginning of the financial year, the business would have contributed £68.4m of revenues.
The fair value of current trade and other receivables is £25.1m and includes trade receivables with a fair value of £23.6m. The gross 
contractual amount for trade receivables is £24.7m, of which £1.1m is expected to be uncollectible. 127

Goodwill of £9.2m has been provisionally determined. Goodwill is attributable to the experience and expertise of key staff and strong 
industry reputation and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

would have been £0.2m. 
The fair value of current trade and other receivables is £1.6m and includes trade receivables with a fair value of £1.4m. The gross contractual 
amount for trade receivables is £1.5m, of which £0.1m is expected to be uncollectible.

18. Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there are legally enforceable rights to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax relates to the same fiscal authority. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
realised through current tax. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities at 31 December, without taking into consideration the offsetting 
balances within the same jurisdiction, are as follows:

The carrying value of trade and other receivables is approximate to their fair value.
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables as the Group has a large number of clients internationally 
dispersed with no individual client owing a significant amount. The credit quality of receivables is managed at a local subsidiary level with 
uncollectible amounts being impaired where necessary.
Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings are unsecured, interest-free and generally cleared within the month.
As at 31 December 2017, trade receivables of £280.6m (2016: £232.0m) were neither past due nor impaired and fully performing.
As at 31 December 2017, trade receivables of £19.9m (2016: £19.3m) were impaired and provided for. The individually impaired receivables 
mainly relate to receivables from clients that have been affected by the uncertain economic conditions where funding and completion have 
been delayed and cash flow has become uncertain.
The ageing of these receivables is as follows:

which are past due at the reporting date but are not considered impaired as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the 
amounts are still considered recoverable. 131

(a) Professional indemnity claims
These arise from various legal actions, proceedings and other claims that are pending against the Group and are based on reasonable 
estimates, taking into account the opinions of legal counsel. The nature of the amounts provided in respect of legal actions, proceedings and 
other claims is such that the extent and timing of cash flows can be difficult to estimate and the ultimate liability may vary from the amounts 
provided. The non-current portion of these provisions is expected to be utilised within the next two to five years. Included are provisions for 
claims relating to subsidiaries prior to their disposal.
(b) Dilapidation provisions
The Group is required to perform dilapidation repairs and in certain instances restore properties to agreed specifications prior to the 
properties being vacated at the end of their lease term. These amounts are based on estimates of repair and restoration costs at a future 
date and therefore a degree of uncertainty exists over the future outflows, given that these are subject to repair and restoration cost price 
fluctuations and the extent of repairs to be completed. The majority of the non-current portion of these provisions is expected to be utilised 
within the next two to nine years.
(c) Onerous leases
A provision is recognised where the costs of meeting the obligations under a lease contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be 
received and is measured as the net least cost of exiting the contract, being the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or 
penalties arising from the failure to fulfil it. The majority of the non-current portion of these provisions is expected to be utilised within the next 
two to five years.
(d) Restructuring provision
This provision comprises termination payments to employees affected by restructuring and lease termination penalties. 137

26.2 Fair value of options
For all the DSP and DSBP schemes the fair value of awards is the closing share price before award date. The Actuarial Binomial model of 
actuaries Lane Clark & Peacock LLP is used to fair value awards granted under the PSP and Sharesave schemes. The key inputs to 
determine the fair value of the awards granted under the PSP scheme during 2017 are shown below.
Performance Share Plan: Awards in the year ended 31 December 2017 22 May 2017
Share price at grant date 887.5p
Risk-free rate 0.4%
Volatility of Savills share price 25% per annum 
Correlation of Savills share price to index 46% 
Employee turnover Zero
The expected volatility is measured over the three years prior to the date of grant to match the vesting period of the award. The risk-free rate 
is the yield on a zero coupon UK government bond at each grant date, with term based on the expected life of the option or award.
The fair values of options granted in the period are shown below.
Grant Grant date Deferred period Fair value pence
DSBP 2017 18 April 2017 3 – 4 years 929.0

burdened with such paper documents, and to the Company, as it is consistent with our target of saving printing and distribution costs.

Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements
Certain statements included in this Annual Report are forward-
looking and are therefore subject to risks, assumptions and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
those expressed or implied because they relate to future events. 
These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, 
statements relating to the Company’s expectations. Forward-
looking statements can be identified by the use of relevant 
terminology including the words: ‘believes’, ‘estimates’, ‘anticipates’, 
‘expects’, ‘intends’, ‘forecasts’, ‘plans’, ‘goal’, ‘target’, ‘aim’, ‘may’, 
‘will’, ‘would’, ‘could’ or ‘should’ or, in each case, their negative or 
other variations or comparable terminology and include all matters 
that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places 
throughout this Annual Report and include statements regarding our 
intentions, beliefs or current expectations and those of our Officers, 
Directors and employees concerning, amongst other things, our 
results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, 
strategies and the businesses we operate.
Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
those estimated by the forward-looking statements include, but are 
not limited to:
– Global economic business conditions;
–  Monetary and interest rate policies;
–  Foreign currency exchange rates;
–  Equity and property prices;
–  The impact of competition, inflation;
–  Changes to regulations, taxes;
–  Changes to consumer saving and spending habits; and
–  Our success in managing the above factors.
Consequently, our actual future financial condition, performance 
and results could differ materially from the plans, goals and 
expectations set out in our forward-looking statements. 
Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any particular 
expectation will be met and readers are cautioned not to place 
undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak only  
at their respective dates.
The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any 
forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, 
future events or otherwise.  2017 Report and Accounts Savills plc
