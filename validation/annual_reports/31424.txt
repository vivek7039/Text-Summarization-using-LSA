Chairman’s statement
Effective risk management
Improved pricing for insurance in 2018 should 
improve the prospects for underwriting profits
Lower capacity 
auction prices in 
2017 will allow more 
effective use of 
available Helios funds. 
Michael Cunningham
Non-executive Chairman
Summary
• Loss before tax and impairment of 
£406,000 (2016 profit: £1,336,000)
• Adjusted net asset value at 
£1.60 per share (2016: £1.96) 
• Five acquisitions in 2017 added 
£4.4m of capacity to 2017 
underwriting year – 13% increase
• 1.5p per share total dividend 
payable (2016: 5.5p)
Your Board announces the results for 2017 
which were affected by the underwriting losses 
arising from natural catastrophes that occurred 
in 2017 and by the reduction in the value of 
the syndicate portfolio of capacity. The loss 
before impairment for the year is £406,000 
(2016 profit: £1,334,000), whilst the adjusted 
net asset value of the Group is £1.60 per share 
(2016: £1.96).
The full impact of the 2017 losses on the Helios 
portfolio of £5.8m was mitigated by the use 
of quota share and stop loss reducing the net 
loss for 2017 to £1.9m.
Underwriting profits from the two older 
underwriting years, the “off-risk” years, made 
a good contribution but the 2017 underwriting 
year in its first 12 months recognised a 
significant loss following the series of natural 
catastrophes in the second half of 2017. 
Other income arising from fees from 
reinsurers, recoveries from reinsurance 
policies and investment income have 
contributed to this year results. Total 
costs of £1.8m included the expenditure 
on protecting the portfolio using stop loss 
reinsurance and foreign exchange losses 
from the strengthening of the US$.
Strategy
The building of a portfolio of participations on 
leading Lloyd’ s syndicates remains the strategic 
objective of the Group. During 2017 the key 
developments were:
• building the portfolio of capacity to £41m 
for 2018 by acquiring a further five limited 
liability vehicles (“LLVs”);
• maintaining the quality of the portfolio 
and the outperformance of the underwriting 
results average against the Lloyd’s market 
as a whole;
• continuing to use quota share reinsurance 
to reduce the risk from the underwriting 
and to assist in the financing of the 
underwriting capital of the portfolio; and
• broadening the access to the portfolio 
to private capital by using a protected 
cell reinsurance structure.
Capacity acquired
During 2017 a further five corporate members were acquired that increased the capacity for 
the 2015 to 2017 years of account as shown below.
Year of account – £m
2015 2016 2017 2018
Capacity at 1 January 2017 32.2 33.7 32.6 41.0
Acquired during 2017 4.1 4.1 4.4 — 
Capacity at 31 December 2017 36.3 37.8 37.0 41.0
These five acquisitions in 2017 were purchased 
for a total consideration of £4.8m, of which 
£2.1m was attributed to the value of capacity 
acquired. Given the uncertainty generated as 
to valuation of LLVs in the second half of the 
year arising from the natural catastrophes, 
the flow of potential acquisitions slowed. 
With prospective 2017 underwriting year 
losses and the reduction in the value of 
capacity, there is the prospect of acquiring 
further LLVs in the future at lower prices. 
We will continue to build on the quality of the 
capacity portfolio as it is essential to acquire 
and retain the participations on the better 
managed syndicates. Annual report and financial statements 2017 — Helios Underwriting plc 5

The Adjusted Net Asset Value has declined 
due to funding the loss and the fall in capacity 
value. In addition funds have been taken 
from tangible assets to pay for acquisitions 
which are reflected in the capacity value total. 
This portfolio value is subject to fluctuation 
and the value could recover when cash from 
underwriting activities becomes available 
at corporate member level. This basis 
of valuation is commonly used for the 
valuations of LLVs in Lloyd’s market.
Dividend
The Board recommends that the final dividend 
remains the same as last year at 1.5p per 
share (2016: final dividend of 1.5p plus a 
special dividend 4.0p, a total for 2016 of 5.5p). 
This dividend will be payable to shareholders 
on the register on 8 June 2018. If approved, 
the dividend will be paid in a single payment 
on 6 July 2018. The board has considered the 
existing dividend policy which would in normal 
circumstances have paid a special dividend 
between 20-30% of the 2015 underwriting year 
profits received. In view of the opportunities 
for acquisitions at favourable prices and the 
possibility of share buybacks (see below) the 
board believes that it is prudent to retain the 
cash for these purposes and does not 
recommend a special dividend this year.
Share Buyback and 
Whitewash Resolution
The Directors are seeking authority to purchase 
up to a maximum of 1,510,424 ordinary shares 
(being equivalent to approximately 10% of the 
Company’ s issued share capital). The proposed 
buyback(s) would only be implemented if the 
Board believes that the purchase(s) would 
enhance net asset value per share and be in 
the best interests of shareholders generally.
As the proposed buyback would result 
in an increase of the proportionate voting 
interest of each shareholder who retains their 
full shareholding following such transaction,
it gives rise to certain considerations under 
the City Code. Each of Nigel Hanbury, Hampden 
Capital Limited, Nicholas Wentworth-Stanley, 
Jeremy Evans, Sir Michael Oliver, Peter Nutting, 
Timothy Oliver and his immediate family 
members are considered by the Panel to be 
acting in concert, as the concert party, in 
respect of the Company and together, as the 
concert party are interested in 29.62% of the 
Company’s issued share capital. Were the 
aggregate interests of the concert party in 
the voting rights of the Company to reach 
30% or more as a result of the proposed 
buyback, the members of the concert party 
would be required to make a mandatory offer 
under Rule 9 of the City Code. 
The Takeover Panel may waive the 
requirement for a general offer to be made 
in accordance with Rule 9 if, amongst other 
things, the shareholders of a company who 
are independent of the person who would 
otherwise be required to make an offer, and 
any person acting in concert with it, pass an 
ordinary resolution on a poll approving such 
a waiver.
Accordingly, the Company has prepared a 
circular and related resolutions for consideration 
by the independent shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting, notice of which 
is being circulated with the Annual Report 
and financial statements.
Outlook
The objective to provide access to insurance 
exposures at Lloyd’s on quality syndicates 
continues to develop with the growth of the 
capacity portfolio and the implementation 
of a protected cell reinsurance structure for 
participation by private capital.
The 2017 underwriting year was affected by 
the worst catastrophe losses for some years, 
in addition 2016 returns were lower due to 
softening market conditions. The 2017 losses
have been fully recognised in these accounts 
so any improvement in the next two years 
will contribute to earnings. In addition firmer 
market conditions should be reflected in the 
underwriting returns in the future.
The strategy of building a capacity 
portfolio of the better available syndicates 
at Lloyd’s should allow Helios to maintain 
its outperformance of returns on capacity 
against the Lloyd’s market. The recent soft 
underwriting conditions will distinguish the 
better managed syndicates which will deliver 
top quartile performance within the Lloyd’s 
market which will reinforce the demand for 
these syndicates and assist in the recovery 
of the auction values. We see the lower 
auction values and the prospective 2017 
underwriting year losses as an opportunity 
to continue to build the portfolio of capacity 
by purchasing LLVs at lower values. 
Board 
This is my first report as your Chairman and I 
would like to pay tribute to my predecessor 
Sir Michael Oliver for his valuable contribution 
to the company since its inception. I would 
also like to welcome Edward Fitzalan-Howard 
to the board and look forward to working with 
him in the future. The 2017 underwriting year 
has fully tested our strategy and I am pleased 
to say that all the protections that have been 
developed and executed have proved to be 
successful in insulating the company from 
severe losses. In addition cash resources are 
available to take advantage of lower prices to 
enable the company to increase capacity in 
line with the existing strategy. The executive 
team are to be congratulated on achieving an 
excellent result in the circumstances.

Opportunities in the future
Acquisition strategy continues  
to build the fund of capacity
Nigel Hanbury
Chief Executive
Summary
• Adjusted net asset value at 
£1.60 per share (2016: £1.96) 
• Five acquisitions in 2017 added 
£4.4m of capacity to 2017 
underwriting year
• 1.5p per share total dividend 
payable (2016: 5.5p)
We have continued 
to implement our 
strategy of building 
the portfolio of 
syndicate capacity.
Highlights
• The strategy of building a quality 
portfolio of syndicate capacity continues 
successfully as the portfolio increased 
from £32.6m to £41.0m – a 26% increase 
• The use of quota share has provided 
finance for acquisitions and has mitigated 
the loss from 2017 catastrophe losses
• The reduction of the value of the capacity 
portfolio to £13.0m (2016: £14.9m) will 
provide opportunities to acquire further 
LLVs at reduced prices
• Helios’ portfolio underwriting results for 2015 
underwriting year outperformed Lloyd’s 
return on capacity by 6.6% demonstrating 
the quality of the portfolio
• Market conditions for underwriting 
are improving after the 2017 losses
• With the prospect of improving 
underwriting returns, together with the 
opportunity to acquire LLVs at lower 
values, Helios is well placed to deliver 
value to shareholders in the future
Capacity value
The value of the portfolio of the syndicate 
capacity remains the major asset of the 
Group and an important factor in delivering 
overall returns to shareholders. The adjusted 
net asset value (“ANAV”), being the value of 
the net tangible assets of the Group, together 
with the current value of the portfolio capacity, 
is a key management metric in determining 
growth in value to shareholders. 
The Board had recognised that the average 
prices derived from the annual capacity auctions 
managed by the Corporation of Lloyd’s could 
be subject to material change if the level of 
demand for syndicate capacity reduces or if 
the supply of capacity for sale should increase. 
In 2017 the supply of capacity increased due 
in the main to surplus pre-emption capacity 
being sold. Capacity traded increased to 
£181.3m compared with £66.7m a year 
earlier while. Subscription demand reduced 
as the cash available to LLVs was used to 
reserve for the losses from the significant 
catastrophes in 2017. 
The fall in the weighted average prices for the 
2017 auctions valued the Helios portfolio at 
31 December 2017 at £13.0m (2016: £14.9m). 
The movement in the capacity and its value 
is as follows: 
2016 2017
Capacity 
£m
Value
£m
Capacity 
£m
Value
£m
At 1 January 28.1 11.8 32.6 14.9
Capacity acquired with LLVs 5.5 2.3 4.4 2.1
Other capacity movements/change in value (1.0) 0.8 4.0 (4.0)
At 31 December 32.6 14.9 41.0 13.0
The weighted average price of capacity 
has now fallen back to just above levels 
last seen in 2012 – a time following a period 
of higher catastrophe loss activity when 
surplus cash in LLVs was reduced. Internal 
valuation assessments of capacity values 
have indicated the sensitivity to the expected 
values from the immediate expected profit 
distributions. As both 2016 and 2017 
underwriting years in aggregate will have 
limited cash distributions to LLVs, this 
has implicitly been reflected in the price 
of syndicate capacity traded at auction. 
As syndicate profitability resumes, the Board 
expects the projected cash flows will lead to 
higher valuations for capacity by stimulating 
the demand in the capacity auctions as some 
owners of the LLVs will wish to reinvest cash 
generated within the LLV in auction purchases.

Strategic report
We will continue to invest in the better 
managed syndicates at Lloyd’s, to provide 
the outperformance of returns that justify 
the capacity values.
The accounting policy requires an assessment 
of the carrying value of each syndicate 
participation against the latest average auction 
prices. The impairment charge for this year 
of £899,000 (2016: £555,000) results in a 
reduction in the fair value of the syndicate 
capacity held on the balance sheet.
These movements in the carrying value of 
capacity have no impact on cash flow.
Underwriting result
The calendar year underwriting profit from 
the Helios retained capacity for 2017 has 
been generated from results recognised 
in the portfolio from the 2015 to 2017 
underwriting years as follows:
Underwriting year contribution
Helios retained profits
Underwriting year 
2017
£’000
2016

2014 — 1,661
2015 1,294 1,031
2016 741 (484)
2017 (1,852) —
183 2,208
During 2017, the 2015 underwriting year 
midpoint estimate increased from 8.2% return 
on capacity to a final result of 12.9%. The overall 
return on capacity for 2015 benefited from 
the below average loss activity. The midpoint 
estimate for the 2016 underwriting year at 
31 December 2017 was 3.5% (2016: 3.5%). 
The expected improvement in the midpoint 
estimate for 2016 has been impacted by the 
2017 hurricane losses as this underwriting 
year had some exposure to those events. 
Nevertheless, we would expect the 2016 
underwriting year forecast to improve over 
the next 12 months to make a contribution 
to 2018 calendar year underwriting profits.
The level of major claims for the whole of 
Lloyd’s during 2017 at £4.5bn (2016: £2.2bn) 
was the third highest since the turn of the 
century and above the long-term average. 
These losses were incurred mainly as a result 
of the three hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) 
and the wild fires in California. Consequently, 
the 2017 underwriting year result in the first 
12 months retained by Helios made a significant 
negative contribution mainly arising from 
this claims experience. The 2017 result at 
12 months represents a loss of 15% of the 
retained capacity but we expect profits earned 
after January 2018 to reduce the 2017 
underwriting year loss substantially; it is 
too early to forecast an expected result.
Following the recent receipt of the first 
estimates of the 2017 year of account we 
are pleased the Helios mid point loss of 8.4% 
is in line with the market figure of 8.0%.
The underwriting environment has improved 
in 2018 following these losses within most 
classes of business although the availability 
of additional capital has restricted the upwards 
price adjustment following the 2017 losses. 
Other income
Helios generates additional income at Group 
level from the following:

Fees from reinsurers 426 557
Corporate reinsurance 
recoveries 629 —
Goodwill on bargain 
purchases 65 —
Investment income 158 347
Total other income 1,278 904
Fees and profit commission from reinsurers have 
reduced as the profit commission falls with 
the level of underwriting profits recognised. 
The Group has reinsurance policies as member 
level where any expected year losses can 
be recovered up the level of indemnity for 
the member. For the 2017 year of account, 
an assessment has been made of the 
likely year of account loss and a potential 
reinsurance recovery has been made. 
The Group Funds at Lloyd’s are invested 
to produce consistent long-term returns. 
Total costs
The costs of the Group comprise the operating 
expenses and the cost of the stop loss 
protection bought to mitigate the downside 
from large underwriting losses.

The costs have increased as foreign exchange 
losses arising from the strengthening of the 
US$ have been incurred.
Growth in capacity through acquisitions
The strategy of building a portfolio of underwriting 
capacity at Lloyd’s has continued through the 
purchase of further corporate members. There 
remains a steady flow of vehicles for sale as 
existing owners wish to cease underwriting due 
to a change of circumstances. During 2017 
£4.4m (2016: £5.6m) of capacity was acquired. 
We remained selective on the purchases and 
as the effect of the 2017 losses became 
apparent the discounts to the formal valuations 
increased. We would anticipate that the LLVs 
that are marketed for sale in 2018 will have 
lower values attributed as the average capacity 
prices are lower and as the prospective 2017 
losses are factored into the valuations. 
There remains a risk to the implementation 
of our strategy if suitable vehicles are not 
available at attractive prices.

Quality of portfolio
We continue to focus ruthlessly on the quality syndicates. In order to maintain the quality we strive to acquire LLVs with portfolios that comprise 
quality syndicates thereby having to pay the average auction prices. Participations on weaker syndicates in acquired portfolios are sold to maintain 
the overall quality. The six largest participations with the leading managing agents at Lloyd’s account for 79% of the portfolio. These participations 
in syndicates managed by these managing agents represent shares in the better managed businesses at Lloyd’s.  Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2017 8
Reinsurance quota share
The use of quota share reinsurance to provide 
access to the Lloyd’s underwriting exposures 
for reinsurers and private capital has been 
expanded. The core of the panel of reinsurers 
remains XL Group plc and Everest Reinsurance 
Bermuda Limited.
This reinsurance reduces the exposure of the 
portfolio and assists in the financing of the 
underwriting capital. Helios will seek to reinsure 
a significant proportion of the capacity at the 
start of the underwriting year to mitigate the 
open-year underwriting exposures. For corporate 
members acquired during the year, a proportion 
of the “on-risk” capacity will be ceded to 
reinsurers whilst the capacity on older years 
will be retained 100% by Helios. Therefore, 
the proportion of the overall capacity that 
Helios retains is expected to rise as further 
corporate members are acquired in the future. 
The profits earned after the company has 
been acquired will be recognised by Helios.
The table shows that the Helios retained capacity 
increases significantly in years 2 and 3 as further 
corporate members are acquired and the 
older years are not reinsured. Capacity 
on underwriting years after 18 months of 
development is substantially “off risk” as 
the underlying insurance contracts have 
mostly expired. 
Therefore, the profits from the capacity on 
the older years are retained 100% by Helios. 
The proportion of overall capacity retained by 
Helios for the 2016 and 2017 underwriting 
years is expected to increase to approximately

Development of profit estimates
As Helios has no active involvement in the 
underwriting or management of the syndicates 
in which it participates, it relies on information 
on forecast profitability of the portfolio that is 
released on a quarterly basis by the managing 
agents of the syndicates. The managing agents 
have traditionally been conservative in the 
estimation of the profitability of a year of 
account, waiting until the development of 
the underlying reserves for the claims can 
be assessed with greater certainty. 
The capacity acquired on the “off-risk” years 
that is retained 100% by Helios contributes 
a significant part of the profits of the Group. 
The chart below indicates that a significant 
proportion of the improvement in the estimates 
of profitability of syndicates are declared by 
the managing agents in the last 12 months 
to the close of an underwriting year. Even 
though the 2017 underwriting year has 
incurred significant catastrophe losses and 
is currently forecast to close at an overall 
loss for the underwriting year at 36 months, 
the loss recognised at 12 months for 2017 
of approximately 15% of capacity is higher 
that the ultimate expected loss to be declared 
at 36 months. Therefore when Helios will 
benefit from profits recognised from the 
12 month stage on 2017 underwriting year.
Quality of portfolio continued
The underwriting results of the Helios portfolio have on average outperformed the Lloyd’s market average. Helios’ average return on capacity 
over the last three closed years is 14.2% and is on average 5.4% higher than the average of the Lloyd’s market.
The combined ratio of the portfolio (before Helios corporate costs) has been 5.79% lower on average over the last three calendar years. 
These incremental returns demonstrate the diversity and breadth of underwriting expertise within the businesses comprising the portfolio 
of syndicate capacity.

Risk management
Helios continues to ensure that the portfolio is well diversified across classes of businesses 
and managing agents at Lloyd’s. 
The purchase of quota share reinsurance cedes 70% of the risk on the younger or “on-risk” 
years, which has remained consistent for the last three years. 
Following the 2017 losses there has been a change in pricing for most classes of business and 
the rate change data published shows increases on average of 5 per cent. The 2017 losses 
from three hurricanes making landfall in the US were significant but the losses were absorbed 
by the strong capital position of the insurance industry. The high aggregation of coastal 
exposures in the US and other developed markets is one reason why further catastrophe 
losses and dislocations cannot be ruled out in the future. 
The biggest single risk faced by insurers arises from the possibility of mispricing insurance on 
a large scale. This is mitigated by the diversification of the syndicate portfolio and by the depth 
of management experience within the syndicates that Helios supports. These management 
teams have weathered multiple market cycles and the risk management skills employed 
should reduce the possibility of substantial under-reserving of previous-year underwriting.
We assess the downside risk in the event of a major loss through the monitoring of the 
aggregate net losses estimated by managing agents to the catastrophe risk scenarios 
(“CRS”) prescribed by Lloyd’s. 
The individual syndicate net exposures will depend on the business underwritten during 
the year and the reinsurance protections purchased at syndicate level.
The aggregate exceedance probability (“AEP”) assesses the potential impact across the 
portfolio from either single or multiple large losses with a probability of occurring greater 
than once in a 30-year period.

In addition, Helios buys stop loss reinsurance 
that will mitigate the impact of a significant 
loss to the portfolio.
For 2018, the scope of the stop loss cover has 
been rationalised and terms have been included 
which will assist in funding a large loss.

Helios has generated free cash of £1m in 2017 
(2016: £3m) from the distribution of its share 
of the final underwriting profits of the 2015 
underwriting year. During the year, the Group 
funded a 2017 solvency deficit in November 
2017, contributing to the increase in Helios 
own funds used as underwriting capital. We 
anticipate that £3m of the Helios own funds 
will be released by Lloyd’s in 2018, which 
together with the 2015 distribution of 
retained profits will provide free cash to 
Helios of £4m for acquisitions in 2018.
Corporate, social and environmental 
responsibility
Helios aims to meet its expectations of its 
shareholders and other stakeholders in 
recognising, measuring and managing 
the impacts of its business activities. 
As Helios manages a portfolio of Lloyd’s 
syndicate capacity, it has no direct 
responsibility for the management of those 
businesses. Each managing agent has 
responsibility for the management of those 
businesses, their staff and employment 
policies and the environmental impact. 
Therefore, the Board does not consider 
it appropriate to monitor or report any 
performance indicators in relation to corporate, 
social or environmental matters.

Outperformance by quality  
syndicates increases compared  
with Lloyd’s average 
Market conditions improving with modestly positive rate increases 
in most classes of business
The underwriting results of the Helios 
portfolio of syndicates have consistently 
outperformed the Lloyd’s market average 
both on an annually accounted basis measured 
by combined ratio and on a three-year account 
basis, measured by return on underwriting 
capacity. Helios’ calendar year combined 
ratio (before corporate costs) was 106.9% 
in 2017 (94.6% in 2016) compared with the 
Lloyd’s combined ratio which was 114% in 
2017 (97.9% in 2016).
Over the last four calendar years, the average 
combined ratio of the Helios portfolio was 
91.5%, outperforming Lloyd’ s by six percentage 
points a year. These incremental returns 
compared with the Lloyd’s market average 
demonstrate the quality of the syndicates in 
the Helios portfolio. The chart below shows 
the combined ratio of the Helios portfolio 
compared with Lloyd’s from 2012 to 2016.
With the closure of the 2015 Account at 
31 December 2016 the Helios portfolio 
has outperformed Lloyd’s for the seventh 
successive three-year account result, reporting 
a profit of 12.9% on capacity compared with 
the Lloyd’ s market average of 6.3% on capacity. 
The chart below shows the return on capacity 
of the Helios portfolio compared with Lloyd’s 
for the last four closed years from 2012 to 2015 
and includes the 3.5% on capacity midpoint 
estimated results for the 2016 Account at Q8 
(Lloyd’s average is a loss of 4%).
$144bn record insured losses from 
natural catastrophes in 2017
The increase in Helios’ calendar year 
combined ratio in 2017 was driven in large 
part by record insured losses from natural 
catastrophes estimated at $144bn by Swiss 
Re Sigma. Insured claims were up from $56bn 
in 2016 and above the inflation-adjusted 
annual average of the previous ten years of 
2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Q8

$58bn a year. The largest losses were three 
major category four plus hurricanes (Harvey, 
Irma and Maria) which Swiss Re estimates 
will cost around $92bn with claims from the 
Caribbean Islands, Puerto Rico, Texas and 
parts of western Florida. Major losses included 
earthquakes in Mexico in September 2017 
costing $1.6bn and a series of wildfires in 
California costing just over $12bn. 
Supply of capital still at all time highs
Despite the hurricane losses at year end 2017 
global reinsurer capital again reached a record 
high, according to Aon Benfield, of $605bn 
increasing by 2% on year end 2016. Alternative 
capital grew by 10% to $89bn principally 
reflecting additional deployment into 
collateralised reinsurance structures as 
investors “reloaded” capital following the 
hurricane losses. Alternative capital is now 
15% of total reinsurance underwriting capital 
and continues to provide strong competition

to traditional reinsurers as well as enabling 
traditional reinsurers to buy protection 
themselves from catastrophe bonds, 
collateralised reinsurance and (sidecar) 
reinsurers. Alternative capital has increased 
significantly in the past ten years with assets 
under management of the ILS fund managers 
increasing by 1,000%. Global reinsurance 
capital has increased by 78% since 2008. 
Both individually and collectively measured 
as a percentage of US industry capital the 
2017 hurricane losses were not as significant 
as previous major hurricane years such as 
2005 (Katrina, Rita and Wilma) and 1992 
(Andrew). Collectively Hurricanes Harvey, 
Irma and Maria cost 10.1% of US industry 
capital with Maria being the larger at 4.0%. 
Insurers benefited from the fact that much of 
the flood loss for Hurricane Harvey, around 
70% according to CoreLogic, was not covered 
by insurance while a government entity, the 
National Flood Insurance Programme, is 
estimated to lose $8bn, although $1bn may 
be recoverable from reinsurers.
In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma 
cost 15.9% of US industry capital with Katrina 
on its own amounting to 11.3%, while in 1992 
Hurricane Andrew cost 9.5%. The strong 
capital position of both insurers and reinsurers 
has enabled the 2017 catastrophe losses to 
be absorbed with a much more muted impact 
on rates in 2018 than in 1993 or 2006.
The insurance market in 2018
Market conditions remain the most competitive 
in Lloyd’s since the late 1990s when Lloyd’s 
reported four consecutive years of underwriting 
losses on a three-year account basis. Increasing 
broker power is a symptom of the soft market 
as are acquisition costs. However, Lloyd’s 
acquisition costs and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net premium reduced 
marginally to 39% in 2017 compared with 
40% in 2016. 
The start point for Lloyd’s is challenging with 
the 2017 combined ratio excluding prior year 
releases and major losses being only marginally 
profitable at 98.4%. This demonstrates the 
compounding effect of rate reductions for the 
previous four to five years. On the same basis 
Lloyd’s combined ratio was 87.8% in 2011 
and 83.8% in 2005, the two most recent above 
average catastrophe loss years before 2017. 
Analysis by leading US analyst VJ Dowling 
suggests that we are now in the “cheating 
phase” of the cycle over distribution from 
prior years. Despite this, AM Best reports 
that it expects US companies to release 
$4.6bn from reserves in 2017. The last period 
when US companies were boosting reserves 
declaring prior years’ losses was 2000 to 
2005. Commercial lines which include other 
liability are where reserve weakness is evident 
with Aon’s annual Industry Reserve Study 
estimating that commercial lines had an 
overall reserve deficiency of $4.2bn at year 
end 2016 compared with its estimate of a 
$1.8bn reserve deficiency at year end 2015. 
Reserving concerns on US liability business is 
likely to be the reason for liability rate increases 
being higher than expected so far in 2018. 
The rating environment
The final quarter of 2017 and the first quarter 
of 2018 has marked a change in trend with 
market conditions in most classes of business 
moving from a prolonged period of rate 
reductions to modestly positive rate increases 
combined with growing exposures benefiting 
in particular from a solid US economy. Across 
all classes of business, based on Hampden’s 
rate index, risk-adjusted rate changes were 
up by 5% in January/February 2018.
At 1 January 2018, following five years of rate 
reductions for US reinsurance business, rates 
increased by 13% using Guy Carpenter’ s rate 
index and are now the same level as in 2014 
and 2002. The rate index shows that rates 
are now down by 23% compared with rating 
levels in 2012 (the reduction was 31% a year 
ago in January 2017). While major losses in 
2017 were concentrated on US business 
reinsurance, rating is also up for international 
business with the average rate online globally 
increasing by 6.1%, again using Guy Carpenter’ s 
rate index. 
Despite reinsurance rate increases the level 
of reinsurance pricing continues to be at a 
level which enables cost-effective risk transfer 
for insurers to reinsurers; the change in trend 
in insurance rates is potentially more significant 
given that insurance business comprises 72.3% 
of Helios’ portfolio for 2018 compared with 
only 27.7% of reinsurance business. 
The economy drives the property casualty 
insurance industry with net written premiums, 
a proxy for demand, tracking nominal GDP 
fairly well other than in “hard markets”. For 
the full year 2017, US nominal GDP grew by 
2.9%, down from 3.7% in 2015. Net written 
premium growth for all property/casualty 
insurers in the US was 4.1% for the first three 
quarters of 2017, up from 2.8% in 2016. 
A continued focus on quality
Our focus in this market is to focus syndicate 
portfolios on quality syndicates with key success 
characteristics being conservative reserving 
and a focus on profit rather than growth.
The Helios portfolio for 2018 continues to 
provide a good spread of business across 
managing agents and classes of business. 
The two largest classes of business remain 
reinsurance at 27.7% (26.0% in 2017) where 
the Hampden Rate Index currently shows 
rate rises of 7.1% and US dollar property 
insurance at 18.2% (16.9% in 2016) where 
the Hampden Rate Index shows rate rises 
of 7.4%.
Capacity auction values
The Helios portfolio for 2018 continues 
to have an above average auction value for 
freehold tradable syndicates. The weighted 
average price of auction tradable syndicates 
was 37.5p per £ in 2017 (£34.8m of capacity) 
or 19.8% higher than the 31.3p per £ average 
for capacity by Third Party Members (unaligned 
to the managing agents). On the same basis 
in 2017 the Helios portfolio with £26.3m 
of auction tradable capacity was valued 
at 56.7p per £ of capacity or 42.1% higher 
than the 39.9p per £ average for Third Party 
Members. The fall in prices at the 2017 
auctions was due to increased volumes of 
capacity traded which increased to £181m 
(£67m in 2016) as pre-emptions were offered 
on freehold tradable syndicates totalling £216m. 
Pre-emptions tend to reduce auction prices 
as the monetary goodwill is diluted by the 
increases capacity. 
Most of the higher priced and higher graded 
syndicates have a history of conservative 
reserving which has boosted Helios’ three 
year account results by an average of 4.8% 
of capacity for the last four closed years, 2012 
to 2015 compared with the Lloyd’s market 
average of 4.0% of capacity. Some syndicates 
also reserve at higher than the actuarial best 
estimate which gives rise to a capital credit 
within the Funds at Lloyd’s requirement 
partially offsetting the auction value.

Summary financial information
The information set out below is a summary of the key items that the Board assesses in estimating the financial position of the Group. 
Given the Board has no active role in the management of the syndicates within the portfolio, the following approach is taken:
(a) It relies on the quarterly syndicate forecasts to assess its share of the underlying profitability of the syndicates within the portfolio.
(b)  It calculates the amounts due to/from the quota share reinsurers in respect of their share of the profits/losses as well as fees and 
commissions due.
(c) An adjustment is made to exclude pre-acquisition profits on companies bought in the year.
(d) Costs relating to stop loss reinsurance and operating costs are deducted.

The Company’s shares are traded on AIM 
of the London Stock Exchange. Whilst the 
Company is not required to report on compliance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the

the importance of the principles of the Code 
and of the Quoted Companies Alliance Code 
which the Board will seek to apply as appropriate 
to the Company given its nature and size.

Board balance, independence 
and review
The Board consists of two Executive Directors 
and four Non-executive Directors. The Board 
concludes that all the Non-executive Directors 
are independent in character and judgement. 
The Board will review on an ongoing basis 
whether there are relationships or circumstances 
which are likely to affect or could affect the 
independence of the Non-executive Directors.
The Board continually considers its own 
performance and effectiveness and that of its 
Committees. Throughout the year the Board 
has continued to review and assess all policies 
and practices to comply wherever possible 
with corporate governance best practice.

with auditors without management present.
The Committee is comprised of independent 
Non-executive Directors only. The major 
tasks undertaken by the Committee include 
monitoring the integrity of the Company’s 
financial reporting, reviewing internal controls 
and risk management systems and oversight 
of the external audit process.
The Committee meets the auditors and 
reviews reports from the auditors relating to 
the accounting and internal control systems. 
It also oversees the relationship with the external 
auditors including reviewing the effectiveness of 
the audit; assessing annually their independence 
and objectivity, taking into account relevant UK 
professional and regulatory requirements; and 
the relationship with the auditors as a whole,

professional guidance. The Committee reviews 
the Company’s compliance with accounting, 
legal and listing requirements.

remuneration duties, the Committee determines 
and agrees the Board policies for pay; 
bonuses; incentives and other rewards; 
employee benefits; and the conditions of 
employment. The Committee’s terms of 
reference try to ensure that members of the

Governance
Directors’ responsibilities statement – Year ended 31 December 2017
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected 
to prepare the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the Financial Statements; and
• prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that the 
Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the Financial Statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. 
The Company is compliant with AIM Rule 26 regarding the Company’s website.

Directors’ report – Year ended 31 December 2017
The Directors present their report and the audited Group and Parent Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
General information
The Company is a public limited company listed on AIM. The Company was incorporated in England and is domiciled in the UK and its 
registered office is 40 Gracechurch Street, London EC3V 0BT. The Company participates in insurance business as an underwriting member 
at Lloyd’s through its subsidiary undertakings. 
Principal activity, review of the business and future developments
The Company’s principal activity is to provide a limited liability investment for its shareholders in the Lloyd’s insurance market.
The Group participates in the Lloyd’s insurance market through its participation in a portfolio of Lloyd’s syndicates.
A more detailed review of the business for the year and outlook for the future is included in the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review 
and the Lloyd’s Advisers’ Report.
Results and dividends
The Group result for the year ended 31 December 2017 is shown in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The Group loss 
for the year after taxation was £694,000 (2016 profit: £713,000).
A dividend of 5.5p per share was paid during calendar year 2017 totalling £803,000 (2016: £525,000).
Charitable and political donations
During the year, the Group made no political or charitable donations.
Directors and their interests
Under the Articles of Association, any Director appointed as a Director by the Board since the Company’s last Annual General Meeting as 
well as one third of the remaining Directors are required to retire from the Board by rotation at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and 
may offer themselves for re-election as Directors. Consequently Edward Fitzalan-Howard, who was appointed as Director on 1 January 2018 
and Jeremy Evans, are therefore retiring by rotation and offering themselves for re-election as Directors of the Company at the 2018 
Annual General Meeting.
Policy and practice on the payment of creditors

• agree the terms of payment at the commencement of business with suppliers;

Disclosure of information to auditors 
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of the Report of the Directors confirm that, so far as they are individually aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware and each Director has taken all steps that they ought to have taken 
as Directors to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
Auditor and the Annual Report
PKF Littlejohn LLP has signified its willingness to continue in office as auditor.
A resolution to reappoint PKF Littlejohn LLP as auditor will be put to the members at the next Annual General Meeting to be convened 
at which the Annual Report will be laid before the members for consideration.

Financial statements
Independent auditor’s report – To the members of Helios Underwriting plc
Opinion 
We have audited the Financial Statements of Helios Underwriting plc (the “Parent Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent Company 
Statements of Financial Position, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Parent 
Company Statements of Cash Flows and notes to the Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union and as regards the Parent Company Financial Statements, as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
In our opinion: 
• the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 
and of the Group’s and Parent Company’s loss for the year then ended; 
• the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the “Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements” section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
Financial Statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Conclusions relating to going concern 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where: 
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the Financial Statements is not appropriate; or 
• the Directors have not disclosed in the Financial Statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the Group’s or the Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of 
at least twelve months from the date when the Financial Statements are authorised for issue. 
Our application of materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on 
the financial statements line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in an aggregate on the 
Financial Statements as a whole, both at the Group level and at the individual Parent Company level. The application of these considerations 
gives rise to the following levels of materiality, the quantum and purpose of which is set out below.
Materiality Measure Materiality
Clearly trivial
threshold Basis for materiality Key considerations and benchmarks
Consolidated 
Financial Statements
£225,000 £11,250 In assessing the materiality, we have assessed 
a number of benchmarks based on the profit 
before tax, gross and net assets. We have 
concluded that a reasonable estimate of 
materiality should be a blended rate heavily 
weighted towards 1% of the Group’ s net assets.
In determining our materiality, for both the 
consolidated and Parent Company Financial 
Statements, we have considered those 
matters which we believe are in the interest 
of the primary users of the Financial Statements. 
We have also taken into account that the 
Parent Company does not trade, and its 
only income is based on its investments 
in subsidiaries.
Parent Company £100,000 £7,500 We have used a similar approach to assess 
the materiality to apply to the Parent Company. 
However, in assessing the net and gross 
assets of the Parent Company, we have 
deducted the Parent Company investments 
in subsidiaries. We have concluded that a 
reasonable estimate of materiality for this 
purpose is again a blended rate heavily 
weighted to 1% of the Parent Company 
net assets after deducting investments 
in subsidiaries.
We have agreed with the Audit Committee that we would not report to them any misstatement below the trivial threshold levels. Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2017 20
Independent auditor’s report continued – To the members of Helios Underwriting plc
Our application of materiality continued
We use a different level of materiality (“performance materiality”) to determine the extent of our testing for the audit of the Financial Statements. 
Performance materiality is set based on the audit materiality as adjusted for the judgements made as to the entity risk and our evaluation of 
the specific risk of each audit area having regards to the internal control environment. In this respect, performance materiality has been set to 
80% of the above materiality levels, to £180,000 for the consolidation level and £80,000 for the Parent Company level.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our audit approach was developed by obtaining an understanding of the Group’s activities, the key subjective judgements used by the 
Directors, the inherent uncertainties and key audit risks in the business environment the Group operates in and the overall control environment 
established by management. Based on this understanding, we assessed those aspects of the Group’s and Parent Company’s transactions, 
year-end balances and disclosures which were most likely to give rise to a material misstatement and were most susceptible to irregularities, 
including fraud or error. Specifically, we identified what we considered to be our key audit matters and planned our audit accordingly.
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
Key audit matter How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter
Preparation of Financial Statements (Group only)
The Group’s primary statements aggregate the results of its trading 
subsidiaries, which mainly consist of corporate members of Lloyd’s 
of London (Lloyd’s). The result of the subsidiaries’ activities is largely 
derived by Returns prepared by Lloyd’s which themselves are based 
on the syndicate audited financial statements. The Group Financial 
Statements aggregate the disclosed analysis from those subsidiaries 
to produce its primary statements and the necessary disclosures.
As Group auditors, we have reviewed the process adopted by 
management in order to collate and aggregate the data produced by 
Lloyd’s and ensured that the data used by management agrees back 
to those Returns. The procedures we have adopted have enabled us 
to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence has been 
obtained to enable us to give the opinion expressed in this report.
Valuation of investments in subsidiaries (Parent Company only)
The Parent Company’s Statement of Financial Position includes 
investments in subsidiaries, which are held at historical cost less 
impairment. Any impairment is primarily based on the fair value of 
Lloyd’s syndicate capacity, which underpins the value at which these 
investments are carried forward, and forms a significant element of the 
Parent Company’ s assets. 
We have reviewed the carrying value of these investments and the 
fair value of the syndicate capacity, as calculated by management, 
against the prices achieved for syndicate capacity at the annual Lloyd’s 
auctions of syndicate capacity. Based on the work performed, we 
consider the assumptions used by management to assess the level 
of impairment against the carried investments as not unreasonable. 
Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, other than the Financial Statements and our Auditor’s Report 
thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements does 
not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the Financial Statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on 
the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard. 
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Financial Statements 
are prepared is consistent with the Financial Statements; and 
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.  Annual report and financial statements 2017 — Helios Underwriting plc 21
Financial statements
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent Company Financial Statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Responsibilities of Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group and Parent 
Company Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditor’s Report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an Auditor’s Report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone, 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Financial statements
Notes to the Financial Statements – Year ended 31 December 2017
1. General information
The Company is a public limited company listed on AIM. The Company was incorporated in England and is domiciled in the UK and its registered 
office is 40 Gracechurch Street, London EC3V 0BT. These Financial Statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred 
to as the “Group”). The Company participates in insurance business as an underwriting member at Lloyd’s through its subsidiary undertakings. 
2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”) 
are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as endorsed by the 
European Union (“EU”), IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. 
No statement of comprehensive income is presented for Helios Underwriting plc, as a Parent Company, as permitted by Section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss.
Use of judgements and estimates 
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions in the process of 
applying the Group’s accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge 
of the amounts, events or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates. Further information is disclosed in Note 3.
The Group participates in insurance business through its Lloyd’s member subsidiaries. Accounting information in respect of syndicate 
participations is provided by the syndicate managing agents and is reported upon by the syndicate auditors.
Going concern
The Group and the Company have net assets at the end of the reporting period of £21,010,000 and £24,609,000 respectively.
The Company’s subsidiaries participate as underwriting members at Lloyd’s on the 2015, 2016 and 2017 years of account, as well as any 
prior run-off years, and they have continued this participation since the year end on the 2018 year of account. This underwriting is supported 
by Funds at Lloyd’s totalling £12,164,000 (2016: £6,006,000), letters of credit provided through the Group’s quota share reinsurance agreements 
totalling £15,683,000 (2016: £13,641,000) and solvency credits issued by Lloyd’s totalling £1,052,000 (2016: £837,000).
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to meet their underwriting and other 
operational obligations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
annual Financial Statements.

Principles of consolidation, business combinations and goodwill
(a) Consolidation and investments in subsidiaries
The Group Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of Helios Underwriting plc, the Parent Company, and its directly and indirectly 
held subsidiaries being Hampden Corporate Member Limited, Nameco (No. 365) Limited, Nameco (No. 605) Limited, Nameco (No. 321) Limited, 
Nameco (No. 917) Limited, Nameco (No. 229) Limited, Nameco (No. 518) Limited, Nameco (No. 804) Limited, Halperin Underwriting Limited, 
Bernul Limited, Dumasco Limited, Nameco (No. 311) Limited, Nameco (No. 402) Limited, Updown Underwriting Limited, Nameco (No. 507) Limited, 
Nameco (No. 76) Limited, Kempton Underwriting Limited, Devon Underwriting Limited, Nameco (No. 346) Limited, Pooks Limited, Charmac 
Underwriting Limited, Nottus (No 51) Limited, Chapman Underwriting Limited, RBC CEES Trustee Limited (newly incorporated, see Notes 14 and 23), 
Helios UTG Partner Limited, Nomina No 035 LLP , Nomina No 342 LLP , Nomina No 380 LLP , Nomina No 372 LLP , Salviscount LLP and 
Inversanda LLP (Notes 4 and 14).
The Financial Statements for all of the above subsidiaries are prepared for the year ended 31 December 2017 under UK GAAP . Consolidation 
adjustments are made to convert the subsidiary Financial Statements prepared under UK GAAP to IFRS so as to align accounting policies 
and treatments.
No income statement is presented for Helios Underwriting plc as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The loss after tax 
for the year of the Parent Company was £4,514,000 (2016: profit £2,539,000).
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying 
a shareholding or partnership participation of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that 
are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that 
control ceases.
Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on intra-group transactions are eliminated. 
In the Parent Company’s Financial Statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost and are reviewed for impairment annually 
or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value to be impaired.
(b) Business combinations and goodwill
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Acquisition costs 
are expensed as incurred.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is capitalised and recorded 
as goodwill. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for impairment 
annually or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired and recognised directly in the consolidated 
income statement. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised 
directly in the consolidated income statement as a bargain purchase.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief 
operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified 
as Nigel Hanbury.
Foreign currency translation
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The Financial Statements are presented in thousands of pounds sterling, 
which is the Group’s functional and presentational currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise indicated.
Foreign currency transactions and non-monetary assets and liabilities, including deferred acquisition costs and unearned premiums, are 
translated into the functional currency using annual average rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transaction as a proxy for the 
transactional rates. The translation difference arising on non-monetary asset items is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Certain supported syndicates have non-sterling functional currencies and any exchange movement that they would have reflected in other 
comprehensive income as a result of this has been included within profit before tax at consolidation level, to be consistent with the Group’s 
policy of using sterling as the functional currency. Annual report and financial statements 2017 — Helios Underwriting plc 31

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Foreign currency translation continued
Monetary items are translated at period-end rates; any exchange differences arising from the change in rates of exchange are recognised 
in the consolidated income statement of the year.
Underwriting
Premiums
Gross premium written comprises the total premiums receivable in respect of business incepted during the year, together with any differences 
between booked premiums for prior years and those previously accrued, and includes estimates of premiums due but not yet receivable or 
notified to the syndicates on which the Group participates, less an allowance for cancellations. All premiums are shown gross of commission 
payable to intermediaries and exclude taxes and duties levied on them.
Unearned premiums
Gross premium written is earned according to the risk profile of the policy. Unearned premiums represent the proportion of gross premium 
written in the year that relates to unexpired terms of policies in force at the end of the reporting period calculated on a time apportionment 
basis having regard, where appropriate, to the incidence of risk. The specific basis adopted by each syndicate is determined by the relevant 
managing agent.
Deferred acquisition costs
Acquisition costs, which represent commission and other related expenses, are deferred over the period in which the related premiums 
are earned.
Reinsurance premiums
Reinsurance premium costs are allocated by the managing agent of each syndicate to reflect the protection arranged in respect of the 
business written and earned.
Reinsurance premium costs in respect of reinsurance purchased directly by the Group are charged or credited based on the annual 
accounting result for each year of account protected by the reinsurance.
Claims incurred and reinsurers’ share
Claims incurred comprise claims and settlement expenses (both internal and external) occurring in the year and changes in the provisions 
for outstanding claims, including provisions for claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) and settlement expenses, together with any other 
adjustments to claims from previous years. Where applicable, deductions are made for salvage and other recoveries.
The provision for claims outstanding comprises amounts set aside for claims notified and IBNR. The amount included in respect of IBNR is 
based on statistical techniques of estimation applied by each syndicate’s in-house reserving team and reviewed, in certain cases, by external 
consulting actuaries. These techniques generally involve projecting from past experience the development of claims over time to form a view of 
the likely ultimate claims to be experienced for more recent underwriting, having regard to variations in the business accepted and the underlying 
terms and conditions. The provision for claims also includes amounts in respect of internal and external claims’ handling costs. For the most 
recent years, where a high degree of volatility arises from projections, estimates may be based in part on output from the rating and other 
models of the business accepted, and assessments of underwriting conditions.
The reinsurers’ share of provisions for claims is based on calculated amounts of outstanding claims and projections for IBNR, net of estimated 
irrecoverable amounts, having regard to each syndicate’s reinsurance programme in place for the class of business, the claims experience for 
the year and the current security rating of the reinsurance companies involved. Each syndicate uses a number of statistical techniques to assist 
in making these estimates.
Accordingly, the two most critical assumptions made by each syndicate’s managing agent as regards claims provisions are that the past is 
a reasonable predictor of the likely level of claims development and that the rating and other models used, including pricing models for recent 
business, are reasonable indicators of the likely level of ultimate claims to be incurred.
The level of uncertainty with regard to the estimations within these provisions generally decreases with time since the underlying contracts 
were exposed to new risks. In addition, the nature of short-tail risks, such as property where claims are typically notified and settled within 
a short period of time, will normally have less uncertainty after a few years than long-tail risks, such as some liability business where it may be 
several years before claims are fully advised and settled. In addition to these factors if there are disputes regarding coverage under policies 
or changes in the relevant law regarding a claim this may increase the uncertainty in the estimation of the outcomes.
The assessment of these provisions is usually the most subjective aspect of an insurer’s accounts and may result in greater uncertainty within 
an insurer’s accounts than within those of many other businesses. The provisions for gross claims and related reinsurance recoveries have been 
assessed on the basis of the information currently available to the directors of each syndicate’s managing agent. However, ultimate liability will 
vary as a result of subsequent information and events and this may result in significant adjustments to the amounts provided. Adjustments to the 
amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the Financial Statements for the period in which the adjustments are made. 
The provisions are not discounted for the investment earnings that may be expected to arise in the future on the funds retained to meet the 
future liabilities. The methods used, and the estimates made, are reviewed regularly.
Quota share reinsurance
Under the Group’s quota share reinsurance agreements, 70% of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 underwriting year of insurance exposure is ceded 
to the reinsurers. Amounts payable to the reinsurers are included within “reinsurance premium ceded” in the consolidated income statement 
of the year and amounts receivable from the reinsurers are included within “reinsurers share of gross claims paid” in the consolidated income 
statement of the year.  Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2017 32

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Underwriting continued
Unexpired risks provision
Provision for unexpired risks is made where the costs of outstanding claims, related expenses and deferred acquisition costs are expected to 
exceed the unearned premium provision carried forward at the end of the reporting period. The provision for unexpired risks is calculated separately 
by reference to classes of business that are managed together, after taking into account relevant investment return. The provision is made on 
a syndicate-by-syndicate basis by the relevant managing agent.
Closed years of account
At the end of the third year, the underwriting account is normally closed by reinsurance into the following year of account. The amount of the 
reinsurance to close premium payable is determined by the managing agent, generally by estimating the cost of claims notified but not settled 
at 31 December, together with the estimated cost of claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) at that date and an estimate of future claims 
handling costs. Any subsequent variation in the ultimate liabilities of the closed year of account is borne by the underwriting year into which 
it is reinsured.
The payment of a reinsurance to close premium does not eliminate the liability of the closed year for outstanding claims. If the reinsuring 
syndicate were unable to meet any obligations, and the other elements of Lloyd’s chain of security were to fail, then the closed underwriting 
account would have to settle any outstanding claims.
The Directors consider that the likelihood of such a failure of the reinsurance to close is extremely remote and consequently the reinsurance 
to close has been deemed to settle the liabilities outstanding at the closure of an underwriting account. The Group will include its share of the 
reinsurance to close premiums payable as technical provisions at the end of the current period and no further provision is made for any potential 
variation in the ultimate liability of that year of account.
Run-off years of account
Where an underwriting year of account is not closed at the end of the third year (a “run-off” year of account) a provision is made for the 
estimated cost of all known and unknown outstanding liabilities of that year. The provision is determined initially by the managing agent on 
a similar basis to the reinsurance to close. However, any subsequent variation in the ultimate liabilities for that year remains with the corporate 
member participating therein. As a result, any run-off year will continue to report movements in its results after the third year until such time 
as it secures a reinsurance to close.
Net operating expenses (including acquisition costs)
Net operating expenses include acquisition costs, profit and loss on exchange and other amounts incurred by the syndicates on which 
the Group participates.
Acquisition costs, comprising commission and other costs related to the acquisition of new insurance contracts, are deferred to the extent 
that they are attributable to premiums unearned at the end of the reporting period.
Investment income
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable are accrued to the end of the period.
Dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in the income statement when the Group’s right to 
receive payments is established.
Syndicate investments and cash are held on a pooled basis, the return from which is allocated by the relevant managing agent to years 
of account proportionate to the funds contributed by the year of account.
Other operating expenses
All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Intangible assets: syndicate capacity
Syndicate capacity is an intangible asset which represents costs incurred in the Corporation of Lloyd’s auctions in order to acquire rights to 
participate on syndicates’ years of account.
At the individual subsidiary company level, the syndicate capacity is stated at cost, less any provision for impairment at initial recognition, and 
amortised on a straight line basis over the useful economic life, which is estimated to be five years (up to 2014: estimated to be seven years). 
No amortisation is charged until the following year when underwriting commences in respect of the purchased syndicate participation.
At the consolidation level, the Group’s accounting policy for the year 2014 was consistent with the accounting policy of the subsidiaries as 
described above. As of 1 January 2015, the Group changed its accounting policy for accounting for the intangible asset, syndicate capacity, 
as set out below:
The syndicate capacity represents the cost of purchasing the Group’s participation in the combined syndicates. The capacity is capitalised at 
cost in the statement of financial position. It has an indefinite useful life and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment. It is annually tested 
for impairment for each syndicate by reference to the weighted average value at Lloyd’s auctions and expected future profit streams to be earned 
by those syndicates in which the Group participates and provision is made for any impairment in the consolidated income statement.
Financial assets
(a) Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, and loans and receivables. The classification 
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition. The Group does not make use of the held-to-maturity and available-for-sale classifications. Annual report and financial statements 2017 — Helios Underwriting plc 33
Financial statements
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Financial assets continued
(a) Classification continued
(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
All financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are categorised as designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition 
because they are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the Company’s documented investment 
strategy. Information about these financial assets is provided internally on a fair value basis to the Group’s key management. 
The Group’s investment strategy is to invest and evaluate their performance with reference to their fair values. Assets in this category are 
classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months; otherwise, they are classified as non-current.
(ii) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are classified as current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting period. The latter ones are classified 
as non-current assets.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “other receivables, including insurance and reinsurance receivables” and “cash and cash equivalents”.
The Parent Company’s loans and receivables comprise “other receivables” and “cash and cash equivalents”.
(b) Recognition, derecognition and measurement 
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, being the date on which the Group commits to the 
purchase or sale of the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the financial assets has expired 
or are transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all its risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs incurred expensed in the 
income statement.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost less any 
impairment losses.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss which are traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the 
end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, 
industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regular occurring market transactions on an arm’s 
length basis. The quoted market price used for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss held by the Group is the current bid price.
The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation 
techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on 
entity-specific estimates.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are presented in 
the income statement within “net investment income”.
The fair values of short-term deposits are assumed to approximate to their book values. The fair values of the Group’s debt securities have 
been based on quoted market prices for these instruments. 
(c) Impairment 
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets 
is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of 
impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”) and that loss event (or events) 
has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. 
Asset carried at amortised cost
For loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value 
of the estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that has not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective 
interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. If a loan has a variable 
interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. As a 
practical expedient, the Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value using an observable market price.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment 
loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits at bank.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of 
the borrowings, using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all 
of the facility will be drawn down. To the extent that there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, 
the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services, and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2017 34
Notes to the Financial Statements continued – Year ended 31 December 2017
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Borrowings continued
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
after the end of the reporting period.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”)
On 14 December 2017, the Company issued and allotted 500,000 new ordinary shares of £0.10 each (“ordinary shares”). The new ordinary 
shares have been issued at a subscription price of 133.5p per ordinary share, being the closing price of an ordinary share on 13 December 2017, 
pursuant to The Helios Underwriting plc Employees’ Joint Share Ownership Plan (the “Plan”).
The new ordinary shares have been issued into the respective joint beneficial ownership of (i) each of the participating Executive Directors 
as shown in Note 23 and (ii) the Trustee of RBC CEES Trustee Limited (“The Trust”) upon and are subject to the terms of joint ownership 
agreements (“JOAs”) respectively entered into between the Director, the Company and the Trustee. The nominal value of the new ordinary 
shares has been paid by the Trust out of funds advanced to it by the Company with the additional consideration of 123.5p left outstanding 
until such time as new ordinary shares are sold. The Company has waived its lien on the shares such that there are no restrictions on 
their transfer.
The terms of the JOAs provide, inter alia, that if jointly owned shares become vested and are sold, the proceeds of sale will be divided 
between the joint owners so that the participating Director receives an amount equal to any growth in the market value of the jointly owned 
ordinary shares above the greater of either:
(a)  the initial market value (133.5p per share), less a “carrying cost” (equivalent to simple interest at 4.5% per annum on the initial market value 
accruing over the three years from the date of award) and the Trust receives the initial market value of the jointly owned shares plus the 
carrying cost; or
(b)  if higher, 150p (so that the participating Director will only ever receive value if the share sale price exceeds this).
The vesting of the award will be subject to performance conditions measured over the three calendar years from the award date.
A proportion of the Jointly Owned Shares shall vest pro rata to the percentage by which the average return on capacity of the last three 
closed underwriting years of account of the Helios Capacity Portfolio outperforms on average the return on capacity of the Lloyd’s market 
(“the Performance Percentage”) over the Performance Period such that:
(i) if the Performance Percentage is 4% or greater, all of the Jointly Owned Shares shall vest; and 
(ii)  if the Helios Capacity Portfolio fails to outperform the return on capacity of the Lloyd’s Market, none of the Jointly Owned Shares shall 
vest; but
(iii) if the performance Percentage is between 0% and 4%, a proportion of the Jointly Owned Shares shall vest pro rata on a straight line basis.
The Plan was established and approved by resolution of the Remuneration Committee of the Company on 13 December 2017 and provides 
for the acquisition by employees, including Executive Directors, of beneficial interests as joint owners (with the Trust) of ordinary shares in the 
Company upon the terms of a JOA. The terms of the JOA provide that if the jointly owned shares become vested and are sold, the proceeds 
of sale will be divided between the joint owners on the terms set out above.
Current and deferred tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current tax
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the 
Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management establishes provisions when appropriate, on the basis 
of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Financial Statements. 
However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at 
the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period 
and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Other payables
These present liabilities for services provided to the Group prior to end of the financial year which are unpaid. These are classified as current 
liabilities, unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting date. They are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  Annual report and financial statements 2017 — Helios Underwriting plc 35

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Share capital and share premium
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
The difference between the fair value of the consideration received and the nominal value of the share capital issued is taken to the share 
premium account. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, 
from proceeds.
Dividend distribution policy
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised in the Group’s and the Parent Company’s Financial Statements in the period 
in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
3. Key accounting judgements and estimation uncertainties
In applying the Company’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in determining 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. These judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on the best and most reliable evidence 
available at the time when the decisions are made, and are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be applicable. 
Due to the inherent subjectivity involved in making such judgements, estimates and assumptions, the actual results and outcomes may differ. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects 
both current and future periods. 
The measurement of the provision for claims outstanding is the most significant judgement involving estimation uncertainty regarding amounts 
recognised in these Financial Statements in relation to underwriting by the syndicates and this is disclosed further in Notes 4 and 7.
The management and control of each syndicate is carried out by the managing agent of that syndicate, and the Company looks to the managing 
agent to implement appropriate policies, procedures and internal controls to manage each syndicate. 
The key accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty set out below therefore relate to those made in respect of the Company 
only, and do not include estimates and judgements made in respect of the syndicates.
Purchased syndicate capacity
Estimating value in use
Where an indication of impairment of capacity values exists, the Directors will carry out an impairment review to determine the recoverable 
amount, which is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash 
flows expected to arise from the capacity and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. 
Assessing indicators of impairment
In assessing whether there have been any indicators of impairment of assets, the Directors consider both external and internal sources 
of information such as market conditions, counterparty credit ratings and experience of recoverability. 
Recoverability of receivables
The Company establishes a provision for receivables that are estimated not to be recoverable. When assessing recoverability, factors such 
as the ageing of the receivables, past experience of recoverability and the credit profile of individual or groups of customers are all considered. 
4. Risk management
The majority of the risks to the Group’s future cash flows arise from each subsidiary’s participation in the results of Lloyd’s syndicates. As detailed 
below, these risks are mostly managed by the managing agents of the syndicates. The Group’s role in managing these risks, in conjunction with its 
subsidiaries and members’ agent, is limited to selection of syndicate participations, monitoring the performance of the syndicates and the 
purchase of appropriate member level reinsurance.
Risk background
The syndicates’ activities expose them to a variety of financial and non-financial risks. The managing agent is responsible for managing the 
syndicate’s exposure to these risks and, where possible, introducing controls and procedures that mitigate the effects of the exposure to risk. 
For the purposes of setting capital requirements for the 2017 and subsequent years of account, each managing agent will have prepared a 
Lloyd’s Capital Return (“LCR”) for the syndicate to agree capital requirements with Lloyd’s based on an agreed assessment of the risks impacting 
the syndicate’s business and the measures in place to manage and mitigate those risks from a quantitative and qualitative perspective. The 
risks described below are typically reflected in the LCR and typically the majority of the total assessed value of the risks concerned is 
attributable to insurance risk.
The insurance risks faced by a syndicate include the occurrence of catastrophic events, downward pressure on pricing of risks, reductions 
in business volumes and the risk of inadequate reserving. Reinsurance risk arises from the risk that a reinsurer fails to meet its share of a claim. 
The management of the syndicate’s funds is exposed to investment risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, currency risk and interest rate risk (as detailed 
below), leading to financial loss. The syndicate is also exposed to regulatory and operational risks including its ability to continue to trade. However, 
supervision by Lloyd’s and the Prudential Regulation Authority provides additional controls over the syndicate’s management of risks.
The Group manages the risks faced by the syndicates on which its subsidiaries participate by monitoring the performance of the syndicates it 
supports. This commences in advance of committing to support a syndicate for the following year, with a review of the business plan prepared 
for each syndicate by its managing agent. In addition, quarterly reports and annual accounts, together with any other information made available 
by the managing agent, are monitored and if necessary enquired into. If the Group considers that the risks being run by the syndicate are excessive, 
it will seek confirmation from the managing agent that adequate management of the risk is in place and, if considered appropriate, will withdraw 
support from the next year of account. The Group also manages its exposure to insurance risk by purchasing appropriate member level reinsurance. Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2017 36

4. Risk management continued
Impact of Brexit vote
The Brexit vote will have an impact on various risk factors, including currency risks. The Lloyd’s market is in the process of developing 
a strategy for dealing with Brexit and the Company will monitor these developments and identify whether it needs to modify its participation 
in the Lloyd’s market.
(a) Syndicate risks
(i) Liquidity risk
The syndicates are exposed to daily calls on their available cash resources, principally from claims arising from its insurance business. Liquidity 
risk arises where cash may not be available to pay obligation when due, or to ensure compliance with the syndicate’s obligations under the various 
trust deeds to which it is party.
The syndicates aim to manage their liquidity position so that they can fund claims arising from significant catastrophic events, as modelled 
in their Lloyd’s realistic disaster scenarios (“RDS”).

(iii) Interest rate equity price risk
Interest rate risk and equity price risk are the risks that the fair value of future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because 
of changes in market interest rates and market prices, respectively. 
(iv) Currency risk
The syndicates’ main exposure to foreign currency risk arises from insurance business originating overseas, primarily denominated in US dollars. 
Transactions denominated in US dollars form a significant part of the syndicates’ operations. This risk is, in part, mitigated by the syndicates 
maintaining financial assets denominated in US dollars against its major exposures in that currency.

Reinsurance risk to the Group arises where reinsurance contracts put in place to reduce gross insurance risk do not perform as anticipated, 
result in coverage disputes or prove inadequate in terms of the vertical or horizontal limits purchased. Failure of a reinsurer to pay a valid claim 
is considered a credit risk, which is detailed separately below.
(b) Group risks – corporate level
(i) Investment, credit, liquidity and currency risks
The other significant risks faced by the Group are with regard to the investment of funds within its own custody. The elements of these risks 
are investment risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and currency risk. To mitigate this, the surplus Group funds are deposited with 
highly rated banks and fund managers. The main liquidity risk would arise if a syndicate had inadequate liquid resources for a large claim and 
sought funds from the Group to meet the claim. In order to minimise investment risk, credit risk and liquidity risk, the Group’s funds are invested 
in readily realisable short-term deposits. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2017 is £18.2m (2016: £14.8m), being 
the aggregate of the Group’ s insurance receivables, prepayments and accrued income, financial assets at fair value, and cash and cash equivalents, 
excluding any amounts held in the syndicates. The syndicates can distribute their results in sterling, US dollars or a combination of the two. 
The Group is exposed to movements in the US dollar between the balance sheet date and the distribution of the underwriting profits and 
losses, which is usually in the May following the closure of a year of account. The Group does not use derivative instruments to manage risk 
and, as such, no hedge accounting is applied.
As a result of the specific nature and structure of the Group’s collateralised quota share reinsurance arrangements through Cell 6, the Group’s 
Funds at Lloyd’s calculation benefits from an aggregate £15.7m (2016: £13.6m) letter of credit (“LOC”) acceptable to Lloyd’s, on behalf of 
XL Re Limited, Everest Reinsurance Bermuda Limited, Polygon Insurance Co Limited (the reinsurers). The LOC is pledged in aggregate to 
the relevant syndicates through Lloyd’s and thus Helios Underwriting plc is not specifically exposed to counterparty credit risk in this matter. 
Should the bank’s LOC become unacceptable to Lloyd’s for any reason, the reinsurer is responsible under the terms of the contract for making 
alternative arrangements. The contract is annually renewable and the Group has a contingency plan in place in the event of non-renewal 
under both normal and adverse market conditions.
(ii) Market risk
The Group is exposed to market and liquidity risk in respect of its holdings of syndicate participations. Lloyd’s syndicate participations are 
traded in the Lloyd’s auctions held in September and October each year. The Group is exposed to changes in market prices and a lack of 
liquidity in the trading of a particular syndicate’s capacity could result in the Group making a loss compared to the carrying value when the 
Group disposes of particular syndicate participations.
(iii) Regulatory risks 
The Company’s subsidiaries are subject to continuing approval by Lloyd’s to be a member of a Lloyd’s syndicate. The risk of this approval 
being removed is mitigated by monitoring and fully complying with all requirements in relation to membership of Lloyd’s. The capital requirements 
to support the proposed amount of syndicate capacity for future years are subject to the requirements of Lloyd’s. A variety of factors are taken 
into account by Lloyd’s in setting these requirements including market conditions and syndicate performance and, although the process is 
intended to be fair and reasonable, the requirements can fluctuate from one year to the next, which may constrain the volume of underwriting 
a subsidiary of the Company is able to support. 
The Company is subject to the AIM Rules. Compliance with the AIM Rules is monitored by the Board.
Operational risks
As there are relatively few transactions actually undertaken by the Group, there are only limited systems and operational requirements of the 
Group and therefore operational risks are not considered to be significant. Close involvement of all Directors in the Group’s key decision making 
and the fact that the majority of the Group’s operations are conducted by syndicates provide control over any remaining operational risks.
Capital management objectives, policies and approach
The Group has established the following capital management objectives, policies and approach to managing the risks that affect its capital position:
• to maintain the required level of stability of the Group, thereby providing a degree of security to shareholders;
• to allocate capital efficiently and support the development of the business by ensuring that returns on capital employed meet the 
requirements of the shareholders; and
• to maintain the financial strength to support increases in the Group’s underwriting through acquisition of capacity in the Lloyd’s auctions 
or through the acquisition of new subsidiaries.
The Group’s capital management policy is to hold a sufficient level of capital to allow the Group to take advantage of market conditions, 
particularly when insurance rates are improving, and to meet the Funds at Lloyd’s (“FAL”) requirements that support the corporate member 
subsidiaries’ current and future levels of underwriting.
Approach to capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists entirely of equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising issued share capital, 
share premium and retained earnings as disclosed in the Statements of Changes in Equity on pages 25 and 26.
At 31 December 2017 the corporate member subsidiaries had an agreed FAL requirement of £28,699,000 (2016: £19,632,000) to support 
their underwriting on the 2018 year of account (2017 year of account). The funds to support this requirement are held in short-term investment 
funds and deposits or provided by the quota share reinsurance capital providers by way of a LOC. The FAL requirements are formally assessed 
and funded twice yearly and must be met by the corporate member subsidiaries to continue underwriting. At 31 December 2017 the agreed 
FAL requirements for the Group were 70% (2016: 60%) of the capacity for the following year of account. Annual report and financial statements 2017 — Helios Underwriting plc 39

Assumptions, changes in assumptions and sensitivity
As described in Note 4, the majority of the risks to the Group’s future cash flows arise from its subsidiaries’ participation in the results of 
Lloyd’s syndicates and are mostly managed by the managing agents of the syndicates. The Group’s role in managing these risks, in conjunction 
with the Group’s members’ agent, is limited to a selection of syndicate participations and monitoring the performance of the syndicates and 
their managing agents.
The amounts carried by the Group arising from insurance contracts are calculated by the managing agents of the syndicates, derived from 
accounting information provided by the managing agents and reported upon by the syndicate auditors. 
The key assumptions underlying the amounts carried by the Group arising from insurance contracts are:
• the claims reserves calculated by the managing agents are accurate; and
• the potential deterioration of run-off year results has been fully provided for by the managing agents.
There have been no changes in assumptions in 2017.
The amounts carried by the Group arising from insurance contracts are sensitive to various factors as follows:
• a 10% increase/decrease in the managing agents’ calculation of gross claims reserves will decrease/increase the Group’s pre-tax profits 
by £5,983,000 (2016: £5,009,000);
• a 10% increase/decrease in the managing agents’ calculation of net claims reserves will decrease/increase the Group’s pre-tax profits by 
£4,500,000 (2016: £4,041,000); and 
• a 10% increase/decrease in the run-off year net claims reserves will decrease/increase the Group’s pre-tax profits by £9,000 (2016: £12,000).
The 10% movement has been selected to give an indication of the possible variations in the assumptions used. Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2017 42

The results of the Group’s participation on the 2015, 2016 and 2017 years of account and the calendar year movement on 2014 and prior 
run-offs will not be assessed for tax until the years ended 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively, being the year after the calendar year result 
of each run-off year or the normal date of closure of each year of account. Full provision is made as part of the deferred tax provisions for 
underwriting profits/(losses) not yet subject to corporation tax.
New legislation was passed on 18 November 2015 to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020. 
The government further announced on 16 March 2016 as part of its Budget that a rate of 17% will apply from 1 April 2020 instead of 18%. 
This is not expected to have a material impact on the closing deferred tax liability.
The Group has £1,205,000 (2016: £1,069,000) taxable losses carried forward, to which £336,000 (2016: £134,000) has been recognised as 
a deferred tax asset and has been offset against deferred tax liabilities of the same nature as disclosed in Note 18.
The Company has £869,000 (2016: £935,000) of tax losses to carry forward to which no deferred tax asset has been recognised due to the 
uncertainty of the future taxable profits, as disclosed in Note 18.
11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company after tax by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the 
conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. 
Earnings per share has been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 “Earnings per Share”. Annual report and financial statements 2017 — Helios Underwriting plc 45

to an anti-dilutive element.
12. Dividends paid or proposed
A dividend of 5.5p per share was paid during the year totalling £803,000 (2016: £525,000). The dividend was settled in cash (2016: partly in

15. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded securities) is based on quoted market prices 
(unadjusted) at the end of the reporting period. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. 
These instruments are included in Level 1.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise 
the use of observable market data inputs, either directly or indirectly, (other than quoted prices included within Level 1) and rely as little as possible 
on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. Annual report and financial statements 2017 — Helios Underwriting plc 47

15. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss continued
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. This is the case 
for unlisted equity securities.
The Group held the following financial assets carried at fair value on the statement of financial position:

23. Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”)
No shares have been vested as at 31 December 2017.
Effect of the transactions
The beneficial interests of the Executives following the transaction will be as follows:
Director
Interests in jointly 
owned ordinary 
shares issued 
under JSOP
Other 
interests in 
ordinary shares
Total 
shareholding
Arthur Manners 200,000 133,334 333,334
Nigel Hanbury 300,000 2,436,871 2,736,871
The new ordinary shares will rank pari passu with the Company’s existing issued ordinary shares. The Company’s issued share capital following 
Admission will comprise 15,104,240 ordinary shares with voting rights and no restrictions on transfer and this figure may be used by shareholders 
as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest 
in, the Company under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.
The JSOP is to be accounted for as if it were a premium priced option, and therefore Black Scholes mathematics have been applied to determine 
the fair value. As the performance condition will eventually be trued up, a calculation of the fair value based on an algebraic Black Scholes calculation 
of the value of the “as if” option discounted for the risk of forfeiture or non-vesting is reasonable. The discount factors are for the risk that an 
employee leaves and forfeits the award or the failure to meet the performance condition with the result the JSOP awards do not vest in full 
or at all. 
The basic Black Scholes calculation is based on the following six basic assumptions:
(a) market value of a share at the date of grant (133.5p);
(b) expected premium or threshold price of a share (141.4p);
(c) expected life of the JSOP award;
(d) risk-free rate of capital;
(e) expected dividend yield; and 
(f) expected future volatility of a Helios share.
Date of grant 13.12.17
(a) Share price 133.5p
(b) Exercise price 141.4p
(c) Expected life (years) 3
(d) Risk-free rate 1.00%
(e) Expected dividend yield (continuous payout) 4.20%
(f) Volatility 20.00%
Exponential constant 2.72
Black Scholes option value 9.3
The fair value has been discounted by 50% for the risk that some of the awards will be forfeited and not vest, giving a fair value of 4.6p per 
share. The total fair value per share 4.6p times the number of JSOP awards (500,000 being ordinary shares, Note 21) which gives a total fair 
value of £23,150. The amount is to be charged as an expense and spread over three years. Annual report and financial statements 2017 — Helios Underwriting plc 61

28. Effects of a reclassification as at 1 January 2016 
The equity position as at 1 January 2016, as shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity in these Financial Statements, has 
been restated to include the effects of the reclassification of the foreign exchange differences, for the year 2015, originally included in the other 
comprehensive income, net of tax, amounting to £121,000, and for the 2015 comparatives presentation within the consolidated Financial Statements 
for 2016, were reclassified into the consolidated income statement, within the other consolidated income line.
These foreign exchange differences arose as a result of the retranslation of the syndicates’ results whose functional currency is not the pound 
sterling into the pound sterling as the reporting currency to Lloyd’s. Hence, such foreign exchange differences were accounted for as other 
comprehensive income within the syndicates’ reported results.
As the functional and presentation currency of the Helios Group is the pound sterling, such foreign exchange differences were accounted 
for as other income in the income statement in the consolidated Financial Statements of the year ended 31 December 2016.
As a result, to aid consistency in presentation, the comparative amount for the year ended 31 December 2015 of £121,000 has been reclassified 
within the consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016. The effects of the reclassification within the consolidated 
Financial Statements of the year ended 31 December 2017 resulted in the restatements of the equity position as at 1 January 2016, within the 
statement of changes in equity as set out below:
