Equity raise and acquisitions
In June 2016 the Company completed a private placing 
raising €30.0 million of new equity capital. In March 2017 
a second private placing raised €15.0 million of new 
equity capital. A total of €80.4 million of acquisitions 
were acquired including the Frankfurt asset which 
completed shortly after year end. These assets were 
purchased at a blended EPRA net yield of 8.1% whilst 
providing value-add opportunity in the future.

The original capex programme commenced just over 
three years ago and is focused on transforming over 
200,000sqm of sub-optimal space. As at 31 March 2017 
approximately 159,000sqm of this space had been 
completely refurbished and was either let or being 
marketed for let. A total of €15.0 million has been 
invested into this space and, at 78% occupancy, is 
generating €8.7 million of annualised rental income 
representing an income return on investment of 58%. 
Recycling of mature and non-core assets
During the year and after the period end, the sale 
of a total of €110.4 million of assets was completed 
or notarised. This included three core mature assets, 
one non-core asset and a land parcel at CöllnParc. 
In order to recycle this equity, further acquisitions 
totalling €72.8 million were either completed or 
notarised after the year end.
Main market move
In March 2017 the Company completed the successful 
move of its shares from AIM to being admitted for 
trading on the main markets of both the London 
and Johannesburg stock exchanges.

Flexible workspace
As at 31 March 2017 the Group owned or managed a 
portfolio of 44 business parks in Germany containing 
more than 1.4 million sqm of lettable space. 
The majority of the Group’s business parks are a mixture 
of office, storage and production space. Whilst retaining 
the major core anchor industrial tenants, many of the 
business parks are restructured to enhance the working 
environment of the tenants.
We are an owner and operator of branded business parks 
providing conventional space and flexible workspace in Germany.

A well-balanced portfolio
What we offer
The Group derives a large part of its rental income from conventional industrial tenants, which include international 
blue-chip corporations, but the majority of clients are German small to medium-sized enterprises (“SME”) companies.
The stable long-term income from anchor tenants underpins the ability to generate higher revenues from the more flexible 
leasing options.
We have created a range of innovative and flexible products by investing into sub-optimal space. This attracts a large number 
of tenants to our sites whilst generating higher income and asset value growth from space that would often be left vacant or 
rented at low prices.

Disposals
Acquisitions
The year under review has proven to be another busy year for investment activity with a 
total of eight sites either acquired or notarised for completion in the period together with 
the disposal of some non-income producing land, one non-core site and the notarisation 
for sale of two mature sites, both of which completed shortly after the period end. 
The eight acquisitions completed or notarised in the period had total acquisition costs of €103.3 million 
and provide an attractive balance of stable income and value-add opportunity. All acquisitions are 
located in areas in which the Group has a deep market understanding and can be quickly incorporated 
into the Group’s operating platform. 
The disposal activity was very pleasing in that it provides evidence of our strategy to be able to recycle 
capital from non-core and mature sites into assets with higher value-add potential. Additionally to 
be able to do this at significantly higher than book value on two mature sites also proves that the 
value-add model that Sirius has created works well.
Following the period end, another mature site located in Kiel was notarised for sale bringing 
the total disposal proceeds for assets sold or notarised for sale in the financial year and after to 
€108.9 million. In addition €1.5 million was received in relation to the sale of a land parcel in 
CöllnParc. The plan is now to reinvest these proceeds and accordingly a further four assets were 
notarised for purchase with total acquisition costs expected to be €49.9 million following the period 
end. These acquisitions have a higher concentration of office space as well as higher vacancy which 
provides the Company with much greater opportunity to enhance income and values going forward 
than would have been achievable on the mature and non-core assets that these are replacing. 7

The sale of the Munich 
Rupert Mayer Strasse asset 
for €85.0 million was notarised 
in January and completed in 
May 2017. Over the eight years 
since the site was acquired the 
Company successfully repositioned 
the asset by replacing a single 
tenant with multiple tenants on 
higher rents, investing in the 
transformation of sub-optimal 
space and significantly increasing 
net operating income. The sale 
at €85.0 million represents a 48% 
increase on original purchase price 
and 9% premium to last reported 
book value at 30 September 2016.
Completed the sale of the 
non-core Merseburg retail park 
asset for €5.9 million. The sale 
of this legacy asset is part of the 
Company’s strategy to dispose 
of non-core assets and recycle 
equity into greater value-add 
opportunities in order to increase 
total returns from the portfolio. 
A loss of €572,000 was recognised 
in the year to 31 March 2017.
The sale of the Düsseldorf 
Wiesenstrasse business park 
for €11.0 million was notarised 
in March and completed in 
May 2017. The asset was fully 
developed under the Sirius brand 
name and, with occupancy in 
excess of 96%, was considered 
a mature asset within the 
Company’s portfolio. The sale at 
€11.0 million represents a 25% 
premium to last reported book 
value at 30 September 2016.
* Completed post period end.
 
KIEL
April 2017
Notarised the sale of a

for €7.0 million. The sale is at 
an EPRA net operating yield 
of 7.4%. The asset is a multi-let 
mixed-use business park 
generating €0.56 million 
of net operating income with 
occupancy of 92% over a net 
lettable area of around 10,000sqm. 8

Chairman’s statement
Building momentum
In summary:
 » Sirius has continued to grow organically through its capex 
investment programme and its asset management techniques as 
well as acquisitively using the proceeds of two successful capital 
raisings in the period.
 » We have agreed the sale of two major core assets at above 
book valuation and completed the disposal of a non-core 
asset in the period.
 » The ability to invest and create income and value from the more 
difficult areas of our industrial and office portfolio has, in particular, 
been a significant contributor to the valuation and profit increases 
in the period.
I am pleased to report another strong year of trading 
for Sirius in what is my first Annual Report as Chairman 
of the Company. Sirius has continued to grow organically 
through its capex investment programme and its asset 
management techniques as well as acquisitively using 
the proceeds of two successful capital raisings in the 
period. This has significantly increased the profitability 
and value of the Company and culminated with the move 
of its shares to the main markets of both the London 
and Johannesburg stock exchanges on 6 March 2017. 
We indicated last year that asset recycling was going 
to be a major element of our continued growth going 
forward and I am pleased to say that we successfully 
agreed the sale of two major core assets at well above 
book value and completed the disposal of a non-core 
asset in the period. An additional mature asset, 
located in Kiel, was notarised for sale at €7.0 million 
after the period end. This, along with the proceeds 
of a €15.0 million private placing which completed at 
the end of the period, will provide the Company with 
substantial capital to reinvest into new assets in the 
next financial year.
This continued growth is reflected in all of the 
key metrics upon which the Company is measured. 
Adjusted profit before tax* was up by 54% to 
€35.3 million (2016: €22.9 million), basic European 
Public Real Estate Association (“EPRA”) EPS increased 
by 69.1% to 3.18c (2016: 1.88c). This has fed through 
to the Group’s valuations, which saw a like-for-like 
increase of 8.5% in the year contributing to an 
increase in EPRA NAV per share of 9.7% to 57.84c 
(2016: 52.72c), whilst adjusted NAV per share** 
increased by 10.3% to 58.82c (2016: 53.35c). 
The disciplined manner in which the Company has 
executed its strategy of providing conventional and 
flexible workspace whilst developing its sub-optimal 
vacant space into both conventional space and the 
Group’s range of flexible Smartspace products has 
also increased the quality of its portfolio and the 
sustainability of this increased income.
While this has been a good year for the business, 
momentum has been building for some years now as 
shown by the growth in the property portfolio which 
at the time of internalisation of the asset management 
platform in March 2012 stood at €486.1 million 
compared to the €823.3 million of property that 
is now held by the Company on its balance sheet. 
This substantial growth was one of the main driving 
forces behind the move up to the Main Market of the 
London Stock Exchange and to the Main Board of the 
Johannesburg Stock Exchange and is indicative of just 
how far the Company has progressed over recent years. 
The move does also reflect an ambition to continue on 
the same upward trajectory and the Sirius Board believes 
that the benefits that will come from the step up will 
help in achieving this ambition.
A key differentiator for Sirius and the most 
important contributor to its success is the capability 
and effectiveness of its operating platform. The 
230-strong in-house team has continued to drive the 
key initiatives of the business such as the acquisitions 
and recycling programme, the major capex investment 
programme which transforms vacant and sub-optimal 
space, the lettings programme, as well as cost 
recovery initiatives. These initiatives are discussed in 
more detail in the asset management and financial 
review sections of this report but progress on all fronts 
has been encouraging. All of this activity has had a 
favourable impact on the value of the Group’ s properties. 
The ability to invest and create income and value from 
the more difficult areas of our industrial and office 
portfolio has, in particular, been a significant contributor 
to the value increases in the period. The Company’s 
like-for-like rent roll*** has again increased materially 
by 5.1% to €65.6 million (2016: €62.4 million) and 
this has been the main driver of the valuation increases 
mentioned above as we have only seen 32bps of yield 
compression on the core portfolio in the period.
As at 31 March 2017, we owned 44 assets with 
1.4 million sqm of net lettable area with a book 
value of €823.3 million (2016: €687.5 million), and 
total portfolio occupancy rate of 81% (2016: 80%). 
This reflects a gross yield of 8.6% (2016: 8.8%
^
) 
and a capital value per sqm of €563 (2016: €527
^
). 
We are confident that the potential to continue 
to grow the portfolio substantially further in this 
organic fashion remains strong. 9

The move up to the Main Market of 
the London Stock Exchange and to 
the Main Board of the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange is indicative of 
just how far the Company has 
progressed over recent years.”
One of the most pleasing achievements of the year 
under review was being able to demonstrate the full 
cycle of the Sirius strategy with €101.9 million of disposals 
either completing or being agreed in addition to the sale 
of a land parcel for €1.5 million. A further mature asset 
was notarised for sale post period end for €7.0 million. 
In January 2017, the Company announced its most 
significant disposal to date in the sale of the 
Rupert Mayer Strasse business park asset in Munich for 
€85.0 million to an institutional buyer. The core disposals 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Sirius strategy from 
acquisition, through the intensive asset management 
to profit crystallisation upon disposal. Furthermore this 
creates the opportunity to recycle capital from mature 
sites into assets with more future potential.
Additionally, the Company continued to identify 
acquisitions, with €103.3 million of new assets 
completed and €49.9 million notarised in the period 
or shortly post period end. Our asset management 
team has already identified good potential to enhance 
the income streams and capital values of these. We have 
now acquired €233.8 million of assets since we started 
our recent acquisitions programme and we expect 
this to continue into the new financial year where, with 
additional banking facilities, we will have the resources 
to acquire a further €65.0 million of assets on top 
of those mentioned above.
With the increase in the size of the business 
and the move to the main markets in London 
and Johannesburg, the Board of Sirius has expanded 
through my own appointment as Non-executive 
Chairman in September 2016 and more recently 
the appointment of Justin Atkinson, former CEO 
of Keller Group plc, as an independent Non-executive 
Director. Robert Sinclair from whom I took over as 
Chairman will not be offering himself up for re-election 
at the next AGM, having served the Company for the 
last ten years, five of those as Chairman. On behalf of 
the Board I would like to thank him for his outstanding 
commitment to Sirius during that time. In particular, 
whilst Chairman, Robert was instrumental in guiding 
the Company through the financial crisis to become the 
strong and fast growing Company that Sirius is today.
 
*  Reported profit before tax adjusted for property revaluation,

**  Excluding provisions for deferred tax and financial derivatives.
***  Including the Krefeld and Markgröningen acquisitions 
which completed just after year end and excluding the 
Merseburg disposal. 
^  Restated for the disposal of Merseburg and a land sale 
at CöllnParc.
The Board is currently actively recruiting for a 
replacement for Robert. Justin Atkinson, a qualified 
accountant, will take on the role of Chairman of the 
Audit Committee from Robert after the AGM.
Following on from the Company’ s growth in profitability, 
the Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.53c 
per share (2016: 1.30c), representing an increase of 
17.7% on the same period in the previous year, which 
gives a total dividend per share for the year of 2.92c, 
an increase of 32% (2016: 2.22c).
Looking forward, the Company remains well positioned 
to take advantage of operating within the most powerful 
economy in Europe and benefit from the strong occupier 
and investor demand across all subsections of the German 
real estate market. This will allow us to deliver attractive 
risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders whilst 
continuing to grow the business.

 Q&A 
with the CEO
Current year performance – What have 
been the key drivers of the record trading 
performance in the financial year?
The strong trading result reflects the continued success 
of the value-add business model of the Company and 
the asset management techniques that we use. 
The profit improvements that we have seen this year 
have come from three main areas: acquisitions, organic 
net income growth and further improvements to our 
banking terms.
Our acquisitions have not only made a strong impact 
when acquired but we have quickly been able to improve 
the income that they generate which has led to valuation 
improvements as well. In the financial year ended 
31 March 2016 we acquired €82.7 million of assets with 
a further €103.3 million completing in or shortly after 
the financial year under review with a combined EPRA 
net initial yield of 8.1% and vacancy of 30%. From an 
organic growth perspective, one of the main drivers has 
been the capex investment programme which continues 
to progress well. Our new lettings, renewals and service 
charge initiatives are also producing good results and we 
have seen a further 2.8% increase in the like-for-like rent 
roll for properties held throughout the reporting period 
despite operating in a low inflationary environment.
Total occupancy has remained fairly stable because we 
have been acquiring vacancy through our acquisitions 
but this will fuel our capex investment programme which 
will provide further organic growth into the future.
We have continued to take advantage of the favourable 
financing markets by refinancing two loan facilities 
during the year which reduced our annual interest 
charge by €1.8 million. This along with the full impact 
of the refinancings from the previous financial year 
had a significant impact on this year’s results.
Opportunities going forward – Where do 
you see value being created looking ahead 
into the current financial year and beyond?
The start of the new financial year will be mainly 
about the asset recycling programme following 
the completed disposal of €96.0 million of assets 
and the notarisation for sale of another €7.0 million 
asset. The replacement of these has begun well with 
€27.4 million of acquisition assets completed and a 
further €49.9 million notarised for completion since 
the year end. We will continue to seek a mix of stable 
income and value-add opportunity within the assets 
we acquire and given the strength of our operating 
platform, we feel confident of taking advantage of 
the opportunities within both the existing portfolio 
and the acquired assets in the year ahead and beyond.
Our capex investment programme will continue to 
play a large part in exploiting these opportunities and 
the acquisitions that we have made certainly helped 
in this regard. We have already identified over 43,000sqm 
for investment and transformation on the assets 
acquired in the year under review and more will come 
from the assets acquired and notarised post year end.
Following our disposals we have, and continue to, 
acquire assets with significant vacancy and hence 
opportunity, whilst replacing most of the income lost 
from the mature and non-core assets which were sold. 
Whilst the initial impact of the recycling programme 
will be to reduce income in the year ahead while the

continued success of the value-add 
business model of the Company and

disposal proceeds are reinvested, the impact from the 
value-add opportunities within the assets acquired will 
be much greater for shareholders in the years thereafter.
Macroeconomic – How are German market 
dynamics changing and how well positioned 
is Sirius to take advantage?
The German economy continues to be the largest in 
Europe and continues to be regarded as a favourable 
market in which to invest. A combination of low 
unemployment, monetary policy and the availability 
of low-cost debt has fuelled private and corporate 
spending. The real estate sector itself continues to feel 
the impact of these economic tailwinds with transaction 
volumes up and pricing across all subsectors of the 
real estate market reaching levels not seen for some 
time. Sirius has seen some of this yield shift feeding 
into its valuations but we still believe there is more 
to come before the levels that we are seeing in the 
market are reached.
This robust economic environment has also translated 
into high occupational demand particularly from the 
SME sector which is a key element of the Group’ s tenant 
base. Continued economic growth, as forecasted by 
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (“OECD”), is good news for the SME 
market which remains of crucial importance for the 
German economy as a whole. Sirius has benefited 
from a long track record of being able to meet the 
continually changing space requirements of these 
SMEs and expects this to continue going forward.
Financing – Describe your approach to 
financing and managing interest rate risk.
The Company has no appetite for interest rate risk or 
other forms of financing risk which is evidenced by the 
fact 88% of our total debt is fixed with fixed rates or 
swap contracts and the other 12% has an obligation 
to fix one year after drawdown. Our stated objective 
is to achieve a gross LTV rate of less than 40.0% by no 
later than 31 March 2018 and is currently at 42.3%.
We have built many strong relationships with lenders 
and developed their confidence in our operating platform 
which is why they continue to lend to us on favourable 
terms. The current debt in place is well diversified with 
facilities from six lenders as at 31 March 2017 and there 
are a number of other lenders that the Company is 
speaking with.
The current loan book looks strong with an average 
cost of borrowing at less than 2.0%, a weighted 
average debt expiry of 5.8 years and annual interest 
coverage of more than 8.5 times by the Group’s net 
operating income. Along with the lower LTV levels, 
we believe that we are currently in a very strong 
position with our financing.
Looking further ahead the availability and terms 
of financing that are accessible may change; however, 
we believe we are well positioned to deal with this. 
Our approach to financing and interest rate risk will 
always remain steadfast in order to provide as best 
a platform as possible for us to continue to deliver 
attractive risk-adjusted returns to shareholders.

Our strategy
Delivering our strategy
The Group’s core strategy is the acquisition of business parks at 
attractive yields and/or with value-add potential which are transformed 
through investment and asset management to higher quality real 
estate assets. This transformation includes the reconfiguration 
and upgrade of existing and vacant space to appeal to the local 
market, branding of the site and extensive asset management 
which includes extending anchor tenants, letting up vacancy 
and significantly improving service charge cost recovery.
The Group continues to be focused on growing both organically 
and acquisitively as well as recycling mature and non-core assets 
to free up capital to be used to acquire assets which it can transform 
and add greater value to.
The type of asset that the Group acquires and develops can be 
divided into three categories as follows:
 » Traditional industrial business parks – typically large production 
sites built many years ago by owner/occupiers and developed 
for their specific needs.
 » Modern mixed-use business parks – typically higher quality 
office, service and warehouse properties built for multi-tenants in 
the 1980s and 1990s.
 » Office buildings – typically good quality office buildings 
in secondary or tertiary locations near the big seven major 
office markets in Germany.
Sirius’ main objective is to maximise income and value of all 
assets through active asset management throughout the period in 
which they are owned. The Group’ s asset management platform is 
predominantly in house and focused on key drivers such as 
property and tenant management, new lettings, service charge 
recovery, lease management, tenant renewals and debt collection.
The main asset management initiatives are designed to 
convert properties into improved, more efficient, higher 
yielding conventional and flexible workspaces.

Our strategy continued
 
The recovery of service charge costs in mixed-use, multi-tenanted 
business parks typically results in high leakage from net operating 
income. Over the last ten years, the Group has invested substantially 
in building an in-house team that is entirely focused on optimising 
service levels and costs as well as improving service charge 
recovery levels. These investments include the following:
 » developing utilities metering and consolidating purchasing 
power to negotiate better utilities deals and improve 
consumption allocation;
 » creating detailed equipment lists and matrices to manage 
maintenance programmes better and improve allocation 
of these costs;
 » increasing service charge prepayments to reduce the need 
to chase balancing payments at the end of each year; and
 » improving the overall cost allocation and recovery process.
The ability to achieve a cost recovery percentage that is higher than 
occupancy which the Company believes to represent a best in class 
performance and something the Group is committed to on all its 
assets going forward.
Improvement of service charge recovery 4
Sirius has been active in growing its portfolio through acquisitions 
over the last three years and has been funding these with private 
placings as well as negotiating favourable banking deals. In order 
to establish and maintain a balanced portfolio, both opportunistic 
and stable assets have been acquired within the three categories 
of assets mentioned at the start of this section.
The Company remains committed to growing the portfolio through 
the successful recycling of several mature and non-core assets. 
Opportunities to dispose of non-core and mature assets which 
have been successfully repositioned are constantly assessed with 
the intention to recycle capital into new assets with attractive 
return profiles and greater opportunity to add value.
Growth through acquisition and recycling 5
The internal asset management platform remains a key 
differentiator for Sirius over its competitors and plays an integral role 
in driving occupancy and rental growth. The internal marketing 
team has developed a significant internet presence over the last 
ten years and this drives the generation of more than 1,100 leads 
per month predominantly from the Company’s website and the 
internet portals upon which vacancy is advertised. Once leads 
have been generated, a dedicated call centre immediately deals 
with all enquiries and converts approximately 74% of all enquiries 
into viewings. The on-site sales teams use a structured sales 
process and are currently converting about 16% of viewings 
into new deals. 
This translates to approximately a 12% conversion rate of all 
enquires into new lettings which the Company believes is best in 
class. All aspects of the Company’s sales process as well as those 
of many of its competitors are mystery shopped in order to measure 
performance and ensure standards are continually met. This highly 
specialised in-house capability enables the Company to secure 
and retain tenants without reliance on external agents and brokers 
and is the key behind being able to realise the full potential of 
the transformed vacant space that is created through the capex 
investment programme.
Occupancy and rental growth 
The Company’s extensive capex investment programme continues 
to deliver exceptional returns and remains one of the major drivers 
of organic income and capital value growth. The programme is 
focused on converting sub-optimal spaces like excess office space, 
redundant halls and basements into both the Group’ s conventional 
and Smartspace flexible workspaces. The investment also includes 
upgrading common and outside areas as well as branding sites. 
Often amenities like conferencing rooms, canteens and fitness 
centres are created on site and let to external operators which 
bring substantial footfall to sites as well as bringing them to life 
and adding to the tenant work environment. 
The returns that the Company achieves from its capex investment 
are high as typically they not only include rental income and service 
charge recovery improvements that come from letting the 
transformed areas but also include significant valuation uplifts that 
come from improving the space and business park. The current 
capex investment programme commenced in January 2014 
and is focused on just over 200,000sqm of sub-optimal space 
and continues to grow as a result of the vacancy in our recent 
acquisitions. To date around €15.0 million has been invested with 
158,691sqm of space being fully transformed resulting in increased 
annualised rental income of €8.7 million based on 78% of this 
space being let. The return on investment to date has been 49%.

Sirius Real Estate Limited
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report
The Group currently operates only in the German real 
estate market and focuses on the industrial, storage 
and office sectors. Most of the assets are located in and 
around six of the big seven German markets and the 
Company is looking to include Hamburg if opportunities 
arise. It currently owns and manages a portfolio of 
44 mixed-use business parks and office buildings across 
Germany which are marketed under the Company’s 
brand. The three major types of property the Group 
owns are traditional light-industrial business parks, 
modern mixed-use business parks and pure office 
buildings. The traditional business parks generally 
offer a combination of conventional light-industrial, 
storage and office space as well as some flexible 
workspace such as serviced offices, self-storage and 
workboxes, whereas the modern business parks are 
more focused on office, service and warehouse space. 
The Group also has a broad tenant base ranging from 
large blue-chip corporations occupying large production 
halls on long-term leases, down to individuals who 
rent a storage box on a monthly basis, with the most 
common tenant being the German SME.
As such, the Group benefits from the dynamics 
of the German economy and SME market, which 
continue to see growth, and the Group is well placed 
to take advantage of continuing demand for both its 
conventional space and flexible workspace.
German economy
Germany is the largest economy in Europe, 
with a GDP of $48,908 per capita ($3.4 trillion) 
which represents 20.1% of the total EU GDP . 
The economy has recovered since the financial 
crisis of 2008–09, delivering real GDP growth 
above that of the EU15 (the original 15 EU members). 
This performance is expected to continue, with 
GDP forecast to grow by 1.6% in 2017 according 
to the OECD.
Germany has the second lowest rate of unemployment 
in the EU at around 4.1% (Statista) and this positive 
trend is expected to continue. This is pushing private 
consumption expenditure, which is a key driver of 
Germany’s economic growth.
Monetary policy in Germany continues to be 
accommodating to both business and consumer 
spending and a competitive manufacturing sector 
is driving strong export performance. The prolonged 
favourable financing conditions continue to provide 
stimuli for real estate and capital investment; however, 
the German real estate sector is well positioned to absorb 
a rise in borrowing costs should this eventuate.
German SME market
A significant part of the Group’s strategy is to provide 
flexible workspace for the German SME market.
SMEs continue to represent a fundamental pillar of the 
German economy and form a significant part of the 
Group’s tenant base. According to KfW, 99.95% of 
German enterprises are SMEs and 68% of workers 
(29.1 million people) are employed by an SME in 
Germany. Within the SME category are microenterprises 
with fewer than ten employees and these account 
for 34% of workplaces in Germany. These are the 
tenants to which the Group’s flexible space offerings 
are most appealing and the Company’s marketing 
platform continues to attract them to the Sirius sites.
German commercial real estate market
Office market
The demand for office space in German cities has 
intensified particularly in the seven largest office 
markets. T ake-up of space year on year in 2016 was 
approximately 15% higher than the year before 
and significantly higher than the last ten year average. 
Rental price trends across Germany as a whole are 
positive with Berlin, Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Stuttgart 
and Munich showing the best growth in average rents. 
The markets in which the Group operates continue to 
see growth, meaning demand for both our conventional 
and flexible workspace continues to be strong.

Sirius Real Estate Limited
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The Group has recently acquired a number of business 
parks with high office content around the key German 
office markets and both the high demand and increasing 
rental rates are evident as it executes its investment 
and letting strategy to fill these new assets.
The major office markets in Germany have also seen 
yields come in significantly over the last seven years 
with prime yields dropping to under 4.0% in all of the 
major markets and under 3.5% in Munich, Berlin and 
Hamburg. The positive movement has also been seen 
in the secondary and tertiary locations around these 
prime areas and the Group should expect to see some 
significant benefit from that over time.
Industrial real estate market
The German industrial real estate asset class is quite 
broad but in general it has significantly benefited in 
recent years because of improved investor understanding, 
availability of debt financing and the relatively high 
yields compared to other asset classes. This has resulted 
in higher demand, higher transaction volume and yields 
coming in across all categories of the sector. What has 
been evident from the independent market research 
which has been conducted on the sector is that yields 
on industrial assets that have been converted into fully 
refurbished, highly let, better quality multi-let business 
parks are much lower than similar assets which have 
not undergone the transformation. This bodes well for 
the Sirius business model, which is based on converting 
lower quality assets in need of investment into the 
more desired “converted property” category.
Demand for space in the industrial market remains 
strong, particularly for smaller units which are not 
always provided by the Group’s competitors.

for organic growth and asset recycling.
EPRA NAV per share increased in the period 
by 9.7% to 57.84c (31 March 2016: 52.72c). 
This is mainly attributable to the valuation 
increases seen in the year, as well as retaining

To remove most of the vacancy from 
sub-optimal space by transforming this 
space into higher quality conventional space 
and Smartspace. We will continue to market 
for sale the two non-core sites in Bremen 
which have 82,171sqm of vacant space 
which is considered structural void.
Occupancy increased to 80.5% in the period, 
a record high for the Company despite acquiring 
a number of sites with high vacancy.
To grow the value of the Group’s portfolio 
through acquisitions and valuation increases 
by increasing income across the portfolio. 
This is most value accretive when created

The book value of the Group’s investment 
property increased by 19.7% as a result of both 
acquisition and organic growth. The like-for-like 
portfolio increased by €58.3m or 8.5%. The 
portfolio is valued at an average gross yield

Introduction
The Sirius in-house asset and property management model continues to be a significant driver of value across the business and one 
of the key reasons that the Company is able to make the level of returns on its assets that it does. While common practice is to outsource 
many of the key functions of asset and property management, Sirius continues to reap the rewards that come with being able to manage 
its portfolio with its own dedicated resources. This is conducted through a highly specialised operating platform with a substantial IT 
infrastructure and over 230 employees, and continues to focus on acquisitions, disposals, financing, capital investment and development, 
lettings, service charge recovery, supplier management, debt collection, lease management, financial reporting and many other aspects 
of portfolio management. Progress on all elements has been made in the year under review, which continues the Company’s strong 
track record in growing profits and adding significant value to the portfolio.
Acquisitions
The Company has successfully continued its acquisitions programme, which in the period was funded by a €30.0 million 
equity raise in June 2016 along with the refinancing and increasing by €57 million of two banking facilities with Berlin Hyp AG 
and Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG. This allowed the Company to complete the acquisition of €80.4 million of assets including 
the Frankfurt asset which completed post year end, as detailed in the following table:

These assets were purchased on an exceptional blended yield of 8.1% considering the 55,778sqm (34% of the total) of vacancy 
that came with them. As such, not only will these assets produce high initial cash-on-cash returns, but, with investment and asset 
management, will provide significant value-add opportunity as well going forward. Following the period end an additional acquisition 
located in Cologne was purchased for total acquisition costs of €22.9 million bringing total acquisition expenditure to €103.3 million.

Disposals and asset recycling
It was indicated in our Interim Report that we would look to recycle assets by disposing of mature and non-core assets and replacing them 
with assets with higher opportunity. In the period the disposal of one non-core asset was completed and two mature assets were notarised. 
These completed post year end along with the notarisation of the disposal of another mature core asset. In total, that is €108.9 million 
of disposals as detailed in the following table:

Together these acquisitions also present a combination of secure, high yielding income in the Cologne asset with much greater opportunity 
in the Grasbrunn, Neu-Isenburg, Neuss and Mahlsdorf assets within the key areas of Munich, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Frankfurt and Berlin. 
The higher concentration of office space within these assets also plays into the strengths of Sirius where it can utilise its sales and marketing 
platform to fill up the vacancies with a combination of conventional lettings and its Smartspace Office products.
After the completion of the March 2017 equity raise, disposals and acquisitions detailed above, the Company will have the resources, 
with further bank facilities, to acquire around €65 million of additional assets.
Capex investment programme
Unlocking value through the transformation of vacant and sub-optimal space has been and continues to be a core part of the Group’s 
business strategy. A detailed knowledge of the markets in which Sirius operates has been built up over the last ten years and this 
knowledge is paramount to being able to create the right solution for the more difficult vacancy within the portfolio. An innovative 
range of products has been developed with the conversion of sub-optimal space in mind which means Sirius is well positioned to 
convert and manage the more complex spaces in its sites very effectively. We believe that this provides the Company with a significant 
competitive advantage over other companies that operate mixed-use industrial business parks and office assets. Our capex investment 
programme has already delivered exceptional returns and is key to delivering the total shareholder returns we see at the asset level. 
For more detail on this please see our case studies section on pages 15 to 17.
The original capex investment programme commenced just over three years ago and is focused on over 200,000sqm of sub-optimal 
space suitable for transformation. As at 31 March 2017 158,691sqm of this space had been completely refurbished and was either let 
or being marketed for let. A total of €14.2 million has been invested into this space and, at 61% occupancy, this space is generating 
€8.7 million of annualised rental income representing a return on investment of 49%. This return does not include the additional benefit 
of improved cost recovery from letting this space or the valuation increase that was generated by this investment.

The original capex investment programme still has significant potential in increasing rents and values further with 43,154sqm 
of space still to be converted. The total programme is expected to require a further €7.2 million of investment which is expected 
to produce €2.5 million of annualised rental income. The space is estimated to be fully converted by March 2018 and the income 
potential realised by September 2018.
In addition to the original capex investment programme, the acquisitions which completed in the year under review as well as the asset 
recycling programme are both contributing substantial sub-optimal vacancy for investment. To date a further 44,977sqm of space has 
been identified for investment on these assets as detailed in the following table:

As the Company continues to grow, further vacant and sub-optimal space will be identified and added to the capex investment programme.
Lettings and rental growth
The year under review also represented another successful lettings period with continued strong demand for both flexible and 
conventional workspace primarily from the Group’s core German SME customers. New lettings of 151,320sqm at an average rate 
of €5.60 per sqm were signed during the period (2016: 150,864sqm at €5.33 per sqm).
The consistently high levels of new lettings which have been seen in recent years are indicative of the effectiveness of the Company’s 
operating platform which again generated more than 85% of its customer leads in the period from its website and the online portals 
that it uses. Additionally it was able to convert 12% of all leads into new lettings, which is extremely efficient compared to industry 
standards. This was achievable because Sirius continues to have the largest sales force in the industry operating under a clearly 
structured sales process and managed through a combination of daily monitoring and regular mystery shopping.
The Group also experienced total move-outs in the period of 128,211sqm at an average rate of €5.54 per sqm (2016: 154,704sqm at 
€4.52 per sqm). Combined with new lettings and acquisitions, this translated into an increase of occupancy across the entire portfolio 
in the period to 81% (31 March 2016: 80%). Whilst this represents the highest occupancy that the Company has operated at before, 
it was reduced somewhat by the fact that most of the acquisitions in the period came with significant vacancy. We expect this trend to 
continue over the following year as many of the acquisitions which are expected to complete post year end also have vacancy. This is 
important for fuelling the capex investment programme going forward after the original programme is completed.
The combination of the tenant churn, contractual rental increases, uplift on renewals and capex investment programme has resulted 
in the average rate per sqm across the whole portfolio increasing to €5.27 per sqm (31 March 2016: €5.06 per sqm), and on a like-for-like 
basis* increasing to €5.15 per sqm (31 March 2016: €5.01 per sqm). The like-for-like annualised rental income* on the assets held or 
acquired near the start of the period increased to €65.6 million from €62.4 million at 31 March 2016. This represents a 5.1% growth 
of rent roll in the period coming predominantly from asset management and the capex investment programme. The total annualised 
rental income for the entire portfolio at the period end increased to €71.0 million (31 March 2016: €60.5 million).
* Includes the Krefeld and Markgröningen acquisitions and excludes the Merseburg disposal. 25

Tenant portfolio mix and breakdown
Despite the relatively high tenant churn across the portfolio, Sirius’ Senior Management T eam continues to maintain the desired tenant mix 
between major anchor tenants, which are often blue-chip manufacturing companies which occupy the large production areas; the 
smaller SME tenants, which occupy various types of space on a conventional lettings basis; and the micro SME tenants, which are most 
commonly associated with the high yielding flexible Smartspace products. The former provide our banks with the comfort, stability and 
lease term lengths that they prefer in order to offer us the most competitive interest rates whereas the flexible tenants contribute 
significantly to generating higher returns.
Our top 50 anchor tenants, many of which are internationally recognised names and have been on site for many years, represent 48% 
of total annualised rental income as at 31 March 2017 with the remaining 52% coming from the large number of smaller SME tenants 
which are on conventional and Smartspace leases. The Smartspace annualised rental income has increased to €4.8 million in the period 
(31 March 2016: €3.7 million) on the back of creating more Smartspace product through the capex investment programme as well as 
letting up more of the Smartspace vacancy. This is analysed in more detail in the next section.
A weighted average lease expiry across the entire portfolio of 2.5 years was in line with the previous period. However, the security of the 
income in place is enhanced by the fact that many of the anchor tenants are significantly invested and have had a long association with 
the site that they occupy, which is why they view operational continuity in their current location as a key success criterion for the future 
of their businesses.
The table below illustrates the tenant mix across our portfolio at the end of the reporting period:

Smartspace
During the year our Smartspace products have continued to prove popular with tenants seeking a flexible workspace solution. The four 
Smartspace products are specifically designed to provide flexibility for the changing requirements of small businesses and include a fixed 
price in order to provide the certainty that these customers need.
From an investment point of view, the returns that are achieved on Smartspace conversion are high, particularly when sub-optimal space 
is converted. A significant part of the capex investment programme involves Smartspace conversion and conversion from Flexilager to other 
Smartspace products and in the period a further 4,054sqm of Smartspace Office, 2,240sqm of Smartspace Workbox and 11,127sqm 
of Smartspace Storage were created from sub-optimal space.
Reflecting its increasing popularity, occupancy of Smartspace products increased to 68% (31 March 2016: 62%) in the period and rate 
per sqm increased to €6.65 per sqm (31 March 2016: €6.33 per sqm). The rental rates achieved on Smartspace Office and Smartspace 
Storage in particular remain materially higher than those typically achieved on conventional space. The table below gives more detail

Environment
Where practically possible, Sirius seeks to reduce 
its environmental impact and encourage sustainability 
initiatives. We actively manage our impact on the 
environment and work hard to ensure that space is 
maximised to its full potential. A fundamental part 
of our business model involves reconfiguring former 
industrial buildings and in doing so we extend the life 
and use of these ageing structures. We endeavour to 
ensure tenants are better equipped to manage their 
energy consumption and have made substantial 
progress in installing meters across many of our sites 
thereby facilitating the measurement and improvement 
of efficiencies in terms of the delivery and consumption 
of utilities throughout our portfolio of properties.
Community
Sirius has enthusiastic and passionate employees who 
are keen to support their community with worthwhile 
events. Sirius focuses attention on community causes 
in which employees have a personal interest and wish 
to be actively involved. We believe this ensures a deep 
commitment to the cause and enables us to see the 
direct impact of our support. Sirius continues to support 
many charities across Germany, both regionally and 
nationally, with a particular focus on youth, health 
and education.
People
Sirius recognises the importance of professional 
development for all employees within the Group. 
The Sirius Akademie internal training programme 
offers training for key employees across a range of 
topics including communication, finance and facility 
management. The Akademie has been running since 
2009 and in 2016 alone there were 15 training courses 
available to staff with a total of 184 employees attending. 
In March 2017 the Leadership Development Initiative was 
introduced. This is a quarterly development programme 
for all team leaders providing participants with a specific 
framework within which to lead and manage their 
individual teams as the Company expands.
Employee health and wellbeing awareness is actively 
promoted by Sirius with sports activities supported on 
a regular basis including team sports events conducted 
throughout the year.
To support employee health awareness in April 2016 
all employees received a Fitbit Fitness Tracker enabling 
everyone to participate in regular Company-run individual 
and team competitions set up to improve employee 
health and encourage team spirit.
Diversity
Sirius has a diverse workforce and in 2014, the 
German Charter of Diversity was signed, making 
Sirius an official member. We are committed to equal 
opportunities and our diversity policy aims to ensure 
that no employee receives less favourable treatment 
because of gender, marital status, race, age, sexual 
preference, religion, belief or disability. As part of the 
Company’s obligations under the German Charter 
of Diversity all employees undertake basic training 
relating to equal rights in the workplace (Allgemeines 
Gleichstellungsgesetz) and we take steps to ensure 
this culture transcends our employees, as well as the 
providers of services to our business parks.
We attract a diverse workforce in terms of nationalities 
employed, evidenced by a recent analysis of job 
applications received for a Business Analyst position 
whereby the nationalities of the applicants were from 
23 countries. As the Company uses both the German 
and English languages the Company provides language 
courses for all employees who wish to participate.

FFO is the profit number upon which dividends are 
determined and the 48% increase mentioned above 
can be approximately attributed to acquisitions 47%, 
organic growth 25% and improvements to banking 
terms 28%, which is broadly consistent with the prior 
year. The asset recycling programme is expected to have 
an initial reduction to earnings whilst disposal proceeds 
are being reinvested; however, the opportunities for 
future growth after the completion of the reinvestment 
will be significantly higher.
In light of the very significant disposals made by the 
Company that completed at the start of the new financial 
year, in particular the sale of Rupert Mayer Strasse, 
and the consequential temporary impact on earnings 
as it recycles the proceeds of sale into new opportunities, 
in order to maintain its dividend trajectory the Company 
may consider, for the current financial year, either 
temporarily increasing the pay-out ratio over 65% of FFO 
or paying a small element of special dividend, linked 
to the profits made on those disposals. The Company 
has successfully continued its acquisition programme 
as set out in the asset management review and the 
Board looks forward to updating shareholders with 
progress in its capital recycling in due course.
Organic growth has mainly come from rental 
income increases arising from the capex investment 
programme and other asset management initiatives. 
There has also been some further improvement in 
service charge recovery due to a combination of slightly 
higher occupancies, further improvements to allocation 
methods and significant increases in tenant prepayments 
reducing the need to collect large balancing invoices 
at the end of the year. As at 31 March 2017,
The year ended 31 March 2017 has again delivered 
a strong trading performance which continues to 
be driven by a combination of organic and acquisitive 
growth. The success of the acquisitions and capex 
investment programmes has been a major contributor 
to this performance and it is expected that the asset 
recycling programme will also prove beneficial in 
future years as the new investments are made mature. 
Total shareholder return, based on an adjusted net 
asset value (“adjusted NAV”) per share, continues 
to be a strong indicator of the Group’s annual 
performance and we recorded a 15.3% return in 
the period (31 March 2016: 16.0%). This would have 
been 17.1% without the effect of the conversion 
of the €5.0 million convertible loan note in June 2016. 
Consistently delivering this kind of performance whilst 
significantly growing the business has been one of the 
key factors behind the strong shareholder support 
as evidenced by multiple successful capital raisings the 
Company has experienced over the last few years.
Trading performance
For the year under review, total income was 
€68.8 million (2016: €55.8 million) with profit before 
tax increasing to €76.4 million (2016: €57.1 million), 
including €49.8 million of gains from property 
revaluations (2016: €44.2 million). The adjusted profit 
before tax* for the period was up 54% to €35.3 million 
(2016: €22.9 million) whilst Funds from Operations** 
(“FFO”) increased by 48% to €37.1 million 
(2016: €25.0 million). On a per share basis all of the 
key earnings metrics have shown positive movement 
in the period, which can be seen in the following table:
*  Reported profit before tax adjusted for property revaluation, 
change in fair value of derivative financial instruments and 
other adjusting items including expense relating to the 
Long Term Incentive Plan.
**  Adjusted profit before tax adjusted for depreciation, amortisation 
of financing fees and current tax receivable/incurred. 28

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report
Trading performance continued
the annualised rental income of the entire portfolio of 44 business parks was €71.0 million (31 March 2016: €60.5 million), of which 
€8.1 million relates to the six acquisitions that completed in the period. The annualised rental income at the period end for the portfolio 
which was owned at the start of the period*** was €65.6 million compared to €62.4 million at the start of the year. This represents 
another 5.1% increase in like-for-like rental income generated in the year which is encouraging considering the low inflation environment 
which exists in Europe. Annualised rental income will fluctuate over the next year because of the sales of the Kiel, Düsseldorf and 
Munich Rupert Mayer Strasse business parks and the purchase of the replacement assets which will be acquired with these disposal proceeds.
*** I ncludes the Krefeld and Markgröningen acquisitions which completed in May 2016 and excludes the Merseburg disposal.
Portfolio valuation
The portfolio was independently valued at €829.7 million by Cushman & Wakefield LLP (31 March 2016: €695.2 million) which converts to 
a book value of €823.3 million after the provision for tenant incentives and the €5.0 million Directors’ impairment of a non-core asset 
in Bremen. The portfolio which was owned at 31 March 2016, excluding the sold Merseburg asset and land at CöllnParc, increased in 
value by 8.5% or €58.3 million from €686.9 million to €745.2 million (31 March 2016: 10.9%). The valuations of the six sites that were 
acquired in the period were €84.5 million or 11.2% higher than their total acquisition costs. These increases have come predominantly 
from effective asset management as only 32bps of yield compression was applied to the core portfolio in the period. This confirms the 
high returns from both an income and valuation perspective that are being achieved from the investment into our capex investment 
programme and that we continue to purchase assets at discounted prices.
The entire portfolio as at 31 March 2017 comprised 44 assets and had a book value of €823.3 million which can be reconciled to the 
market valuation as follows:

Balance as at period end 823.3 687.5
Focusing on the core portfolio, the 31 March 2017 book valuation of €804.3 million represents an average gross yield of 8.5% 
(31 March 2016: 8.7%), a net yield of 7.6% (31 March 2016: 7.9%) and an EPRA net yield (including purchaser costs) of 7.1% 
(31 March 2016: 7.3%) which highlights the 32bps of yield compression that we have seen in the period. The average capital 
value per sqm of the core portfolio* is €628 (31 March 2016: €593) which is still below replacement cost.
* Adjusted for the sale of land at CöllnParc.
It is commonly believed that assets which have been completely renovated and are close to being fully let are worth more than those 
that still require investment and have vacancy. If true, then it provides further support for the high returns that are potentially achievable 
from our investment programme. When we make this split within the entire Sirius portfolio the valuation metrics support the valuation 
benefits of the investment into our assets, as can be seen in the following table:

Since the capex investment programme is predominantly focused on the vacant space of the value-add portfolio, and in transforming these 
assets from high-vacancy and capital-intensive properties to low-vacancy and fully renovated assets, we are hopeful that there are more 
net income and valuation increases to come on the back of these investments which may also protect against any development 
of adverse market conditions.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
 
The valuation increases seen this year have contributed towards the increase in adjusted NAV^ per share to 58.82c, an increase 
of 10.3% from 53.35c as at 31 March 2016. As mentioned above, total shareholder return, comprising adjusted NAV growth plus 
dividends paid in the period, was 15.3% (31 March 2016: 16.0%). The movement in adjusted NAV is explained in the following table:
^  Excludes the provisions for deferred tax and derivative financial instruments.
The EPRA net asset value (“EPRA NAV”) per share, 
which excludes Directors’ impairments and the 
provisions for deferred tax and derivative financial 
instruments, and includes the potential share award 
relating to the Company’s LTIP programme, was 
57.84c (31 March 2016: 52.72c).
Financing
The Company continues to access debt on very low 
interest rate terms and it was decided to refinance two 
bank facilities before the end of their term in order to 
extract more debt to acquire assets, as well as significantly 
reduce the cost of borrowings on these facilities and 
lock in the low rates for a longer term. The details 
of these two facilities are as follows:
 » In April 2016, the Group concluded a new seven 
year €137.0 million facility with Berlin Hyp AG 
and Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG to refinance an 
existing loan with the same syndicate which had 
an outstanding balance of €110.4 million and an 
average interest rate of 3.61%. The new facility 
is split in two tranches with Tranche 1, totalling 
€94.5 million, charged at a fixed interest rate of 
1.66% for the full term of the loan and tranche 2, 
totalling €42.5 million, charged with a floating rate 
of 1.57% over three month EURIBOR (not less than 
0%) for the first year of the loan and a requirement 
to fix the interest rate on this tranche thereafter is 
subject to ongoing negotiation as a result of the 
sale of the asset that this tranche was secured 
against. The cost to break the original facility was 
€2.1 million and the extra €26.6 million of debt 
from the new facility was used to purchase the 
Markgröningen and Krefeld assets which now 
form part of the security pool.
 » In October 2016, the Group concluded a new 
seven year €70.0 million facility with Berlin Hyp AG, 
with an all-in fixed interest rate of 1.48% for the full 
term of the loan, to replace an existing €39.2 million 
facility which was incurring an all-in fixed interest 
rate of 2.68%. The cost to break the original facility 
was €0.4 million and the extra €30.8 million of debt 
was used to part-fund the Dresden and Wiesbaden 
acquisitions which have both been injected into the 
security pool of the new facility.
These new facilities have helped further reduce 
the Group’s total cost of borrowings, which now 
stands at 1.99% (31 March 2016: 3.0%), as well 
as increase the weighted average debt expiry to 
5.8 years (31 March 2016: 4.7 years).
Total debt at 31 March 2017 was €348.6 million 
(31 March 2016: €299.0 million) and the Group’s 
gross loan to value (“gross LTV”) ratio reduced to 
42.3% (31 March 2016: 42.8%) whilst its net LTV* 
(“net LTV”) reduced to 38.0% (31 March 2016: 41.5%). 
The Group remains committed to achieving a target 
gross LTV of 40% by no later than 31 March 2018 
and believes it is on course to achieve this.
In June 2016, the Company successfully completed 
a €30.0 million equity raise followed, in March 2017, 
by a €15.0 million private placing. Proceeds from the 
June 2016 equity raise were used to part-fund 
the Dresden and Wiesbaden acquisitions as well as 
the three unencumbered acquisitions in Dreieich, 
Frankfurt and Krefeld. The proceeds from the March 2017 
private placing, together with the proceeds from the 
disposals of Merseburg, Munich Rupert Mayer Strasse, 
Düsseldorf and Kiel, will provide the Company with the 
potential to acquire around €138 million of assets over 
the next financial year. Up to the date of this report,

Financing continued
the Company had completed the acquisition of the 
Cologne asset for €22.9 million and notarised acquisitions 
totalling €49.9 million. This leaves a further €65.0 million 
of acquisitions to source for which the Company 
is progressing.
Also in June 2016, the Karoo Investment Fund S.C.A. 
SICAV-SIF converted its €5,000,000 5% convertible 
loan note, due 2018 in full, into, in aggregate, 
22,814,731 new ordinary shares at the conversion 
price of €0.2191566 per ordinary share, as adjusted 
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
loan note. This had the impact of reducing the adjusted 
NAV per share by 0.83c and the annualised adjusted 
EPS by 0.09c.
*  Net LTV is the ratio of principal value of gross debt less cash, 
excluding that which is restricted, to the aggregate value of 
investment property.
Dividend
The Company’s dividend policy continues to pay 
shareholders 65% of FFO, with the dividend paid 
semi-annually. As in previous periods, the Company 
is offering shareholders the ability to receive dividends 
in scrip rather than cash.
In accordance with this policy, the Board has 
declared a final dividend of 1.53c per share representing 
a 17.7% increase on the same period the previous 
year. The total dividend for the year is 2.92c per share 
(2016: 2.22c per share). The ex-dividend date will be 
12 July 2017 for shareholders on the South African 
register and 13 July 2017 for shareholders on the UK 
register. The record date will be 14 July 2017 and the 
dividend will be paid on 18 August 2017. A detailed 
dividend announcement including the dates of the 
dividend will be made in due course.
Outlook
Sirius has completed another strong financial year 
with profits again reaching levels not seen before 
and valuations continuing to rise. Most of this progress 
is derived from the intensive asset management the 
Company deploys, which focuses on transforming its 
properties predominantly through its capex investment, 
lettings and service charge recovery programmes. 
The focus remains on delivering risk-adjusted returns 
by growing recurring income and capital values through 
these asset management activities. The success of this 
is highlighted by the further increases in like-for-like 
rents and improvements in service charge recovery 
seen in the period.
It was pleasing to see a successful start to the asset 
recycling programme with a number of disposals at 
well above book value being achieved. The ability 
to crystallise this value completes the Group’s asset 
management cycle and will allow it to replace mature 
and non-core assets with assets with much greater 
opportunity that will fuel further increases to shareholder 
returns in the future.
All in all it has been a successful year and the foundations 
for this success to continue have been set. We look 
forward to the year ahead with optimism.

Managing our risks
Risk management framework
The Group has an established risk management 
approach to identify, monitor and mitigate risks. 
The Sirius Board has overall responsibility for risk 
management and is of the view that understanding 
and mitigating key risks is crucial to achieving the 
Group’s strategic objectives and long-term success. 
As such, a risk-based approach is taken on all major 
decision making and strategic initiatives.
Risk management is an integral part of the Group’s 
business and risks are considered at every level 
of decision making and across all business activities. 
A risk management framework is in place to ensure 
that risks are identified and mitigated in order to 
significantly increase the chances of being able 
to achieve the Group’ s objectives and create as well as 
preserve shareholder value. A detailed and extensive 
risk register is maintained that documents risks and 
related mitigating controls and has been created on 
the following basis.
Firstly, the Board categorises risk into five 
primary areas: 
1.  Corporate strategy – the risk the Group does 
not meet its objectives and becomes unattractive 
to shareholders and investors.
2.  Investment activity – the risk of being prevented 
from executing investments or that returns are not 
in line with expectations.
3.  Compliance – the risk of non-compliance with 
laws, regulations and accepted practices. 
4.  Customers and service providers – the risk 
associated with customers and suppliers not 
being able to meet their contractual obligations.
5.  Financial – the risk associated with the valuation, 
management and control of the Group’s assets 
and liabilities.
Sirius has policies and procedures in place for the 
timely identification, assessment and prioritisation 
of the Group’s material risks and uncertainties. 
This section describes how these risks are identified, 
managed and mitigated appropriately in order to 
deliver the Group’s strategic objectives.
Following categorisation, risks are evaluated and 
catalogued according to their likelihood of occurring 
and potential impact on the business. 
Finally, the risk register documents the controls in 
place that exist to mitigate the particular risk and sets 
out the frequency with which the risks are reviewed 
and by whom.
The Audit Committee takes responsibility for the 
review of the risk management methodology and 
the effectiveness of internal controls and the Board 
reviews the risk register on a bi-annual basis.
This process includes the following:
 » reviewing regular risk reporting prepared 
by the Senior Management Team;
 » assessing the effectiveness of control design 
and implementation; and 
 » overseeing and advising the Board on current 
risk exposures and future risk strategy. 32

Principal risks and uncertainties continued
 » The Group has established a number of strong banking relationships with lenders who understand and value the Sirius model.
 » The Sirius track record and methodology, especially its performance during the last downturn, is also valued highly by the lending market.
 » Bank facilities are only entered into where attractive rates and long facility terms can be secured.
 » It is Group policy to mitigate interest rate risk by fixing or capping interest rates on facilities.
 » Loan facilities incorporate covenant headroom, cure provisions and sufficient flexibility to facilitate asset management initiatives including asset substitution. 
 » Bank reporting is prepared and reviewed regularly.
Mitigation
 » Successfully refinanced two existing facilities with new debt of €207.0 million at a blended fixed rate of 1.58% for seven years.
 » 88% of the total borrowings of €348.6 million have been fixed with a fixed interest rate or swap. The remaining 12% is subject to an obligation to fix one 
year after drawdown.
 » The weighted average cost of debt has continued to decrease, standing at 1.99% at 31 March 2017 compared to 3.0% at 31 March 2016.
 » Weighted average debt expiry of 5.8 years up from 4.7 years at 31 March 2016.
Developments in the year
FINANCING 1
 » Reduced availability and increased cost of bank financing.
 » A breach of banking facility covenants.
Principal risks
 » Increase in cost of borrowing and reduction in Group profits.
 » Inability to refinance when facilities expire.
 » Requirement to dispose of assets at discounted values.
 » Limited ability to acquire new assets when yields are higher.
 » Acceleration of the Group’s obligations to repay borrowings.
 » Lender enforces security over the Group’s assets and restricts cash flow 
to the Group (e.g. cash traps).
Potential impact
VALUATION 2
 » Inherent difficulty in valuing property assets and valuations subject to uncertainty.
 » Asset values decline as a result of macroeconomic and other external factors.
 » Property assets are inherently difficult to value as there is no liquid market 
or standard pricing mechanism. As a result, valuations are subject to 
substantial uncertainty.
Principal risks
 » Reported NAVs may not accurately reflect the value of the portfolio.
 » Reduced liquidity and impact on returns.
 » Detrimental to NAV growth.
 » Potential non-compliance with loan facility covenants.
Potential impact
 » Valuations are conducted half-yearly by an expert, independent, reputable major corporation in the property sector.
 » The German property market and transactions are continually monitored by the Group and independent research has been developed to analyse 
transactions within the Group’s asset class in Germany.
 » The Group operates a value-add business model which involves significant investment into its assets with the intention of enhancing income and property 
value even in buildings with vacant or sub-optimal space.
 » All acquisition, investment and disposal decisions are made strategically incorporating market analysis and conditions. 
 » The Group is currently targeting a gross LTV ratio of no more than 40% at Group level, which it expects to achieve by 31 March 2018.
 » The Group holds seven assets on an unencumbered basis which are more liquid to sell or could be injected into bank security pools if necessary.
Mitigation
 » Like-for-like valuations have increased by €58.3 million or 8.5% for the year on the back of the Group’s investment and asset management initiatives.
 » Valuations of sites acquired in the year increased by €8.5 million or 11%, demonstrating the ability to buy at discounts to market price.
 » Average gross yields of the portfolio of 8.6% remains high compared to transactions that have been seen by Sirius in the market for similar assets.
 » Group gross LTV ratio of 42.3%. 
 » During the year two properties totalling €7.5 million were acquired without financing, which may provide flexibility in the event of any market downturns.
Developments in the year 35
Sirius Real Estate Limited
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
MARKET 3
 » The Group’s performance may be significantly impacted by events 
such as a general downturn in the German economy.
 » Reduced demand in key locations.
 » Reduced demand if the German SME market was to contract.
Potential impact
 » The Group offers a broad range of products to a broad range of tenants, from major blue-chip corporations to individuals. Many of its flexible products 
proved to be more desirable during the last downturn.
 » The Group’s pricing policy is to be below the upper quartile of the market so that during downturns it becomes the supplier of choice because of its 
economical pricing.
 » 48% of the Group’s rental income comes from its top 50 tenants, which are generally highly invested and embedded on the sites that they occupy. In the 
last market downturn there was relatively low movement within this group.
 » Most of the Group’s assets are concentrated around the key economic areas of Germany which are underpinned by strong supply and demand fundamentals.
Mitigation
 » The German economy continues to be the largest in Europe with the OECD forecasting continued GDP growth into 2017. Monetary policy is 
accommodating business and consumer spending which provide stimulus for the real estate sector. 
 » The SME market, which the Group considers to be its core tenant base has remained strong during the period under review. 
 » The Group continues to concentrate its investment activity in markets where prior experience, in-depth knowledge of local demand drivers 
and operational synergies can be utilised.
Developments in the year
 » Dependability on German market and economy.
 » Concentration of value in key locations.
 » Reliance on SME market.
 » The Group is subject to location risk in its property portfolio, which 
consists only of assets in the commercial real estate sector of Germany.
 » Whilst the level of demand for the Group’s offerings is currently robust, 
factors such as the economy, competition and sentiment may change 
in the future.
Principal risks
ACQUISITIVE GROWTH 4
 » The Group’s ability to execute earnings-accretive and/or value-add 
acquisitions may be significantly impacted due to the inability to source 
and complete on assets that meet the Group’s return expectations.
Potential impact
 » During the year under review the Group has reviewed a record number of on and off-market potential acquisition opportunities.
 » A total of six assets were acquired in the reporting period totalling €75.9 million, two assets were completed post period end totalling €27.4 million 
and a further four assets totalling €49.9 million were notarised for completion post period end. 
Developments in the year
 » Inability to source and complete on assets that meet the Group’s 
return expectations.
Principal risks
 » The Group’s operating platform includes an acquisition team which is focused specifically on sourcing potential acquisition opportunities, analysing their 
suitability for purchase and presenting those assets to the Investment Committee for further review and consideration.
 » The Group’s acquisition team has several years of experience within the markets in which the Group operates and over this time has grown its market 
understanding and connectivity significantly.
 » The Group ordinarily sources potential acquisition opportunities by independent enquiry; however, where opportunities are unable to be accessed privately 
the use of third party brokers is considered.

ORGANIC GROWTH 5
 » Income and valuation improvements do not meet expectations.
 » The Group’ s detailed site business plans and expected returns are not met.
 » Assets are more difficult to sell and are valued accordingly.
Potential impact
 » In the year under review a total of €14.2 million was invested into the original capex investment programme whereby the development of a further 
158,691sqm of sub-optimal vacant space was completed and an additional €8.7 million of annualised rental income was contracted on the completed 
space at 31 March 2017 representing a return on investment of 61% and excluding potential benefits to cost recovery and valuation.
 » For more details on our organic growth programme see the case studies on pages 15 to 17.
Developments in the year
 » Failure to invest into vacant space. 
 » Failure to realise the targeted returns on investment from the capex 
investment programme.
Principal risks
 » Extensive analysis is performed to assess demand and costs before an investment decision is made to ensure each project meets local demands and returns 
are realistic. 
 » Sirius has ten years of experience and data on developing its vacancy and the take-up of its and its competitors’ products in the markets that it operates, 
so assessments and projections are based on detailed information and knowledge.
 » The Group is continuing to invest in its internal operating platform, which ensures the delivery of all aspects of projects including development, marketing, 
lettings, renewals, service charge recovery and collections. 
 » Fortnightly conference calls are held with all relevant people discussing progress and expectations on all projects within the capex investment programme.
Mitigation
CUSTOMER 6
 » Reduced tenant demand for the Group’s offerings and lower take-up 
of vacant space. 
 » Substantial amount of existing tenants or tenants becoming insolvent.
 » Tenants failing to meet their lease obligations.
Principal risks
 » Inability to fill up vacant space and not meet profit growth 
targets/expectations.
 » Occupancy and profit issues when a number of major anchor tenants 
vacate in a short time period.
 » Tenant defaults result in loss of income and an increase in void costs 
and bad debt.
 » Downward pressure on earnings and NAV.
Potential impact
 » The Group has a large and active internal marketing and lettings team working within the German market and is not reliant on third parties to sign new 
and renew existing tenants. The Group’s online presence is such that more than 90% of the average of 1,100 enquiries received each month come from 
the internet and the dedicated call centre and on-site teams convert on average 12% of all leads into new lettings.
 » On-site management is focused on tenant needs and ensuring that their experience on a Sirius business park is as good as possible, which significantly 
mitigates the risk of tenants leaving.
 » Continual engagement with tenants also provides an early indication of tenants that will leave so that work on replacement can start much earlier.
 » The close relationships that have been developed with tenants help to understand their businesses and meet their changing space requirements. 
 » Due to the industrial nature of most of the Group’s major tenants, they are generally highly invested on site and have been there for many years. 
The move-out rate of these tenants is low.
 » All prospective tenants go through a robust credit check to provide comfort over their suitability and financial state.
 » All lease agreements require tenants to provide deposits and/or bank guarantees.
 » Service charge costs are subject to prepayments which are adjusted each year to reflect future expectations of actual costs.
Mitigation
 » Of the €1.7 million of rental income that was up for renewal in the period, 73% was renewed.
 » The Group generated 13,230 letting enquiries, of which 12% were converted into new deals, which let up 151,320sqm of space with contracted 
annualised rental income of €10.1 million.
 » Like-for-like occupancy in the period increased from 80% to 82%. 
 » As at 31 March 2017, 48% of rental income was contracted to the top 50 tenants.
 » As at 31 March 2017, €7.0 million was held in escrow accounts for tenant deposits.

Viability statement 
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
and the South African King III Code of Corporate 
Governance Principles, the Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group over a period longer than the 
twelve months required by the “Going Concern” 
provision. The Board has conducted this review taking 
into account the Group’s long-term strategy, principal 
risks, current position and future plans over a three 
year period.
A period of three years was chosen on the basis of:
 » three years being the period for which detailed 
asset level business plans are prepared; 
 » three years being the period considered optimal 
to balance planning requirements and the ability 
to make accurate estimations; and
 » three years being indicative of the Group’s short-
term redevelopment and asset management 
initiative cycle. 
Particular attention is given to existing and planned 
financial commitments, financing arrangements including 
compliance, and broader macroeconomic considerations.
The Group’s three year plan is underpinned by 
a detailed financial model that consolidates the 
business plans of the Group’s property assets. 
The key assumptions underpinning the plan are:
 » growth in rental income, principally from 
acquisitions and supported by delivery of 
the organic growth programme;
 » a gradual decrease in irrecoverable service charges 
as a result of an increase in occupancy rates; and
 » the broadly fixed nature of overheads which consist 
primarily of central management costs.
The financial model is stress tested to validate its 
resistance to changes relating to property valuations 
and associated yields, rental income rates, occupancy 
levels, overheads, committed capital expenditures, 
working capital requirements, and the ability to finance 
forecasted transactions and refinance maturing debt. 
The financial covenants to which the Group is subject 
are included in the financial model to ensure the 
conditions which would result in a breach of covenant 
can be anticipated. 
Based on the results of their review, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three year period of their assessment.

Governance
The Board has resolved that the disclosures to be 
made in the Annual Report regarding the operation 
of the Board and its sub-committees should comply 
with the requirements of the Companies (Guernsey) 
Law, 2008, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
South African King III Code of Corporate Governance 
Principles and best practice generally.
Statement of Compliance
The Board is committed to the highest standards of 
corporate governance and has adopted processes and 
policies to seek to ensure a sound framework for the 
control and management of the business. Following 
UK Admission, the Board complies with the requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code published in 
September 2014 by the Financial Reporting Council 
(“UK Corporate Governance Code”) as it relates to 
“smaller companies” (companies which are outside 
the FTSE350 throughout the year immediately prior 
to the reporting year) with the exception of the 
requirement for an internal audit function as explained 
in more detail below. The Company is not subject 
to the Code of Corporate Governance in Guernsey. 
The Company will report to its Shareholders on its 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code in accordance with the Listing Rules.
The Board has established an Audit Committee, a 
Nomination Committee and a Remuneration Committee. 
In light of UK Admission, the Board intends to continue 
to review the terms of reference for each committee. 
If the need should arise, the Board may set up 
additional committees. 
The Company has adopted policies and procedures to 
comply with the Market Abuse Regulation, including 
the establishment of a Disclosure Committee and a code 
of securities dealings in relation to the Ordinary Shares. 
The Company intends the code to apply to the Directors 
and other relevant employees of the Company.
Directors
The Company is led and controlled by a Board of 
Directors, which is collectively responsible for the 
long-term success of the Company. The Board believes 
it has an appropriate balance of skills and experience.
The Chairman of the Board is independent and is 
appointed in accordance with the Company’s Articles 
of Incorporation.
In accordance with the Articles of Association of the 
Company, at each general meeting (a) any Director 
who was elected or last re-elected as a Director at or 
before the AGM held in the third calendar year before 
the current year shall retire by rotation, and (b) such 
further Directors (if any) shall retire by rotation as 
would bring the number retiring by rotation up to 
one-third of the number of Directors in office at that 
date. The current practice of the Board is to offer 
themselves up for re-election annually.
The Company has adopted a share dealing code for the 
Board and will seek to ensure compliance by the Board, 
the Executive and Senior Managers and other third party 
service providers with the terms of the share dealing code.
The Board met on a regular basis throughout 
the year and as needed to deal with special business. 
The Board has appointed an Audit Committee, a 
Nomination Committee, a Remuneration Committee, 
a Disclosure Committee and an Investment Committee 
which consider issues relevant to their specific terms 
of reference. The offices of the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive Officer are held separately.
Board meetings follow a formal agenda of matters 
reserved for decision and approval by the Board and 
also address any special business. Matters reserved 
for the Board include the review of strategy and 
organisational change, the review and monitoring 
of internal controls and risk management processes, 
the approval of significant investments and disposals, 
the approval of budgets and the regular review of 
current trading and the financial position of the Group. 
The Board receives regular reports on current trading 
and the financial position and forecasts of the Group prior 
to its meetings. In addition, the Board receives relevant 
information on business, corporate and strategic issues.
The Company maintains a register of Directors’ 
conflicts of interest. In addition, at the start of each 
Board meeting, as a routine item, Directors are asked 
to declare any interests that might conflict with the 
agenda items under discussion. Directors are required 
to notify the Company, via the Company Secretary, at 
any time, of any potential or future conflicts of interest 
that may arise. Any such notifications are reviewed at 
the next Board meeting or sooner if deemed necessary 
and, if considered appropriate, authorised. Directors 
do not participate in the discussion or vote regarding 
their own conflicts of interest. If authorised, any conflicts 
are entered in the register of Directors’ conflicts.
Corporate governance

Sirius Real Estate Limited
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
 
All Directors may take independent professional 
advice at the Group’s expense in the furtherance 
of their duties and have full access to the Company 
Secretary. The Company maintains directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance in respect of legal action 
against its Directors on an ongoing basis.
Upon appointment, Non-executive Directors undertake 
an induction process to familiarise themselves with the 
Group’s activities, policies and key issues. During their 
appointment they are expected to dedicate adequate 
time to carry out their role effectively and to challenge 
management in a constructive way.
The Chairman meets regularly with the other 
Non-executive Directors to discuss the performance 
of the Board and the Board sub-committees. 
The performance of Executive Directors is measured 
against predetermined objectives that are agreed 
with each Executive Director at the start of the 
financial year.
The Chairman has no executive responsibilities but 
leads and sets the agenda for the Board. The Chairman 
also acts as an interface between the Executive Directors 
and Non-executive Directors.
The Senior Independent Director provide a sounding 
board for the Chairman and to serve as an intermediary 
for the other Directors when necessary. The Senior 
Independent Director should be available to shareholders 
if they have concerns which contact through the normal 
channels of the Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer 
has failed to resolve or for which such contact is 
inappropriate. James Peggie was appointed, on UK 
admission, as the Senior Independent Director.
Board tenure and re-election 
A Director who retires at an Annual General Meeting 
may, if willing to continue to act, be elected or re-elected 
at that meeting. If, at a general meeting at which a 
Director retires, the Company neither re-elects that 
Director nor appoints another person to the Board in 
the place of that Director, the retiring Director shall, 
if willing to act, be deemed to have been re-elected 
unless at the general meeting it is resolved not to fill 
the vacancy or unless a resolution for the re-election 
of the Director is put to the meeting and not passed. 
Directors are appointed under letters of appointment, 
copies of which are available at the registered office 
of the Company. The Board considers its diversity, 
experience, composition and succession planning 
on an ongoing basis.
Directors’ remuneration
The level of remuneration of the Non-executive Directors 
reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of their 
roles. The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors 
does not include any share options or other performance 
related elements and there are no plans to seek any 
shareholder waivers to deviate from this.
Based on the exchange rate at the date of Admission 
and rounded to the nearest thousand the Chairman 
is entitled to annual remuneration of €139,000 and 
the other non-executive Directors are entitled to a 
basic annual remuneration of €46,000. In addition 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee is entitled to 
annual remuneration of €9,000, the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee is entitled to annual 
remuneration of €9,000 and the Senior Independent 
Director is entitled to annual remuneration of €6,000.
Board performance and evaluation
The Board formally reviews its performance 
annually through an internal process. Internal evaluation 
of the Board, the Audit Committee, the Nomination 
Committee, the Remuneration Committee and 
individual Directors has taken the form of performance 
evaluation questionnaires and discussions to determine 
effectiveness and performance in various areas as 
well as the Directors’ continued independence.
The Board believes that annual evaluations are 
helpful and provide a valuable opportunity for 
continuous improvement.
Internal control and financial reporting
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible 
for establishing and maintaining the Company’s system 
of internal control and reviewing its effectiveness. 
Internal control systems are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatements or loss.
The Directors carry out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Company, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. The key procedures which have 
been established to provide internal control are that:
 » the Board has delegated the day-to-day 
operations of the Company to the Executive and 
the Senior Management Team and to Intertrust Fund 
Services (Guernsey) Limited as its provider of company 
secretarial and administrative services; however, it 
retains accountability for all functions it delegates; 44
Sirius Real Estate Limited
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance
Internal control and financial reporting continued
 » the Board clearly defines the duties and 
responsibilities of the Company’s agents and 
advisers and appointments are made by the Board 
after due and careful consideration. The Board 
monitors the ongoing performance of such agents 
and advisers and will continue to do so;
 » the Board monitors the actions of the Executive 
and the Senior Management Team at regular 
Board meetings and is given frequent updates 
on developments arising from the operations 
and strategic direction;
 » Intertrust Fund Services (Guernsey) Limited provide 
administration and company secretarial services to 
the Company; and
 » the Board has reviewed the need for an internal 
audit function and has decided that the systems 
and procedures employed by Intertrust Fund 
Services (Guernsey) Limited, the Executive and 
Senior Management Team, including their own 
internal controls and procedures, provide sufficient 
assurance that an appropriate level of risk 
management and internal control, which safeguards 
shareholders’ investment and the Company’s assets, 
is maintained. An internal audit function specific to 
the Company is therefore considered unnecessary 
at this time; however, this will continue to be reviewed.
Internal controls over financial reporting are designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external reporting purposes.
The systems of control referred to above are designed 
to ensure effectiveness and efficient operation, internal 
control and compliance with laws and regulations. 
In establishing the systems of internal control, regard 
is paid to the materiality of relevant risks, the 
likelihood of costs being incurred and costs of control.
It follows therefore that the systems of internal control 
can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance 
against the risk of material misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee has considered arrangements 
by which staff of the Company may, in confidence, 
raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters 
of financial reporting or other matters, which are 
incorporated in its Terms of Reference. It has concluded 
that adequate arrangements are in place for the 
proportionate and independent investigation of such 
matters and, where necessary, for appropriate follow-up 
action to be taken within their organisation. The Audit 
Committee may also seek professional advice on any 
such matters and secure the attendance at its Meetings 
of third parties with relevant experience and expertise 
if it considers this necessary.
Board and Committee attendance
This is detailed separately for the Board, the 
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees on 
page 66. The Disclosure Committee met once during 
the period. The Investment Committee was formed in 
2017 and has not yet had its first formal meeting.
Board sub-committees
Sub-committees of the Board have been constituted 
to consider and make recommendations to the Board 
regarding matters relating to external audit, internal 
control and risk management processes, the selection 
of appropriate accounting policies, the presentation 
of the half year and full year accounts, investment 
performance, acquisitions and disposals and the 
appointment of Directors and Directors’ remuneration.
Membership is determined by the Board and the 
duties of the Board sub-committees are set out in 
the following sections of this report.
All the sub-committees of the Board operate 
within clearly defined terms of reference which 
are reviewed and updated to reflect best practice 
and the UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
South African King III Code of Corporate Governance 
Principles as far as is commercially practicable. The 
terms of reference of the Board and the sub-committees 
are available on request from the Company Secretary 
and are published on the Company’s website at 
www.sirius-real-estate.com.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Robert Sinclair, 
a Non-executive Director, who has up to date 
relevant financial experience. The other members 
are Neil Sachdev, James Peggie, Justin Atkinson 
and Wessel Hamman.
During the year, the Committee met three times. 
Its terms of reference were widened following a 
Board meeting in February 2017 following the move 
to a dual main market listing on 6 March 2017 and 
were updated to comply with the principles contained 
in the South African King III Code of Corporate 
Governance Principles and the September 2014 
edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
It now considers in more detail risk management 
processes in addition to reviewing internal control 
procedures, the interim and full year results and 
external audit plans. Regular reviews of significant 
risks are undertaken at meetings of the Committee 
and its observations are reported to the Board. 
The Group’s system of internal control is designed to 
manage and mitigate rather than eliminate altogether 
the risk of failure to meet business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material financial misstatement or loss.

invited to attend meetings, along with other 
members of management as appropriate.
The Committee considers and approves the 
external audit approach with the external auditors. 
The Committee reviews the independence of the 
external auditors and the procedures in place to 
ensure that their independence is not compromised.
Audit Committee meetings are minuted and copies 
of the minutes are provided to the Directors and the 
external auditors.

to the Board relating to the policy for the ongoing 
education and development of Directors. The Committee 
uses external search consultants or open advertising 
for recruitment purposes as deemed most appropriate. 
When nominating candidates for Non-executive 
Directorships, the Committee takes account of the 
need for diversity and independence.
The Committee keeps under review and evaluates 
the composition of the Board and its Committees 
to maintain the most appropriate balance of diversity, 
skills, knowledge, experience and independence and 
to ensure their continued effectiveness.
Its terms of reference were widened following a Board 
meeting in February 2017 following the move to a 
dual main market listing on 6 March 2017 and were 
updated to comply with the principles contained in the 
South African King III Code of Corporate Governance 
Principles and the September 2014 edition of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has two scheduled 
meetings each year and meets additionally as 
circumstances require.
The Committee met six times during the year. 
James Peggie is the Chairman of the Committee. 
The other members are Neil Sachdev, Wessel Hamman 
and Robert Sinclair.
The Remuneration Committee sets and monitors the 
overall Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors 
and other senior executives. The Committee reviews, 
but does not limit itself to, the following key areas 
and makes recommendations to the Board accordingly:
 » total remuneration (including base pay, 
bonus and incentive arrangements);
 » method of remuneration;
 » service contracts; and
 » terms and conditions and any material changes 
to the standard terms of employment.
The activities, recommendations and approvals of the 
Committee are reported to the next routinely scheduled 
Board meeting. Its terms of reference were widened 
following a Board meeting in February 2017 following 
the move to a dual main market listing on 6 March 2017 
and were updated to comply with the principles 
contained in the South African King III Code of Corporate 
Governance Principles and the September 2014 edition 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council.
Investment Committee
The Chairman of the Investment Committee 
is Neil Sachdev. The Committee was formed on 
17 February 2017 and comprises five Directors, 
Neil Sachdev, Wessel Hamman, Justin Atkinson, 
Alistair Marks and Andrew Coombs. The Committee 
has not yet held its first meeting but will be responsible 
for considering and reviewing the recommendations 
of executive management in relation to acquisitions 
and disposals, capex, projects, and other matters 
involving capital commitments between €200,000 
and €10.0 million.
Any transactions in excess of this and any material changes 
to any Board-approved transaction or commitment 
must be referred to the Board for additional approval.
The activities, recommendations and approvals of the 
Committee are reported to the Board. The Committee’s 
delegated authorities are reviewed annually by the Board.
The Committee has not undertaken its first formal 
meeting as it was only recently formed. Its terms of 
reference were approved following a Board meeting 
in February 2017.
Disclosure Committee
The Disclosure Committee’s role is to oversee the 
Company’s compliance with its obligations (as laid 
down by the UKLA’s Listing Rules, Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules and the Market Abuse Regulation) 
in respect of the disclosure and control of inside 
information directly concerning the Company. 
However, the delegation of responsibilities to the 
Disclosure Committee does not exclude the Board 
from assuming any of the Committee’s responsibilities.

in compliance with its obligations as set out above.
Members of the Committee are appointed by the 
Board and it comprises two Non-executive members. 
The Committee is chaired by the Senior Independent 
Director, James Peggie, and the other member is 
Neil Sachdev.
Its terms of reference were widened following a

Engagement with shareholders
The Board is committed to providing shareholders 
with timely announcements of significant events 
or transactions affecting the Company, including its 
financial performance and any changes to strategy 
as well as material investment commitments and 
realisations. As part of this, the Company’s brokers 
provide regular market feedback to the Board and 
senior management.
In addition, the Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director are available to shareholders to discuss 
governance, strategy or any concern they may have.
The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer 
are responsible for the Company’s interaction with existing 
shareholders, potential new shareholders and analysts. 
To ensure its financial and operational performance 
and strategic objectives are properly communicated, 
the Company operates a dedicated investor relations 
programme. This includes formal events along with 
other meetings outside the financial reporting calendar. 
In April 2017, the Chief Executive Officer, together with 
other members of the Senior Management Team, hosted 
the Company’s first investor day since its move up to 
a main market listing; this focused on risk management, 
value creation and origination of new investments.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Each Director is fully aware of the risks inherent in the 
Company’s business and understands the importance 
of identifying, evaluating and monitoring these risks. 
The Board has adopted procedures and controls that 
enable it to carry out a robust assessment of the risks 
facing the Company, manage these risks within 
acceptable limits and meet all of its legal and 
regulatory obligations.
The Board thoroughly considers the process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing any significant 
risks faced by the Company on an ongoing basis and 
these risks are reported and discussed at Board meetings. 
It ensures that effective controls are in place to mitigate 
these risks and that a satisfactory compliance regime 
exists to ensure all applicable local and international 
laws and regulations are upheld.
For each material risk, the likelihood and consequence 
are identified, management controls and frequency 
of monitoring are confirmed and results are reported 
and discussed at regular Board meetings. For further 
details see Principal risks and uncertainties section 
on pages 31 to 38.

Composition of the Audit Committee
During the year ended 31 March 2017 the 
composition of the Audit Committee changed in 
order to ensure compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the South African King III Code 
of Corporate Governance Principles by which the 
Company is now governed. The Audit Committee 
now comprises four members, Robert Sinclair, who 
was appointed Chairman on 23 September 2017, 
Wessel Hamman, James Peggie and Neil Sachdev, 
who joined the committee on 23 September 2017. 
As a result of these appointments the Audit Committee 
is now in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the South African King III Code of Corporate 
Governance Principles, which recommends that an 
audit committee should comprise of at least three 
independent non-executive directors. In addition 
to this the UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
South African King III Code of Corporate Governance 
Principles requires at least one member of the Audit 
Committee to have recent and relevant financial 
experience. The Board considers that Robert Sinclair 
and Wessel Hamman, both of whom are qualified 
Chartered Accountants, possess the necessary 
experience to satisfy this requirement.
Details of attendance at the Audit Committee meetings 
during the financial year ended 31 March 2017 are set 
out on page 66.
Roles and responsibilities
The Audit Committee’s main role is to assist the 
Board in discharging its responsibilities with regard 
to the financial reporting process, the audit process 
and the system of internal controls of the Company 
and compliance with financial laws and regulations 
by the Company.
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving 
the Annual Report and Interim Report remains with 
the Board; however, the Audit Committee helps to 
ensure the accuracy and integrity of these in particular 
with regards to any significant judgements contained 
within them. The Audit Committee reviews and approves 
the external auditors’ annual audit plan to ensure it is 
consistent with the agreed scope of engagement and 
Audit Committee report
Protecting our shareholders’ interests
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present my first 
Audit Committee report as Chairman 
of the Audit Committee which is also 
the Company’s first report since admission 
to the main markets of both the London 
and Johannesburg stock exchanges in 
March 2017. The Audit Committee’s role 
is to protect the interests of shareholders 
by ensuring a sound control environment 
within the Group, the integrity of published 
financial information and an effective 
audit process.
This report describes the main focus areas of the Audit Committee 
and how it discharged its responsibilities during the financial year 
ended 31 March 2017. It sets out how the Audit Committee has assessed 
internal control, risk management, the Company’s financial statements 
and the effectiveness of the external audit in the year under review. 
The Audit Committee assists 
the Board in discharging its 
responsibilities with regard 
to financial reporting and 
monitors the integrity of 
the financial statements 
of the Company.”

Developments in the year
Prior to listing on the main markets of both the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges in March 2017 the primary focus of the 
Audit Committee was the review of the Company’s financial results and supporting policies and procedures. During the listing process 
the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee were reviewed with new terms of reference being approved in February 2017 that 
included changes in Audit Committee composition, authority and scope of work. As a result, Robert Sinclair replaced Wessel Hamman 
as the chairman of the Audit Committee and Neil Sachdev joined the Audit Committee. The additional areas of focus for the Audit Committee 
now include compliance relating to fraud and bribery, the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the provisions of the 
South African King III Code of Corporate Governance Principles and the additional requirements of the main markets of the stock exchanges 
upon which the Company’s shares are now listed. This includes reviewing and understanding the forecasts used to create the Company’s 
Viability Statement. 
it takes responsibility for all aspects of the external 
auditors’ appointment, performance and independence.
This includes monitoring the extent of non-audit 
related work undertaken by the external auditors. 
In its review of this, the Audit Committee will give 
due consideration to laws and regulations, the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and the South African King III Code of Corporate 
Governance Principles along with the requirements 
of the London and South African stock exchange 
rules. Accordingly the Audit Committee will advise 
the Board on whether, taken as a whole, the Company’s 
financial statements present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment as well as provide 
shareholders with the necessary information to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.
Similarly it is the Board which is ultimately responsible 
for the Group’s internal control environment but 
the responsibility for the Group’s risk management 
methodology and effectiveness of internal controls has 
been delegated to the Audit Committee. The Group’s risk 
management process and system of internal controls 
are designed to manage rather than totally eliminate 
risk and are described in more detail in the principal 
risks and uncertainties section of this Annual Report.
The Audit Committee also reviews the Group’s current 
trading performance and future cash flow forecasts 
in order to consider the going concern and viability 
of the Company. It is then the Audit Committee’s 
responsibility to advise the Board on this topic and 
from this the Group’s viability statement is created.
Activities of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee met on three occasions within the 
year under review and the content of each meeting is 
described as follows:
 » On 18 May 2016, the Audit Committee 
met to discuss the full year results for the year 
ended 31 March 2016. In this meeting, KPMG, the 
Company’s auditors, presented their Audit Committee 
report relating to their audit of the year ended 
31 March 2016 Annual Report (the “Annual Report”). 
The Audit Committee then reviewed the Annual 
Report, the adequacy of disclosures and the 
appropriateness of preparing the Annual Report 
on a going concern basis. It was concluded that the 
Company’s financial position was such that it continued 
to be appropriate for accounts to be prepared on 
a going concern basis. The Audit Committee duly 
approved the Annual Report for the year ended 
31 March 2016 for consideration by the Board.

 » On 23 November 2016, the Audit Committee met 
to review the half year results of the Company for the 
period ending 30 September 2016. The Interim Report 
was reviewed by the Audit Committee and it was 
concluded that the disclosures were appropriate 
and having reviewed the Group’s trading and future 
cash flow forecasts, agreed it was appropriate 
to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis. 
Consequently the Interim Report was approved 
for consideration by the Board.
 » On 22 March 2017, the Audit Committee met 
to consider the auditors’ plan for the year ended 
31 March 2017 audit. In reviewing the audit plan 
the Audit Committee discussed and challenged 
the auditors’ assessment of materiality and risk 
areas that were considered most likely to give rise 
to material error. The 31 March 2017 Annual Report 
was also discussed particularly with regards to the 
extra reports that would be required as it was the 
Company’s first Annual Report as a main market 
listed company. It was agreed to allow more time 
to complete the enhanced Annual Report before 
announcing results to the market. The fees to be 
paid to KPMG for the year ended 31 March 2017 
audit were also discussed and subsequently 
approved by the Audit Committee.
 » On 8 June 2017, the Audit Committee met to 
discuss the full year results for the year ended 
31 March 2017. In this meeting, KPMG, the 
Company’s auditors, presented their Audit Committee 
report relating to their audit of the year ended 
31 March 2017 Annual Report (the “Annual Report”). 
 » On 21 June 2017 the Audit Committee met 
to review the Annual Report for the year ended

the Company’s financial position was such that it 
continued to be appropriate for accounts to be 
prepared on a going concern basis. The Audit 
Committee duly approved the Annual Report for 
the year ended 31 March 2017 for consideration 
by the Board.
A review of the Committee’s terms of reference 
was also undertaken following the move to a dual 
main market listing on 6 March 2017 and were 
updated to comply with the principles contained 
in the South African King III Code of Corporate 
Governance Principles and the September 2014 
edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council.

Internal audit
The decision on whether or not to implement an 
internal audit function is made by the Board and 
this is based on the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee which considers annually a number of 
factors in making its assessment. These include the 
growth and scale of the Company, the diversity and 
complexity of the Company’s activities, the procedures 
and systems in place, the number of employees and 
the risk that issues may arise as well as the cost and 
benefit of implementing such a function.
During the year under review the Audit Committee 
recommended to the Board that a formal internal 
audit function should not be appointed for the 
following reasons: 
 » the Group has in place an internal compliance 
function which reviews and monitors the 
appropriateness of operating procedures 
and ensures and tests compliance with these 
throughout the Group;
 » the routine nature of the Group’s business activities 
and the experience of employees reduce risks 
of material mistakes occurring; and
 » the clear approval process based on authority 
matrices, the high level of accountability from 
regular detailed management reporting and 
assurances gained from the external auditors 
reduce the risk of material misstatement and fraud.
The Audit Committee will continue to review its position 
on the establishment of an internal audit function on 
an annual basis.
Whistleblowing
The Audit Committee has considered arrangements 
by which staff of the Company may, in confidence, 
raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters 
of financial reporting or other matters, which are 
incorporated in its Terms of Reference. It has concluded 
that adequate arrangements are in place for the 
proportionate and independent investigation of such 
matters and, where necessary, for appropriate follow-up 
action to be taken within their organisation. The Audit 
Committee also seeks professional advice on any such 
matters and secures the attendance at its Meetings 
of third parties with relevant experience and expertise 
if it considers this necessary.
Viability statement testing 
The viability statement is based on the current 
trading and latest three year forecasts prepared by 
the Company’s Senior Management Team. A model 
has been created for this which uses a combination of 
existing contractual agreements and future assumptions 
of performance of existing assets and expected 
acquisitions and disposals for which the Group 
currently has the resources. 50

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance
Viability statement testing continued
In order to test the robustness of the forecast, 
sensitivities have been applied to key income and 
expense items including rental income, service charge 
recovery and overhead costs creating three forecasts 
showing the worst, base and best case scenarios.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and agreed the 
assumptions used by management in these forecasts 
and agrees with the conclusion.
Independence and oversight of external audit 
KPMG Channel Islands Limited (“KPMG”) have 
been the auditors of the Company since it was 
listed on AIM in London in April 2007. The Audit 
Committee’s review of the appropriateness of the 
external auditors included assessing their terms of 
engagement, remuneration, independence, qualifications 
and compliance. Based on this review, it decided 
that KPMG met all requirements and their terms 
of engagement were appropriate and they should 
continue as the Company’s auditors for the year
ending 31 March 2017. The Audit Committee will review 
this again in the next financial year, with a formal process 
extended to inviting other firms to make proposals 
regarding the provision of audit services.
The Audit Committee meets the external auditors on 
average three times a year to discuss their remit and 
any issues arising from their audit work.
Non-audit services policy
The total non-audit fees paid to the external auditors, 
KPMG, during the year ended 31 March 2017 were 
€500,000 (31 March 2016: €20,000). The main 
non-audit related fees paid to KPMG in the period 
relate to professional fees associated with the move 
to the main markets of the London and Johannesburg 
stock exchanges. KPMG undertook their standard 
independence procedures in relation to all non-audit 
related services and concluded their independence 
and objectivity was not impaired.

Significant matters considered in relation to the financial statements
Significant matters considered Audit Committee response 
Valuation of investment properties
The carrying value of investment properties is material to 
the Group’s balance sheet. The valuation, which is performed 
half-yearly by Cushman & Wakefield LLP, is based upon 
assumptions including future rental income, anticipated 
maintenance costs and an appropriate discount and exit cap 
rate. There is a risk that the carrying value will differ from its 
net realisable value. 
The fair value of the Group’s investment properties is determined 
by an independent valuer on the basis of a ten year discounted 
cash flow model. 
The Audit Committee considers the Company’s management’s 
assessment of the carrying value of investment property and 
the appropriateness of supporting business plans as well as 
the transactional evidence available on the market.
The Audit Committee also considers offers that have been received 
by the Group on properties that have been marketed for sale as 
well as the levels at which assets have been disposed.
The Directors have made discretionary impairments of non-core 
assets in the past when strong evidence exists to support an 
adjustment. This evidence includes external offers from potential 
buyers, expected future prospects and cash flows of the assets 
based on activity compared to assumptions used by valuers, 
market conditions and transactional evidence in the specific 
locations that the assets are located.
The external auditors reports to the Audit Committee at 
the half year on their review and the year end in relation 
to the audit on their results and findings of their assessment 
of Cushman & Wakefield’s valuation judgements.

Annual Report on Remuneration
Business performance and incentive 
out-turn for 2017
As described in the strategic report the Company 
continues to perform strongly. For the year under 
review profit before tax increased to €76.4 million 
(2016: €57.1 million) driven by a combination of organic 
and acquisitive growth. The Board has declared a final 
dividend of 1.53c per share representing a 17.8% 
increase on the same period the previous year. 
The average cost of debt reduced in the period to 
1.99% (2016: 3.0%). Total debt at 31 March 2017 
was €348.6 million (31 March 2016: €299.0 million) 
and the Group’s gross loan to value ratio reduced 
to 42.3% (31 March 2016: 42.8%) whilst the 
Group’s net loan to value ratio reduced to 38.0% 
(31 March 2017: 41.5%). Total shareholder return, 
based on an Adjusted NAV per share was 15.3% 
in the period (31 March 2016: 16.0%) and market 
capitalisation increased by €194.6 million or 58.8% 
to €525.5 million* as at 31 March 2017.
*  Market capitalisation calculated using number of shares 
in issue, closing share price on the London Stock Exchange 
and conversion rate of GBP:EUR of 0.8686.
As a consequence of this performance and strong 
delivery around both financial, strategic and personal 
targets, the annual bonus earned by the Executive 
Directors was 83% and 89% of base salary for 
Andrew Coombs and Alistair Marks respectively 
and details are provided on page 57. Base salary was 
the salary at the start of the financial year and is the 
salary used to calculate the bonus awards. 35% of 
the bonus relating to the Company’s pre-tax profit 
performance is deferred for one year and payment 
of this deferred amount is dependent on an Adjusted 
FFO condition being achieved for the year ending 
31 March 2018. The amounts deferred for one 
year equate to 11% and 14% of base salary for 
Andrew Coombs and Alistair Marks respectively. 
The deferral structure for future bonuses has been 
changed and further detail is provided below and 
in the policy table.
Introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present the Directors’ remuneration 
report (the “Report”) for the year ended 
31 March 2017.
As a Guernsey-incorporated company we 
are not subject to the UK regulations regarding 
the presentation of the remuneration report 
and the disclosures to be made by UK-quoted 
companies, but the Committee has sought to apply 
the requirements on a voluntary basis in order to 
reflect evolving best practice and to demonstrate our 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Report is presented in two main 
sections, the annual report on remuneration, which provides details 
on the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 31 March 2017 
and includes a forward-looking statement on how the remuneration 
policy will be applied in the year ending 31 March 2018, and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the “Remuneration Policy”), which 
sets out the forward-looking Remuneration Policy for Directors.
This has been an important year for the Committee. We have seen the 
arrival of the Company’s new Chairman, Neil Sachdev; various changes 
to the Board Committees; the appointment of me as Senior Independent 
Director; and the arrival of Justin Atkinson as a Non-executive Director. 
Sirius has also been one of the fastest growing listed real estate companies 
over the last few years, which culminated most significantly in the admission 
of the Company’s shares to the main markets of both the London 
and Johannesburg stock exchanges on 6 March 2017 (“Admission”). 
These changes have led to some significant reviews of the Company’s 
remuneration practices and I would like to thank the Committee for 
all the extra work that this has required this year.

Business performance and incentive 
out-turn for 2017 continued
No awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) 
were made during the course of the year to the 
Executive Directors, as under that plan awards are 
made every three years and the current three year 
LTIP award cycle ends on 31 March 2018.
During the year, the Executive Directors acquired 
shares which led to them receiving awards under 
the Matching Share Plan (“MSP”). The MSP entitled 
participants to receive one share for every share 
purchased during the financial year, subject to a 
continued employment condition and the satisfaction 
of a profit before tax related performance condition 
as at the year end. Further details are provided 
on pages 58 and 59. The MSP was terminated on 
31 March 2017, as the Committee does not believe 
it to be in line with market practice relating to 
remuneration for main board-listed companies, 
in particular in relation to the performance hurdles 
and short-term nature of the scheme.
Rewards for the financial year ending 
31 March 2018
In conjunction with the move to the main markets 
and the decision to terminate the MSP, the Committee 
undertook a review of the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors, supported by Deloitte LLP. 
Changes to the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors in terms of salary, benefits and pension 
were approved by the Committee and details are 
provided on page 57.
Shareholders will note that the LTIP is not included in 
the policy table as no further awards are to be made to 
the Executive Directors under this plan. The Committee 
will be reviewing long-term incentives during the 
current year and will be seeking shareholder approval 
for a new long-term plan at the 2018 AGM. This will 
need to be included in the Remuneration Policy, and 
therefore an advisory vote for a new policy will also 
be sought at the 2018 AGM.

Basic salary
To provide a competitive base 
salary for the market in which 
the Group operates to attract 
and retain Executive Directors 
of a suitable calibre.
Usually reviewed annually taking account of:
 » Group performance; 
 » role, experience and individual performance;
 » competitive salary levels and market 
forces; and
 » pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Increases will normally be in line with the 
range of salary increases awarded (in percentage 
terms) to other Group employees. Increases 
above this level may be awarded to take account 
of individual circumstances, such as:
 » promotion;
 » change in scope or increase 
in responsibilities;
 » an individual’s development or performance 
in role; and
 » a change in the size or complexity 
of the business.
Benefits
To provide market competitive 
benefits as part of the total 
remuneration package.
Executive Directors currently receive private 
medical insurance, income insurance and death 
in service benefits.
Other benefits may be provided based 
on individual circumstances, for example, 
relocation or travel expenses or the provision 
of a company car or cash allowance.
Whilst the Committee has not set a maximum 
level of benefits that Executive Directors may 
receive, the value of benefits is set at a level 
which the Committee considers appropriate, 
taking into account market practice and 
individual circumstances.
Retirement benefits
To provide an appropriate 
level of retirement benefit (or 
cash allowance equivalent).
Executive Directors are provided with a 
contribution to a self-invested pension plan or 
a cash allowance instead of contributions to a 
pension plan.
The maximum contribution level is set at 15% 
of salary.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy report
The following section sets out our Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the “policy”). As set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration, 
it is intended that the policy will be reviewed during the course of the financial year ending 31 March 2018 as a result of the Company’s 
admission on 6 March 2017 to the main markets of both the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges. This review will include the 
terms of a new Long Term Incentive Plan which the Board intends to develop with the Executive team for the start of the 2018–19 
financial year.
The aim of the policy is to align the interests of Executive Directors with the Group’s strategic vision and the long-term creation of 
shareholder value. The policy is intended to remunerate our Executive Directors competitively and appropriately for effective delivery 
of this and allows them to share in this success and the value delivered to shareholders. 
Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy

Annual bonus
Rewards performance against 
targets which support the 
strategic direction and financial 
performance of the Group.
Deferral provides a retention 
element through share 
ownership and direct alignment 
to shareholders’ interests.
Awards are based on performance (typically 
measured over one year). Pay-out levels are 
normally determined by the Committee after 
the year end. 
The Committee has discretion to amend 
pay-outs should any formulaic output not 
reflect their assessment of performance.
A proportion (normally up to 65%) of any bonus 
is paid in cash with the balance normally paid 
in the form of shares, half of which are usually 
deferred for one year and half for two years.
Awards may include dividend equivalents 
earned over the deferral period, which may 
be delivered in cash or in additional shares and 
which may assume the reinvestment of dividends 
on such basis as the Committee determines.
The annual bonus opportunity is up to a 
maximum of 100% of base salary.
Targets are set annually and aligned with key 
financial, strategic and/or individual targets 
with the weightings between these measures 
determined by the Committee each year 
considering the Group’s priorities at the time. 
At least 50% of the bonus will be based on 
profit related measures.
For financial measures, no financial element 
is earned for threshold performance rising 
to 100% of the maximum for the financial 
element for maximum performance. 
Vesting of the bonus in respect of strategic 
measures or individual objectives will be between 
0% and 100% based on the Committee’s 
assessment of the extent to which the 
relevant metric or objective has been met.
Legacy plans
The Company has two legacy share plans in place 
under which Executive Directors have an interest in 
vested and unvested shares. These are the Matching 
Share Plan (“MSP”) and the Long Term Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”). Awards have been granted under the MSP in 
relation to the shares acquired by the Executive Directors 
in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 and no 
further awards will be made after this. No further grants 
will be made under the LTIP to the Executive Directors.
The Committee retains discretion to make any 
remuneration payment or payment for loss of 
office outside the policy in this report:
 » where the terms of the payment were agreed before 
the policy came into effect (including the satisfaction 
of awards granted under the LTIP and the MSP); and
 » where the terms of the payment were agreed at a 
time when the relevant individual was not a Director 
of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, 
the payment was not in consideration of the 
individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes, “payment” includes the satisfaction 
of awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to 
an award over shares, the terms of the payment are 
agreed at the time the award is granted.
Information supporting the policy table
Explanation of performance measures chosen
Performance measures for the annual bonus 
and long-term incentive are selected that reflect 
the Group’s strategy. Performance targets are set 
each year by the Committee, taking into account 
a number of different factors.
For FY17/18, the annual bonus will be subject to 
appropriately stretching performance conditions 
based on adjusted Funds from Operations (“FFO”) 
(as regards 60% of the award), strategic objectives 
(as regards 20% of the award) and personal objectives 
(as regards 20% of the award). The Committee considers 
that adjusted FFO is the primary measure of short-term 
performance and seeks to balance this with other 
strategic and personal targets which reflect the 
contribution and focus of the Executive Directors.
The Committee retains the discretion to adjust or 
set different performance measures or targets where 
it considers it appropriate to do so (for example, to 
reflect a change in strategy, a material acquisition 
and/or a divestment of a Group business or change in 
prevailing market conditions and to assess performance 
on a fair and consistent basis from year to year). 
Awards and options may be adjusted in the event 
of a variation of share capital in accordance with 
the rules of the LTIP.

Approach to 
setting fees
 » The fees of the Non-executive Directors are agreed by the Chairman and CEO and the fees for the Chairman 
are determined by the Board as a whole.
 » Fees are set taking into account the level of responsibility, relevant experience and specialist knowledge 
of each Non-executive Director and fees at companies of a similar size and complexity.
Basis of fees » Non-executive Directors are paid a basic fee for membership of the Board with additional fees being paid for 
Chairmanship of Board Committees.
 » Additional fees may also be paid for other Board responsibilities or roles, such as the Senior Independent Director.
 » Fees are normally paid in cash.
Other » Non-executive Directors may be eligible to receive reasonable reimbursements such as travel and other expenses.
 » Neither the Chairman nor any of the Non-executive Directors are eligible to participate in any of the Group’s 
incentive arrangements.
Recovery provisions
The Committee has the right to reduce, cancel or impose 
further restrictions on unvested deferred bonus shares 
in certain circumstances (including a material error or 
misstatement of the financial results, gross misconduct 
or a material failure of risk management).
Shareholding guidelines
To promote further alignment to shareholders’ interests 
and share ownership, Andrew Coombs and Alistair Marks 
are subject to a minimum shareholding requirement 
of 1,400,000 and 950,000 shares respectively.
This limit is kept under review by the Committee. 
Until this guideline is met Executive Directors will be 
required to retain half of any shares which vest under 
the deferred bonus or LTIP (after sales to cover tax).
Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Policy for the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors is to pay fees necessary to 
attract an individual of the calibre required, taking 
into consideration the size and complexity of the 
business and the time commitment of the role, 
without paying more than is necessary. Details are 
set out in the table below:
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The policy aims to facilitate the appointment of 
individuals of sufficient calibre to lead the business 
and execute the strategy effectively for the benefit of 
shareholders. When appointing a new Executive Director 
the Committee seeks to ensure that arrangements are 
in the best interests of the Company and not to pay 
more than is appropriate. The Committee will take 
into consideration relevant factors, which may include 
the calibre of the individual, their existing remuneration 
package, and their specific circumstances, including 
the jurisdiction from which they are recruited.
The Committee will typically seek to align the 
remuneration package with the Group’s Remuneration 
Policy. The Committee may make payments or awards to 
recognise or “buy out” remuneration packages forfeited 
on leaving a previous employer. The Committee’s 
intention is that such awards would be made on a 
“like-for-like” basis to those forfeited. The discretion 
will not be used to make non-performance related 
incentive payments (for example, a “golden hello”).
Recognising that any new Executive Director 
appointed from outside the business would not 
participate in the LTIP or any other existing long-term 
incentive arrangement, an additional annual bonus 
opportunity may be offered until such time as a new 
long-term incentive arrangement is put in place in 
which that new Executive Director can participate. 
Accordingly taking this and the maximum annual 
bonus in the policy table into account, the overall 
variable pay maximum which could form part of the 
recruitment arrangement is 250% of salary.
The remuneration package for a newly appointed 
Chairman or Non-executive Director will normally be 
in line with the structure set out in the Non-executive 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy.

Payments for loss of office
Payments for loss of office will be in line with the 
provisions of the Executive Directors’ service contracts 
and the rules of the share plans. The Company retains 
the right to terminate each Executive Director’s service 
agreement by making a payment in lieu of some or all 
of the notice period. Any such payment would consist 
of base salary but not benefits in respect of the unexpired 
notice period for termination. Post-termination 
restrictive covenants are in place for six months after 
notice of termination has been given, and under their 
service agreements, the Executive Directors are entitled 
to a payment of 100% of salary for observing these 
restrictions. This is a legacy arrangement in their 
service contracts and will not be replicated for 
future appointments.
Any payment to an Executive Director on termination 
in respect of annual bonus will be determined by the 
Committee taking into account the circumstances of 
the termination. Any payment will be pro-rated to 
reflect the proportion of the bonus year worked and 
subject to performance achieved. The Committee 
retains discretion to pay the whole of the bonus for 
the year of departure and/or the previous year in cash.
Any deferred amounts from bonus earned in previous 
years will normally be retained unless the Executive 
Director resigns or is summarily dismissed. Payments 
will ordinarily only be made at the usual time (although 
the Committee retains discretion to make payments 
early in appropriate circumstances). The Committee 
retains discretion to pay the whole of the bonus for 
the year of departure and/or the previous year in cash. 
In appropriate circumstances, payments may also 
be made in respect of accrued holiday, outplacement, 
legal fees and other benefits. The Committee reserves 
the right to make additional payments where such 
payments are made in good faith in discharge of an 
existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for 
breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement 
or compromise or any claim arising in connection with 
the termination of Director’s office or employment. 
Where the Committee retains discretion it will be 
used to provide flexibility in certain situations, taking 
into account the particular circumstances of the 
Director’s departure and performance.
On termination of employment, entitlements under 
the legacy LTIP and MSP arrangements in respect of 
both vested and unvested awards will be dealt with in 
accordance with the terms of those plans and the awards. 
There is no entitlement to any compensation in 
the event of Non-Executive Directors’ contracts 
not being renewed or being terminated without 
notice in accordance with their terms.
Consultation with shareholders
The Committee will consider shareholder feedback 
received on remuneration matters including issues 
raised at the AGM as well as any additional comments 
received during any other meeting with shareholders. 
The Committee will seek to engage directly with 
major shareholders and their representative bodies 
should any material changes be made to the policy.
Statement of consideration of employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee considers the pay and employment 
conditions of Group employees generally and takes 
these into account when determining the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors.
External appointments
None of the Executive Directors currently have an 
external appointment. The Directors recognise that 
external appointments can broaden an individual’s 
skills and experience. If an Executive Director wishes 
to take up an external appointment, he or she must 
first seek approval from the Chairman.
Illustrations of application 
of Remuneration Policy
The Company is voluntarily electing to adopt a 
Remuneration Policy. It would usually also include the 
illustration of the application of Remuneration Policy. 
However, as there is no current long-term incentive 
plan in the policy the Committee considers that this 
does not provide a useful illustration and will therefore 
seek to include it next year when a new long-term 
plan has been developed.

Role and responsibilities
The role of the Nomination Committee is to 
consider and make recommendations to the Board 
on its composition so as to maintain an appropriate 
balance of skills and knowledge, relevant experience, 
independence and diversity, including gender, and to 
ensure adequate succession planning for the Board.
Before the appointment of any new Director is 
recommended to the Board, the description of the role 
and the required capabilities are established by the 
Committee for presentation to the Board. Whilst the 
Nomination Committee is committed to selecting the 
best person for the role of Director, the Committee 
alongside the Board aims to promote and recognise 
the importance of diversity.
The Chairman of the Nomination Committee 
is primarily responsible for interviewing suitable 
candidates and a recommendation is then made 
to the Board for final approval.
Activities of the Nomination Committee
To discharge its duties the members of the 
Nomination Committee met on three occasions 
during the year under review, on 20 June 2016, 
23 September 2016 and 17 February 2017 to consider 
the diversity, composition and balance of the Board, 
Board succession planning and the selection of 
suitable candidates to be recommended to the Board 
for appointment. Following these meetings, two 
appointments were recommended to the Board for 
approval, namely the appointment of Neil Sachdev 
and Justin Atkinson as independent Non-executive 
Directors, both bringing additional skills and 
experience to the Board to support future growth 
and the strategic aims of the Company.
The Committee considers 
and makes recommendations 
to the Board on its composition 
so as to maintain an appropriate 
balance of skills and knowledge, 
relevant experience, 
independence and diversity.”
Dear shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present the Directors’ nomination 
report for the year ended 31 March 2017.
Composition of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises four 
members: Neil Sachdev who was appointed 
Chairman on 23 September 2016, taking over 
the role from Robert Sinclair, who remains a 
member, alongside Wessel Hamman and 
James Peggie. Andrew Coombs stepped down 
from the Committee on 21 November 2016. 
The Nomination Committee is now complied 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
the South African King III Code of Corporate Governance Principles 
which recommends that the majority of the members of a nomination 
committee should be independent non-executive directors.
The Nomination Committee assists the Board in reviewing the 
structure, size, composition, diversity and performance of the Board. 
It is also responsible nominating new Directors to become part of the 
Board, as appropriate.
Details of attendance at the Nomination Committee meetings during 
the financial year ended 31 March 2017 are set out on page 66.

Activities of the Nomination Committee 
continued
The Board has employed the executive search 
firm The Inzito Partnership to assist in the search 
for Non-executive Directors, which it concludes 
is an effective way to find suitable candidates.
On appointment each Non-executive Director receives 
a letter of appointment, setting out, among other things, 
their role and duties and that they are expected to 
allocate sufficient time to perform their duties effectively, 
making themselves available for all regular and ad hoc 
meetings, as well as providing for them to sit on 
Committees of the Board as required during their tenure.
In accordance with the Articles of Association of the 
Company, at each general meeting (a) any Director 
who was elected or last re-elected as a Director at 
or before the AGM held in the third calendar year 
before the current year shall retire by rotation, and (b) 
such further Directors (if any) shall retire by rotation 
as would bring the number retiring by rotation up to 
one-third of the number of Directors in office at that 
date. The current practice of the Board is to offer 
themselves up for re-election annually.
In addition the Nomination Committee reviewed 
and agreed the 2016 Board evaluation process and 
provided feedback on that process to the Board for 
consideration at the 23 September 2016 meeting. 
The evaluation was carried out on the performance 
of the Board, the Committees and individual Directors.
A review of the Committee’s terms of reference 
was also undertaken following the move to a dual 
main market listing on 6 March 2017 and they were 
updated to comply with the principles contained 
in the South African King III Code of Corporate 
Governance Principles and the September 2014 
edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council.

Developments in the year
Prior to listing on the main markets of both the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges in March 2017 the primary focus of the 
Nomination Committee was the review of Board composition and its supporting policies and procedures. During the listing process the 
role and responsibilities of the Nomination Committee were reviewed with new terms of reference being approved in February 2017 that 
included changes in Committee composition, authority and scope of work. As a result, Neil Sachdev joined and replaced Robert Sinclair 
as the Chairman of the Nomination Committee and Andrew Coombs left the Committee. The additional areas of focus for the 
Nomination Committee now include the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the South African King III Code 
of Corporate Governance Principles.

which should be read in conjunction with this report.
The Directors have complied with the provisions

The Directors submit their report together with the 
Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, consolidated statement of financial position, 
consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated 
statement of cash flows and related notes for the 
financial year ended 31 March 2017, which have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union (“EU”) and in accordance with any 
relevant enactment for the time being in force, and 
are in agreement with accounting records, which have 
been properly kept in accordance with Section 238 
of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008.
Business of the Group
Sirius Real Estate Limited is the Group’s holding 
company. The principal activity of its operating 
subsidiaries is the investment in, and development 
of, commercial property to provide conventional 
and flexible workspace in Germany.
Results for the year
These results are set out in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income on page 71.
The Group’s profit after tax attributable to the equity 
holders of the Company for the year was €66.9 million 
(2016: €54.7 million). The Group has continued its 
policy to pay out 65% of its FFO* and has paid a 
final dividend of 1.30c per share for the year ended 
31 March 2016 on 15 July 2016 and an interim

1.53c per share for the second half of the year 
ended 31 March 2017. The final dividend will be 
paid on 18 August 2017, with the ex-dividend 
dates being 12 July 2017 for shareholders on the 
South African register and 13 July 2017 for shareholders 
on the UK register. It is intended that dividends will 
continue to be paid on a semi-annual basis and 
offered to shareholders in cash or scrip form.
*  Adjusted profit before tax adjusted for depreciation, 
amortisation of financing fees and current tax  
receivable/incurred.
Going Concern and Viability Statement
The Directors have examined significant areas of possible 
financial risk and have reviewed cash flow forecasts 
and compliance with the debt covenants, in particular 
the loan to value covenant and interest cover ratio.
They have not identified any material uncertainties which 
would cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern for a period of not less 
than twelve months from the date of the approval of 
the financial statements. The Directors have satisfied 
themselves that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. After due consideration, the Board believes it 
is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
The Viability Statement can be found on page 38. 
The Group’s activities, strategy and performance are 
explained in the strategic report from page 2. Further 
details of the financial performance and financial 
position of the Group are provided in the financial 
statements on pages 71 to 104.

investment properties for lease incentive accounting 
and Directors’ write-downs on non-core assets, the value 
of investment properties is shown as €727.3 million 
(2016: €687.5 million) in the consolidated statement 
of financial position.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
Directors’ report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law, they have elected to prepare the financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law. 
The financial statements are required by law to give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 » select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 » make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 » state whether applicable accounting standards 
have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
 » prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records which disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets 
of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities.
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
 » the financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Group and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole and comply with 
the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008;
 » the strategic report on pages 2 to 38 and 
governance report on pages 40 to 66 include a 
fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Group 
and the undertaking included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties it faces; and
 » the Annual Report and consolidated financial 
Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

Corporate governance
The Board has resolved that the disclosures 
to be made in the Annual Report regarding the 
operation of the Board and its sub-committees 
should comply with the requirements of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), the 
Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008, the South African 
King III Code of Corporate Governance Principles 
and best practice generally following the move to 
the premium listing segment of the Financial Conduct 
Authority (“FCA”) and to trading on the London 
Stock Exchange’s Main Market of listed securities.
The Board of Directors
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The risk management process and system of internal 
control are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s objectives.
Any such system of internal control can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The Board believes it 
has an appropriate balance of skills and experience.
Board meetings follow a formal agenda of matters 
reserved for decision and approval by the Board and 
also address any special business. Matters reserved 
for the Board include the review of strategy, the 
review and monitoring of internal controls and risk 
management processes, the approval of significant 
investments and disposals, the approval of budgets, 
and the regular review of current trading and the 
financial position of the Group. 
The Board receives regular reports on current trading 
and the financial position and forecasts of the Group prior 
to its meetings. In addition, the Board receives relevant 
information on business, corporate and strategic issues.
The Company, at the start of each Board meeting, 
as a routine item requests that each Director declare 
any interests that might conflict with the agenda 
items under discussion. Directors may also notify the 
Company, via the Company Secretary, at any time, 
of any potential or future conflicts that may arise. 
Any such notifications are reviewed at the next Board 
meeting and, if considered appropriate, authorised. 
Directors do not participate in the discussion or vote 
regarding their own conflicts of interest.
All Directors may take independent professional advice 
at the Group’s expense in the furtherance of their duties 
and have full access to the Company Secretary.
Upon appointment, Non-executive Directors undertake 
an induction process to familiarise themselves with the 
Group’s activities, policies and key issues. During their 
appointment they are expected to dedicate adequate 
time to carry out their role effectively and to challenge 
management in a constructive way.
The Chairman meets regularly with the other 
Non-executive Directors to discuss the performance 
of the Board and the Board sub-committees. The 
performance of Executive Directors is measured against 
predetermined objectives that are agreed with each 
Executive Director at the start of the financial year.
The Chairman has no executive responsibilities but leads 
and sets the agenda for the Board. The Chairman also 
acts as an interface between the Executive Directors 
and the Non-executive Directors.

Auditors and disclosure of information 
to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval 
of the financial statements confirm that, so far as they 
are each aware:
 » there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Group’s auditors are unaware; and
 » each Director has taken all the steps that he ought 
to have taken as a Director to make himself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
KPMG Channel Islands Limited have indicated their 
willingness to continue in office as auditors and a 
resolution proposing their reappointment will be

Company website
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the group financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the group financial statements (“the financial statements”) of Sirius Real Estate Limited (“the Company” and together 
with its subsidiaries “the group”) for the year ended 31 March 2017 which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of cash flows 
and the related notes. In our opinion the financial statements:
 » give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of its profit for the year then ended;
 » have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union; and
 » comply with the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008.
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The risks of material misstatement detailed in this section of this report are those risks that we have deemed, in our professional 
judgement, to have had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in our audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team. Our audit procedures relating to these risks were designed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of these risks, and we do not 
express an opinion on these individual risks.
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on 
our audit, were as follows:
Our audit procedures included but were not limited to: 
Evaluating the external property valuer
Cushman and Wakefield prepared the valuation report used by group. We assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of Cushman and Wakefield. 
We also assessed the independence of Cushman and Wakefield by considering the scope of their work and the terms of their engagement with 
Sirius Real Estate Limited.
Evaluating unobservable inputs
We critically assessed the valuation report prepared by the external property valuer by evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies 
and assumptions used, including undertaking discussions on key findings with the external valuer and challenging the unobservable inputs used, with 
the assistance of our own real estate specialist.
Agreeing observable inputs used in the valuations
We verified the accuracy of the underlying lease and occupancy data used by Cushman and Wakefield by agreeing the data back to the group’s accounting records.
Evaluating controls
We evaluated the design and implementation of the control over the valuation of investment properties.
Consideration of accounting policies
We also considered the group’s investment property valuation policies and their application as described in the notes to the group financial statements for 
compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union in addition to the adequacy of disclosures in the notes to 
the group financial statements in relation to the fair value of the investment properties.
Our response
VALUATION OF INVESTMENT PROPERTIES 
 » €727.3 million; 2016: €687.5 million.
 » Refer to page 50 (Audit Committee Report), page 77 (accounting 
policy) and pages 88 and 89 (financial disclosures).
Valuation
The group holds investment properties which consist primarily of 
business retail parks located in Germany. The value of the investment 
properties has been arrived at on the basis of a valuation carried out 
by Cushman and Wakefield. Investment properties account for 81% 
of total assets at 31 March 2017 (2016: 95% of total Assets).
Determination of fair value of investment properties is considered a significant 
audit risk due to the magnitude of the balance and the subjective nature 
of the valuation which involves significant judgement and estimates.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit continued
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the financial statements as a whole was set at €5.9m, determined with reference to a benchmark of group Gross 
Assets of €893m, of which it represents 0.7% (2016: 0.7%).
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding €0.29m, in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Our assessment of materiality has informed our identification of significant risks of material misstatement and the associated audit 
procedures performed in those areas as detailed above.
The Group team performed the audit of the Group as if it was a single aggregated set of financial information. The audit was performed 
using the materiality level set out above and covered 100% of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax, total Group assets, and 
total Group liabilities.
Whilst the audit process is designed to provide reasonable assurance of identifying material misstatements or omissions it is not 
guaranteed to do so. Rather we plan the audit to determine the extent of testing needed to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements does not exceed materiality for the financial statements 
as a whole. This testing requires us to conduct significant depth of work on a broad range of assets, liabilities, income and expense 
as well as devoting significant time of the most experienced members of the audit team, in particular the Responsible Individual, 
to subjective areas of the accounting and reporting process.
The Group team performed the audit of the Group as if it was a single aggregated set of financial information. The audit was performed 
using the materiality level set out above and covered 100% of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax, and total Group assets.
4. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 » the Directors’ viability statement on page 38, concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the Directors’ 
assessment and expectations of the group’s continuing in operation over the 3 years to March 2020; or
 » the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting.
5. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we 
acquired during our audit, we have identified other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either 
that knowledge or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
 » we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ statement that 
they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; or
 » the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee.
Under the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 » the Company has not kept proper accounting records; or
 » the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records; or
 » we have not received all the information and explanations, which to the best of our knowledge and beliefs are necessary for the 
purposes of our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 42 relating to the 
company’s compliance with the eleven provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.

are publicly traded on the main markets of the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”) (primary listing) and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange 
(“JSE”) (secondary listing).
The consolidated financial information of the Company comprises that of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as 
the “Group”) for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
The principal activity of the Group is the investment in, and development of, commercial property to provide conventional and flexible 
workspace in Germany.
2. Significant accounting policies 
(a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for investment properties, investment 
properties held for sale and derivative financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial 
information is presented in euros and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (€000) except where otherwise indicated.
As at the reporting date, the Company has elected to present consolidated financial statements in a manner which makes them more 
comparable with similar businesses. As a result, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 March 2016 
has been re-presented. The impact on total comprehensive income for the comparative period is €nil as shown in the table below:

(b) Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, 
and in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the EU (“Adopted IFRS”) and the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008. The consolidated 
financial statements give a true and fair view and are in compliance with the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008. 
(c) Going concern
Having reviewed the Group’s current trading and cash flow forecasts, together with sensitivities and mitigating factors and the available 
facilities, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Board continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the historical financial information.

(d) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information comprises the financial information of the Group as at 31 March 2017. The financial 
information of the subsidiaries is prepared for the same reporting period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group balances and transactions and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue 
to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group and are presented separately in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, separately 
from the Company’s shareholders’ equity.
(e) Acquisitions
Property acquisitions that are not accounted for as business combinations under IFRS 3 are dealt with as acquisitions of property assets.
(f) Foreign currency translation
The consolidated financial information is presented in euros, which is the functional and presentational currency of all members 
of the Group.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the 
exchange rate ruling at the statement of financial position date. All differences are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
(g) Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. In particular:
Rental income
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the benefit derived from the leased asset is diminished.
Fixed or determinable rental increases, which can take the form of actual amounts or agreed percentages, are recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the term of material leases only. If the increases are related to a price index to cover inflationary cost increases 
then the policy is not to spread the amount but to recognise them when the increase takes place.
The value of rent free periods and all similar lease incentives is spread on a straight-line basis over the term of material leases only. 
Where there is a reasonable expectation that the tenant will exercise break options, the value of rent free periods and all similar lease 
incentives is booked up to the break date. 
Interest income
Interest income is recognised as it accrues (using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument).
Service charges
Service charge income receivable is not treated as revenue; rather, it is set off against the direct costs to which such income relates.
(h) Leases
Group as lessor
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
(i) Income tax
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the reporting date at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to 
the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted 
by the reporting date.
Certain subsidiaries may be subject to foreign taxes in respect of foreign sources of income. Sirius Real Estate Limited is UK resident 
for tax purposes. 77

2. Significant accounting policies continued
(i) Income tax continued
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the consolidated financial statements, with the following exceptions:
 » where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
 » in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and 
 » deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is foreseeable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
year when the related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
(j) Sales tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:
 » where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case 
the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and 
 » receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables 
in the statement of financial position.
(k) Investment properties
Investment properties are properties owned by the Group which are held either for long-term rental income or for capital 
appreciation or both.
Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs when ownership of the property is transferred. 
Where recognition criteria are met the carrying amount includes subsequent costs to add to or replace part of an investment 
property. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at fair value, which reflects market conditions at 
the reporting date.
Investment properties are derecognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are transferred to a third party.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in profit or loss of the statement 
of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The fair value of the Group’s investment properties at 31 March 2017 has been arrived at on the basis of a valuation carried out at 
that date by Cushman & Wakefield LLP (2016: Cushman & Wakefield LLP), an independent valuer. The valuations are in accordance 
with standards complying with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors’ (“RICS’s”) approval and the conceptual framework that has 
been settled by the International Valuation Standards Committee.
The valuation is based upon assumptions including future rental income, anticipated non-recoverable and maintenance costs, expected 
capital expenditure and an appropriate discount rate. The properties are valued on the basis of a ten year discounted cash flow model 
supported by comparable evidence. The discounted cash flow calculation is a valuation of rental income considering non-recoverable 
costs and applying a discount rate for the current income risk over a ten year period. After ten years, a determining residual value 
(exit scenario) is calculated. A capitalisation rate is applied to the more uncertain future income, discounted to present value.
Directors can make discretionary impairments of non-core assets when strong evidence exists to support an adjustment. In such 
circumstances the Audit Committee performs a review and satisfies itself the impairment can be fully substantiated and appropriately 
supported before a write-down is recognised in the Company’s books and records.
(l) Disposals of investment property
Investment property disposals are recognised in the financial information on the date of completion. Profit or loss arising on disposal of 
investment properties is calculated by reference to the most recent carrying value of the asset adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure. 78

2. Significant accounting policies continued
(m) Investment properties held for sale
Investment properties held for sale are separately disclosed at the asset’s fair value as determined by the notarised sales price. 
Expected selling costs are accrued within administrative expenses. In order for an investment property held for sale to be recognised, 
the following conditions must be met:
 » the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and location;
 » the asset is being actively marketed;
 » the asset’s sale is expected to be completed within twelve months of classification as held for sale;
 » there must be no expectation that the plan for selling the asset will be withdrawn or changed significantly; and
 » the successful sale of the asset must be highly probable.
(n) Plant and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation
Where parts of an item of plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part 
of an item of the fixed assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Plant and equipment four to ten years
Fixtures and fittings  four years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.
(o) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of the purchase consideration over the Group’s interest in the fair 
value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not 
amortised but is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when there is an indication that the business to which the goodwill 
applies may be impaired.
(p) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less an allowance for impairment.
(q) Treasury Shares
Own equity instruments which are reacquired (“Treasury Shares”) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s equity instruments.
(r) Share-based payments
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number 
of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
(s) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant 
risk of change in value. 79

2. Significant accounting policies continued
(t) Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
(u) Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
rate method.
(v) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(w) Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the consolidated financial information in the 
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s Board. The final dividend relating to the year ended 31 March 2017 
will be approved and recognised in the financial year ended 31 March 2018.
(x) Impairment excluding investment properties
(i) Financial assets
A financial asset (excluding financial assets at fair value through profit and loss) is assessed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates 
that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. Objective evidence of impairment 
includes observable data that comes to the attention of the Group about one or more of the following loss events:
 » significant financial difficulty of the debtor;
 » excessive or persistent debtor ageing;
 » a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
 » it becomes probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying 
amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed 
collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss of the statement of comprehensive income. 
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss 
was recognised. For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the reversal is recognised in profit or loss of the statement 
of comprehensive income.
(ii) Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than investment property and deferred tax assets, are reviewed 
at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”).
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss of the statement of comprehensive income. Impairment losses recognised in profit 
or loss of respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units 
and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (or group of units) on a pro rata basis. 80

2. Significant accounting policies continued
(y) Compound financial instruments
Compound financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible notes denominated in euros that can be converted 
to share capital at the option of the holder, when the number of shares to be issued is fixed.
The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does 
not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is recognised initially at the difference between the fair value of the 
compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs 
are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not remeasured subsequent to initial recognition.
Interest related to the financial liability is recognised in profit or loss. On conversion, the financial liability is reclassified to equity 
and no gain or loss is recognised.
(z) Standards effective in the period
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except that the following new standard has 
been adopted in the current period:
 » Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012–2014 Cycle.
The adoption of this has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in the Group financial information.
(aa) Standards and interpretations in issue and not yet effective
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – In November 2009 and October 2010, the IASB issued IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which represents 
part of a project to replace IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the 
classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: 
those measured at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification 
depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the 
fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other 
comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The IASB currently has an 
active project to make limited amendments to the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9 and to add new requirements 
to address the impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting. A final standard in relation to hedge accounting is now in issue. 
The IASB has tentatively set the effective date of IFRS 9 as periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018; it has not yet had EU 
endorsement. The Group has yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact and will also consider the impact of the remaining phases of IFRS 9 
when completed by the IASB.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ – In 2016, the IASB amended the standard to clarify application issues identified 
by stakeholders. The clarifications relate principally to identifying performance obligations, accounting for licences of intellectual property 
and agent vs principal considerations. A five step model will be applied to determine when to recognise revenue, and at what amount. 
Depending on whether certain criteria are met, revenue is recognised either over time, in a manner that best reflects the Group’s 
performance, or at a point in time when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer. The new standard requires 
both qualitative and quantitative disclosures detailing: contracts with customers, significant judgements and assets recognised from 
the costs to obtain or fulfil a contract with a customer. IFRS 15 will not be effective before 1 January 2018; however, early adoption 
is permitted. The Group may choose to adopt the new standard either retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment as 
of the start of the first period for which it applies the new standard. The Group has yet to assess IFRS 15’s full impact, and a full analysis 
will be included in the March 2018 accounts.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ – In 2016, the IASB introduced a new leases standard, with the accounting treatment of leases by lessees fundamentally 
changing. IFRS 16 eliminates the current dual accounting model for lessees, which distinguishes between on-balance sheet finance 
leases and off-balance sheet operating leases. Instead, there is a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to current 
finance lease accounting. As a result of the amendments, lessees will appear to become more asset rich but also more heavily indebted. 
Impacts are not limited to the balance sheet. There are also changes in accounting over the life of the lease. In particular, companies 
will now recognise a front-loaded pattern of expense for most leases, even when they pay annual rents. Lessor accounting will remain 
similar to current practice, with lessors classifying leases as finance and operating leases. IFRS 16 will not be effective before 1 January 2019. 
The Group has yet to assess IFRS 16’s full impact, and a full analysis will be included in the March 2018 accounts. 81

3. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors have made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial information:
Operating lease commitments – Group as lessor
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio. The Group has determined that it retains 
all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties and therefore accounts for them as operating leases.
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year 
are discussed below.
Valuation of investment properties
The fair value of the Group’s investment properties, excluding those held for sale of €735.3 million (31 March 2016: €695.2 million), 
was determined by Cushman & Wakefield LLP (2016: Cushman & Wakefield LLP), an independent valuer. After adjusting investment 
properties for lease incentive accounting and Directors’ discretionary impairments of non-core assets described below, the book value 
of investment properties is shown as €727.3 million (31 March 2016: €687.5 million).
The Cushman & Wakefield LLP valuation is based upon assumptions including future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs 
and an appropriate discount rate. The properties are valued on the basis of a ten year discounted cash flow model supported by 
comparable evidence. The discounted cash flow calculation is a valuation of rental income considering non-recoverable costs and 
applying a discount rate for the current income risk over a ten year period. After ten years, a determining residual value (exit scenario) 
is calculated. A capitalisation rate is applied to the more uncertain future income, discounted to a present value.
The Directors also perform a review of the Cushman & Wakefield LLP valuation taking into consideration factors or information which 
may or may not have been factored into the Cushman & Wakefield LLP valuation. As a result of this review Directors have included 
an investment property write-down amounting to €4,968,000 relating to non-core assets in the year under review. See note 13 for 
further details.
As a result of the level of judgement used in arriving at the market valuations, the amounts which may ultimately be realised in 
respect of any given property may differ from the valuations shown on the statement of financial position.
Service charge 
Service charge expenses are based on actual costs incurred and invoiced together with an estimate of costs which have been incurred 
at 31 March but are yet to be invoiced. The estimates are based on expected consumption rates and historical trends and take into 
account market conditions at the time of recording. 
Service charge income is based on service charge expense and takes into account recovery rates which are largely derived from 
estimated occupancy levels. 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is measured at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Such rates are subject to governmental changes that are 
outside the control of the entity.
Additionally, management has to assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets and certain assets are not recognised due to 
uncertainties over the timing and nature of future events that will lead to their realisation. Accordingly, these unrecognised assets 
may have an impact on future corporate tax changes in certain circumstances.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group is required to test on an annual basis whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The assessment and quantification 
of any such impairment charges are determined by key management judgements in terms of:
 » detailed short-term budgeting on which the recoverable amounts calculated are based;
 » determining the medium and long-term growth rates that are used in extrapolating these budgets over the goodwill’s indefinite 
useful economic life; and
 » the discount rate applied to these extrapolated forecasts to calculate the present value of the cash flows. 82

Estimates and assumptions continued
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
A new LTIP scheme for the benefit of the Executive Directors and the Senior Management Team was approved in October 2015. 
The fair value of the LTIP as determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting and holding period, based 
on the Company’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. 
Assumptions considered in the valuation of the LTIP include: expected volatility of the Company’s share price, as determined by

(31 March 2016: €1,452,000) relating to the granting or award of shares under LTIPs (see note 8).
All employees are employed directly by one of the following Group subsidiary companies: Sirius Facilities GmbH, Sirius Facilities (UK) 
Limited, Curris Facilities & Utilities Management GmbH, SFG NOVA GmbH and Sirius Corporate Services B.V. The average number of 
people employed by the Group during the year was 204 (31 March 2016: 182), expressed in full-time equivalents. In addition, the Board 
of Directors consists of five Non-executive Directors (31 March 2016: three) and two Executive Directors (31 March 2016: two) as at 
31 March 2017.
8. Equity-settled share-based payments
A new LTIP for the benefit of the Executive Directors and the Senior Management Team was approved in October 2015. The fair value 
determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting and holding period, based on the Company’s estimate 
of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Under the LTIP, the awards 
are granted in the form of whole shares at no cost to the participants. Shares vest after the three year performance period followed 
by a holding period of twelve months. The performance conditions used to determine the vesting of the award are based on net asset 
value and total shareholder return allowing vesting of 0% to a maximum of 125%. As a result, a maximum of 25,150,000 shares were 
granted, subject to performance criteria, under the scheme in December 2015 and an expense of €1,452,000 was recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income to 31 March 2016. 
A total of 1,300,000 shares were forfeited in the year to 31 March 2017. An expense of €4,136,000 was recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income to 31 March 2017.

The fair value per share was determined using the Monte Carlo model, with the following assumptions used in the calculation as at grant date:
Weighted average share price – € 0.52
Weighted average exercise price – € —
Expected volatility – % 20
Expected life – years 2.48
Risk free rate based on European treasury bonds’ rate of return – % (0.11)
Expected dividend yield – % 3.41
Assumptions considered in the model include: expected volatility of the Company’s share price, as determined by calculating the 
historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the historical period immediately prior to the date of grant and commensurate 
with the expected life of the awards; dividend yield based on the actual dividend yield as a percentage of the share price at the date 
of grant; expected life of the awards; risk free rates; and correlation between comparators.
Employee benefit scheme 
The original LTIP for the benefit of the Executive Directors and the Senior Management Team expired at the end of March 2015. 
As a result, a total of 3,471,200 ordinary shares were issued during the financial year to 31 March 2016.
During the period 313,608 shares were issued to the Company’s management through its MSP programme (31 March 2016: 134,918).

Balance as at year end 727,295 687,453
* Excluding assets held for sale.
The fair value (market value) of the Group’s investment properties at 31 March 2017 has been arrived at on the basis of a valuation 
carried out at that date by Cushman & Wakefield LLP (2016: Cushman & Wakefield LLP), an independent valuer.
The value of each of the properties has been assessed in accordance with the RICS valuation standards on the basis of market value. 
Market value was primarily derived using a ten year discounted cash flow model supported by comparable evidence. The discounted 
cash flow calculation is a valuation of rental income considering non-recoverable costs and applying a discount rate for the current 
income risk over a ten year period. After ten years, a determining residual value (exit scenario) is calculated. A capitalisation rate is 
applied to the more uncertain future income, discounted to a present value.
As at 31 March 2017 a Director’s discretionary impairment of €4,968,000 has been recognised in relation to one non-core asset 
that management considers to be impaired based on challenging market conditions specific to the location where the asset is situated. 
All previously recognised impairments have been utilised in the period.
The weighted average lease expiry remaining across the whole portfolio at 31 March 2017 was 2.5 years (2016: 2.6 years).
As a result of the level of judgement used in arriving at the market valuations, the amounts that may ultimately be realised in respect 
of any given property may differ from the valuations shown in the statement of financial position.
The reconciliation of surplus on revaluation above capex as per the statement of comprehensive income is as follows:
2017

2016

Surplus on revaluation above capex 50,040 47,501

Included in the surplus on revaluation of investment properties reported in the statement of comprehensive income are gross gains 
of €57,900,000 and gross losses of €8,116,000. 
Other than the capital commitments disclosed in note 27, the Group is under no contractual obligation to purchase, construct 
or develop any investment property. The Group is responsible for routine maintenance to the investment properties. 89

13. Investment properties continued
All investment properties are categorised as Level 3 fair values as they use significant unobservable inputs. There have not been any 
transfers between levels during the year. Investment properties have been classed according to their real estate sector. Information 
on these significant unobservable inputs per class of investment property is disclosed below: 
As at 31 March 2017

Market rental income €424k–€6,034k
Gross initial yield 4.6%–15.7%
Discount factor 5.5%–12.0%

Estimated capital value per sqm €67–€1,318
Other 20,330,000 Discounted cash flow Current rental income €422k–€740k
Market rental income €466k–€884k
Gross initial yield 7.4%–8.7%
Discount factor 6.5%–7.8%
Void period (months) 12–24
Estimated capital value per sqm €537–€806
The valuation is performed on a lease-by-lease basis due to the mixed-use nature of the sites. This gives rise to large ranges in the inputs.
As a result of the level of judgement used in arriving at the market valuations, the amounts which may ultimately be realised in respect 
of any given property may differ from the valuations shown in the statement of financial position. For example, an increase in market 
rental values of 5% would lead to an increase in the fair value of the investment properties of €37,980,000 and a decrease in market 
rental values of 5% would lead to a decrease in the fair value of the investment properties of €37,770,000. Similarly, an increase in 
the discount rates of 0.25% would lead to a decrease in the fair value of the investment properties of €14,730,000 and a decrease 
in the discount rates of 0.25% would lead to an increase in the fair value of the investment properties of €15,040,000.
The highest and best use of properties do not differ from their current use. 90

Closing balance 3,738 3,738
On 30 January 2012 a transaction was completed to internalise the Asset Management Agreement and, as a result of the 
consideration given exceeding the net assets acquired, goodwill of €3,738,000 was recognised. Current business plans indicate 
that the balance is unimpaired.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and whenever there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable 
amount of a cash-generating unit is based on its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the projected cash flows of the  
cash-generating unit. The key assumptions regarding the value-in-use calculations were budgeted growth in revenue and the discount rate 
applied. Budgeted profit margins were estimated based on actual performance over the past two financial years and expected market 
changes. The discount rate used is a pre-tax rate and reflects the risks specific to the real estate industry. The Group prepares cash flow 
forecasts based on the most recent financial budget approved by management, which covers a one year period. Cash flows beyond 
this period are extrapolated to a period of five years using a revenue growth rate of 2.0%, which is consistent with the long-term 
average growth rate for the real estate sector. A discount rate of 6.75% and terminal value of 4.75% was applied in the impairment 
review. A discount rate of 10.0% would be required for the carrying value of goodwill to be greater than the fair value. A negative 
revenue growth rate of 1.16% would be required for the carrying value of goodwill to be greater than the fair value.

21. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise bank loans, derivative financial instruments and trade payables. The main purpose 
of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various financial assets, such as trade 
receivables and cash, which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and interest rate risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises when a failure by counterparties to discharge their obligations could reduce the amount of future cash inflows from 
financial assets on hand at the reporting date. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high 
credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. The risk management policies employed by the Group to manage these 
risks are discussed below. In the event of a default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional 
costs, including expenses incurred to try and recover the defaulted amounts and legal expenses in maintaining, insuring and marketing 
the property until it is re-let. During the year, the Group monitored the tenants in order to anticipate and minimise the impact of defaults 
by occupational tenants, as well as to ensure that the Group has a diversified tenant base. 95

More than 120 days 2,928 (2,232) 3,303 (2,576)
6,979 (4,142) 7,401 (4,332)
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows:
2017
€000
2016
€000
Balance at 1 April (4,332) (3,743)
Impairment loss recognised/(released) 190 (589)
Balance at 31 March (4,142) (4,332)
The allowance account for trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group believes that no recovery of the 
amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against the trade receivables directly.
Most trade receivables are generally due one month in advance. The exception is service charge balancing billing, which is due 
ten days after it has been invoiced. Included in the Group’s trade receivables are debtors with carrying amounts of €2,837,000 
(2016: €3,069,000) that are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant 
change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that arises when the maturity of assets and liabilities does not match. An unmatched position potentially 
enhances profitability but can also increase the risk of losses. The Group has procedures with the objective of minimising such losses, 
such as maintaining sufficient cash and other highly liquid current assets and having available an adequate amount of committed 
credit facilities. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts and continually monitors its ongoing commitments compared to available cash. 
Cash and cash equivalents are placed with financial institutions on a short-term basis which allows immediate access. This reflects the 
Group’s desire to maintain a high level of liquidity in order to meet any unexpected liabilities that may arise due to the current 
financial position. Similarly, accounts receivable are due either in advance (e.g. rents and recharges) or within ten days (e.g. service 
charge reconciliations), further bolstering the Group’s liquidity level. 96

(299,039) — (29,541) (328,580)
Currency risk
There is no significant foreign currency risk as most of the assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in euros. Small amounts 
of UK sterling and South African rand are held to ensure payments made in UK sterling and South African rand can be achieved at an 
effective rate.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Group’s long-term floating rate debt obligations. The Group’s policy 
is to mitigate interest rate risk by ensuring that a minimum of 80% of its total borrowing is at fixed or capped interest rates by taking 
out fixed rate loans or derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate exposure, or interest rate caps.
A change in interest will only have an impact on the floating loans capped due to the fact that the other loans have a general fixed 
interest rate or they are effectively fixed by a swap. An increase in 100bps in interest rate would result in a decreased post tax profit 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income of €133,000 (excluding the movement on derivative financial instruments) 
and a decrease in 100bps in interest rate would result in an increased post tax profit in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income of €133,000 (excluding the movement on derivative financial instruments).
Market risk
The Group’s activities are within the real estate market, exposing it to very specific industry risks.
The yields available from investments in real estate depend primarily on the amount of revenue earned and capital appreciation generated 
by the relevant properties, as well as expenses incurred. If properties do not generate sufficient revenues to meet operating expenses, 
including debt service and capital expenditure, the Group’s revenue will be adversely affected.
Revenues from properties may be adversely affected by the general economic climate; local conditions, such as oversupply of properties 
or a reduction in demand for properties, in the market in which the Group operates; the attractiveness of the properties to the tenants; 
the quality of the management; competition from other available properties; and increased operating costs. 97
Sirius Real Estate Limited
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
 
21. Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
Market risk continued
In addition, the Group’s revenue would be adversely affected if a significant number of tenants were unable to pay rent or its 
properties could not be rented on favourable terms. Certain significant expenditures associated with each equity investment in real 
estate (such as external financing costs, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) are generally not reduced when circumstances cause 
a reduction in revenue from properties. By diversifying in product, risk categories and tenants, the Group expects to lower the risk 
profile of the portfolio.
Capital management
The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by 
managing the capital structure.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust 
the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, issue shares or undertake transactions such as those 
that occurred with the internalisation of the Asset Management Agreement.
The Company holds 1,062,058 of its own shares which continue to be held as Treasury Shares. During the year to 31 March 2017 
313,608 shares were issued from treasury and no shares were bought back. 
The Group monitors capital using a gross debt to property assets ratio, which was 42.3% as at 31 March 2017 (2016: 42.8%).
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements other than those related to the covenants of the bank loan facilities.

For financial assets or liabilities measured at amortised cost and whose carrying value is a reasonable approximation to fair value there 
is no requirement to analyse their value in the fair value hierarchy. 
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique 
used to determine fair value:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 98

The interest rate swap contract is reset on a quarterly basis. The Company will settle the difference between the fixed and floating 
interest rates on a net basis. The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness 
by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar 
instrument at the measurement date. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the reporting period. 
The interest rate swap is measured at fair value with changes recognised in profit or loss.
