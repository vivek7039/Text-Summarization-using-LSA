Overview
The twelve months ending 31 March 2017 
have proved to be turbulent, with major 
political surprises, along with significant 
economic and regulatory changes affecting 
the financial services industry in general 
and foreign exchange markets in particular. 
Exchange rates have reacted to political 
surprises, in some cases markedly.
The UK’s vote to leave the European Union 
in June caused a major adjustment in foreign 
exchange markets with an immediate and 
dramatic decrease in the value of sterling of 
11% against the US dollar, and weakness 
against all other major currencies in the year 
ending 31 March 2017. Sterling finished the 
year down 13% against the US dollar, 9% 
down against the Swiss franc and just over 
7% down versus the euro.
Elections in the US later in the year also 
caused surprise amongst investors, with 
President Trump’s economic ambitions 
being viewed optimistically by markets and 
proving to be supportive of the US dollar, 
which ended the year having strengthened 
against most major currencies.
Interest rates broadly remain at historically 
low levels (with most major economies’ 
negative in real terms), although global 
central bank policy proved more divergent 
in the second half of the year with the 
US Federal Reserve announcing rate 
increases in December 2016 and March 
2017. In contrast, a rate decrease was 
announced by the Bank of England in 
August 2016, and the Bank of Japan 
remained in negative interest rate territory 
since its decrease in January 2016. 
Official bond-buying continued under the 
umbrella of Quantitative Easing in the UK, 
the EU and Japan.
The year also saw the first of a series of 
regulatory changes, with the introduction 
of mandatory collateralisation on some 
foreign exchange contracts between major 
market counterparties. This will be extended 
to more market participants during the 
current financial year. Regulatory focus on 
investment management has also continued 
with the Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Asset Management Market Study, and 
the industry’s preparations for MiFID II.
Capital and dividend policy
Since the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, 
the Board’s focus has been on building a 
robust business by continuing to develop 
its diverse suite of currency-related 
products and strategies, by investing in 
our people and infrastructure, and by 
building a strong and liquid balance sheet 
and regulatory capital buffer.
Over this period, the yardstick for our 
balance sheet has been broadly to 
hold excess capital equivalent to two 
years’ worth of overheads excluding 
variable remuneration. With net assets of 
£41.6 million, own cash
1
 of £29.2 million; 
a surplus over regulatory capital (adjusted 
The Board is recommending a 21% increase in 
ordinary dividend to 2.00 pence per share and 
a special dividend of 0.91 pence per share.

for the final and special dividends referred 
to below) of £23.1 million and overheads 
of £11.7 million, the current capital 
structure, with a surplus of just under 
24 months, reflects this policy.
As discussed further in the Business 
Review, Record has reported its 
highest-ever AUME, increased revenues 
and earnings, and further growth in revenue 
diversification, with revenues from Passive 
Hedging now covering all overheads 
excluding variable remuneration. Given 
this, the Board has decided that conditions 
are now right for a change in the capital 
policy. The new policy will be to ensure 
retained capital broadly equivalent to one 
year’s worth of future estimated overheads 
(excluding variable remuneration), in 
addition to capital assessed as required 
for regulatory purposes, for working 
capital purposes and for investing in new 
opportunities for the business. This new 
policy will still ensure a significant capital 
buffer over regulatory requirements.
Consequently the Board is considering 
the return of approximately £10 million 
of excess capital to shareholders so that 
our capital structure conforms to our new 
policy. Record will provide an update on 
this to the market shortly.
Our dividend policy targets a level of 
dividend which is at least covered by 
earnings and which allows for sustainable 
dividend growth in line with the trend 
in profitability. In line with such policy 
and improved profitability, the Board is 
recommending a 21% increase in the 
ordinary full year dividend to 2.00 pence 
per share. The interim dividend of 
0.825 pence per share was paid on 
23 December 2016, and the final ordinary 
dividend of 1.175 pence per share, subject 
to shareholders’ approval, will be paid on 
2 August 2017 to shareholders on the 
register at 30 June 2017.
In my statement last year I confirmed 
the Board’s intention, subject to financial 
performance and market conditions at 
the time, to return excess earnings over 
ordinary dividends for the financial year 
to shareholders, potentially in the form of 
special dividends. The Board is pleased 
to announce a special dividend equal to 
the excess of basic earnings over ordinary 
dividends, equivalent to 0.91 pence per 
share to be paid simultaneously with the 
final dividend.
In the future, the Board intends to pursue 
a progressive ordinary dividend policy, with 
dividends expected to be paid equally in 
respect of an interim and a final dividend. 
In setting the interim and final dividends, 
the Board will be mindful of setting a level 
of ordinary dividend payments which it 
expects to be at least covered by earnings 
and which allows for future sustainable 
dividend growth by the business in line with 
the trend in profitability. The Board intends 
to continue its approach of considering 
returning to shareholders any excess of 
earnings over the sum of ordinary dividends 
for the financial year and increased capital 
requirements, normally in the form of 
special dividends.
The Board will continue to consider 
ordinary dividends and other distributions 
to shareholders on a “total distribution” 
basis. The total distribution for any year 
will be at least covered by earnings, and 
will always be subject to the financial 
performance of the business, the market 
conditions at the time and to any further 
excess capital assessed as required under 
the policy described above.
Group strategy
The Group believes its core strategies 
remain appropriate to achieve sustainable 
growth in the business. Our primary focus 
is still maintaining our existing revenue base 
and growing this further through excellent 
client service and relationships.
Constant innovation is key to meeting 
the needs of our clients in a challenging 
environment. One of the Group’s 
key strengths is its flexibility which is 
demonstrated in its capability to adapt 
products, processes or distribution 
methods, and to tailor its approach to 
suit individual client requirements.
This innovation can be seen in each of our 
established products, where our strategy 
has been continually to enhance the value 
proposition offered to clients in order to resist 
competitive pressures on revenue margins. 
This is particularly true in the case of Passive 
Hedging, which can be mis-characterised 
by others as a commodity service, but 
which instead offers growing opportunities 
to save costs and add value for clients. Both 
Dynamic Hedging and Multi-Strategy have 
also benefited from enhancements to their 
investment process, and combinations of 
these products are increasingly tailored to 
specific clients’ needs.
The Board
There were a number of important changes 
made to the Board during the year.
Cees Schrauwers and Andrew Sykes 
stepped down from the Board as 
non-executive directors during the year, 
having each served a full nine-year term 
on the Board and hence no longer having 
been deemed independent under the 
UK Corporate Governance Code from 
November 2016. I would like to thank them 
both most warmly for their commitment and 
valuable guidance over the past nine years 
and wish them both well for the future.
Following the conclusion to a succession 
plan starting in late 2014, and allowing 
for a period of smooth transition and 
handover, we welcomed Rosemary Hilary 
to the Board as non-executive director 
in June 2016, having previously also 
welcomed Jane Tufnell to the Board in 
September 2015. Following the resignations 
of Cees and Andrew in September 2016, 
Rosemary succeeded Cees as Audit and 
Risk Committee Chair, David Morrison was 
appointed Senior Independent Director and 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee, and 
Jane Tufnell was appointed Chair of the 
Nomination Committee.
Outlook
Global financial markets continue to 
experience a mix of predicted and 
unexpected developments. Whilst the 
outcome of the French presidential election 
was as anticipated by markets, both the 
United Kingdom and United States by 
contrast continue to experience political 
instability. Elections in Germany and 
elsewhere in Europe, as well as the ongoing 
Brexit negotiations, still contain the capacity 
to surprise. Geopolitical instability, whether 
from the Middle East or South East Asia, also 
continues to have an impact on markets.
This environment continues to provide 
opportunities to engage with clients, to 
understand their objectives, and to develop 
tailored solutions. Record has the strategies, 
track records, operational systems and most 
importantly the people to do so.
Record’s success is a consequence 
of the hard work, commitment and 
professionalism of our people. On behalf of 
the Board, I would like to thank everyone 
at Record for their valuable contribution 
towards this success.

Strategic report

Record is reporting growth in AUME, 
underlying revenues and underlying 
earnings. Whilst much of the growth in 
sterling terms can be attributed to sterling’s 
depreciation, it is also pleasing to note 
AUME growth in US dollar terms, taking 
AUME to its highest level in Record’s history.
The environment of political uncertainty 
and change, and the resultant significant 
moves in currency markets, have focused 
investors’ attention on the opportunities 
presented by currency management. 
We have seen inflows throughout the year 
in Hedging strategies and in Currency for 
Return, and we continue to see interest in 
a diversified range of opportunities amongst 
investors around the world.
The environment of political uncertainty and change 
creates opportunities for Record to demonstrate its 
full range of currency management skills.

Market overview
Financial markets have been dominated 
by political events in the year to 
31 March 2017, most notably the UK’s 
vote to leave the EU and the election 
of President Trump. Partly as a result, 
markets around the world have been 
slow to return to conventional interest 
rate policies, although the modest moves 
to higher US dollar rates have brought 
about some divergence. The net effect 
has included a marked depreciation of 
sterling over the financial year; the US dollar 
moved sideways in the first half of the year, 
before undergoing a notable rally following 
the election in November. The ongoing 
European election cycle brings with it the 
prospect of further market volatility as the 
question of sustainability of the EU, and by 
extension the euro, is revisited.
At the market structure level, differences 
have emerged between money market 
interest rates and those implied in foreign 
exchange forward contracts which have not 
generally been observed historically, as set 
out further on page 19. This creates relative 
winners and losers, as well as opportunities 
for Record’s clients. Regulation is one of 
the unintended drivers of this phenomenon. 
Other regulatory changes have required us 
to dedicate significant resources throughout 
the year to understanding the impact of 
such changes on each of our clients and 
engaging with clients to help them meet the 
new requirements.
Investment performance
UK-based Dynamic Hedging programmes 
allowed UK investors to capture gains in 
their underlying overseas exposures as 
sterling depreciated, by keeping hedge 
ratios low throughout the period.
US-based Dynamic Hedging clients saw 
losses from currency on international assets 
when valuing positions in US dollars, as the 
US dollar strengthened. Record’s Dynamic 
Hedging product increased hedge ratios 
in line with US dollar strength, though 
programmes experienced negative hedging 
returns overall due to the costs associated 
with varying the hedge ratios in the first half 
of the year, when the US dollar traded in a 
relatively narrow range.
All of Record’s Currency for Return 
strategies have performed positively in the 
period. Carry strategies yielded positive 
returns from all currency selections other 
than a short position in the Japanese yen, 
which ended the year up against higher 
interest rate currencies. In the case of 
Emerging Markets, positive returns were 
generated over the period as emerging 
market currencies generally appreciated 
against a basket of developed market 
currencies. Value performed markedly 
positively over the year, in part benefiting 
from long positions in the Japanese yen 
and the US dollar. Momentum generated 
positive returns through a short position in 
the pound.
Asset flows and 
financial performance
AUME
1
 increased by 10% in US dollar terms 
over the financial year to $58.2 billion, and 
by 26% in sterling terms to £46.6 billion 
– its highest ever level. There were net 
inflows of $3.2 billion in the year, with the 
majority coming from our Hedging products 
comprising Passive Hedging inflows of 
$2.5 billion and Dynamic Hedging inflows 
of $0.7 billion. There were also inflows to 
Currency for Return of $0.3 billion as our 
Multi-Strategy offering continued to gain 
interest from clients. Our Multi-product 
mandates had outflows of $0.4 billion. 
The aggregate impact of external factors 
(i.e. equity and other market movements 
and the impact of exchange rates over the 
period) was +$2.1 billion. Client numbers 
increased to 59.
Underlying revenues increased by 9% to 
£23.1 million. The increase was principally 
due to the impact of sterling weakness on 
the conversion of the 82% of management 
fees that are denominated in currencies 
other than sterling. Record’s costs before 
Group Profit Share remuneration grew by 
5%, most of which can be attributed to 
the office relocation which took place in 
November 2016. These factors combined 
with continued discipline in other cost areas 
allowed the Group to record an underlying 
operating margin of 34%, underlying 
profit before tax of £7.9 million, and basic 
earnings per share of 2.91 pence.

1. During the year ended 31 March 2017, Record introduced a new product category (“Multi-product”) in order to redefine the boundaries between existing products, 
and combinations of products, and redefined how AUME is measured for this new category. A full reconciliation of AUME under the new classification and the 
historic classifications is provided on page 103. All AUME data in the main body of this report is provided using the new classification basis.
2. The Group uses non-GAAP measures such as “underlying revenue” and “underlying operating profit”. These measures are calculated by removing the impact of 
non-controlling interests from the normal GAAP measures presented in the financial statements calculated in accordance with IFRS. The Group believes that these 
non-GAAP measures provide a useful indication of the performance of the business. Record plc Annual Report 2017

CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER’S STATEMENT CONTINUED
Client relationships
Our strategy of building trusted individual 
relationships with clients and their advisers 
remains unchanged. During the year 
we have seen the emergence of clearer 
themes amongst investors as to their 
preferences in managing currency risk 
and opportunity. In the US, currency 
risk management has risen higher on 
investors’ agendas with the rally in the 
US dollar and the recognition of the impact 
of political events on currency markets. 
Switzerland has long been a core market 
for Record, and we have increased the 
resources committed to this market with 
the opening of an office in Zürich since the 
financial year-end. In all markets the strong 
performance track record of Multi-Strategy 
is encouraging interest. The UK market is 
more challenging as sterling’s weakness 
has caused cash outflows from clients’ 
hedging programmes, and time and 
attention has to be focused on meeting 
regulatory requirements.
Innovation
Enhancement of existing products and 
development of new ones is a constant 
feature at Record, driven by clients’ 
needs and market opportunities. We have 
prioritised the expansion of our capabilities 
in cash and collateral management. The 
need to do so comes from a number of 
sources – legislation mandating variation 
margin for FX forwards, our plans to 
support a greater range of derivative 
overlays, and the opportunity to help 
clients suffering from low yields and 
growing  cash requirements. We have 
also continued to enhance our Passive 
Hedging offering, emphasising to clients 
its bespoke nature, and the opportunity 
to take advantage of market opportunities 
even within a fixed hedge ratio constraint. 
The range of exchange-traded funds 
offered by WisdomTree Investments, Inc. 
that track indexes using Record’s hedging 
signals has continued to grow and has 
won industry awards.
People
We have continued to attract, retain and 
develop high quality people, principally 
through intern programmes and graduate 
and early-stage career hires. We then focus 
on internal development and retention of 
these individuals. When recruiting staff 
early in their careers some subsequent 
attrition is inevitable, but this also creates 
a growing pool of alumni with whom we 
maintain strong relationships. We have 
largely succeeded in retaining key staff in 
a highly competitive employment market. 
The working environment for staff is part of 
the Group’s retention strategy, hence we 
have focused on the environment in our 
expanded office in Windsor, have moved 
our US office from Atlanta to New York, and 
have opened an office in Zürich since the 
end of the financial year. We are proposing 
changes to our remuneration structures 
including to conform conditions between 
Approved and Unapproved options and 
thereby enhance the alignment of interests 
with external shareholders.
Strategic progress
Record’s strategic progress over the year can be measured 
against each of the objectives set out on pages 10 and 11.

Outlook
From a diverse picture of investors’ 
preferences a year ago, clearer themes 
have now emerged. In particular, currency 
risk management has risen on US investors’ 
agendas, and we continue to commit 
significant resources to pursuing these 
opportunities. The strong performance of 
Multi-Strategy continues to attract investor 
interest. The Group has increasingly 
focused on its bespoke and differentiated 
approach to Passive Hedging when 
engaging with current and prospective 
clients and their advisers, and we continue 
to broaden our capabilities in cash and 
collateral management.
There is no evident end to political 
uncertainty and change, which creates 
opportunities for Record to demonstrate 
its full range of currency management 
skills to clients. All of Record’s management 
and staff remain focused on maintaining 
and enhancing our relationships with 
existing clients, as well as developing new 
client relationships and continuing to grow 
the business.

Growth
We have achieved growth in client 
numbers (58 to 59), AUME ($52.9 billion 
to $58.2 billion), management fees 
(£20.9 million to £22.7 million) and 
underlying revenues (£21.3 million to 
£23.1 million) over the period. We have 
deployed additional resources in 
North America and Switzerland and 
have sustained efforts in our other core 
markets of the United Kingdom and 
continental Europe. We continue to 
explore opportunities in other markets.
Profitability
The Group’s underlying profitability has 
increased. Underlying profit before tax 
increased from £7.0 million to £7.9 million 
over the period. Revenues benefited from 
improved conversion rates for revenues 
denominated in currencies other than 
sterling. The underlying operating margin 
has increased to 34%.
Risk management
The Group takes a proactive approach 
to developing its systems, people 
and processes, in order to improve 
management of the operational risk 
that we assume from clients and 
to meet the demands of emerging 
regulatory requirements. We have 
implemented new systems to support 
our collateral management function and 
have developed a new system to improve 
our exposure capture and rebalancing 
processes for Hedging mandates. We have 
continued to invest in our cyber-security 
defences. The Group has committed 
resources to prepare for the implementation 
of MiFID II, and to manage the effects of 
the UK exiting the European Union. Record 
is well placed to manage the risks arising 
from these events and will continue to keep 
developments under review. Record plc Annual Report 2017

The Group was founded over 30 years ago, and

in managing currency for institutional clients.
BUSINESS  
MODEL
Who we are
Record is a specialist currency manager. 
Our goals are to develop robust and 
innovative currency solutions that meet 
client demand and, in doing so, to create 
shareholder value for our investors over 
the long term.
Over the 30-plus years since being 
established, the Group’s business 
model has focused fundamentally on 
the individual requirements of each of 
our clients. Consequently, the Group 
operates Hedging mandates and unfunded 
Currency for Return mandates as bespoke, 
segregated mandates, managing each 
client’s unique characteristics through 
robust operational systems built to 
manage exposures efficiently and to 
minimise operational risk. These strong 
operational capabilities are supplemented 
by a team of highly experienced personnel 
within the investment, client services and 
support teams. 
By building trusted adviser relationships 
with each client, we can fully understand 
their currency-related issues and 
implement robust and high-quality solutions.
Our clients
Client relationships are the keystone to our 
success. Only by building strong, long-term 
trusted adviser relationships with our clients 
can we fully understand their currency 
issues and develop effective solutions for 
their currency requirements.
We provide currency hedging and 
return-seeking services to institutional 
clients including public Defined Benefit 
(“DB”) pension funds, corporate DB pension 
funds, corporations, foundations and trusts 
as well as other fund managers.

Our market
The currency market represents the 
biggest and most liquid market available 
with exceptionally low transaction 
costs and daily FX volumes averaging 
$5.1 trillion per day. The FX market is 
essential to global trade and finance and 
includes a high proportion of not-for-profit 
or forced participants, resulting in 
profit-seeking financial institutions 
continuing to represent a minority of FX 
market participants. Consequently, the 
market displays persistent patterns of 
behaviour or inefficiencies which Record 
believes are best exploited by quantitative, 
systematic processes. 
The FX market continues to offer 
opportunities for investors. Record’s 
expertise is in identifying and understanding 
these opportunities and then educating 
clients on how such opportunities may be 
used to their best advantage taking account 
of each client’s individual circumstances and 
attitude to risk.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information
The Group has good track records for its Dynamic and Passive Hedging 
products over 34 and 18 years respectively and now has a good track 
record approaching five years for its Currency Multi‑Strategy return‑seeking 
product. It has established itself both in the eyes of clients and their 
investment consultants as a respected specialist in this sector.
What we do
We have a fundamental and comprehensive 
understanding of how currency markets 
operate. Our approach is to listen to clients 
and to understand their currency issues 
in order to advise them on and implement 
the best solution. Clients invested in 
international assets are exposed inherently 
to the risk of currency rate fluctuations, 
which can be managed using currency 
hedging. Alternatively, clients may look 
to take on additional currency risk in the 
expectation of returns, and in some cases 
clients may be interested in both risk 
reduction and value-added opportunities, 
which can be offered through a mix of 
hedging and currency for return strategies. 
Investing in currency strategies has the 
advantage of offering diversification of 
returns compared to more established 
asset classes, and has the flexibility to 
be implemented on either a funded or 
unfunded basis.
Our products and services
The Group’s suite of core products is split 
into two main categories: Currency Hedging 
and Currency for Return products. We also 
offer bespoke solutions tailored to individual 
client requirements.
Currency Hedging mandates, both 
Passive Hedging and Dynamic Hedging, 
are primarily risk-reducing in nature.
Currency for Return mandates are 
return-seeking in nature. The range includes 
four principal Currency for Return strategies 
being Carry, Emerging Market, Momentum 
and Value and these strategies can be 
offered in either a segregated or pooled 
fund structure. Additionally, Record is able 
to offer combinations of these strategies 
under a Multi-Strategy approach that seeks 
to vary the allocation to these strategies 
either on a fixed basis or according to 
market conditions.

Currency Hedging and Currency for Return 
products to address each individual client’s 
requirements.
Currency Hedging: 
AUME $54.5 billion
Our hedging products are predominantly 
systematic in nature. Record has the 
experience and expertise to deliver tailored 
hedging programmes to suit the currency 
needs of our clients. The effectiveness of 
each client mandate is assessed regularly 
and adjustments are made when necessary 
in order to respond to changing market 
conditions. We continue to enhance our 
product offerings, so that they maintain their 
premium product status. In a competitive 
marketplace, our ability to differentiate our 
hedging products is key to maintaining and 
to growing our market share further.

BUSINESS  
MODEL CONTINUED
Passive Hedging: 
AUME $48.2 billion
Passive Hedging mandates have the 
cost-effective reduction of exposure to 
currency risk as their sole objective by the 
symmetrical and unbiased elimination of 
currency volatility from clients’ international 
portfolios. They require execution and 
operational expertise to a greater extent 
than investment judgement and are 
designed to minimise transaction costs 
and make resultant cash flows easier to 
manage. Furthermore, our experience 
enables us to tailor each client’s mandate 
to suit their particular needs – for 
example in managing bank counterparty 
exposure, in offering independent trading 
relationships, and in managing the 
inherently high operational risk associated 
with such mandates.
Dynamic Hedging: 
AUME $6.3 billion
Record’s Dynamic Hedging product is an 
attractive alternative to Passive Hedging 
since these mandates have the reduction 
of exposure to currency risk as their 
principal objective and generating value 
as a secondary objective. The Dynamic 
Hedging product seeks to allow our clients 
to benefit from foreign currency strength 
while protecting them from foreign currency 
weakness relative to their own base 
currency. Value is generated entirely through 
the asymmetric reduction of pre-existing 
currency risk and Dynamic Hedging’s 
ability to outperform Passive Hedging is 
dependent on trending in currency markets. 
Historically, Dynamic Hedging mandates 
have been implemented only through 
segregated accounts to accommodate 
the individual international portfolios and 
hedging requirements of each client.
Currency for Return: 
AUME $1.0 billion
Our Currency for Return strategies have 
the generation of investment return as their 
principal objective.
Record’s longer-established return-seeking 
strategies, the Carry and Emerging Market 
currency strategies, are founded on market 
risk premia and as such perform more 
strongly in “risk on” environments. By 
contrast, Value and Momentum strategies 
are founded on market inefficiencies which 
are more behavioural in nature. As such 
they are less risk-sensitive, with Value 
strategy returns relatively insensitive to 
risk sentiment and Momentum strategy 
returns potentially inversely correlated to 
risk sentiment. It is this diversification of 
response to risk sentiment that makes 
Multi-Strategy an attractive approach 
for generating a return from currency 
for potential clients. Furthermore, the 
Multi-Strategy approach, which reaches 
the fifth anniversary of its live track record 
in July 2017, can be used as a flexible 
“overlay” to help clients achieve a variety 
of investment objectives. 
Carry
The Forward Rate Bias is the observation 
that higher yielding currencies tend to 
outperform lower yielding currencies over 
longer time periods, and is regarded by 
Record as a fundamental and structural 
currency risk premium. The Carry strategy 
aims to exploit this observation by buying 
selected developed market higher interest 
rate currencies and selling selected lower 
interest rate currencies.
One of Record’s medium to long-term aims 
is to develop currency as an asset class 
in its own right. The “asset class project”, 
which started in 2009, saw the launch of a 
currency index, the FTSE Currency FRB10 
Index, in December 2010. Record launched 
a pooled fund, the Record Currency – FTSE 
FRB10 Index Fund, to track this FTSE index 
and invested £1 million in December 2010. 
Performance data for this and the other 
strategies discussed here can be found 
on page 21.
Emerging Market Currency
Emerging market currencies offer investors 
an opportunity either to seek a return from 
such currencies or to seek to separate the 
currency effect from the underlying overseas 
domestic asset performance (typically 
equities or bonds). Record believes that 
as a result of convergence in the levels of 
economic output between emerging and 
developed markets, holding emerging 
market currencies offers the benefit of 
real exchange rate appreciation as well as 
typically offering higher positive real yields. 
This currency appreciation has historically 
been a significant contributor of returns to 
(developed market) holders of emerging 
market assets including equities and bonds. 
Consequently we regard emerging market 
currency strategies as an attractive route 
through which to implement emerging 
market local currency debt strategies, 
offering substantially the same elements 
of return, with significant implementation 
benefits including no direct capital 
commitment in the emerging market, lower 
administration, custody and transaction 
costs, broader coverage, and greater 
flexibility and security.
This convergence-driven return opportunity 
combined with a selection based on interest 
rate differentials, relative valuations and 
discretionary risk management, is expected 
to result in long-term positive performance 
of the strategy.
Currency Momentum
This strategy exploits the periodic tendency 
of the spot exchange rate to appreciate 
after a prior appreciation, and to depreciate 
after a previous depreciation. This market 
inefficiency has persisted across different 
currencies and is present in other asset 
classes, such as equities. Currency is 
commonly thought of as trending and the 
Momentum strategy seeks to make a return 
from this phenomenon.
Currency Value
Research suggests that purchasing power 
parity (“PPP”) valuation models have been 
relatively good predictors of the long-term 
direction of spot movements. For example, 
if a currency deviates too much from its 
equilibrium value (as indicated by PPP), then 
this deviation will be corrected. The more 
significant the deviation, the more pressure 
on the exchange rate to revert to equilibrium 
value and, consequently, the more rapid 
the reversion. Currency value strategies 
exploit this insight, buying currencies that 
are undervalued relative to PPP and selling 
currencies that appear overvalued.
Multi-Strategy
The Multi-Strategy approach can be applied 
as an “overlay” to help clients achieve a 
variety of investment objectives, and offers 
clients access to the main sustainable 
sources of return in the currency market. 
Record has the ability to combine four 
currency return streams (Carry, Emerging 
Markets, Momentum and Value) in different 
weightings that appeal to particular market 
segments. By implementing more than one 
currency for return strategy, clients receive 
a diversified return stream which performs 
well under a variety of market conditions 
and reduces the correlation of their currency 
programme to other asset classes. Record plc Annual Report 2017

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information
Multi-product:
AUME $2.5 billion
Multi-product mandates typically have 
combined risk-reducing and return-seeking 
objectives, and are bespoke in nature. 
These may include a hedging mandate 
overlaid with selected elements of the 
Currency for Return product, which cannot 
readily be separated into its hedging and 
return-seeking components for reporting 
purposes. These mandates tend to be more 
susceptible to changes in market volatility, 
and are therefore more variable in nature, 
attracting different levels of fees.
Other products
In the prior year, Record entered into a 
licensing agreement with WisdomTree 
Investments, Inc. who, through its 
subsidiaries in the US, Europe and 
Japan (collectively “WisdomTree”), 
is an exchange-traded fund and 
exchange-traded product sponsor 
and asset manager headquartered in 
New York. Under the licensing agreement, 
Record provides signals that are used to 
dynamically hedge currency exposures 
within WisdomTree’s rules-based index 
family and this licensing agreement was 
extended during the year to include their 
newly-launched Canadian rules-based 
index family. Whilst the product is still 
relatively new, we are optimistic that this 
will allow dynamic hedging strategies to 
be accessible to a wider range of investors 
than has previously been the case.
Since Record is not managing the 
exchange-traded funds that seek to 
track the performance of their respective 
WisdomTree Dynamic Currency Hedged 
Indexes, assets under management in these 
funds do not contribute to Record’s AUME. 
Record reports revenues arising from this 
licensing agreement under “Other income”.
Further information on product investment 
performance is given in the Operating 
Review section (page 20).
Distribution
The Group’s sales and marketing activities 
are organised to ensure that resources are 
deployed where opportunities have been 
identified as giving the most likelihood of 
future success. To this end, the dedicated 
sales and marketing team are based in 
the UK headquarters but are available to 
provide comprehensive sales and technical 
support to the sales staff based in the US, 
Switzerland and Germany.
We distribute through both direct sales 
to institutional clients, and through local 
and global investment consultants. 
Building long-term relationships with 
investment consultants and developing their 
understanding of our products and services 
is important to our continued success and 
our ability to deliver quality services to our 
clients. By working closely both with clients 
and investment consultants we can identify 
new business opportunities as the currency 
landscape continues to change and evolve.
Our products are delivered both through 
segregated mandates and pooled 
fund structures to suit individual client 
requirements.
Our people
Record views its ability to attract, retain, 
motivate and develop highly talented 
staff as key to organisational stability 
and long-term success.
Recruitment
The recruitment process is carefully 
structured to ensure that talented people 
with the right skills and experience are 
recruited into the Group. This continues with 
a comprehensive induction programme for 
all new joiners to allow them to adapt to the 
specialist environment within Record.
The Group has continued to recruit very 
selectively throughout the year in order to 
maintain a flexible, scalable platform for 
future growth. The number of employees 
(including Directors) in the Group increased 
during the year, and headcount at 
31 March 2017 was 75 (2016: 72).
Staff retention, motivation 
and development
An effective performance review and 
objective-setting process, personal 
development planning including the 
development of career paths, together 
with our open and inclusive office culture, 
are all key priorities in the development and 
retention of our staff. In addition, the Group 
Share Scheme, the Group Profit Share 
Scheme and the Group Share Incentive 
Plan (“SIP”) promote the acquisition of 
equity in the Company by staff, improving 
motivation and retention, as well as aligning 
employees’ interests with those of our 
clients and shareholders. At 31 March 2017, 
the proportion of employee shareholders 
stood at 68% (2016: 69%). Furthermore, 
the business ensures that wider factors, 
such as market trends in pay, are monitored 
closely to ensure risks to staff retention are 
limited as far as possible.
Another factor considered crucial to the 
attraction, retention and motivation of staff 
is the physical office environment and 
how this affects both the productivity and 
wellbeing of our employees. During the 
year, the business moved offices due to the 
cessation of the existing first floor lease at 
Morgan House. Following refurbishment, 
the Group moved into floors two and 
three in the same building at the end of 
November 2016. The new lease gave the 
business the opportunity to have a new 
office incorporating more space designed 
around the wellbeing of employees, in 
addition to modernising the more formal 
client-facing spaces and upgrading the 
communication technology used throughout 
the business.
We are proposing changes to our 
remuneration structures including to 
conform conditions between Approved 
and Unapproved options for employees 
below Executive Director level and thereby 
enhance the alignment of interests with 
external shareholders.
Our infrastructure
The Group’s operational infrastructure is 
built around how we service our clients and 
ensures a collaborative approach across 
all sections of the business. Superior 
relationship management is core to our 
client proposition and we achieve this on 
various levels by assigning a dedicated 
and experienced relationship manager to 
oversee each client portfolio. Also, direct 
communication between our operational 
and administrative specialists with each 
client’s own internal functions is encouraged 
(for example on rebalancing or reporting 
issues), building on the general level of 
interaction with the client and underpinning 
the overall “trusted adviser” relationship. 
This high level of communication on multiple 
levels ensures all aspects of the currency 
issues facing our clients are fully considered 
and understood in terms of solutions.
All of the Group’s investment functions, 
comprising portfolio implementation, trading 
and research plus the operational and 
support functions are based centrally at the 
Head Office in Windsor, UK and provide 
services to the Group as a whole. Record plc Annual Report 2017

Strategic report: business review
Financial markets in general, and FX 
markets in particular, were dominated in 
the year to 31 March 2017 by political 
events, most notably the UK’s vote to leave 
the EU and the election of President Trump. 
Partly in reaction to the uncertainties these 
implied, markets around the world have 
been slow to return to conventional interest 
rate policies, although the modest moves 
to higher US dollar rates have brought 
about some divergence. At the market 
structure level, differences between money 
market interest rates and foreign exchange 
forward contracts have created relative 
winners and losers.
Political events
In the year to 31 March 2017 political 
events largely took markets by surprise, 
as well-anticipated events yielded 
unexpected outcomes. The first event was 
the UK’s vote on EU membership in June, 
which concluded with the vote to leave 
by 52% to 48%. With no precedent and 
with the result threatening to unravel the 
UK’s trading arrangements with the EU, 
the pound fell to a 31-year low against 
the US dollar. As newly appointed PM 
Theresa May announced her intention to 
pursue a ‘hard Brexit’, the currency took a 
further step lower in October before trading 
sideways for the rest of the period.
November saw the second political 
upset for the year with Donald Trump’s 
US Presidential election victory. Almost 
as notable as the election result was the 
euphoric asset market response which saw 
US bond yields jump from multi-year lows 
on account of Trump’s Reagan-inspired 
economic prospectus. Unlike Brexit, the 
Reagan era provided a historical precedent 
for the US dollar, which notably appreciated 
as markets anticipated significant fiscal 
easing and the prospect of a more hawkish 
central bank. By the start of 2017, the US 
dollar’s rally had begun to lose momentum 
as markets waited for clarity on Trump’s 
reflationary policy. 
Towards the end of the financial year, 
focus shifted towards the ongoing 
European election cycle which promises 
to fuel currency market volatility as 
crucial questions around the long-term 
sustainability of the EU, and by extension 
the euro, are revisited.
Monetary policy 
and interest rates
Since the onset of the global financial 
crisis, interest rates in developed markets 
have remained extraordinarily low, and in 
some cases below what was previously 
thought as the zero lower bound. Over the 
past year the monetary policy divergence 
previously anticipated did not fully 
come to fruition despite a backdrop of 
recovering commodity prices, improved 
global growth prospects and restored risk 
sentiment. While the United States took 
significant steps towards monetary policy 
normalisation, hopes of normalisation 
elsewhere were either thwarted by political 
outcomes such as Brexit or mired by 
longer-run structural forces.
In the United States the Federal Reserve 
took a year-long pause following its first 
move towards interest rate normalisation in 
December 2015. Inflation moved sideways 
for the first seven months of the calendar 
year and the US dollar showed a similar 
lack of direction, range-trading up until 
the election date in November. Before the 
financial year ended, a confluence of factors 
led the Federal Reserve to hike the federal 
funds target rate twice more; once in its 
December meeting and again in the March 
meeting, causing the US dollar to rally into 
the new year. 
The Bank of England in the first half of 
the financial year contended with the 
impact of Brexit and took precautionary 
measures to ease financial conditions. In 
August the Bank cut interest rates to an 
historic low of 0.25 percent, and restarted 
its asset purchase facility and its term 
funding scheme. In the second half of the 
financial year, forewarned dire economic 
consequences of a Brexit vote were yet to 
materialise, and the Bank of England began 
revising upwards projections of inflation and 
growth, although this failed to pass through 
noticeably to short-term interest rates. 
Political risk and easing policy weighed on 
the pound, which weakened against all 
G10 currencies over the financial year.
The European Central Bank and the 
Bank of Japan both continued to pursue 
exceptionally easy monetary policy in 
order to support prices and to exert 
downward pressure on their currencies. 
In December the ECB chose to extend 
its quantitative easing programme until at 
least December 2017. The Bank of Japan 
took new and innovative measures to 
combat deflation in September by explicitly 
setting a ten-year bond yield target of zero 
percent, which was particularly effective as 
global yields shifted upwards following the 
US election. 
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) faced 
much of the same economic dilemmas this 
financial year as last. Although the SNB had 
abandoned the 1.20 cap against the euro, 
the currency remains inextricably linked 
to developments in the Eurozone, so the 
SNB kept interest rates deeply negative at 
-0.75 percent. The Swiss franc fluctuated 
throughout the financial year and overall 
depreciated marginally against a basket of 
G10 currencies.
Record’s flexibility and ability to adapt its processes 
enable it to meet an increasing demand for bespoke 
currency solutions from clients and to address tactical 
objectives driven by market events.

REVIEW Record plc Annual Report 2017

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information
Basis
Since early 2016, Record and other market 
observers have become increasingly aware 
of the breakdown in the historic relationship 
between money market interest rates and 
those implied in foreign exchange forward 
contracts, which have historically been 
held in lockstep. The newly-emerged the 
gap between these is referred to as the 
basis. The breakdown of this relationship 
and the emergence of the basis is largely 
due to changes in the structure of money 
markets and new banking capital adequacy 
regulations. These have significantly 
reduced the capacity of the banking system 
and other market participants to prevent the 
emergence of the basis through arbitrage. 
The size and direction of the basis, can 
be largely explained by mismatches in 
global demand for hedging, arising out 
of the imbalances between the extent to 
which for example US dollar denominated 
assets are held outside the United States, 
compared to the extent to which non-US 
dollar denominated assets are held within 
the United States.
The basis can act to the advantage of 
certain of our clients, if it increases the 
interest rate benefit from hedging or 
reduces its cost, or conversely to the 
disadvantage of others. Whether the basis 
is beneficial or detrimental to any particular 
client depends on that client’s location and 
exposure currencies. For clients that are 
disadvantaged, Record can employ hedging 
strategies that attempt to minimise the basis 
cost, while new opportunities have arisen 
for clients who reside on the advantageous 
side of the basis.
Regulation
The year to 31 March 2017 saw the 
first implementation of market reforms 
and new regulations in over-the-counter 
foreign exchange derivative markets. 
These regulations are being promulgated 
in the European Union, the United States, 
Switzerland, Canada, Singapore, Australia, 
and other jurisdictions.
Whilst the general thrust of regulation is 
common across jurisdictions, there remain 
important implementation differences. 
This is particularly true regarding the 
introduction of mandatory variation margin 
and in some cases initial margin on foreign 
exchange derivative contracts. As a result 
Record has dedicated significant resources 
during the year to a series of detailed 
mandate-by-mandate reviews, analysing 
the jurisdiction of each client, each bank 
counterparty with which they trade, and 
each category of instrument they trade, 
to assess the specific requirements being 
imposed on each client and to help clients 
meet those requirements. Some of our 
clients were affected from 1 March 2017; 
many more clients will be affected from 
January 2018.
As of the date of this report, the market-wide 
impact of such changes has been muted, 
with no evident differences in pricing 
between those market participants that 
have to exchange margin and those 
that do not. There have however been a 
number of consequences that were likely 
unintended by regulators, such as the 
handicaps imposed on European Union 
banks when trading with certain categories 
of non-European Union counterparty.
Effects on Record’s strategies
Results for UK- and US-based Dynamic 
Hedging clients were necessarily driven 
by the impact of shifting political and 
economic expectations on the strength or 
weakness of the pound and the US dollar. 
For UK investors, sterling’s depreciation 
created currency gains in foreign currency 
investments, and Dynamic Hedging 
allowed clients to keep most of these 
gains by holding hedge ratios at low levels. 
For US investors, the dollar’s path was 
more variable in the first half of the year, 
generating costs in the Dynamic Hedging 
programmes, although dollar strength in 
the second half generated gains partially 
offsetting earlier losses.
With respect to return-seeking currency 
strategies, all four principal strands – Carry, 
Emerging Markets, Value and Momentum – 
generated positive performance throughout 
the year. Although market attention was 
dominated by idiosyncratic events focused 
on the UK and the US, the consistent 
approach each of these strategies takes 
to a diversified group of currencies allowed 
currency behaviour further from the 
spotlight, such as commodity-dependent 
emerging market currencies, or more minor 
developed market currencies, also to be 
rewarded. Since the rationale for combining 
these four strands is that we expect 
diversification between them, positive 
performance from all four should be seen 
as the exception rather than the norm. Record plc Annual Report 2017

Strategic report: business review
Product investment performance
Our hedging products are predominantly 
systematic in nature. The effectiveness of 
each client mandate is assessed regularly 
and adjustments are made when necessary 
in order to respond to changing market 
conditions or to bring the risk profile of the 
hedging mandate in line with the client’s 
risk tolerance.
The performance of our Dynamic Hedging 
product depends on how the foreign 
currencies change in value relative to the 
base currency of a client. During the year, 
mandates for our UK-based Dynamic 
Hedging clients performed as expected 
in terms of allowing clients to benefit from 
periods of strengthening foreign currencies, 
whilst being protected against periods 
of weakening foreign currencies. For 
our US-based Dynamic Hedging clients, 
costs associated with a sideways-moving 
US dollar led to negative hedging returns. 
UK investors saw underlying gains from 
currency over the year as sterling weakened 
against all G10 currencies following the UK’s 
decision to leave the EU, leading to higher 
sterling valuations for foreign currency 
investments. UK-based Dynamic Hedging 
programmes began the period with 
hedge ratios close to zero, and remained 
low throughout the year as the currency 
depreciated further, thus containing hedging 
losses and allowing UK investors to capture 
gains in the underlying overseas exposures. 
US investors saw losses from currency on 
international assets when valuing positions 
in US dollars, as the US dollar strengthened 
against most G10 currencies on account 
of expectations for stimulatory fiscal policy, 
corporate tax cuts and a potential border 
adjustment tax. Record’s Dynamic Hedging 
product increased hedge ratios in line with 
US dollar strength, though programmes 
experienced negative hedging returns 
due to the costs associated with varying 
the hedge ratios in the first half of the 
year, as the US dollar traded in a relatively 
narrow range. 
Record had a number of “live” Currency 
for Return products in the year. The 
Record Currency – FTSE FRB10 Index 
Fund, and Emerging Market products are 
founded on market risk premia and as 
such perform more strongly in “risk on” 
environments. By contrast, Momentum 
and Value strategies are more behavioural 
in nature, and as a result are less 
risk-sensitive. FRB10 Index, Emerging 
Market, Momentum and Value can also be 
combined to create the Record Currency 
Multi-Strategy product.
During the period, all Record Active Forward 
Rate Bias portfolios had been transitioned 
to the FRB10 Index strategy as part of 
account restructuring processes agreed 
with the respective clients. The Forward 
Rate Bias Index product uses more 
diversified allocations without active risk 
control and similarly aims to buy selected 
higher interest rate developed market 
currencies and sell selected lower interest 
rate currencies. This year saw positive 
returns from all currency selections other 
than a short position in the Japanese 
yen, which ended the year up against 
higher interest rate currencies. Record 
remains committed to our belief that 
over time currency, and in particular the 
Carry strategy, can be a persistent and 
uncorrelated source of returns for investors, 
and that the Carry will continue to generate 
long-term returns.
Record’s Emerging Market Currency Fund 
generated positive returns over the period 
as emerging market currencies generally 
appreciated against a basket of developed 
market currencies. Returns in the fund 
were mainly attributable to the appreciation 
of the Russian rouble, Brazilian real and 
South African rand, which appreciated as 
an improvement in global growth prospects 
saw commodity prices rise throughout the 
period. In addition, the diversified developed 
market shorts contributed positively to 
performance as the US dollar appreciated 
against the euro, Japanese yen and 
pound sterling.
Record’s Multi-Strategy mandates 
combining Carry, Emerging Market, 
Momentum and Value strategies delivered 
positive performance over the period. 
Gains were driven by positive returns in all 
four strands. In the Value strategy, returns 
were primarily driven by long positions in 
the Japanese yen and the US dollar. The 
US dollar appreciated over the year as the 
Federal Reserve delivered two interest rate 
hikes during the period, and as markets 
anticipated fiscal stimulus following Donald 
Trump’s surprise Presidential election 
win. Positive returns in the Momentum 
strand were driven by a short position in 
the pound, which depreciated significantly 
in the run up to, and following the UK’s 
decision to leave the European Union in 
June. Gains in the Carry strategy were 
driven by a long position in the New 
Zealand dollar which appreciated as 
commodity export prices recovered, and a 
short position in the Swedish krona which 
depreciated on account of a dovish policy 
stance by the central bank, despite a 
stream of positive economic data.

Gearing
The Currency for Return product group 
allows clients to select the level of exposure 
they desire in their currency programmes. 
The pooled funds have historically offered 
clients a range of gearing and target 
volatility levels. The segregated mandates 
allow clients to individually pick the level of 
gearing and/or volatility target.
It should be emphasised that in this case 
“gearing” refers to the multiple of the 
maximum size of the aggregate forward 
contracts in the currency programme, to the 
pooled fund’s net assets or the segregated 
mandate size. This is limited by the 
willingness of counterparty banks to take 
exposure to the pooled fund or segregated 
client. Gearing in this context does not 
involve borrowing.

AUME movements
The Group has seen net inflows of 
$3.2 billion during the year arising from 
inflows from both new and existing 
clients of $9.2 billion offset by outflows 
of $6.0 billion.
Passive Hedging AUME continued to grow 
reaching $48.2 billion by the end of the 
year (2016: $43.4 billion), an increase of 
11%. Net inflows of +$2.5 billion were from 
a combination of new and existing clients 
with the net impact of external factors 
contributing a further +$2.3 billion.
Dynamic Hedging benefited from inflows 
of +$0.7 billion, being partially offset 
by external factors with an impact of 
$0.5 billion, ending the year at $6.3 billion 
(2016: $6.1 billion).
Currency for Return AUME was boosted by 
inflows of +$0.3 billion to our Multi-Strategy 
product contributing to an increase from 
$0.6 billion to $1.0 billion over the period.
Multi-product AUME was broadly 
unchanged with outflows of -$0.4 billion 
being offset by the net impact of external 
factors of +$0.3 billion.
Equity and other market 
performance
Record’s AUME is affected by movements 
in equity and other market levels because 
substantially all the Passive and Dynamic 
Hedging, and some of the Multi-product 
mandates, are linked to equity and other 
market levels. Market performance 
increased AUME by $5.4 billion in the 
year to 31 March 2017.
Further detail on the composition of assets 
underlying our Hedging and Multi-product 
mandates is provided below to help 
illustrate more clearly the impact of equity

these mandate sizes.

The percentage of the Group’s AUME which

AUME by $3.3 billion over the year. This 
movement does not have an equivalent 
impact on the sterling value of fee income.
At 31 March 2017, the split of AUME 
by base currency was 21% in sterling,

Strategic report: business review
Overview
In a strong year for the Group, we 
are pleased to report our highest ever 
value of AUME, which finished the 
year at $58.2 billion (+10%), driven 
predominantly by asset flows of 
+$3.2 billion (2016: -$2.3 billion) and 
increases in underlying equity and other 
market movements of +$5.4 billion 
(2016: +$0.4 billion). Client numbers 
increased for the fifth successive year, 
reaching 59 at the year-end, and now 
standing a third higher than they were 
four years ago (44). 
The Group’s total revenue increased by 
13% over last year, assisted by the tailwind 
afforded by sterling depreciation following 
the UK referendum vote and its effect on 
those Group revenues denominated in 
the base currencies of our clients, when 
retranslated into sterling.
Total operating expenditure (excluding 
variable remuneration costs) increased by 
5% over the prior year, driven by increases 
in both personnel costs and non-personnel 
costs, at 4% and 7% respectively. Variable 
remuneration costs relating to the Group 
Profit Share (“GPS”) scheme increased by 
10% in line with the increase in underlying 
operating profit (calculated before GPS).
As a result of above, the operating profit 
margin increased to 36% (2016: 32%) for 
the year, leading to an increase in profit 
before tax of 26% over the prior year.
In a strong year for the Group, we are pleased 
to report our highest ever value of AUME, 
which finished the year at $58.2 billion.

Passive Hedging management fees grew by

assisted by the effects of translating fees 
charged in clients’ base currencies during 
a period of sterling weakness.
Management fees from Dynamic Hedging 
remained broadly level with last year at 
£5.6 million despite the full year impact 
this year of the loss of management 
fees from a £900 million client mandate 
announced in October 2015, albeit offset 
by inflows of $0.7 billion, again assisted by 
translation effects.
Inflows of $0.4 billion into Currency for 
Return mandates in the year alongside 
sterling translation effects resulted in a 
25% increase to related management 
fees for the year. Total Multi-product 
management fees decreased by 23% as a 
consequence of net outflows of -$0.5 billion 
in the year, further underlining the variability 
of certain mandates.
Management fees by product

Average management fee rates for all 
product lines have remained broadly 
constant throughout the year ended 
31 March 2017.

Aggregate Currency for Return fee rates 
on AUME have decreased including as 
a result of increasing portfolio sizes for 
mandates with defined volatility targets, 
where the fee rate is linked to the target 
volatility. Certain Multi-Strategy portfolio 
sizes have been increased as volatility in 
the underlying strategies has fallen and 
correlations between strategies have 
increased, reducing the volatility of the 
aggregate return to the client. This effect 
may reverse in future periods. Fee rates 
based on volatility targets have not changed 
during the period.

FINANCIAL  
REVIEW CONTINUED
Performance fees
Performance fees can be earned either 
from Currency for Return or Dynamic 
Hedging programmes, dependent on 
the individual client agreement. Record 
had two mandates during the financial 
year incorporating a performance fee 
component, both of which are Dynamic 
Hedging mandates. There was no 
performance fee earned in the year 
(2016: £0.3 million).
Other income
Other income is principally from gains 
made on forward foreign exchange 
contracts employed by the funds 
seeded by the Group and consolidated 
under IFRS, and includes gains of 
£0.8 million consolidated on behalf of 
the Non-controlling interests invested in 
the funds. Revenue from the licensing 
agreement with WisdomTree and hedging 
gains or losses on revenues denominated 
in currencies other than sterling, and 
other foreign exchange gains or losses 
are also included.
Expenditure
Operating expenditure
Group operating expenditure (excluding 
variable remuneration) increased by 5% 
to £11.7 million for the year. Personnel 
costs increased by 4% over the prior 
year in line with the growth in employee 
numbers, which rose from an average of 
69 last year to 73 this year. An increase 
in non-personnel costs of 7% was driven 
predominantly by the increase in occupancy 
costs associated with a new lease on 
larger offices for Record’s headquarters 
in Windsor UK, plus moving the US office 
from Atlanta to New York, both at higher 
market rentals than was previously the case 
(see note 23 on page 100 of the financial 
statements for further detail).
Group Profit Share Scheme
The Group operates a Group Profit Share 
Scheme such that a long-term average 
of 30% of underlying operating profit 
before Group Profit Share (“GPS”) is 
made available to be awarded to staff. 
The Remuneration Committee has agreed 
that for the year ended 31 March 2017, 
the Group Profit Share Scheme is 30% of 
pre-GPS operating profit. This represents 
£3.3 million, an increase of 10% over the 
previous financial year and in line with Group 
financial performance. Directors and senior 
management in Record are required to take 
a proportion of this remuneration in the 
form of shares which are subject to lock-up 
arrangements under the scheme rules.
Under the scheme rules, the intention is to 
purchase shares required, in the market 
following the announcement of interim 
and full year financial results.
Operating profit and margins
On a fully consolidated basis, the operating 
profit for the year increased by 26% to 
£8.6 million and the Group operating margin 
increased to 36% (2016: 32%).
Management also considers operating 
profit  and profit before tax on an 
“underlying” basis, which excludes the 
impact of the income and expenditure 
attributable to non-controlling interests 
(i.e. gains and losses attributable to other 
investors in the seed funds which are 
consolidated into the Group’s financial 
statements on a line-by-line basis, as 
required under IFRS). This reflects the 
approach used for internal management 
reporting and is considered to represent 
more accurately the core revenues and 
costs driving current and future cash flows 
of the business. Underlying operating 
profit for the year was £7.7 million 
(2016: £6.9 million) with underlying profit 
before tax for the year of £7.9 million 
(2016: £7.0 million).
Cash flow
The Group’s year end cash and cash 
equivalents stood at £19.1 million 
(2016: £21.7 million). The cash generated 
from operating activities before tax 
was £8.7 million (2016: £7.1 million), 
with £1.6 million paid in taxation 
(2016: £1.6 million) and £3.6 million paid 
in dividends (2016: £3.7 million). At the 
year end, the Group held money market 
instruments with maturities between three 
and twelve months, worth £18.1 million 
(2016: £13.0 million). These instruments 
are managed as cash by the Group but 
are not classified as cash under IFRS rules 
(see note 16 to the financial statements for 
more details).
Dividends
Shareholders received an interim ordinary 
dividend of 0.825 pence per share 
paid on 23 December 2016, equivalent 
to £1.8 million. As disclosed in the 
Chairman’s statement on page 4, the 
Board is recommending an increased 
ordinary dividend in line with the improved 
profitability of the Group and in addition a 
special dividend returning the excess of 
this year’s earnings over the total ordinary 
dividend to shareholders. Consequently, 
the Board recommends paying a final 
ordinary dividend of 1.175 pence per 
share, equivalent to £2.6 million, taking 
the overall ordinary dividend to 2.00 pence 
per share, and simultaneously paying a 
special dividend of 0.91 pence per share 
(equivalent to £2.0 million), making the total 
dividends paid for the year of £6.3 million 
equal to earnings of 2.91 pence per share 
(total ordinary dividend paid in respect of 
the prior year ended 31 March 2016 was 
1.65 pence per share, and there was no 
special dividend paid).
Subject to shareholder approval, the final 
ordinary dividend will be paid simultaneously 
with the special dividend on 2 August 2017 
to shareholders on the register on 
30 June 2017, the ex-dividend date being 
29 June 2017. All ordinary and special 
dividends for the financial year will be fully 
covered by earnings.
For the current and future financial years, 
the Board intends to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy and to consider the return 
of excess earnings over ordinary dividends 
to shareholders, potentially in the form 
of special dividends. On this basis, such 
distributions to shareholders will be 
considered on a ‘total distribution’ basis, 
such that the total distribution for any one 
financial year will at least be covered by 
earnings, whilst always being subject to 
market conditions at the time, and to any 
further excess capital assessed as required 
by the Board. Record plc Annual Report 2017

Financial stability and 
capital management
The Group’s balance sheet is strong and 
liquid with total net assets of £41.6 million at 
the end of the year, including current assets 
managed as cash totalling £37.2 million. 
The business remains cash generative, with 
net cash inflows from operating activities of 
£7.2 million for the year.
The Board’s new capital policy is to retain 
minimum capital (being equivalent to 
shareholders’ funds) within the business 
broadly equivalent to twelve months’ worth 
of future estimated operating expenses 
(excluding variable remuneration), plus 
capital assessed as sufficient to meet 
regulatory capital requirements and working 
capital purposes, and for investing in new 
opportunities for the business. To this end, 
the Group maintains a financial model 
to assist it in forecasting future capital 
requirements over a three year cycle under 
various scenarios and monitors the capital 
and liquidity positions of the Group on an 
ongoing and frequent basis. The Group has 
no debt.
Record Currency Management Limited 
(“RCML”) is a BIPRU limited licence firm 
authorised and regulated in the UK by 
the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), 
and is a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Record plc. RCML is required to submit 
semi-annual capital adequacy returns, and 
it held significant surplus capital resources 
relative to its regulatory financial resource 
requirement throughout the year. Similarly 
the Group also submits semi-annual capital 
adequacy returns but on a consolidated 
basis, taking account of the risks across 
the business assessed by the Board as 
requiring further capital. In assessing these 
risks, the Group uses an active risk-based 
approach to monitoring and managing risks, 
which includes its Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process (“ICAAP”).
The market and regulatory environment 
in which the Group operates is constantly 
evolving and the Directors consider it 
prudent to consider a three year horizon 
over which to assess the viability of the 
Group. This is consistent with the approach 
in its ICAAP , which uses scenario analysis 
to evaluate potential impacts of severe but 
plausible occurrences on the business, and 
to quantify the level of capital required to 
mitigate the financial impact to the Group. 
Such scenarios consider material events 
that may occur as a result of the principal 
risks faced by the business, for example, 
direct AUME outflows or severe reputational 
damage to the business.
Having reviewed and considered the results 
of the above, the Directors have a current, 
reasonable expectation that the Group will 
continue to operate and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the three year period of 
their assessment, to 31 March 2020.
Cautionary statement
This Annual Report contains certain 
forward-looking statements with respect to 
the financial condition, results, operations 
and business of Record. These statements 
involve risk and uncertainty because 
they relate to events and depend upon 
circumstances that will occur in the future. 
There are a number of factors that could 
cause actual results or developments to 
differ materially from those expressed or 
implied in this Annual Report. Nothing in this 
Annual Report should be construed as a 
profit forecast.
The Board has concluded that the Group is 
adequately capitalised both to continue its 
operations effectively and to meet regulatory 
requirements, due to the size and liquidity 
of balance sheet resources maintained by 
the Group.
The Group held regulatory capital resources 
based on the audited financial statements 
as at 31 March, as follows:
Regulatory capital  
resources (£ million) 2017 2016
Core Tier 1 capital  36.8 33.7
Deductions:  
intangible assets (0.2) (0.3)
Regulatory capital  
resources 36.6 33.4
Further information regarding the Group’s 
capital adequacy information can be 
found in the Group’s Pillar 3 disclosure, 
which is available on the Group’s website 
at www.recordcm.com.
Viability statement
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have 
performed a robust assessment of the 
viability of the Group considering the 
business model, the Group’s expected 
financial position, Board strategy and risk 
appetite, the Group’s solvency and liquidity 
and its principal risks.
The Directors review the financial forecasts 
and position of the Group on a regular 
basis, mindful of the need to maintain 
a strong balance sheet whilst allowing 
the Group the flexibility to adapt its 
products and services to challenging 
market conditions, or to take advantage 
of emerging business opportunities. 
The Group’s strategy and principal risks 
are assessed and reviewed regularly by 
the Board as well as by the Executive 
Committee and operational sub-committees 
within the Group. Further detail on the 
Group’s strategy and principal risks is given 
in the Strategic report on pages 10 and 28 
respectively. Record plc Annual Report 2017

The Record culture is one of integrity and accountability; 
core values that are embedded into the control 
environment surrounding all areas of the business. 
Risk management framework
Oversight of the risk management 
framework is governed by various 
committees as delegated by the Board.
The Board has delegated authority to 
the Audit and Risk Committee to provide 
oversight and independent challenge 
in relation to internal controls, risk 
management systems and procedures 
and external financial reporting.
The Executive Committee is the delegated 
decision-making body for the day-to-day 
operation of the business and includes 
executive Board members and other senior 
personnel.
The Board has delegated authority to the 
Investment Committee to approve changes 
to any of the Group’s investment processes 
and to establish and maintain policies 
for these processes. The Committee’s 
membership includes Board members 
and senior personnel including the Chief 
Investment Officer, the Chairman, the 
Chief Executive Officer, the Head of Client 
Team, the Head of Portfolio Management, 
the Head of Economic Research and 
FX Strategy and the Head of Investment 
Strategy. Investment Committee approval is 
required prior to implementation of any new 
or amended investment process or product. 
The Board has established a Risk 
Management Committee which is chaired 
by the Chief Operating Officer and has 
the Chief Financial Officer, the Head of 
Operations, the Head of Trading, the 
Head of Portfolio Management, the 
Head of Portfolio Implementation, the 
Head of Front Office Risk Management 
and the Head of Compliance and Risk 
as members. As prescribed in terms of 
reference determined by the Audit and 
Risk Committee, the Risk Management 
Committee continually reviews existing and 
new risks, and the nature of any operational 
incidents with the objective of ensuring that 
adequate systems and controls are in place 
to minimise and preferably eliminate such 
incidents and their impact on clients and 
the Group.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for risk 
and the oversight of the risk management 
process within the business. Recognising 
that risk is inherent in all of the Group’s 
business dealings, and in the markets and 
instruments in which the Group operates, 
it places a high priority on ensuring 
an integrated approach and a strong 
risk management culture is embedded 
throughout the Group, with accountability 
at all levels within the business. Effective risk 
management and strong internal controls 
are integral to the Group’s business model 
and are reflected in the risk management 
framework adopted within the business.
Lines of defence
The Record culture is one of integrity 
and accountability; core values that are 
embedded into the control environment 
surrounding all areas of the business. 
The overall risk management framework is 
underpinned by three lines of defence and is 
overseen by the Audit and Risk Committee, 
as delegated by the Board.
Within this framework the first line of 
defence provides management assurance 
and rests with line managers within 
their specific departments and with 
senior managers responsible for the 
implementation and maintenance of 
higher-level controls to ensure 
adherence to quality standards and 
regulatory requirements. Functions such 
as Compliance and Risk, Legal, HR and 
Finance provide the second line of defence 
through the drafting, implementation and 
monitoring of policies and procedures 
to align with best practice, to ensure 
compliance and to provide assurance and 
oversight for the Board and the Audit and 
Risk Committee. The third line of defence 
is performed by internal audit which 
provides independent assurance on the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management, control and governance 
processes providing recommendations to 
improve the control environment. Internal 
audit is provided by Deloitte LLP .
External independent assurance for 
shareholders is gained through the statutory 
annual external audit process which has 
been run by Grant Thornton UK LLP , with 
the same firm appointed as reporting 
accountant for the Group’s annual Audit 
and Assurance (AAF 01/06 and SSAE 16) 
reports on internal controls.
There are two types of assurance 
engagements associated with the AAF 
framework, specifically “reasonable” 
assurance engagements and “limited” 
assurance engagements. The Group 
undertakes the higher standard of 
“reasonable” assurance engagements.

Economic risk: the UK’s decision to exit 
from the EU (‘Brexit’) during the year and the 
consequent triggering of Article 50 just prior 
to the financial year-end will have economic 
ramifications both in the UK and across 
the EU. Record and its clients are subject 
to extensive EU-originated legislation, and 
there will be an impact on the business and 
its clients in terms of the legal and structural 
framework under which banking, trading and 
regulatory rules currently operate as well as 
on the ability of the business to attract and 
retain talented employees.

Record has established a Brexit Working Group to

Concentration risk: on single product or

Record’s products are all currency 
management based hence it would be 
adversely affected by a move away from 
currency by its core client base.
Record has a relatively small number of high 
value clients. For the year ended 31 March 
2017, Record’s largest client generated 
14% of revenue, and the largest five clients 
generated 57% of revenue.
For the year ended 31 March 2017, 54% 
of AUME and 34% of revenues derive from 
Passive Hedging for Swiss pension funds, 
which are required by regulation to hedge 
currency risk above a certain threshold –

Record’s commitment to client services excellence, 
the transparency of the investment process and the

is integral to retention.
The Group seeks to build long-term and close 
trusted adviser relationships with its clients, which are 
intended to assist in retaining such mandates even in 
the event of regulatory change.
Reputational risk: potentially affects 
Record’s brand and its relationships with

The principal risks faced by the Group 
including those that threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency and 
liquidity are reviewed periodically by the 
Audit and Risk Committee and as part 
of the ICAAP which is performed at least

The Group’s investment process is steered by an

one person left.
The Group considers that its office environment 
and culture, as well as its remuneration policy and 
in particular the operation of the Group Profit Share 
and Share Schemes promotes key personnel retention 
and effective risk management.
Risk from reliance on investment 
consultants: clients or potential clients may 
utilise the services of investment consultants 
to advise them in relation to investment 
products and services. Relationships 
with consultants and assisting with their 
understanding of the benefits of Record’s

continued access to such clients is available 
via the investment consultant. Failure to do 
so may result in a loss of AUME.

The Group has dedicated consultant relations staff 
and devotes considerable senior management time 
and effort to its relationships with the investment

Intervention risk: intervention by 
government, government agency or 
regulatory body such as exchange controls, 
financial transaction tax, etc. that renders 
some or all of the Group’s products 
ineffective. Such intervention may arise as 
an unintended consequence of regulatory 
reforms targeted elsewhere.
Changes in the regulatory environment 
or tax regime may make investment in 
currency less attractive to investors. 
For example, new rules for risk mitigation 
of over-the-counter derivatives not cleared 
by a central clearing party are to be 
implemented under the European Market 
Infrastructure Regulation. These rules will 
mandate variation margin for FX forward 
contracts and swaps for EU financial 
counterparties from January 2018. Such 
a requirement is a major change from the 
historic practice of many of Record’s clients 
of using non-collateralised foreign exchange 
credit lines. Such clients may consider 
moving currency hedging mandates to other 
managers who already manage assets that 
could be used as collateral, or may consider 
stopping currency hedging altogether.

Market liquidity risk: Record’s investment 
process involves high trading turnover of 
client positions in both size and volume, 
therefore it is reliant on market liquidity.
The foreign exchange market offers 
exceptionally deep liquidity, as measured 
by the ability to execute sizeable transactions 
without adversely affecting the market price. 
In recent years this liquidity has routinely been 
sustained in normal market environments, 
but has become more fragile and less reliable 
in stressed market environments.

are predominantly systematic and non-discretionary in 
nature. The Group’s proprietary system prompts trades 
that are executed by a dedicated trading team without 
discretion, thereby ensuring that portfolios are within 
the structure dictated by the investment process.
Each department has established procedures manuals 
that are available to all members of staff. The adherence 
to these procedures is checked regularly through the 
compliance monitoring programme, AAF and SSAE 16 
reviews and the internal audit review process.
A dedicated portfolio management team oversees the 
investment process and a dedicated and independent 
Front Office Risk Management team provides 
post-trade compliance assurances, including changes 
to any static data which may impact the behaviour of 
the systematic processes.
Automated post-trade compliance tests are used to 
monitor whether programmes are running in line with 
expectations, and identify any potential issues that may 
need to be resolved in a timely manner. Record plc Annual Report 2017

Operational risk continued
Operational risks are broad in nature and inherent in all activities and processes performed across the business, and all other businesses.
They include the risk that operational flaws result in business losses – through error or fraud, the inability to capitalise on market opportunities, 
or weaknesses in systems and controls.
Risk ownership:

Counterparty risk: Record executes 
derivative transactions with large banks as the 
counterparty, on behalf of clients. As an over 
the counter (“OTC”) product, these contracts 
inherently contain a degree of counterparty 
risk with the counterparty bank. Default by 
any of these counterparties could indirectly 
lead to impairment of Record’s standing in the 
currency management markets with investors 
and investment consultants and thus may 
result in the loss of AUME and/or fee income.
  Risk

 Profitability
On a daily basis, Record monitors the credit ratings 
(and other indicators of creditworthiness) of the 
counterparties Record has dealings with and the RMC 
maintains an Approved Counterparty List (“ACL”). 
Changes are noted against a comprehensive Credit 
Risk Policy overseen by the RMC that meets at least 
on a monthly basis. Reallocations of exposures to 
certain counterparties may follow the daily review in 
order to ensure a prudent spread of counterparty 
credit risk.
The Group is also enhancing its systems to offer 
collateral and cash management services to clients, 
which will mitigate counterparty risk.

More than 80% of Group revenues are 
denominated in a currency other than sterling, 
the Group’s functional and reporting currency,

sterling based resulting in a risk to profit in 
periods of sterling strength.

The Group hedges its non-sterling income on a monthly

In conducting its business operations, 
the Group has a responsibility to its 
stakeholders and the environment. 
Our stakeholders, with whom we maintain 
an ongoing dialogue, include shareholders, 
clients, employees, regulators and the 
local community.
Our approach to corporate social 
responsibility is built around three key areas:
• community;
• workplace; and
• environment.
Community
During the course of the year, the Group 
made charitable donations totalling 
£14,719. Our charitable giving is focused on 
employee choice, with the Group matching 
employee donations and sponsorship. We 
also provide financial assistance to students 
studying at Balliol College, Oxford through a 
half-bursary scheme, which provides grants 
to students who aim to pursue ambitions 
which will benefit the wider community, for 
example in medical or charitable fields. 
The Group continues to encourage 
employees to participate in fundraising 
activities for charitable causes. This year 
employees participated in a variety of 
events, including charity lunches and a 
number of dress-down days.
The Group has an established internship 
programme for students and during 
the year we welcomed interns from 
Oxford University, Cambridge University, 
ETH Zürich and Ulm University, Germany.

Human rights
Record complies fully with appropriate 
human rights legislation in the countries 
in which it operates.
Workplace
Record is committed to providing a working 
environment in which bright, dynamic and 
committed individuals thrive. We believe 
that investing in our staff and developing 
their potential is key to the success of the 
business and our policies and practices 
reflect this. 
Since 28 November 2016, all UK staff 
have enjoyed the benefits of the newly 
refurbished offices on the Second 
and Third Floors of Morgan House 
in Madeira Walk, Windsor.
The new office layout on the Second Floor 
has been designed to allow all departments 
to continue to work together in an open 
plan environment. The open plan office 
allows ease of communication between 
departments, as well as enabling staff to 
work closely with senior management.
The Third Floor has been designed to 
accommodate additional meeting rooms 
as well as a generous breakout area for 
staff, with a large kitchen area and space 
for recreational and fitness activities. The 
new office environment is indicative of the 
Group’s commitment to staff welfare and to 
providing a happy and stimulating working 
environment. 
The office environment and culture 
promotes staff development and training. 
All staff are invited to participate in monthly 
company update meetings which are led 
by the Chief Executive Officer. The Group 
also provides study support to employees 
who wish to pursue relevant professional 
qualifications. The Board has established 
a staff-run welfare committee which 
organises team-building and other social 
events enhancing interaction between 
different departments and different grades 
within the business.
In addition, the Group provides a number 
of different benefits to employees including 
pension, private medical cover, life 
insurance, permanent health insurance and 
subsidised gym membership. All employees 
are rewarded through the Group Profit 
Share Scheme and have the opportunity to 
acquire shares in Record plc through this 
scheme, as well as through the Record plc 
Share Incentive Plan.

Equal opportunities and diversity
The Group’s objectives include ensuring 
that all staff are provided with equal 
opportunities and that the workplace is 
free of discrimination. The Group aims to 
ensure that the recruitment process is fair 
and is carried out objectively, systematically 
and in line with the requirements of 
employment law.
The Group ensures all staff are aware that 
it is not acceptable to discriminate, harass 
or victimise someone, and that it is also 
unlawful and such behaviour will not be 
tolerated under any circumstance. 
The Group believes that valuing what is 
unique about individuals and drawing on 
their different perspectives and experience 
will add value to the way the Group does 
business. By accessing, recruiting and 
developing talent from the widest possible 
pool the Group can gain an insight into 
different markets and better support 
client needs. The Group aims to create 
a productive environment, representative 
of different cultures and groups, where 
everyone has an equal chance to succeed.

Environment
The Group seeks to minimise its carbon 
footprint through recognising the 
environmental impact of its activities, reducing 
that impact through responsible procurement 
of goods and services, and offsetting its 
remaining carbon emissions. The Group first 
assessed its carbon footprint in July 2006, 
and has offset its carbon emissions since 
then through investment in renewable energy 
projects, currently in Brazil.

CHAIRMAN’S  
INTRODUCTION
Chairman’s statement
The Board works closely with the Group’s 
highly experienced management team to 
implement a strong, effective governance 
framework which supports Record’s 
dedicated operational teams in delivering 
a high quality service to all our clients. 
We believe that the long-term growth 
and success of the Record Group has 
always been underpinned by these robust 
corporate governance practices.
The UK and global regulatory and 
governance environments continue to 
evolve at a rapid pace and whilst the 
Board and I are confident that the Group’s 
governance arrangements remain effective, 
regulatory change will continue to be an 
area of ongoing attention.
Neil Record
Chairman

CORPORATE  
GOVERNANCE REPORT
Corporate culture
Since the business was first established in 
1983 Record has endeavoured to put the 
interests and needs of our clients first and 
this cultural belief is encouraged and deeply 
embedded within all business functions. 
The Board has worked hard to ensure that 
the importance of client focus through 
diligence, transparency, accountability 
and probity has been disseminated to all 
staff, contractors and consultants across 
the Group.
The UK Corporate 
Governance Code
The Board has adopted the principles 
established in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code September 2014 and 
its previous versions (all referred to as 
the “Code”) since its Admission to the 
Official List of the UK Listing Authority in 
December 2007.
Listed companies are required under the 
Financial Conduct Authority Listing Rules 
either to comply with the provisions of the 
Code or explain to investors in their next 
annual report why they have not done so.
As a non-FTSE 350 company, Record plc 
is classed as a smaller company under the 
Code. The Group has been in compliance 
with the Code since Admission, except in 
particular limited circumstances where the 
provisions apply specifically to FTSE 350 
companies: 
• the Board does not comprise a majority 
of independent non-executive directors; 
• the annual Board performance evaluation 
is not externally facilitated; and
• Directors are not re-appointed on 
an annual basis.
In all such instances Record plc has 
reviewed the appropriateness of the 
provisions to determine whether they should 
be applied or if departure is justified. The 
Board is satisfied that these decisions are 
in the best interest of the business and 
are not detrimental to the high standards 
of corporate governance they have 
established for the Group.
The departures from the Code are fully 
explained in the following narrative.
Corporate governance framework
The Board has established a framework of 
committees and sub-committees to ensure 
robust corporate governance practices 
throughout the business. The Board is 
confident that this structure is appropriate 
and that the delegation of responsibilities 
allows the business to operate in a 
systematic manner and to respond rapidly 
when issues arise.
The diagram on page 37 gives an overview 
of the Group’s core governance framework.
The Board of Directors
Board responsibilities
The Board has a schedule of matters 
specifically reserved to it for decision 
and approval, which includes but is not 
limited to:
• determining the Group’s long-term 
strategy and objectives;
• significant capital expenditure;
• the Group’s annual and interim reports 
and preliminary announcements;
• setting interim dividend and 
recommendation of final dividend 
payments;
• effectiveness of internal controls;
• authorisation of Directors’ conflicts or 
possible conflicts of interest; and
• communication with shareholders and 
the stock market.
Board membership
The Board is headed by Neil Record 
(Chairman), with the Executive Directors, 
James Wood-Collins (Chief Executive 
Officer), Steve Cullen (Chief Financial 
Officer), Bob Noyen (Chief Investment 
Officer) and Leslie Hill (Head of Client Team). 
There are currently three Non-executive 
Directors, David Morrison, being the Senior 
Independent Director, Jane Tufnell and 
Rosemary Hilary.
Rosemary Hilary was appointed to the 
Board on 1 June 2016. Cees Schrauwers 
and Andrew Sykes retired from the Board 
in September 2016 having served the 
business for almost nine years.
On an ongoing basis at least half the 
Board members have not been independent 
Non-executive Directors as required by 
the Code for FTSE 350 companies but 
the Board does comply with the Code’s 
provision for smaller companies to have 
at least two independent Non-executive 
Directors. The Board considers that the 
existing composition and the planned 
structure to have three independent 
Non-executive Directors going forward 
is appropriate given the current size and 
structure of the business.
All Directors have access to independent 
professional advice, when required, at the 
Company’s expense as well as to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary. 
The division of responsibilities between 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is 
clearly established, set out in writing and 
agreed by the Board. 
Role of the Chairman
The Chairman is responsible for leadership 
of the Board. He is also responsible for 
overseeing the activities of the Chief 
Executive Officer and providing advice, 
guidance and support to the Executive 
Team. He works with the Board to develop 
Company strategy and support its 
implementation. The Chairman is a principal 
ambassador of Record and a guardian of 
the Group’s ethos and values.
Role of the Chief Executive Officer
The Group Chief Executive is responsible 
for the executive management of the Group 
to grow the business profitably while acting 
in the interests of all stakeholders – clients, 
shareholders, employees and industry 
regulators and upholding the core values 
of Record. 
Role of the Independent 
Non-executive Directors
The Non-executive Directors are responsible 
for upholding high standards of integrity and 
probity; providing constructive challenge 
and helping to develop proposals on 
strategy.
In determining the independence of 
Non-executive Directors, the Board has 
taken into consideration the guidance 
provided by the Code. The Board considers 
David Morrison, Jane Tufnell and Rosemary 
Hilary to be independent at the current time. 
Neil Record is a Non-executive Chairman, 
although he is not considered to be 
independent.  Record plc Annual Report 2017

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information
Re-election of directors
Under the Code, all directors should 
be submitted for re-election at regular 
intervals, subject to continued satisfactory 
performance. The Code states that all 
directors of FTSE 350 companies should be 
subject to annual election by shareholders. 
All other directors should be subject to 
election by shareholders at the first Annual 
General Meeting after their appointment, 
and to re-election at the Annual General 
Meeting thereafter at intervals of no more 
than three years.
Under the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the minimum number of 
Directors shall be two and the maximum 
shall be twelve. Directors appointed by the 
Board must offer themselves for election 
at the next Annual General Meeting of 
the Company following their appointment 
but they are not taken into account in 
determining the Directors or the number of 
Directors who are to retire by rotation at that 
meeting. The minimum number of Directors 
who should retire by rotation is one third.
The Board has reviewed these provisions 
in the Articles against the recommendations 
of the Code and has determined that, 
given the size and structure of the business, 
the Articles are appropriate and annual 
re-election is unnecessary.
Conflicts of interest
Under UK company law, a Director 
must seek authorisation before taking 
up any position with another company 
that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, 
with the Group’s interests.
The Articles of Association contain 
provisions to allow the Directors to authorise 
situations of potential conflicts of interest 
so that a Director is not in breach of their 
duty under company law. The Board is 
responsible for conducting an annual review 
of the Conflicts Register and confirming 
that, where relevant, conflicts have been 
dealt with appropriately, and that the 
process for dealing with them is operating 
efficiently. All existing external appointments 
for each Director were considered and 
authorised by the Board in September 2016 
as part of this annual review.
Board member diversity
The Board has three female members in a 
board of eight and thus women make up 
38% of the Board. It is the Board’s aim to 
maintain a diverse mix of skills, experience, 
knowledge and backgrounds across its 
members to ensure that the Board operates 
effectively. The Board’s opinion is that the 
current composition of members meets 
these criteria and is therefore appropriate 
for the business at the present time. Future 
executive director succession planning will 
take into account the benefits of diversity 
including gender diversity as set out in the 
Company’s Board Diversity Policy. Diversity 
in the workplace is detailed on page 35.
Board meetings
The Board met six times between 
1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017 to review 
financial performance and to follow the 
schedule of matters reserved for its decision 
and approval. Comprehensive Board 
papers, comprising an agenda and formal 
reports and briefing documents are sent 
to Directors in advance of each meeting. 
Directors are regularly informed by senior 
executives and external advisers on the 
Group’s affairs, including commercial, 
regulatory, legal, corporate governance 
and other relevant matters.
Appropriate and timely notice is given of all 
Board meetings and all Directors receive 
information in advance so that if they are 
not able to attend their input can be tabled 
and taken into consideration. The Board 
has twice yearly offsite strategy meetings 
and additional meetings as required to 
address specific issues. Any concerns 
raised by Directors which are not resolved 
are recorded in the Board minutes. No such 
matters were noted during the year ended 
31 March 2017.

GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
Board induction and training
New Directors appointed to the Board 
receive advice as to the legal obligations 
arising from the role of a director of a 
UK listed company as part of a tailored 
induction programme. This training includes 
briefings with the Chairman, Executive 
Directors and senior management to help 
new directors to familiarise themselves 
with their duties and the Group’s culture 
and values, strategy, business model, 
businesses, operations, risks and 
governance arrangements.
The Company Secretary, under the 
direction of the Chairman, is responsible 
for maintaining an adequate continuing 
education programme, reminding the 
Directors of their duties and obligations on 
a regular basis, ensuring good information 
flow between the Board, its committees and 
management and assisting with Directors’ 
continuing professional development needs.
Board performance evaluation
The Board is required by the Code to 
undertake an annual evaluation of its 
performance. The Code states that 
“evaluation of the board should consider the 
balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge of the company on the 
board, its diversity, including gender, how 
the board works together as a unit, and 
other factors relevant to its effectiveness”.
The Code recommends that evaluation 
of the board of FTSE 350 companies 
should be externally facilitated at least 
every three years. The Board agreed that 
full external evaluation of performance 
was not necessary at the current time but 
that a group discussion with all members 
present and a third party facilitator would 
be an efficient way to canvas opinions. 
An external facilitator was identified and 
the group discussion took place in April 
2017, focusing on the Board approach 
to business strategy and succession 
planning. The external facilitator selected 
was an experienced businessman 
and serial entrepreneur with extensive 
board insight and no previous links to 
Record. The comments made during this 
meeting were recorded by the Company 
Secretary and collated into a report which 
documented the observations made and 
assessed the activities and achievements 
of the Board and its sub-committees during 
the period under review. Members were 
also invited to approach the Chairman or 
Company Secretary with any individual 
concerns or comments they had. No 
concerns were raised directly to the 
Chairman or the Company Secretary.
The review of the comments made during 
the evaluation process identified no serious 
concerns over the functioning of the Board, 
its members or its Committees. A number 
of objectives for Board performance 
improvement over the short term have been 
set. It is the responsibility of the Chairman 
and Company Secretary to ensure these 
initiatives for improvement are implemented 
over the coming months.
Individual appraisal of each director’s 
performance is undertaken by the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chairman. The 
Senior Independent Director conducted 
an appraisal of the performance of the 
Chairman with input from the other Board 
members. The outcome of these appraisals 
in 2017 was positive and all roles were 
considered to be undertaken effectively.
Board committees
The Board has established three Board 
committees and delegated authority to each 
committee to enable it to execute its duties 
appropriately. The annual reports of the 
three committees provide a statement of 
each committee’s activities in the year:
• Nomination Committee – report set out 
on pages 44 and 45;
• Audit and Risk Committee – report set 
out on pages 46 to 49; and 
• Remuneration Committee – report set 
out on pages 50 to 64. 
The committees operate on written terms 
of reference, which are reviewed annually 
and which are available on the Company’s 
website or on request from the Company 
Secretary at the registered office address. 
The Chair of each Committee reports 
regularly to the Board.
The work undertaken by the Audit and Risk, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees 
was reviewed by Rosemary Hilary, David 
Morrison and Jane Tufnell respectively to 
assess each committee’s effectiveness 
during the year. The reviews concluded 
that the committees were operating in an 
effective manner and no concerns were 
raised and these conclusions were reported 
to the Board accordingly.
Operational Committees
Executive Committee
The Board has delegated responsibility for 
the day to day operation of the business 
within defined delegated authorities to the 
Executive Committee, which comprises 
the Chief Executive officer as chair, the 
three other Executive Directors, the Chief 
Operating Officer and a Managing Director. 
Regular attendees of meetings held include 
the Head of Compliance and Risk and the 
Head of Human Resources. The Committee 
meets formally once a month and holds 
weekly operational update meetings. 
Standing agenda review items for formal 
meetings include clients and client 
prospects, the management accounts, 
departmental KPI data, compliance issues, 
projects and resourcing. Operational policy 
documents are regularly reviewed by the 
Committee prior to formal approval by the 
Board or the appropriate Board Committee. 
Minutes of all meetings are circulated to the 
Board for review and comment. Record plc Annual Report 2017

for authorising changes to existing 
investment processes and for approving 
new investment strategies to the Investment 
Committee. The Committee consists of 
the Chief Investment Officer, the Chief 
Executive Officer, the Head of Client Team, 
the Group Chairman, the Head of Portfolio 
Management, the Head of Economic 
Research and FX Strategy and the Head

internal developments and external events. 
Reports on the activities of the Committee 
are presented at each formal Board meeting 
for review and comment.
Risk Management Committee

of Record Currency Management Limited, 
the regulated entity within the Group. 
The Chief Operating Officer, the Chief 
Financial Officer, the Head of Operations, 
the Head of Portfolio Management, the 
Head of Portfolio Implementation, the 
Head of Trading, the Head of Compliance 
and Risk and the Head of Front Office 
Risk Management are all members of the 
Committee. The Committee meets at least 
once a month and as necessary in response 
to individual or specific events requiring 
review. The minutes of meetings are 
circulated to the Audit and Risk Committee 
and a report is presented by the Chief 
Operating Officer at each Audit and Risk 
Committee meeting.
Operational Sub-Committees
Investment Management Group
The Investment Committee has granted 
the Investment Management Group the 
authority to make certain decisions to 
override systematic investment processes 
and manage discretionary investment 
processes as sub-delegated by the 
Investment Committee in policy documents. 
The Investment Management Group 
consists of the Chief Investment Officer, 
the Head of Portfolio Management and 
the Head of Economic Research and FX 
Strategy. The Group meets as necessary 
and minutes are circulated to the Portfolio 
Management Group, the Investment 
Committee and the Risk Management 
Committee once approved and are 
available for inspection by the Board 
and Executive Committee.
Portfolio Management Group
The Investment Committee has granted the 
Portfolio Management Group the authority 
to plan and implement process overrides as 
instructed by the Investment Management 
Group and as sub-delegated by the 
Investment Committee in policy documents. 
The Portfolio Management Group consists 
of the Chief Operating Officer, the Head 
of Portfolio Implementation, the Head 
of Trading, the Head of Operations, the 
Head of Investment Strategy and the 
Head of Reporting and is chaired by 
the Head of Trading. The Group meets 
as frequently as necessary to fulfil its 
obligations and minutes are available to 
the Investment Management Group, the 
Risk Management Committee and the 
Investment Committee, the Executive 
Committee and the Board.
Internal control and 
risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s systems of internal control and the 
management of significant risks. The Board 
sets appropriate policies on internal control 
which are reviewed annually, and authority is 
delegated to the following committees and 
senior personnel to implement and apply 
those policies:
• the Executive Committee;
• the Investment Committee;
• the Audit and Risk Committee; and
• the Risk Management Committee
The Board seeks ongoing assurance from 
these Committees and senior management 
about the effectiveness of the internal 
controls, which include operational and 
compliance controls, risk management 
and the Group’s high-level internal control 
arrangements. Such a system of internal 
controls is designed to manage, rather than 
eliminate, risk of failure to meet business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatements or loss.
Further information on the Group’s risk 
management systems is provided on 
pages 28 to 33 of the Strategic report.
The Audit and Risk Committee has 
undertaken a review of the effectiveness 
of internal controls for the year ended 
31 March 2017 and is satisfied that the 
internal control environment is appropriate 
(see Internal controls and risk management 
on page 48).

NOMINATION  
COMMITTEE REPORT
Role of the Committee
The Nomination Committee is responsible 
for ensuring that the structure, size and 
composition of the Board is fit to perform 
its duties, and for giving full consideration to 
succession planning for Directors and other 
senior executives. The Committee is also 
responsible for identifying and nominating 
for the Board’s approval candidates to fill 
Board vacancies as and when they arise.
When considering possible candidates, the 
Committee evaluates the skills, knowledge 
and experience of the candidates and, in 
the case of non-executive appointments, 
their other commitments. The Committee 
is mindful of the benefits of a diverse board 
with a broad range of skills and experience.
Membership of the Committee
The Committee was chaired by David 
Morrison until 22 September 2016 when 
Jane Tufnell took over the role. Jane is 
supported by the other Non-executive 
Directors, David Morrison and Rosemary 
Hilary and the Group Chairman, Neil Record.
During the year there were two other 
independent Non-executive Directors 
who served on the Committee until their 
retirement in September 2016:
• Cees Schrauwers (appointed 
3 December 2007, resigned 
22 September 2016); and
• Andrew Sykes (appointed 3 December 
2007, resigned 22 September 2016).
Committee meetings
The Committee met on five occasions 
during the year ended 31 March 2017 
and invited the Chief Executive Officer, 
Company Secretary and the Head of 
Human Resources to join the meetings as 
the Committee considered appropriate. 
Meeting attendance is detailed on page 41.
The Chair of the Nomination Committee 
reported regularly to the Board on the 
Committee’s activities, identifying any 
matters where any action was deemed 
to be required and recommendations as 
considered appropriate.
Key Committee activities
Independent director search
The principal focus has been on appointing 
a new independent director to replace David 
Morrison who will no longer be deemed to 
be independent from September 2018. 
Discussion took place between the 
Directors in early 2017, both formally 
and informally, about the skills required 
for the independent director role. A job 
description and person specifications 
have been prepared and tailored to reflect 
the requirements for the role. It has been 
agreed that the search objective should be 
to identify an independent director by the 
end of 2017 to allow a period of handover 
and transition before David Morrison leaves.
The Committee has agreed that a 
sub-committee comprising Jane Tufnell 
and Neil Record should have delegated 
responsibility for initiating the search 
process and appointing Norman Broadbent 
as the external search consultancy. 
Norman Broadbent is a signatory to the 
Voluntary Code of Conduct on Gender 
Diversity and is independent of Record.
A shortlist of candidates has yet to be 
identified. Such candidates will meet all 
members of the Board as part of the 
selection process. The Board will consider 
more than one appointment should 
sufficient high calibre candidates present 
themselves. Any appointment made will be 
subject to regulatory approval by the FCA. 
Board Diversity Policy
The Board Diversity Policy was reviewed 
by the Committee in May 2016 and again 
in May 2017. The Committee agreed the 
policy remained appropriate and that no 
amendments were necessary.
The Committee has acknowledged that 
future executive director succession 
planning should embrace the benefits of 
diversity. Accordingly, the Committee plans 
to take into account the benefits of diversity 
in the current independent director search 
to ensure that any individual selected will 
add to the Board’s mix of perspective, 
experience, background and personal 
attributes. Record plc Annual Report 2017

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information
Board membership
The Committee reviewed peer Board 
membership as part of an evaluation of 
Board structure. The Committee is content 
that the current composition of the Board 
remains appropriate and that the time 
commitment required of Non-executive 
Directors is consistent with the nature 
and size of the business. 
Succession planning
The Committee continues to consider what 
additional skills are needed on the Board 
and is keen to consider the appointment 
of suitable external candidates should they 
present themselves.
Management has continued to deploy 
strategies to attract, recruit and retain 
talented individuals with client focused 
and sales skills, and has focused on 
nurturing these individuals to become future 
executives. The Committee is supportive of 
this approach to succession planning and 
has encouraged management to continue 
to pursue and develop this long-term 
approach.
Committee evaluation
An internal review of Committee 
effectiveness was overseen by the Chair of 
the Committee in May 2017. The conclusion 
was that the Committee had been effective 
in carrying out its duties.
Annual General Meeting
Leslie Hill, James Wood-Collins and David 
Morrison are due to retire by rotation 
and stand for re-election at the 2017 
Annual General Meeting. The Committee 
met to review the Directors standing 
for re-election, taking into account their 
ongoing effectiveness and commitment. 
The Committee agreed that Leslie, 
James and David continue to make 
effective and valuable contributions to the 
Board’s deliberations and accordingly the 
Committee has recommended the Board 
approve a resolution in respect of their 
re-election by shareholders.
Under Listing Rules the appointment of 
independent directors must be approved 
by a simple majority of all shareholders and 
by a simple majority of the independent 
shareholders. Further details are set out in 
the 2017 Notice of Annual General Meeting. 
The Chair of the Nomination Committee 
will be available to answer any questions 
relating to the Committee and its activities 
at the Annual General Meeting.
Looking forward
As well as considering the standing items 
of business, the Committee will continue 
to focus on appointing a new independent 
director to replace David Morrison who will 
have served a full nine-year term on the 
Board and hence will no longer be deemed 
to be independent under the Code from 
September 2018.

AUDIT AND RISK  
COMMITTEE REPORT
Role of the Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee aims 
to provide effective governance over 
risk management and external financial 
reporting through the monitoring of the 
integrity of the financial statements and the 
review of the Group’s internal controls and 
risk management systems. Its findings, 
conclusions and recommendations are 
regularly put to, and reviewed by, the Board.
The Committee’s duties include:
• monitoring the integrity of the Group’s 
and Company’s financial statements and 
any other formal announcements relating 
to the Company’s performance;
• overseeing arrangements by which 
staff may raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of financial 
reporting or other matters;
• reviewing the Group’s internal control 
and risk management procedures;
• reviewing the terms of reference for 
the Risk Management Committee;
• monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
audit function;
• making recommendations relating to 
the appointment, reappointment and 
removal of the external auditor;
• approving the remuneration and terms 
of engagement of the external auditor;
• reviewing and monitoring the 
independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor, and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the audit process; and
• overseeing the provision of any non-audit 
services by the external auditor.
The full terms of reference of the Committee 
comply with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the “Code”) and are available on 
the Group’s website or from the Company 
Secretary at the registered office address.
The Committee has direct access to 
auditors, and receives periodic reports from 
management and auditors on significant 
financial reporting issues.
Membership of the Committee
The Committee comprises all the 
independent Non-executive Directors 
as follows:
• Rosemary Hilary (appointed 
1 June 2016 and Committee Chair 
since 22 September 2016);
• David Morrison (appointed 
14 January 2010); and
• Jane Tufnell (appointed 
14 September 2015).
During the year there were two other 
independent Non-executive Directors 
who served on the Committee until their 
retirement in September 2016:
• Cees Schrauwers (Committee 
Chair from 3 December 2007 
to 22 September 2016); and
• Andrew Sykes (appointed 
3 December 2007, resigned 
22 September 2016).
Rosemary Hilary was appointed as 
Committee Chair following the resignation 
of Cees Schrauwers in September 2016. 
Given her accounting and regulatory 
background the Board considers that 
Rosemary Hilary is the most appropriate 
independent Non-executive Director for the 
role and this view is supported by the other 
current members of the Committee.
The Board is satisfied that by virtue of 
their previous experience gained in other 
organisations, the Committee members 
collectively have competence relevant to 
the sector in which the Group operates. 
The biographical details of the Committee 
members are set out on pages 38 and 39.
The composition of the Audit and Risk 
Committee complies with the Code 
provision for smaller companies requiring 
at least two independent Non-executive 
Directors throughout the year. However, 
Record has confirmed with the FCA that 
it will have at least three independent 
Non-executive Directors serving on the 
Committee at all times.
Committee meetings
The Committee met six times during the 
year ending 31 March 2017, being four 
quarterly meetings plus two additional 
meetings ahead of results announcements. 
All meetings were also attended by the 
Head of Compliance and Risk, the Chief 
Financial Officer and the Chief Operating 
Officer. The Chief Executive Officer attended 
four meetings to explain draft market 
announcement commentary. The internal 
audit partner was present at three meetings 
and the external audit partner attended 
three meetings. Two further meetings have 
been held since the year end.
The Committee also separately met with 
the Group’s auditor and the internal auditor 
with no executive management present, 
providing an opportunity for them to raise 
matters of concern in confidence.
The Committee discharged its 
responsibilities under the terms of 
reference by the following actions:
• reviewing the form, content and 
integrity of financial information prior 
to release, including the Annual and 
Interim Reports, and each of the Interim 
Management Statements;
• reviewing the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls and risk management systems;
• considering the Risk Appetite statement, 
ICAAP and Pillar 3 disclosures prior to 
their recommendation for acceptance 
by the Board;
• receiving and reviewing internal audit 
reports, discussing their findings and 
management’s responses;
• evaluating the performance of 
the internal auditor during the 
engagement period;
• reviewing the independence of the 
Group’s external auditor and the 
nature of non-audit services supplied 
by the auditor;
• reviewing the external auditor’s audit 
strategy and concluding report for the 
2017 financial statements;
• evaluating the performance of the 
external auditor over the period; and
• conducting an external audit tender 
and making recommendations to 
the Board for a resolution to be put 
to the shareholders to approve the 
appointment of the external auditor. Record plc Annual Report 2017

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information
Standing items on the agenda for Audit 
and Risk Committee meetings included 
the following:
• regular reports given by the Head of 
Compliance and Risk reviewing internal 
compliance and risk management 
activities and issues and also 
highlighting relevant UK and global 
regulatory developments which will/may 
impact the Group;
• review of a high level “Risk Heat Map” 
to ensure that key risks and risk 
movements are identified and 
addressed;
• a report from the internal auditor 
highlighting progress made against 
the agreed Internal Audit plan, 
findings from the audit, and the 
status of management’s responses 
and actions to observations and 
recommendations made;
• review of departmental KPI and KRI 
data to ensure operational risks are 
identified and appropriately addressed 
by Management; and
• review of Risk Management Committee 
meeting minutes with a summary activity 
report given by the Chief Operating 
Officer as Chairman of the Risk 
Management Committee.
During the year the Chair of the Audit and 
Risk Committee separately met with the 
key people involved in the Company’s 
governance, including the Board Chairman, 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief 
Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, 
the Head of Compliance and Risk, the 
external audit lead partner and the internal 
audit lead partner to obtain updates and 
insights into business activities.
The Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee 
reported regularly to the Board on 
the Committee’s activities, identifying 
any matters on which the Committee 
considered that action was required, and 
made recommendations on the steps to 
be taken.
Key committee activities
AUME presentation review
In October 2016 the Committee 
considered a proposal to redefine product 
classifications to clarify the link between 
AUME, average fee rates and management 
fees and to aid transparency for analysts 
and the market generally, by the addition 
of a new “Multi-product” product category 
for client mandates which have combined 
hedging and return-seeking objectives. 
The Committee noted that this was 
purely a reporting change and following 
a detailed review of the analysis it agreed 
that the proposed disclosure was a 
pragmatic solution allowing the market 
better understanding of the link between 
AUME and revenue. The Committee 
agreed that the new approach to AUME 
disclosure should be adopted for the Interim 
Report 2016 and all future announcements 
and disclosures thereafter.
Cyber security
The Committee has also focused on 
the cyber security risks to the business 
and the need to ensure that the Group’s 
systems and client data are properly 
safeguarded at all times.
During the year the Committee was keen 
that a cyber security attack response be 
added to the Group’s Business Continuity 
Plan (“BCP”). The BCP document has now 
been updated and it includes procedures 
to respond to a cyber security attack 
impacting operations. Prompted by 
the Committee the COO and CEO also 
discussed cyber security attacks which 
would not trigger the BCP procedures 
and they agreed such events should be 
covered by the Incident Management Policy. 
The Incident Management Policy has been 
updated accordingly to encompass 
such system breaches and data loss. 
The Committee has welcomed these 
developments.
Regulatory change
The Committee is highly aware of the 
rapid pace of regulatory change and has 
regularly reviewed updates from the Head 
of Compliance and Risk on the regulatory 
environment to ensure that management 
is continuing to monitor developments 
and ensure compliance as necessary 
with the legislation of the countries and 
markets in which the Group conducts 
business. Regulatory change will continue 
to be closely monitored by the Committee 
with the introduction of margin rules and 
MiFID II being the major focus over the 
coming months.
Financial reporting
The Committee reviews the half-year and 
annual results and the Annual Report, 
before recommending them to the Board 
for approval. During the year, the Committee 
considered the significant financial and 
regulatory reporting issues and judgements 
made in connection with the financial 
statements and the appropriateness 
of accounting policies. In particular, 
the Committee considered management 
reports providing an assessment of the 
internal controls environment and going 
concern. The Committee is satisfied that 
all judgements made by management 
which affect financial reporting have been 
made in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policies.
Key controls in Financial Reports are 
subject to external audit as well as being 
periodically tested by internal audit. The 
Committee also considers reports from 
the external auditor, Grant Thornton UK 
LLP (“Grant Thornton”), providing an 
independent assessment of financial 
reporting, an audit opinion on the Annual 
Report and an independent report on the 
half-year results.
The Committee is satisfied that the financial 
reporting control framework, including the 
operation of a Group-wide general ledger, 
consolidation system and preventative and 
detective controls, operated effectively after 
considering reports from both management 
and from Grant Thornton. 
The Committee has reviewed the narrative 
statements in the report and accounts 
to ensure that they were reasonable and 
consistent with the reported results, and 
also the auditor’s findings report which 
identified no significant issues. Record plc Annual Report 2017
Governance
48
The Committee was satisfied with the 
content of the Annual Report and confirmed 
there were no significant issues or concerns 
to be addressed. Therefore it unanimously 
recommended that the Annual Report be 
approved by the Board.
Internal controls and 
risk management
A significant part of the work of the 
Committee is in providing oversight and 
independent challenge to the internal 
controls and risk management systems 
of the Group. Management owns and 
maintains a high level “Risk Heat Map” 
which identifies key risk areas that may 
impact the Group. This analysis is used 
by the Committee to ensure that material 
risk areas are being appropriately identified 
and addressed by management and that 
movements in risks and business impact 
are identified promptly so that appropriate 
action can be taken.
During the year the Committee invited the 
CEO to present the top ten operational 
risks as identified by senior management 
as a backdrop for the ongoing work of the 
Committee, Compliance & Risk, the Risk 
Management Committee and internal audit.
The Committee reviews all minutes of Risk 
Management Committee meetings and 
the COO as Chair of the Risk Management 
Committee was present at all meetings to 
answer questions raised. 
The Committee has reviewed and 
evaluated the system of internal controls 
and risk management operated within the 
Group, and is satisfied that the internal 
control environment is appropriate. 
Detailed information on the Group’s risk 
management process is given in the 
Strategic report on pages 2 to 35.
Internal audit
The internal audit function undertakes a 
programme of reviews as approved by the 
Committee, reporting the results together 
with its advice and recommendations to the 
Committee. The internal audit function is 
provided by Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”) under 
an outsourcing contract which commenced 
in May 2010. Deloitte reports directly to the 
Committee and the relationship is subject to 
periodic review.
The Committee and its internal auditor have 
developed a planning process to ensure 
that the audit work performed focuses on 
significant risks. The plans include a number 
of cyclical reviews of key operational 
functions (Trading, Portfolio Implementation, 
Operations, IT systems and Compliance) 
together with thematic reviews and 
ongoing internal audit activities to monitor 
Committee reporting and meeting minutes. 
This ensures that, whilst there is focus on 
areas deemed to be higher risk, all parts of 
the business are covered over a three year 
cycle. Each review is scoped at the start 
of the audit to ensure an appropriate focus 
reflecting business activities, the market 
environment and regulatory importance at 
that time. The annual plans are periodically 
reviewed to ensure they are adapted 
as necessary to capture changes in the 
Group’s risk profile.
The Committee has received regular 
reports on the programme of reviews 
and internal audit findings at each of its 
meetings during the course of the year, has 
reviewed the findings and recommendations 
made by the internal auditor and has 
ensured that any issues arising are suitably 
addressed by management in an efficient 
and timely manner.
Following her appointment as Committee 
Chair Rosemary Hilary met privately 
with the internal audit partner to discuss 
Deloitte’s approach. 
The Committee has reviewed Deloitte’s 
work and discussed the delivery of internal 
audit with Management and is satisfied 
with the internal audit work conducted and 
the coverage and standard of the reports 
produced. The Committee is content that 
sufficient and appropriate resources are 
dedicated to the internal audit function 
and this has been reported to and noted 
by the Board.
External audit
Grant Thornton has been retained to 
perform the external audit function since the 
Company was admitted to the Official List of 
the UK Listing Authority in December 2007. 
During this time the lead engagement 
partner has been rotated twice.
The Committee has agreed the external 
auditor’s fees and reviewed and accepted 
the terms of the audit engagement letter.
The Committee has reviewed reports from 
the external auditor on their audit plan 
(including their proposed materiality level 
for the performance of the annual audit), the 
status of their audit work and issues arising 
from it. Particular focus was given to their 
testing of internal controls, their work on 
the key judgement areas and possible audit 
adjustments. The Committee has confirmed 
that no such material items remained 
unadjusted in the financial statements.
Each year, following the annual audit, the 
Committee evaluates the performance of 
the external auditor. In May 2017 the Audit 
and Risk Committee members met with 
senior management within the finance 
team to review the audit process. There 
were no significant adverse findings from 
the 2017 evaluation and the Committee 
concluded that Grant Thornton had 
provided an external audit service which 
was appropriate for the Group given its 
size and structure.
External auditor independence
The Audit and Risk Committee operates 
a policy covering the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor, Grant 
Thornton to ensure that the ongoing 
independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor is not compromised.
This policy restricts the nature and value 
of non-audit services that can be provided 
by the external auditor and sets the 
requirement that permitted services above 
a pre-determined limit should be approved 
by the Committee before the assignment 
is undertaken.
The Committee was satisfied that the 
quantity and type of non-audit work 
undertaken during the year did not 
impair Grant Thornton’s independence or 
objectivity and that their appointment for 
these assignments was in the best interests 
of the Group and its shareholders due to 
Grant Thornton’s pre-existing knowledge 
of the Group’s operations and practices.
The Committee is satisfied that the external 
auditor has maintained its independence 
and objectivity over the period of its 
engagement.

Audit tender
Grant Thornton has been the Company’s 
auditor since 1998. As a consequence 
of new EU audit regulations which came 
into force in June 2016, Grant Thornton 
confirmed that the final year for which it 
could provide audit services to the Record 
plc Group, without reappointment via a 
formal audit tender process, was the year 
ended 31 March 2017, being 10 years 
post listing. 
The Committee was briefed on the 
requirements of the new EU audit 
regulations and approved the initiation of 
an audit tender process in October 2016. 
From the outset the process was designed 
to be transparent, effective and efficient 
being overseen by the Committee with 
management support in developing and 
implementing the planned approach. 
The Committee requested that approaches 
be made to four firms in total with a view to 
shortlisting firms for a final presentation and 
Q&A stage before a selection committee in 
March 2017. 
Selection criteria included using publicly 
available information to ascertain firms’ 
“Financials” sector rankings versus peers, 
as well as prior experience, where relevant, 
of work performed for the Group by each 
firm. Four firms were identified, two of 
which were from outside the “Big 4”, and all 
four firms confirmed their willingness to be 
included in the formal audit tender process.
Prior to starting the formal process, 
in December 2016 each firm had the 
opportunity to meet senior members 
of the Record finance team to discuss 
the business and its requirements in 
more detail. 
The meetings included members of both 
the audit and tax teams from each firm and 
senior members of the finance team from 
Record. 
Having considered the FRC guidance, the 
evaluation criteria for the formal process 
were agreed as:
• organisation and industry experience;
• resourcing and the engagement team;
• audit approach and delivery;
• identification of specific technical issues;
• quality assurance and independence; and
• value for money.
A formal Invitation to Tender (ITT) document 
was approved by the Committee and sent 
out to participating firms in early February 
2017, starting the process of meetings and 
due diligence by the firms and culminating 
in final proposal documents submitted by 
10 March 2017. 
In order to evaluate each tender firm against 
the criteria set the Committee considered 
the following:
• analysis of the RFP responses;
• presentations to the Committee and 
Management, including technical 
queries; and
• due diligence including reviewing Audit 
Quality Review Team reports published 
by the FRC and media searches.
Based on their evaluation of the criteria the 
Committee’s preferred firm was PwC LLP . 
The decision was based on the knowledge 
of Record’s business displayed by PwC LLP 
and the proposed organisation and approach 
of the audit team and a recommendation 
was put to the Board accordingly. 
The Board has noted the observations 
of the Committee and has agreed to 
recommend the appointment of PwC LLP 
to shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
Committee evaluation
An internal review of Committee 
effectiveness was overseen by the 
Company Secretary in May 2017. 
The review was based on input from Board 
members, senior management, the internal 
audit partner and the external audit partner. 
The conclusion was that the Committee 
was effective in carrying out its duties.
Annual General Meeting
The Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee 
will be available to answer any questions 
relating to the Committee and its activities 
at the Annual General Meeting.
Looking forward
As well as considering the standing items 
of business, the Committee will focus on 
the following areas during the year ahead:
• cyber security;
• MiFID II readiness;
• conduct risk; and
• statutory auditor transition.

REMUNERATION  
REPORT
Our remuneration policy is designed to act in 
the interests of all our key stakeholders: our 
clients, shareholders, employees and regulators.
Remuneration Committee 
Chairman’s summary statement
Introduction
This is my first report as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, having taken 
the role in September 2016 and been a 
member of the Committee since 2009. 
I would like to thank my predecessor, 
Andrew Sykes, for his leadership of 
the Committee and I am delighted to 
succeed him.
Remuneration philosophy
In 2016, the Committee carried out a 
comprehensive review of our remuneration 
philosophy, the objectives of our 
remuneration structures and options that 
we might contemplate. The review was 
not confined to Executive Directors but 
addressed remuneration for all employees.
To be able to capitalise on the opportunities 
the Company has, which are outlined in 
the Chief Executive’s statement, we need 
to motivate and incentivise all of our staff, 
which includes our colleagues below 
Director level, as well as the Executive 
Directors. This group makes an important 
contribution to the growth of the business 
and ensuring that we have capable and 
committed staff is critical to the success of 
the business. The Committee is, therefore, 
concerned to ensure that our remuneration 
structure and policies work at all levels.
In brief, we continue to believe in our 
current approach to remuneration, but 
recommend some minor amendments. 
The remuneration policy for all our staff 
including Executive Directors is designed 
to act in the long-term interests of all our 
key stakeholders, clients, shareholders, 
employees and regulators, as it links reward 
with performance in a straightforward 
and transparent way. It is also designed 
to incentivise our colleagues to work as a 
team, delivering sustained business and 
investment performance consistent with 
the Company’s strategic goals.
The changes that we are recommending to 
our current policies are summarised below 
and are designed to incentivise our staff 
below Director level.
Remuneration policy changes
There are two separate proposals for 
change, one relating to our Group Profit 
Share Scheme which will affect all staff 
including Directors, and the other proposed 
change is to our Share Scheme, which 
relates only to staff below Director level.
To remove the Matching 
Pool within the Group Profit 
Share Scheme
The Group Profit Share Scheme is currently 
split into two separate pools, the Group 
Profit Share Scheme Pool, which operates 
at 27% of operating profits, and the 
Matching pool, which operates at 3%. 
The Matching Pool seeks to reward those 
employees who are inclined to take some 
compensation in shares rather than cash. 
The intention continues to be to maintain 
the Group Profit Share Scheme policy to 
link the value of profit share to the Group’s 
profitability such that the Scheme is 30% 
of operating profits over the medium term. 
However, the Committee is now proposing 
that the entire Group Profit Share Scheme 
Pool is distributed to staff and there is no 
longer a matching pool.
The reasons for this change are, firstly, to 
ensure that the Scheme is transparent and 
simple to understand for both employees 
and shareholders. On review, it is clear 
that the distribution of the Matching Pool 
can change considerably depending on 
elections by individuals, the consequence 
of which is that the value of participating in 
the Matching Pool is not clear until after all 
elections have been made.
The second reason for change is that the 
Committee felt that the structure of the 
matching scheme was not providing an 
incentive to our colleagues to increase 
their shareholding, which was its original 
objective. Many such colleagues have 
actively demonstrated a strong preference 
for cash based remuneration, reflecting 
their age, external commitments and the 
stage of their careers. Record plc Annual Report 2017
51
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information
The remuneration philosophy regarding 
deferred remuneration and share ownership 
is different for Executive Directors and 
so is in line with our policy of promoting 
alignment between the interests of senior 
management and shareholders. There are 
no changes proposed to the structure of 
Group Profit Share Scheme payments for 
Directors, which requires that at least one 
third of any variable remuneration is to be 
taken as shares, which are locked up for 
a period of up to three years. It should be 
noted that any election to take up to a final 
third of a profit share payment in shares 
will no longer have any lock up due to the 
removal of the Matching Pool.
To introduce more flexibility 
to the Share Scheme for senior 
management below Executive 
Director level
For staff below Executive Director level, 
the Committee would like to broaden 
the parameters within the Approved and 
Unapproved Share Option Schemes.
Notwithstanding the response to the 
Matching Scheme, the Committee 
continues to believe that share ownership 
is important as an incentive mechanism for 
those who have been identified as important 
contributors to the growth of the Company 
and that the Share Scheme provides 
the most efficient route to establishing a 
shareholding.
There are no proposed changes to the 
quantum of the Share Scheme, which is 
limited to a maximum of 2% per annum 
of the market capitalisation of Record plc 
and of which up to 1% can be awarded as 
options to Executive Directors and a further 
1% awarded to staff below Director level.
The specific proposal is that, for those 
staff members below Executive Director 
level, the Committee would like to be able 
to vary the price at which options are 
struck, so that future Unapproved option 
grants may be awarded at market price, at 
discounted price or nil cost. It is also the 
general intention of the Committee to align 
performance conditions of both Approved 
and Unapproved option grants in future.
The rationale for introducing this flexibility is 
to be able to offer a different mix of reward, 
retention and alignment benefits, which 
can be used according to the relevant 
environment and business objectives at 
the time. For example, in a period of share 
price growth, market price options are a 
strong incentive and retention benefit. Nil 
cost or discounted options offer the clearest 
immediate reward and can be used to retain 
and motivate high performing staff in the 
shorter term.
The Committee delegates option awards 
to those below Executive Director to 
management, who will be required to make 
a proposal to the Committee detailing 
which structure or structures is to be used 
for that period. The Committee will be 
responsible for reviewing and approving 
all option scheme grants to Executive 
Directors and staff.
There are no proposed changes to the 
Share Scheme for Executive Directors, 
with the scheme currently allowing 
Directors to be awarded share options, 
subject to defined limits, performance and 
clawback conditions.
Further details are explained within the 
proposed remuneration policy below.
Directors’ remuneration report
This year’s report is split into two sections:
• the proposed directors’ 
remuneration policy; and
• annual report on remuneration.
As the current directors’ remuneration policy 
was approved in 2014, we will be asking 
shareholders to approve the new policy at 
the 2017 AGM. 
The annual report on remuneration explains 
how the existing policy has been applied 
during the year.
Review of salaries
A 3% company-wide salary increase 
was brought forward from April 2017 
to December 2016 in recognition of the 
firm’s revenue and profitability outlook and 
prospects for the business. This was also 
accelerated in light of the fact that salaries 
had remained static since the previous 
review in May 2015 and that salaries had 
slipped below market levels. The Executive 
Directors were included within this year’s 
award. No further salary increase for 
Directors was made within the financial year.
Committee membership
Andrew Sykes and Cees Schrauwers 
served on the Committee until their 
resignation from the Board in September. 
I would like to thank them for their 
contribution, having both served on it since 
2007. Jane Tufnell and Rosemary Hilary, 
who was appointed as Non-executive 
Director on 1 June 2016, are the other 
independent Committee members.
Shareholder consultation
It remains our policy to discuss any 
substantive proposed changes to the 
Group’s remuneration structure with key 
external shareholders in advance of any 
implementation.
Our policy is set out below and together 
with the annual report on remuneration will 
be submitted to shareholders for approval 
at the AGM on 27 July 2017.

REPORT CONTINUED
Directors’ remuneration policy
The new Directors’ remuneration policy 
proposed by the Committee is set out 
below. Shareholders will be asked to 
approve the new policy at the 2017 AGM 
and, if approved, it will formally take effect 
from the date of the AGM for three years.
The policy begins with an overview, 
followed by the Executive Director and 
Non-executive Director remuneration policy 
tables and there then follows an outline 
of the remuneration structures that are 
being proposed, including details of the 
proposed changes.
Policy overview
The remuneration structure for the 
Executive Directors is designed to incentivise 
the delivery of sustained performance 
consistent with the Group’s strategic goals 
and appropriate risk management, and to 
reward success in doing so. The motivation 
for proposing changes to our remuneration 
policy is to incentivise and engage our high 
potential senior managers and staff.
Our remuneration structures are similar for 
all staff and Executive Directors, providing 
a base salary, participation in the Group 
Profit Share Scheme and participation by 
invitation to the Group Share Scheme. 
For Executive Directors, a higher proportion 
of the total annual remuneration will be in 
the form of variable compensation, directly 
linked to the profitability of the Group.
The table below sets out the key 
components of the remuneration policy for 
employees and the policy that will apply 
to the Executive Directors, subject to 
shareholder approval. The key elements of 
the remuneration policy for Non-executive 
Directors are set out separately.
Remuneration of Executive Directors 
is determined within the limits of the 
Company’s Articles of Association whilst 
remuneration of the Non-executive Directors 
is determined by the Chairman.

Base salary
To pay a salary that reflects 
the role, responsibilities, 
experience and knowledge of 
the individual, ensuring that 
the salary paid is competitive 
with other employers in our 
industry.
Salaries are paid monthly through the payroll and 
reviewed annually by management.
Any review will take into account market rates, 
business performance and individual contribution.
The Remuneration Committee reviews salaries 
for Executive Directors on an annual basis.
There is no prescribed maximum salary. However, 
increases are normally expected to be in line with the 
typical level of increase awarded across the Group, 
except under certain circumstances such as:
• a new Executive Director being appointed at lower 
than typical market salary to allow for growth in 
the role;
• larger increases in salary may be awarded 
to position salary closer to market levels as 
experience increases;
• higher increases may be awarded to reflect an 
increase in responsibilities or promotion; and
• where there has been a significant change in 
market practice.
Benefits
To provide a benefits 
package that provides for the 
wellbeing of our colleagues.
A range of benefits are offered including, but 
not limited to, private medical insurance, dental 
insurance, permanent health insurance, life 
assurance, personal accident insurance and annual 
holiday.
There is the option to exchange medical insurance 
for the cash equivalent.
Benefit schemes are reviewed on an annual basis to 
ensure that the costs and service of the schemes are 
appropriate.
Executive Directors receive benefits on the same 
basis as all other employees. 
There is no maximum level of benefit.
Pension
To provide an appropriate 
retirement income.
All staff are entitled to join the Group Personal 
Pension Scheme. This is a defined contribution plan 
to which the Group makes employer contributions 
and staff can choose to make additional personal 
contributions. There are differing levels of employer 
contribution.
Base salary is the only pensionable element of 
remuneration.
Executive Directors receive an employer pension 
contribution of 15.5% of salary which can be 
paid into the Group Personal Pension Scheme. 
Executive Directors can choose to make a personal 
contribution in addition to the Company contribution.
If Executive Directors have elected not to make 
contributions into the Group Personal Pension 
Scheme then they will be paid a cash amount 
equivalent to their employer pension contribution 
through the payroll, with the appropriate tax and 
national insurance deductions. Record plc Annual Report 2017

Group Profit Share
To reward individual and 
collective performance, 
aid retention and to align 
interests with those of our 
shareholders.
The Group Profit Share Scheme is based on pre-tax 
profitability of the business for the financial year and 
is paid semi-annually.
The Remuneration Committee sets the quantum of 
the Scheme with the intention of maintaining this at 
an average of 30% of operating profits.
The profit share scheme range is capped at 25% 
to 35% of operating profits with the intention of this 
being an average of 30%.
The allocation of the Profit Share pool is determined 
by the Remuneration Committee and management 
and is based on the role and performance of the 
individual.
Senior managers are required to take one third of 
their payment in shares subject to lock up conditions 
of one to three years and in addition are offered the 
opportunity for up to a further third of the Profit Share 
to be paid in shares. The remaining amount is in cash.
Staff members can take their profit share in cash 
or elect for up to a third in shares.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in 
the Group Profit Share Scheme, together with all 
employees.
The Remuneration Committee approve all payments 
to Executive Directors.
Executive Directors are required to take one third of 
their payment in shares subject to lock up conditions 
of one to three years. In addition they are offered 
the opportunity for up to a further third of their 
Profit Share to be paid in shares. The remaining 
amount will be paid in cash.
Clawback provisions are in place in the event 
of adverse restatement of accounts or material 
misconduct, at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee. 
Whilst the profit share pool is capped based on the 
profitability of the Group and range stated above, 
there is no individual maximum entitlement set within 
this limit.
Key features of the scheme may be amended to 
the advantage of Executive Directors only with prior 
shareholder consent. 
Share Scheme
To incentivise long-term 
performance, aid long-term 
retention and to align 
interests with those of 
our shareholders.
The Share Scheme allows the Remuneration 
Committee to grant options over up to 2% of 
the market capitalisation of Record plc (being 
approximately 4.4 million shares) per annum. Of this 
total 1% (approximately 2.2 million shares) can be 
made to Executive Directors and the other 1% can 
be made to staff.
Approved and Unapproved Options can be granted 
under the Share Scheme at various strike prices and 
conditions.
Approved options are limited to a maximum grant 
value of £30,000.
All staff members are eligible to participate in the 
Share Scheme.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the 
Share Scheme.
The Remuneration Committee limits the value of 
shares over which an option is granted to any 
Director in any year to a maximum of 200% of that 
Director’s salary for that year.
All share options awarded to Executive Directors 
are struck at market price and are subject to 
a performance condition based on Record’s 
cumulative annual EPS growth with vesting 
proportions directly related to this growth.
Clawback provisions are in place for all options 
should there be any restatement of accounts 
or breach of contract, at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Key features of the scheme may be amended to 
the advantage of Executive Directors only with prior 
shareholder consent.
Share Incentive Plan
To incentivise long-term 
performance, aid long-term 
retention and to align 
interests with those of 
our shareholders.
The Group has an approved Share Incentive Plan 
(“SIP”). All staff are able to buy shares from pre-tax 
salary up to an HMRC-approved limit (£1,800 for 
the financial year ended 31 March 2017), which is 
matched at a rate of 50%.
Executive Directors may participate in the SIP on 
the same basis as other employees. Record plc Annual Report 2017

Other elements of 
remuneration
The Chairman and the Non-executive Directors do

Share Scheme, or the SIP Scheme.
Group Profit Share Scheme
Record operates a Group Profit Share 
Scheme (the “Scheme”), which allocates 
a profit share pool to be distributed 
between all employees of the Group. 
The Remuneration Committee has the 
discretion to vary the quantum of the 
Scheme between 25% and 35% of 
operating profits, and the intention is 
to maintain an average level of 30% of 
operating profits over the medium term.
The current policy is that the scheme is 
split into two separate pools, the Group 
Profit Share Pool, which operates at 27% 
of operating profits, and the Matching 
Pool, which operates at 3%. On review, 
the Committee would like to simplify 
the scheme so that there is no longer a 
Matching Pool and that the entire Group 
Profit Share Pool is distributed to staff. 
The Committee believes that this change 
will also ensure that our high potential 
colleagues are incentivised.
The continuation of the Scheme remaining 
at 30% of operating profits has created a 
transparent and predictable link between 
variable compensation and profitability, and 
has aligned the interests of employees with 
those of our shareholders.
The Scheme is payable through a 
combination of profit share payments in 
cash and share-based payments. The 
allocation of the profit share pool for 
Executive Directors is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee and for all other 
employees is delegated to management. 
The Scheme is discretionary and employees 
do not have a contractual right to receive 
awards. In addition, all payments made to 
Executive Directors and other Code Staff 
(those in Significant Influence Functions) 
are subject to Remuneration Committee 
approval and no payments are made 
automatically. Payments are awarded after 
input from the Head of Compliance and 
Risk, who reports any legal or compliance 
issues that relate to individuals who are due 
to receive awards under the Scheme. Any 
issues would also be monitored through 
compliance and risk reports at Audit and 
Risk Committee and Board meetings.
To ensure that the interests of 
management and shareholders are aligned, 
Directors, Code staff and senior managers 
are required to take a proportion (initially a 
third) of their Profit Share in shares rather 
than cash, subject to a three-year “lock 
up” period. These shares are released from 
“lock up” in three equal tranches on the first, 
second and third anniversary of the Profit 
Share payment date. Additionally, Directors 
and Code Staff are offered the opportunity 
to elect for up to a further third of their 
Profit Share to be paid in shares, which will 
have no lock up due to the removal of the 
Matching Pool. The remaining amount will 
be paid in cash. Record plc Annual Report 2017

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information
The Record plc Share Scheme
The Record plc share scheme (the “Share 
Scheme”) was adopted by the Company 
on 1 August 2008 to allow deferred share 
awards to be granted to new senior 
employees, but has more recently been 
used to award share options to employees 
of Record plc or its subsidiaries. The 
Share Scheme was amended in 2011 to 
include the ability to grant HMRC approved 
options (“Approved Options”) under Part 2 
of the Share Scheme alongside Part 1 
which allows for the grant of unapproved 
options (“Unapproved Options”). In 2013 
the Share Scheme was amended to 
allow Board Directors to participate in the 
grant of Unapproved options. In 2016, 
the Share Scheme was further amended 
to allow Board Directors to be granted 
Approved options.
It is of great importance for the long-term 
success of the business that the Group 
retains and motivates its current and 
future key employees, and that they are 
incentivised over the longer term in a manner 
which aligns their interests with shareholders. 
It is therefore the intention of the Group 
to continue to use the Share Scheme for 
Executive Directors and staff. In total the size 
of the Share Scheme will be limited to 2% 
per annum of the market capitalisation of 
Record plc (being approximately 4.4 million 
shares). Of this total the Remuneration 
Committee will continue to be able to award 
up to 1% as options to Executive Directors 
and up to 1% to staff.
This year the Committee proposes 
to amend the Scheme for staff below 
Executive Director level to introduce 
more flexibility to the Scheme rules 
when granting options. In particular, the 
Committee would like to introduce flexibility 
on the price that options are struck, to allow 
future Unapproved option grants to be 
struck at market price, discounted price and 
nil cost. It is also the general intention of the 
Committee to align performance conditions 
of both Approved and Unapproved option 
grants in future.
The reason for introducing this flexibility 
is that each choice achieves a different 
mix of reward, retention and alignment 
benefits and can be used according to 
the environment and business objectives. 
For example, in a period of share price 
growth, market price options will be a 
strong incentive and retention benefit. 
Nil cost or discounted options have the 
greatest immediate reward effect and 
could be used to retain and motivate 
high performing staff in the shorter term.
With this added flexibility, the Committee will 
be responsible for approving the structure 
of any option awards to Executive Directors 
and staff.
Each participant may be granted Approved 
Options over shares with a total market 
value of up to £30,000 on the date of 
grant. There is no such limit on the value 
of Unapproved Options, which may be 
granted with any exercise price (including 
nil), although the Committee’s policy is for 
Unapproved options awarded to Executive 
Directors to be struck at market price.
The terms of options for Executive 
Directors differ to those for all other staff. 
For Executive Directors, the Remuneration 
Committee will limit the value of shares over 
which an option is granted to any Director 
in any year to a maximum of 200% of that 
Director’s salary for that year. All Executive 
Director option awards will be subject to a 
performance condition based on Record’s 
annual cumulative EPS growth. One third 
of the award will vest on each of the third, 
fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of 
grant, subject to an EPS hurdle linked to the 
annualised EPS growth for the respective 
three, four and five year periods from date 
of grant. Vesting is on a stepped basis, with 
25% of each tranche vesting if EPS growth 
over the relevant period is at least RPI plus 
4% per annum, increasing through 50% 
and 75% to 100% vesting if EPS growth 
exceeds RPI plus 13% per annum over 
the same period. Options under both the 
Approved and Unapproved schemes will 
be struck at market price and the exercise 
price per share of Approved Options 
must be no lower than the market value 
of a share on the dealing day immediately 
preceding the date of grant.
For staff below Executive Director, Approved 
Options become exercisable on the fourth 
anniversary of grant subject to the employee 
remaining in employment with the Group 
and any other performance conditions being 
met. One quarter of any Unapproved option 
grant become exercisable each year for four 
years, subject to the employee remaining 
in employment and any other performance 
conditions being met.
The Remuneration Committee retains the 
power to grant options under the Share 
Scheme, and granted options to Board 
Directors during the year, although it can 
and has delegated to management the 
task of identifying suitable recipients of 
options and the number of shares to be put 
under option for those below Board level. 
Details of the option awards made to Board 
Directors during the year can be found 
on page 59 and all awards were made in 
accordance with the Scheme rules.
The Remuneration Committee retains the 
ability to vary or waive existing performance 
targets where, in its absolute discretion, 
it considers the target has become unfair 
or impractical or to take account of 
exceptional circumstances.
Clawback provisions
The Group Profit Share Scheme rules 
contain clawback provisions which allow for 
the repayment of profit share payments in 
the event of a material breach of contract, 
material misconduct or a restatement of 
financial accounts which would have led to 
a reduction in any prior Profit Share award.
Both Approved and Unapproved Options 
granted under the Share Scheme for 
Executive Directors are subject to 
clawback provisions in addition to the 
performance conditions set by the 
Remuneration Committee. Record plc Annual Report 2017

REMUNERATION  
REPORT CONTINUED
Source and funding of shares
Share awards under the Group Profit 
Share Scheme are covered wherever 
possible through market purchases by the 
Company’s Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) 
rather than through the issue of new shares, 
and this has been the case since the 
inception of the Scheme in 2007. It remains 
our intention to continue to operate in 
this manner in order to minimise potential 
dilution of shareholders’ interests.
Similarly, options under the Share Scheme 
are not normally satisfied by the issue of 
new shares, in order to minimise potential 
dilution. The Company provides funds to 
the EBT to allow it to purchase shares in the 
market with which to satisfy the exercise of 
options. The number of shares purchased 
by the Group to hedge the award of 
options is based on an appropriate hedge 
ratio at each grant date, as calculated 
by management and approved by the 
Remuneration Committee.
Accounting treatment
The Share Scheme is accounted for in 
accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based 
payments” and is not part of the Group 
Profit Share costs.
Share Incentive Plan
The Group operates an HMRC-approved 
Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) which is offered 
to all staff, including Executive Directors, 
who are able to buy shares from pre-tax 
salary up to a defined HMRC limit (£1,800 
worth of shares in the financial year ended 
31 March 2017). To encourage employee 
share ownership the Group matches any 
shares purchased through this scheme at a 
rate of 50%, although staff will only receive 
the full benefit of the matched shares if 
they remain with the Group for three years. 
To qualify for full tax benefits, these shares 
must be left in the SIP for five years.
How the views of shareholders 
are taken into account
The Remuneration Committee takes into 
account shareholder views received in 
relation to resolutions to be considered 
at the AGM each year. The Committee 
values shareholder feedback when forming 
remuneration policy and any material 
proposed changes to Executive Directors’ 
remuneration will be discussed in advance 
with major institutional shareholders.
Considering the views 
of employees
When determining Executive Director 
remuneration arrangements the 
Committee takes into account pay 
conditions throughout the Group to 
ensure that the structure and quantum 
of Executive Directors’ pay remains 
appropriate in this context.
The Committee does not consider that 
it is appropriate to consult directly with 
colleagues when developing the Directors’ 
remuneration policy. However, the 
Committee does actively seek feedback 
from the high potential staff about the 
remuneration structures that are in place. 
A significant proportion of our colleagues 
are shareholders so are able to express 
their views in the same way as other 
shareholders.
Approach to remuneration for 
new Executive Directors
On the recruitment of a new Executive 
Director the level of fixed remuneration will 
be appropriate to the candidate’s skills 
and experience and the responsibility that 
they will be undertaking. New Executive 
Directors would be eligible to join the Group 
Profit Share Scheme and would be eligible 
to be considered for the Record Share 
Scheme as deemed appropriate by the 
Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee recognises 
that a new Executive Director may forfeit 
remuneration as a result of leaving a 
previous employer and the Committee 
will consider mitigating that loss or 
part of that loss by making an award in 
addition to the remuneration outlined 
above. The Committee will consider any 
relevant factors including any performance 
conditions attached to any previous 
incentive arrangements and the likelihood 
of these conditions being met and will 
take reasonable steps to ensure that any 
payment is at an appropriate level.
When recruiting a new Non-executive 
Director, fees will be in line with the 
prevailing fee schedule paid to other Board 
members and Non-executive Directors at 
that time.
Service contracts and loss 
of office payment policy
All Executive Directors have service 
agreements with effect from 15 November 
2007, with the exception of James 
Wood-Collins, who has a service agreement 
dated 1 October 2010, reflecting his 
promotion to Chief Executive Officer and 
Steve Cullen who has a service agreement 
dated 15 March 2013, reflecting his 
promotion to Chief Financial Officer. None 
of the service agreements is for a fixed term 
and all include provisions for termination 
on six months’ notice by either party. 
Service agreements do not contain any 
contractual entitlement to receive bonuses, 
nor to participate in the Group Profit Share 
Scheme or the Group Share Scheme, nor 
to receive any fixed provision for termination 
compensation.
Non-executive Directors are appointed for 
an initial three-year period. Their continued 
engagement is subject to the Company’s 
Articles relating to the retirement of 
Directors by rotation.
The terms and conditions of appointment of 
the Executive Directors and Non-executive 
Directors are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office.
When an Executive Director leaves the 
Group, the Remuneration Committee will 
review the circumstances and apply the 
appropriate treatment. Any payments that 
are made will be in line with contractual 
entitlements and statutory requirements 
only. Where applicable the broad aim in 
making termination payments is to avoid 
rewarding poor performance.
Salary and benefits will continue to be paid 
throughout the notice period although the 
Committee has the discretion to make a 
payment in lieu of notice.
The treatment of payments for the Group 
Profit Share Scheme and the Share 
Scheme will be in accordance with the 
relevant scheme rules at the time the 
Director leaves. Record plc Annual Report 2017

Remuneration illustrations
The charts below show the lowest, highest and average remuneration for the Executive Directors over the past three years. Fixed 
remuneration is comprised of salary, pension contributions, other benefits and any cash alternative. Variable remuneration comprises 
Group Profit Share including cash and share payments as well as any gains on share options. As variable remuneration is not capped at the 
individual level, we have used the three year average, highest and lowest remuneration as an indication of the Executive Director’s earnings 
potential. Future remuneration will be determined based on profitability and performance as described in the Remuneration policy.
 Fixed   Variable
Compliance with the FCA Remuneration Code
The Committee regularly reviews its remuneration policies to ensure compliance with the principles of the Remuneration Code of the 
UK financial services regulator, as applicable to the Group. The remuneration policy is designed to be consistent with the prudent 
management of risk, and the sustained, long-term performance of the Group. The Chief Financial Officer and the Head of Compliance 
and Risk are involved in reviewing the remuneration policy and practice to ensure that it is aligned with sound risk management, and keep 
the Committee informed of the firm’s risk profile so that this can be taken into account in remuneration decisions.

Allocation of the Profit Share pool to Executive Directors
The Remuneration Committee is able to exercise discretion over the level of Group Profit Share awarded to the Executive Directors. 
On two occasions during the year, the Committee has approved awards to the Directors after considering the role and performance of 
each individual Director and also reports from the Head of Compliance and Risk, regarding any legal or compliance issues relevant to 
the award.
Pensions (audited information)
Executive Directors are entitled to join the Group Personal Pension Scheme. This is a defined contribution plan and for the financial 
year ending 31 March 2017, the Group made contributions of at least 15.5% of each Director’s salary which could either be paid into 
the Group Personal Pension Scheme, taken as cash or a combination of the two. 
A change was made to the structure of pension contributions for Executive Directors from 1 April 2016 as the Company moved away 
from an employer pension contribution rate of 13% and a matching rate of 2.5% to a single 15.5% employer pension contribution.
All Directors who make personal contributions into the Company pension scheme via salary sacrifice receive an amount equivalent to 
the employer’s national insurance saved by the Company into their pension as an additional contribution.
The employer pension contributions for the financial years ending 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2017 are detailed in the table opposite.
Directors’ share options and share awards (audited information)
James Wood-Collins, Leslie Hill, Bob Noyen and Steve Cullen were all awarded options over 550,000 shares during the financial year 
ended 31 March 2017. All option awards were Unapproved and were made in accordance with the scheme rules for Executive Directors.
All of the Executive Directors have previously been awarded share options and the table below sets out details of Executive Directors’ 
outstanding share option awards, which may vest in future years subject to continued service and performance conditions, as well as

REPORT CONTINUED
Vesting of awards made to Executive Directors is on a stepped basis and is linked to Record’s average annualised EPS growth over the 
relevant period since grant as follows:
Record’s annualised EPS growth over the period from grant to vesting Percentage of shares subject to the award which vest
>RPI Growth + 13%         100%
>RPI Growth + 10%, =<RPI + 13%        75%
>RPI Growth + 7%, =<RPI + 10%        50%
>RPI Growth + 4%, =<RPI + 7%        25%
=<RPI Growth + 4%         0%
A principal strategic objective of the business is to create shareholder value for our investors over the long term. The Board considers this 
to be delivered by consistent growth in earnings of the business, and the performance measurements used in the determination of the 
number of awards which ultimately vest under the scheme rules reflect this.
Share option awards made to James Wood-Collins on 18 November 2013 vest in three equal tranches and the first of these vesting 
dates was 18 November 2016. In accordance with the performance conditions detailed above, 50% of this tranche of options vested, 
which was 233,333 shares, and the other 50% lapsed.
Share option awards over 75,000 shares that were previously made to Steve Cullen under the Approved Option Scheme on 
18 December 2012, before he was made a Board Director, lapsed. This award was based on the median total shareholder return (“TSR”) 
as measured against the FTSE 350 General Financial – Price Index. The performance target table is given below. As the lowest threshold 
level of performance was not exceeded the award did not vest.

Disclosures required under 
Listing Rule 9.8.4
The information required to be disclosed 
by Listing Rule 9.8.4 is located within 
this Directors’ Report. The majority of the 
disclosures required under LR 9.8.4 are 
not applicable to Record. The applicable 
sub-paragraph within LR 9.8.4 and related 
disclosures are as follows:
• LR 9.8.4 (12) Shareholder waivers 
of dividends; 
• LR 9.8.4 (13) Shareholder waivers 
of future dividends; and 
• LR 9.8.4 (14) Agreements with 
controlling shareholders.
Results and dividends
The results of the Group for the year are 
set out in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income on page 70.
The Company paid an interim ordinary 
dividend of 0.825 pence per share on 
23 December 2016 to shareholders on the 
register on 2 December 2016.
The Directors recommend a final 
ordinary dividend of 1.175 pence per 
ordinary share, making a total ordinary 
dividend of 2.00 pence per share for 
the year ended 31 March 2017. Subject 
to shareholder approval at the Annual 
General Meeting, the final dividend will be 
paid on 2 August 2017 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business 
on 30 June 2017. The shares will be 
quoted ex-dividend from 29 June 2017. 
The Board has declared a special 
dividend of 0.91 pence per share to be 
paid simultaneously with the final ordinary 
dividend on 2 August 2017. This equates 
to a “total distribution” of 2.91 pence per 
share, equivalent to the earnings per share 
of 2.91 pence per share for the year.
Shareholder waiver of dividends
The Record Employee Benefit Trust has 
waived its rights to dividends paid on 
the ordinary shares held in respect of 
the Group Share Scheme and the Group 
Profit Share Scheme. The trust held 
3,618,995 shares as at 31 March 2017 
(2016: 4,942,248 shares).
Share capital
The Company has a single class of share 
capital consisting of ordinary shares of 
0.025 pence each. Each ordinary share 
is equally eligible to receive dividends and 
the repayment of capital and represents 
one vote at a shareholders’ meeting. 
Details of structure and changes in share 
capital are set out in note 18 to the 
financial statements.
At its Annual General Meeting in 2016, 
the Company obtained, subject to certain 
conditions, shareholder approval to 
purchase ordinary shares representing not 
more than 10% of its issued capital. This 
authority will expire on the date of this year’s 
Annual General Meeting.
The Company has not exercised the right 
to purchase ordinary shares in its capital 
(including treasury shares) during the year.
Substantial shareholdings
The table below sets out the names of 
those persons who, insofar as the Company

reporting a shareholding reducing from 
3.23% to below 3%. 
Controlling shareholder
Under the UKLA Listing Rules Neil Record 
is deemed to be a controlling shareholder, 
as he exercises control over more than 30% 
of the voting rights in the Company. With 
effect from 16 May 2014 premium-listed 
companies were required, under LR 9.2.2 
to establish a legally binding relationship 
agreement to govern interactions between 
the Company and a controlling shareholder. 
The Company already had a relationship 
agreement in place with Neil Record dated 
28 November 2007. An amendment to this 
agreement was agreed by the Board and 
signed by Neil Record on 2 October 2014 in 
order to ensure full compliance with the new 
Listing Rules.
In accordance with the Listing Rules, the 
Board confirms that throughout the period 
under review:
(i)   the Company has complied with 
the independence provisions in the 
relationship agreement; and
(ii)   so far as the Company is aware, 
Neil Record and his associates have 
complied with the independence 
provisions in the relationship agreement.

DIRECTORS’  
REPORT CONTINUED
Restrictions on transfers of shares
Under the terms of the Record plc Group 
Profit Share Scheme rules, certain senior 
employees and Directors of the Company 
are required to receive a proportion of any 
award in shares, and may elect to receive 
a further proportion of their profit share in 
the form of a share award and receive a 
final proportion in cash. All ordinary shares 
which are the subject of these share 
awards are transferred immediately to a 
nominee. These shares are not subject 
to any vesting conditions but are subject 
to “lock-up” arrangements and clawback 
provisions. The individual is entitled to full 
rights in respect of these shares. No such 
shares can be sold, transferred or otherwise 
disposed of without the consent of the 
Remuneration Committee unless specified 
anniversary dates have been reached. 
Further details are disclosed in note 19 to 
the financial statements.
Dealings in the Company’s ordinary 
shares by persons discharging managerial 
responsibilities, employees of the Company 
and, in each case, their connected persons, 
are subject to the Group’s dealing code 
which complies with the EU Market Abuse 
Regulation which came into force on 
3 July 2016.
Certain restrictions, customary for a listed 
company, apply to transfers of ordinary 
shares in the Company.
Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety 
of financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk, 
foreign currency risk (managed using 
financial instruments) and interest rate risk. 
The Group seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on its financial performance. 
Further information is contained in note 21 
to the financial statements.
Financial reporting controls
The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for 
managing the financial controls framework. 
The framework requires control owners 
to perform key preventative and detective 
controls and follow documented processes 
to ensure that proper accounting records 
are maintained and that financial information 
used by the business is reliable and free 
from material misstatement.
Related party transactions
Details of related party transactions are set 
out in note 25 to the financial statements.
Post-reporting date events
As set out in note 28 to the financial 
statements, there were no post-reporting 
date events.
Going concern
The Strategic report explains the Group’s 
business activities together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position and the financial 
statements include information on the 
Group’s financial position, cash flows 
and liquidity. In addition, the financial 
risk management note to the financial 
statements sets out the objectives, policies 
and processes for the management of the 
risks to which the business is exposed 
in order to minimise any adverse effects 
on the Group’s financial performance. 
The Group has sizeable financial resources 
and performs regular financial forecasts 
and cash flow projections, which are 
subject to rigorous sensitivity analysis.
Consequently, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue operations for the foreseeable 
future and therefore continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Annual 
Report and Accounts.
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
Code, the Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group over a longer period 
than the twelve months required by the 
Going concern provision. Details of the 
assessment can be found in the Financial 
review section of the Strategic report on 
page 27.
Political donations
It is the Group’s policy not to make political 
donations and accordingly no such 
donations have been made during the 
period under review.
Environment
The Group’s environmental policies and 
the disclosures required by SI 2008/410 
Sch7.15-20 are provided in the Corporate 
Social Responsibility section on pages 34 
and 35.
Directors’ indemnities
As at the date of this report, indemnities 
are in force under which the Company has 
agreed to indemnify the Directors, to the 
extent permitted by law and the Company’s 
Articles of Association, in respect of all 
losses, liabilities or expenses incurred by 
them in relation to the Company or any of 
its subsidiaries. The Group has appropriate 
Directors’ and Officers’ insurance in place.
Change of control
Directors’ and employees’ employment 
contracts do not provide for compensation 
for loss of office or employment as a 
result of a change of control. However, the 
provisions of the Group’s employee share 
schemes may cause awards granted to 
employees under such schemes to vest 
on a change of control.
The Group is not party to any significant 
agreements that would take effect, alter 
or terminate on a change of control of 
the Company.
Investor relations
During the year Directors met and 
made presentations to institutional 
investors, analysts and potential 
shareholders. The Senior Independent 
Director is also available to meet institutional 
investors if requested.
The Board and the chair of each of the 
Board Committees will be available 
to answer questions put to them by 
shareholders of the Company at the 
2017 Annual General Meeting.
2017 Annual General Meeting
The 2017 Annual General Meeting of the 
Company will be held at 10.00 a.m. on 
27 July 2017 at the Company’s registered 
office at Morgan House, Madeira Walk, 
Windsor SL4 1EP . Details of the ordinary 
and special resolutions to be proposed at 
the Annual General Meeting are given in a

DIRECTORS’  
RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Strategic report and Directors’ report, the 
Remuneration report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have to prepare the financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted 
by the European Union. Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs and profit or loss of the Company 
and Group for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and
• state whether applicable IFRSs have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Remuneration report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that: 
• so far as each Director is aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all the steps 
that they ought to have taken as 
directors in order to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the auditor is aware 
of that information.
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. The 
Directors consider the Annual Report and 
the financial statements, taken as a whole, 
provides the information necessary to 
assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy and is fair, balanced and 
understandable.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
To the best of our knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
and 
• the Annual Report, including the 
Strategic report, includes a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.

Who we are reporting to
This report is made solely to the company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the company and the company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
What we have audited
Record plc’ s financial statements for the 
year ended 31 March 2017 comprise the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, the Consolidated and Company 
statements of financial position, the Consolidated 
and Company statements of changes in equity, 
the Consolidated and Company statements of 
cash flows and the related notes.
The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and, as regards the parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Overview of our audit approach
• Overall group materiality: £393,000, which 
represents approximately 5% of the group’s 
profit before taxation;
• We performed full scope audit procedures 
for Record plc, Record Currency 
Management Limited and Record Group 
Services Limited and targeted procedures 
for Record Currency Management (US) Inc. 
and Record Umbrella Funds; and
• The key audit risk was identified as revenue 
recognition and occurrence.
Our assessment of risk
In arriving at our opinions set out in this 
report, we highlight the following risks that, 
in our judgement, had the greatest effect 
on our audit: 
Revenue recognition and occurrence
The risk: Revenue comprises primarily 
management fees which have arisen as a 
result of investment management activities. 
Management fees are calculated as a 
percentage of assets under management 
equivalents (“AUME”) and, as per the 
Group’s accounting policy in accordance with 
International Accounting Standard (IAS) 18 
‘Revenue’, are accrued on a daily basis. 
Due to the large monetary value, materiality 
within the financial statements and the 
susceptibility of revenue recognition to 
fraudulent financial reporting, we have 
identified revenue recognition as a significant 
risk requiring special audit consideration. 
How we responded to the risk: Our audit 
work included, but was not restricted to: 
• assessing whether the stated accounting 
policies conform to IAS 18 and testing 
the implementation of these polices. 
Specifically, we considered where the 
revenue was recognised based on 
the transfer of the risk and rewards of 
ownership to the customer and the 
accounting period in which services 
were rendered by testing a sample of 
revenue items recognised to investment 
management contracts;
• analytical procedures on revenues 
recognised and movements in AUME 
to identify any significant or unusual 
movements which require further testing; 
• for a sample of invoices, testing 
management fees by recalculating the 
fees recorded with reference to the 
management fee percentages and 
portfolio hedge ratios per the contractual 
arrangement and AUME. We also agreed 
the receipt of the management fees to 
bank statements;
• substantively testing a sample of debtor 
positions at the year end to invoices raised 
and subsequent receipts of cash; and 
• examining post year-end activity to 
identify any significant reversals or credit 
notes raised. 
The group’s accounting policy on revenue 
recognition and related disclosures are shown 
in note 3 to the financial statements.
Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of 
misstatement in the financial statements that 
makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would 
be changed or influenced. We use materiality 
in determining the nature, timing and extent 
of our audit work and in evaluating the results 
of that work. 
We determined materiality for the audit of the 
group financial statements as a whole to be 
£393,000, which is approximately 5% of the 
group’s profit before taxation. This benchmark 
is considered the most appropriate because 
in our view, it is one of the key metrics against 
which the financial performance of the group 
is measured. No revision to the materiality 
determined at the planning stage of our audit 
was necessary as we judged that it remained 
appropriate in the context of the Group’s 
actual financial results for the year ended 
31 March 2017.
Materiality for the current year is higher than 
the level that we determined for the year 
ended 31 March 2016 to reflect the increase 
in the group’s profit before taxation. 
We use a different level of materiality, 
performance materiality, to drive the extent of 
our testing and this was set at 75% of financial 
statement materiality for the audit of the group 
financial statements. We also determine a 
lower level of specific materiality for certain 
areas such as directors’ remuneration and 
related party transactions. 
We determined the threshold at which we 
will communicate misstatements to the audit 
committee to be £20,000. In addition, we 
will communicate misstatements below that 
threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting 
on qualitative grounds.
Overview of the scope of our audit
A description of the generic scope of an 
audit of financial statements is provided on 
the Financial Reporting Council's website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) 
(UK and Ireland). Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the 
'Responsibilities for the financial statements 
and the audit' section of our report. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.
We are independent of the group in 
accordance with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with those Ethical Standards. Record plc Annual Report 2017

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information
Our audit approach was based on a thorough 
understanding of the group’s business and is 
risk based, and in particular included: 
• evaluation by the group audit team of 
identified components to assess the 
significance of that component and to 
determine the planned audit response 
based on a measure of materiality 
considered significant as a percentage of 
the group’s total assets, revenues and profit 
before taxation, or significance based on 
qualitative factors, such as specific use 
or concerns over specific components; 
• focusing our group audit approach on the 
audit work associated with three significant 
components subject to full scope audits 
for the year ended 31 March 2017, namely, 
Record plc, Record Currency Management 
Limited and Record Group Services 
Limited. These entities represent the 
parent company and the most significant 
subsidiaries of the group and account for 
approximately 92% of the group’s revenue. 
Our audit work on these components was 
performed at levels of materiality applicable 
to each individual entity which were lower 
than the group materiality;
• specific target procedures were also 
performed on another two components 
based on our assessment of the risks of 
material misstatements and the materiality 
of the group’s operations within the 
components; 
• evaluating the description, design 
effectiveness and implementation of 
controls relating to revenue; and
• a substantive approach on significant 
transactions, balances and disclosures, 
the extent of which was based on various 
factors such as our overall assessment of 
the control environment and our evaluation 
of the design and implementation of controls 
and the management specific risks.
Other reporting required 
by regulations
Our opinions on other matters prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006 are unmodified.
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken 
in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report for 
the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements; and 
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report have been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements.
Matter on which we are required to 
report under the Companies Act 2006
In the light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the group and the parent 
company and its environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not identified 
material misstatements in the Strategic Report 
or the Directors’ Report. 
Matters on which we are required 
to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006 we 
are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules, we are 
required to review:
• the directors’ statements in relation to going 
concern and longer-term viability, set out on 
pages 66 and 27 respectively; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for 
our review.
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we 
are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, information in the annual 
report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information 
in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, our knowledge 
of the group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to 
report to you if:
• we have identified any inconsistencies 
between our knowledge acquired during 
the audit and the directors’ statement 
that they consider the annual report is fair, 
balanced and understandable; or 
• the annual report does not appropriately 
disclose those matters that were 
communicated to the audit committee 
which we consider should have been 
disclosed. 
We have nothing to report in respect of any 
of the above matters.
We also confirm that we do not have anything 
material to add or to draw attention to in 
relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation in the annual 
report that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the 
group including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures in the annual report that 
describe those risks and explain how they 
are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement in the financial 
statements about whether they have 
considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them, and their identification of 
any material uncertainties to the group’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period 
of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements; and
• the directors’ explanation in the annual 
report as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider 
that period to be appropriate, and their 
statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the group 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit
What the directors are responsible for:
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on page 67, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
What we are responsible for:
Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and ISAs 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 March 2017
These financial statements exclude disclosures that are both immaterial and judged to be unnecessary to understand our results and financial 
position.
1. Accounting policies
In order to increase the clarity of the notes to the financial statements, accounting policy descriptions appear at the beginning of the note to 
which they relate, and are shown in purple text.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out in the notes below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise stated.
(a) Accounting convention
Basis of preparation
The Group and Company have prepared their financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by 
the European Union. IFRSs comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and 
the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) as adopted in the European Union as at 31 March 2017. The financial 
statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, modified to include fair valuation of derivative financial instruments.
The Directors are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources with which to continue to operate for the foreseeable 
future. Please refer to the Directors’ report on pages 65 and 66 for more detail. For this reason the financial statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles set out in IFRSs requires management 
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income 
and expenses. The bases for management judgements, estimates and assumptions are discussed further in note 2.
Impact of new accounting standards
A number of amendments to existing standards and interpretations have been issued, some of which were mandatory for periods beginning 
1 April 2016, with the remaining becoming effective in future periods. The new standards and amendments to existing standards effective for 
the year to 31 March 2017 have not had a material impact on the financial statements of Record plc.
Standard Description Effective date
Amendments to IAS 1 (December 2014) Part of the disclosure initiative aimed at improving 1 January 2016 
 financial statement presentation and disclosures 
Standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted
  Effective date  
  (periods commencing  
Standard Description on or after 1 January 2017)
IFRS 9 (July 2014) Financial instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 (May 2014) Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 (January 2016) Leases 1 January 2019
IFRS 9 has been endorsed by the EU and replaces the classification and measurement models for financial instruments in IAS 39 with three 
classification categories: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income. The Group’s 
business model and the contractual cash flows arising from its investments in financial instruments determine the classification. The impact of the 
standard will depend on the types of financial instruments held by the Group on adoption. The detailed assessment of the exact impact IFRS 9 will 
have on the Group’s financial statements is ongoing.
IFRS 15 has been endorsed by the EU and deals with revenue recognition; establishing principles for reporting useful information to users of 
financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. 
Revenue is recognised in a manner that depicts the pattern of transfer of services to the customer, according to a five-step model stipulated by 
the standard. The standard replaces IAS 18 "Revenue" and IAS 11 "Construction contracts" and related interpretations. The standard is effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is permitted. The Group does not anticipate that IFRS 15 will have 
a material impact on results. However, additional disclosures may be required.
IFRS 16 "Leases" will replace IAS 17 "Leases". IFRS 16 requires that all operating leases in excess of one year, where the Group is the lessee, 
are included on the Group’s statement of financial position. The Group will be required to recognise a right-of-use ("ROU") asset and a lease 
liability (representing the obligation to make lease payments). The ROU asset will be amortised on a straight-line basis with the interest expense on 
the lease liability being measured using the effective interest method. IFRS 16 contains optional exemptions for both short-term leases (less than 
twelve months) and for small-value leases. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application 
is permitted subject to EU endorsement and the entity adopting IFRS 15 at the same time. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 16 
on its financial statements.
No other standards or interpretations issued but not yet effective are expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. Record plc Annual Report 2017

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended 31 March 2017
1. Accounting policies continued
(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information contained within the financial statements incorporates financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries drawn up to 31 March 2017. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company and are included from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases. Control is achieved where the Company is exposed to or has rights over variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and it has the power to affect returns. Where the Group controls an entity, but does not own all the share capital of that 
entity, the interest of the other shareholders’ non-controlling interests is stated within equity at the non-controlling interests’ proportion of the fair 
value of the recognised assets and liabilities.
An Employee Benefit Trust has been established for the purposes of satisfying certain share-based awards. As the Group has “de facto” control 
over this special purpose entity, the trust is fully consolidated within the financial statements.
The Group has investments in three funds. These funds are held by Record plc and represent seed capital investments by the Group. If the 
Group is in a position to be able to control a fund by virtue of holding a majority of units in the fund, then the fund is consolidated within the Group 
accounts. We consider that the Group exerts such control in cases where it (either in isolation or together with its related parties) holds a majority 
of units in the fund. Such funds are consolidated either on a line-by-line basis, or if it meets the definition of a disposal group held for sale it is 
classified and accounted for on that basis. In the case that the Group does not control a fund for the complete reporting period, then the fund is 
consolidated only for the part of the reporting period for which the Group has control over the entity.
The accounts of subsidiary undertakings, which are prepared using uniform accounting policies, are coterminous with those of the Company apart 
from those of the seeded funds which have accounting reference dates of 30 September. The consolidated financial statements incorporate the 
financial performance of the seeded funds in the year ended 31 March 2017 and the financial position of the seeded funds as at 31 March 2017.
The Company is taking advantage of the exemption under the Companies Act 2006 s408(1) not to present its individual statement of 
comprehensive income and related notes that form part of the financial statements. The Group’s total comprehensive income for the year includes 
a profit of £3,855,425 attributable to the Company (2016: £4,091,492).
All intra-group transactions, balances, income, expenses and dividends are eliminated on consolidation.
(c) Foreign currencies
The financial statements are presented in sterling (£), which is the functional currency of the parent company. Foreign currency transactions 
are translated into the functional currency of the parent company using prevailing exchange rates which are updated on a monthly basis. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the re-measurement of monetary items at year 
end exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss.
(d) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire, or when the financial asset and 
all substantial risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.
(e) Impairment of assets
The Group assesses whether there is any indication that any of its assets have been impaired at least annually. If such an indication exists, the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and compared to its carrying value.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in profit or loss.
(f) Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognised when present obligations as a result of a past event will probably lead to an outflow of economic resources from 
the Group and amounts can be estimated reliably. Timing or amount of the outflow may still be uncertain. A present obligation arises from the 
presence of a legal or constructive commitment that has resulted from past events.
Provisions are measured at the estimated expenditure required to settle the present obligation, based on the most reliable evidence available at 
the reporting date, including the risks and uncertainties associated with the present obligation. Provisions are discounted to their present values, 
where the time value of money is material. Any reimbursement that the Group can be virtually certain to collect from a third party with respect to 
the obligation is recognised as a separate asset. However, this asset may not exceed the amount of the related provision.
All provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. In those cases where the possible outflow 
of economic resources as a result of present obligations is considered improbable or remote, no liability is recognised.
(g) Equity
Share capital represents the nominal (par) value of shares that have been issued. Share premium includes any premium received on issue of share 
capital. Retained earnings includes all current and prior period retained profits and share-based employee remuneration. All transactions with 
owners of the parent are recorded separately within equity. Record plc Annual Report 2017

2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that 
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
Note 1.b. describes the basis which the Group uses to determine whether it controls seed funds. Note 19 covers the assumptions made in 
calculating the fair value of share options offered by the Group to its employees. The Directors have judged that the Group does not bear 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of its leasehold premises and therefore accounts for the leases as operating leases as 
described in note 23.
3. Revenue
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised in profit or loss when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that economic benefits will flow to 
the entity, the stage of completion can be measured reliably, and the costs incurred and costs to complete the transaction can be measured 
reliably also.
Management fees are accrued on a daily basis, typically based upon an agreed percentage of the assets under management equivalents 
(“AUME”) denominated in the client’s chosen base currency. The Group is entitled to earn performance fees from some clients where the 
performance of the clients’ mandates exceeds defined benchmarks by an agreed level of outperformance over a set time period. Performance 
fees are recognised at the end of each contractual performance period as this is the first point at which the fee amount can be estimated reliably 
and it is probable that the fee will be received.
Segmental analysis
The Directors, who together are the entity’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, consider that its services comprise one operating segment (being the 
provision of currency management services) and that it operates in a market that is not bound by geographical constraints. The Group provides 
Directors with revenue information disaggregated by product, whilst operating costs, assets and liabilities are presented on an aggregated basis. 
This reflects the unified basis on which the products are marketed, delivered and supported. 
(a) Product revenues
The Group has split its currency management revenues by product. Other income includes gains or losses from foreign exchange conversion, 
gains or losses on derivative financial instruments (see note 15), gains or losses on seed investments that have not been consolidated on a 
line-by-line basis and fees from other related services.

Aggregate staff costs        10,434 9,693
Other employment benefit costs include share-based payments, share option costs, and costs relating to the Record plc Share Incentive Plan.
6. Taxation – Group
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year. Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations 
to, or claims from, fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior reporting periods, that are unpaid at the reporting date. Current tax is payable 
on taxable profit, which differs from profit or loss in the financial statements. Calculation of current tax is based on tax rates and tax laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
The total charge for the year can be reconciled to the accounting profit as follows:
        2017 2016 
        £’000 £’000
Profit before taxation        8,675 6,933
Taxation at the standard rate of tax in the UK of 20% (2016: 20%)     1,735 1,387

Adjustments recognised in current year in relation to the current tax of prior years    — 4
(Profit)/loss attributable to non-controlling interests      (164) 26
Other temporary differences       (46) 62
Total tax expense        1,540 1,523
The tax expense comprises:  
Current tax expense        1,599 1,493
Deferred tax expense        (59) 30
Total tax expense        1,540 1,523
The standard rate of UK corporation tax for the year is 20% (2016: 20%). A full corporation tax computation is prepared at the year end. 
The actual charge as a percentage of the profit before tax may differ from the underlying tax rate. Differences typically arise as a result of capital 
allowances differing from depreciation charged, and certain types of expenditure not being deductible for tax purposes. Other differences may 
also arise.
The tax charge for the year ended 31 March 2017 was £1,539,580 (2016: £1,522,827) which was 17.7% of profit before tax (2016: 22.0%). Record plc Annual Report 2017

7. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as for the basic earnings per share with a further adjustment to the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares to reflect the effects of all potential dilution.
There is no difference between the profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent used in the basic and diluted earnings 
per share calculations.
        2017 2016
Weighted average number of shares used in calculation of basic earnings per share    217,401,660 217,176,877

        pence pence
Basic earnings per share        2.91 2.55
Diluted earnings per share        2.90 2.54
The potential dilutive shares relate to the share options granted in respect of the Group’s Share Scheme (see note 19). There were share 
options in place at the beginning of the period over 13,369,249 shares. During the year 1,589,458 share options were exercised, and a further 
2,320,748 share options lapsed or were forfeited. The Group granted 4,197,521 share options with a potentially dilutive effect during the year. 
All of the 13,656,564 share options in place at the end of the period have a dilutive impact at the year end.
8. Dividends
Interim and special dividends are recognised when paid and final dividends when approved by shareholders.
The dividends paid by the Group during the year ended 31 March 2017 totalled £3,591,603 (1.65 pence per share) which comprised a final 
dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2016 of £1,790,888 (0.825 pence per share) and an interim dividend for the year ended 
31 March 2017 of £1,800,715 (0.825 pence per share).
The dividends paid by the Group during the year ended 31 March 2016 totalled £3,749,849 (1.725 pence per share) which comprised a 
final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2015 of £1,962,261 (0.90 pence per share) and an interim dividend for the year ended 
31 March 2016 of £1,787,588 (0.825 pence per share).
For the year ended 31 March 2017, a final ordinary dividend of 1.175 pence per share has been proposed and a special dividend of 0.91 pence 
per share has been declared.
9. Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates defined contribution pension plans for the benefit of employees. The Group makes contributions to independently 
administered plans, such contributions being recognised as an expense when they fall due. The assets of the schemes are held separately from 
those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The Group is not exposed to the particular risks associated with the operation of Defined Benefit plans and has no legal or constructive obligation 
to make any further payments to the plans other than the contributions due.
The pension cost charge represents contributions payable by the Group to the funds and amounted to £375,845 (2016: £479,206). Record plc Annual Report 2017

11. Intangible assets
Intangible assets are shown at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to profit or loss 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Amortisation is included within 
operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. 
Useful lives are as follows:
• Software – 2 to 5 years
Amortisation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.

Management (US) Inc. is incorporated in Delaware (registered office: Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Wilmington, 
DE 19808), and all other subsidiaries are registered in England and Wales with their registered office at Morgan House, Madeira Walk, 
Windsor, Berkshire SL4 1EP , UK.
Investment in funds
In addition to the subsidiaries listed above, funds are consolidated where the Group has determined that a controlling interest exists through an 
investment holding in the fund, in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. These funds are seed investments, which have 
various investment objectives and policies and are subject to the terms and conditions of their offering documentation. The principal activity of 
each is to invest capital from investors in a portfolio of assets in order to provide a return for those investors.
The Group has controlled both the Record Currency – Emerging Market Currency Fund and the Record Currency – Strategy Development Fund 
throughout the year ended 31 March 2017 and the comparative period, the year ended 31 March 2016, and both were consolidated in full, on 
a line-by-line basis in the Group’s financial statements throughout these periods.
The Group was not in control of the Record Currency – FTSE FRB10 Index Fund as at 1 April 2015, at which point the Group did not consolidate 
the fund on a line-by-line basis, but the Group did regain control of the fund on 1 September 2015 and has consolidated it in full on a line-by-line 
basis since that date. 
In May 2013, the Company invested in the Record Currency – Global Alpha Fund which changed its name to Record Currency – 
Strategy Development Fund in November 2015. The Group has controlled this fund since inception, and the fund is consolidated in full 
on a line-by-line basis. Record plc Annual Report 2017

13. Deferred taxation – Group
Deferred tax is the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities shown 
on the statement of financial position. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of recovery or settlement of the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be 
utilised. The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets are reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
A deferred tax liability is generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets or liabilities arising on goodwill are not recognised but are however recognised on separately identifiable intangible assets. 
Deferred tax arising on the initial recognition of an asset or liability, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised.

intrinsic value for tax purposes of £1,006,095 (2016: £47,742). On exercise the Group will be entitled to a corporation tax deduction in respect of 
the difference between the exercise price and the strike price. There is no unprovided deferred taxation.
14. Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their original invoice value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash 
receipts over the short credit period is not considered to be material. Individual receivables are considered for impairment when they are past 
due or when other objective evidence is received that a specific counterparty will default. Impairment of trade receivables is presented within 
administrative expenses.

15. Derivative financial assets and liabilities
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at cost on the date on which the contract is first entered into unless the fair value at 
acquisition is different to cost, in which case fair value is recognised. Subsequently they are measured at fair value with gains and losses 
recognised in profit or loss. Transaction costs are immediately recognised in profit or loss. The fair values of derivative financial instruments 
are determined by reference to active market transactions.
The Group holds derivative financial instruments for two purposes. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk 
associated with sales denominated in foreign currencies, and additionally uses both foreign exchange options and forward foreign exchange 
contracts in order to achieve a return within the seed funds. The instruments are recognised at fair value. The fair value of the contracts is 
calculated using the market rates prevailing at the period end date. The net gain or loss on instruments is included within revenue.

16. Cash management
The Group’s cash management strategy employs a variety of treasury management instruments including cash, money market deposits and 
treasury bills. Whilst the Group manages and considers all of these instruments as cash, which are subject to its own internal cash management 
process, not all of these instruments are classified as cash or cash equivalents under IFRS.
IFRS defines cash and cash equivalents as cash in hand, on demand and collateral deposits held with banks, and other short-term highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Moreover, 
instruments can only generally be classified as cash and cash equivalents where they are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash 
commitments rather than for investment or other purposes.
In the Group’s judgement, bank deposits and treasury bills with maturities in excess of 3 months do not meet the definition of short-term or highly 
liquid and are held for purposes other than meeting short-term commitments. In accordance with IFRS, these instruments are not categorised as 
cash or cash equivalents and are disclosed as money market instruments with maturities >3 months.

19. Share‑based payments
During the year ended 31 March 2017 the Group has managed the following share-based compensation plans: 
a) the Group Profit Share Scheme: share awards issued under the Group Profit Share Scheme are classified as share-based payments with 
cash alternatives under IFRS 2;
b) the Record plc Share Scheme: share options issued under the Record plc Share Scheme are classified as equity-settled share-based 
payments under IFRS 2; and
c) the Record plc Share Incentive Plan: the Group operates the Record plc Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) to encourage more widespread ownership 
of Record plc shares by employees. The SIP is a tax-approved scheme offering attractive tax savings for employees retaining their shares in 
the scheme over the medium to long term.
All obligations arising from the three schemes are fulfilled through purchasing shares in the market. Record plc Annual Report 2017

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended 31 March 2017
19. Share‑based payments continued
(a) Group Profit Share Scheme
Share‑based payments with cash alternatives
These transactions are compound financial instruments, which include a debt element and an equity element. The fair value of the debt component 
of the amounts payable to the employee is calculated as the cash amount alternative offered to the employee at grant date and the fair value of the 
equity component of the amounts payable to the employee is calculated as the market value of the share award at grant date less the cash forfeited 
in order to receive the share award. The debt component is charged to profit or loss over the period in which the award is earned and remeasured at 
fair value at each reporting date. The equity component is charged to profit or loss over the period in which the award is earned.
The Group Profit Share Scheme allocates a proportion of operating profits to a profit share pool to be distributed between all employees of 
the Group. The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to vary the proportion awarded to the profit share pool between 25% and 35% 
of operating profits, with the intention of maintaining an average level of 30% of operating profits over the medium term. Directors and senior 
employees receive one third of their profit share in cash, one third in shares (“Earned Shares”) and may elect to receive the final third as cash only 
or to allocate some, or all, of the amount for the purchase of Additional Shares. The charge to profit or loss in respect of Earned Shares in the 
period was £733,858 (2016: £631,252). Other employees receive two thirds of their profit share in cash and may elect to receive the final third as 
cash only or to allocate some, or all, of the amount for the purchase of Additional Shares.
If an individual elects to receive Additional Shares, the Group simultaneously awards a Matching Share value amount using a multiple decided 
by the Remuneration Committee. The multiple is dependent on the level of seniority of the employee. The number of shares is determined by 
the post-tax cash attributed to Earned Shares plus Additional Shares plus Matching Shares divided by the aggregate market value achieved 
on the purchase of all such shares in the market. The charge to profit or loss in respect of Matching Shares in the period was £292,525 
(2016: £262,426). Shares awarded under the Profit Share Scheme do not include any vesting restrictions but rather restrictions over subsequent 
sale and transfer. All shares which are the subject of share awards vest immediately and are transferred to a nominee allowing the individual to 
retain full rights in respect of the shares purchased. These shares cannot be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of without the consent of the 
Remuneration Committee except as follows:
• Earned Shares – one third on each anniversary of the Profit Share Payment date; and
• Additional or Matching Shares – the third anniversary of the Profit Share Payment date for Directors and senior employees and the second 
anniversary of the Profit Share Payment date for all other employees.
The Group Profit Share Scheme rules contain clawback provisions allowing for the repayment of profit share payments under certain 
circumstances including a material breach of contract, an error in performance of duties or a restatement of accounts which leads to a change 
in any prior award under the scheme. 
Shares awarded under this scheme are purchased in the market.
(b) The Record plc Share Scheme
Equity‑settled share‑based payments
The fair value of the amounts payable to employees under these awards is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the award, 
with a corresponding increase in equity. All such awards made by the Group involve the parent company granting rights to its equity instruments 
to employees of its subsidiary. Consequently the subsidiary measures the services received from its employees in accordance with the above 
classification under IFRS 2 and recognises a corresponding increase in equity as a contribution from the parent. The parent has the obligation 
to settle the transaction with the subsidiary’s employees and therefore recognises an increase in its investment in the subsidiary and a 
corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of options granted is measured at grant date using an appropriate valuation model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The fair value amounts for the options issued since flotation were determined using 
quoted share prices.
The Record plc Share Scheme allows deferred share awards to be granted to employees and Directors in the Record Group. Part 1 of the 
Record plc Share Scheme allows the grant of Unapproved Options to employees and Directors and Part 2 allows the grant of HMRC Approved 
Options to employees and Directors. Each participant may be granted Approved Options over shares with a total market value of up to £30,000 
on the date of grant. There is no such limit on the value of grant for Unapproved Options, which have recently been granted with a market value 
exercise price in the same way as for the Approved Options.
Options over an aggregate of 4,197,521 shares were granted under the Share Scheme during the year (2016: 4,402,249), of which 3,790,000 
were made subject to Unapproved Options and 407,521 to Approved Options (2016: 3,197,500 made subject to Unapproved Options and 
1,204,749 to Approved Options). All options were granted with an exercise price per share equal to the share price prevailing at the time of grant.
The 328,574 Approved Options issued on 30 November 2016 each become exercisable on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to 
the employee being in employment with the Group at the relevant vesting date and to the extent performance conditions have been satisfied.
The 1,590,000 Unapproved Options issued on 30 November 2016 each become exercisable in four equal tranches on the first, second, third and 
fourth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the employee being in employment with the Group at the relevant vesting date and to the extent 
performance conditions have been satisfied. Record plc Annual Report 2017
91
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information
The 2,200,000 Unapproved Options issued on 30 November 2016 each become exercisable in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and 
fifth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the employee being in employment with the Group at the relevant vesting date and to the extent 
personal performance conditions have been satisfied.
The 78,947 Approved Options issued on 31 January 2017 each become exercisable on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, subject 
to the employee being in employment with the Group at the relevant vesting date and to the extent performance conditions have been satisfied.
The fair value of the services provided by employees has been calculated indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. 
Fair value amounts for the options granted in the year ended 31 March 2017 were determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing method and 
the following assumptions:
Model input        Weighted average value
Share price          34.1p
Exercise price         34.1p
Expected volatility         60%
Option life         2.3 years
Risk-free interest rate (%)         0.73%
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility.
The Group share-based payment expense in respect of the Share Scheme was £200,220 for the year ended 31 March 2017 (2016: £240,067).
Outstanding share options
At 31 March 2017, the total number of ordinary shares of 0.025 pence outstanding under Record plc share compensation schemes was 
13,656,564 (2016: 13,369,249). These deferred share awards and options are over issued shares, a proportion of which are hedged by shares 
held in an Employee Benefit Trust. Details of outstanding share options and deferred shares awarded to employees are set out below:

Performance measures
Performance conditions attached to all options granted to Board Directors differ to those granted for all other staff. All Executive Director option 
awards are subject to a performance condition and vest on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant subject to an 
earnings per share (“EPS”) hurdle linked to the annualised EPS growth for the respective three, four and five year periods from grant. Vesting 
is on a stepped basis, with 25% of each tranche vesting if EPS growth over the relevant period is at least RPI plus 4% per annum, increasing 
through 50%, 75% and with 100% vesting if EPS growth exceeds RPI plus 13%, as shown in the table below. Options awarded subject to EPS 
performance conditions are valued using a Black-Scholes model.
       Percentage of shares subject  
Record’s average EPS growth      to the award which vest
>RPI growth + 13%         100%
>RPI growth + 10%, = <RPI + 13%        75%
>RPI growth + 7%, = <RPI + 10%        50%
>RPI growth + 4%, = <RPI + 7%        25%
=<RPI growth + 4%         0%
Approved options issued to all other staff are subject to performance measures linked to the Group’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) and vest 
on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to these measures. At vesting date, a percentage of the total options granted may vest 
based upon Record’s TSR performance versus the median TSR performance as measured against the FTSE 350 General Financial – Price Index. 
Options awarded subject to TSR performance conditions are valued using a Black-Scholes model. The performance target table is given below:
     Percentage of shares subject  
Percentage by which Record’s TSR is below the median TSR performance of the Index to the award which vest
Equal to or above the median TSR performance       100%
Equal to or above 75% of the median TSR performance       75%
Equal to or above 50% of the median TSR performance       50%
Below 50% of the median TSR performance       0%
Unapproved options issued to all other staff vest in four equal tranches on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, 
subject to the employee being employed with the Group at the relevant vesting date and to the extent personal performance conditions have 
been satisfied. 
Clawback provisions
In addition to the performance measures above, both Approved and Unapproved Options granted to Executive Directors under the Share 
Scheme are subject to clawback provisions. These provisions allow the Remuneration Committee to adjust the number of shares that may be, 
or were, acquired to be decreased if the committee considers that either a material breach of contract has arisen or in respect of retrospective 
amendments required to calculations of the Group’s performance upon which vesting calculations were originally based. The clawback provisions 
allow the Group to take various steps until the clawback obligation is satisfied, including reduction of future share option awards, transfer of shares 
back to the Group for nil consideration, reduction of future payments under the Group Profit Share Scheme or payment of sales proceeds back to 
the Group. Record plc Annual Report 2017

(c) The Record plc Share Incentive Plan
The Group operates the Record plc Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”), to encourage more widespread ownership of Record plc shares by employees. 
The SIP is a tax-approved scheme offering attractive tax savings for employees retaining their shares in the scheme over the medium to long term.
As an incentive to employees, the Group matches every two shares bought by employees with a free matching share. During the year, the Group 
awarded 49,264 free shares (2016: 49,223 free shares) to employees. The expense charged in respect of the SIP was £14,838 in the year ended 
31 March 2017 (2016: £14,690).
20. Non‑controlling interest
Record plc has made investments in a number of funds where it is in a position to be able to control those funds by virtue of the size of its own 
holding plus those of any related party. Non-controlling interests occur when Record plc is not the only investor in the fund. The non-controlling 
interest is measured at cost plus movement in value of the third party investment in the fund.
Record has seeded three funds which have been active during the year ended 31 March 2017.
The Record Currency – Emerging Market Currency Fund was considered to be under control of the Group as the combined holding of 
Record plc and its Directors constituted a majority interest throughout the period. Similarly, the Record Currency – Strategy Development Fund 
is considered to be under control of the Group as the combined holding of Record plc and its Directors has constituted a majority interest since 
inception. The Record Currency – Strategy Development Fund was known as the Record Currency – Global Alpha Fund until it was renamed 
on 26 November 2015.
The Record Currency – FTSE FRB10 Index Fund was considered to be under control of the Group on 31 March 2017, but it was not under the 
control of the Group during the period from 28 February 2014 to 31 August 2015, when the amount of external investment meant that Record 
did not hold a majority interest.
The mark to market value of units held by investors in these funds other than Record plc are shown as non-controlling interests in the Group 
financial statements, in accordance with IFRS. There were no other non-controlling interests in the Group financial statements.

21. Financial risk management
The Group’s current activities result in the following financial risks and management responses to those risks in order to minimise any resulting 
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
Objectives, policies and processes for managing risk and the methods used to measure the risk
Financial assets principally comprise trade receivables, other receivables, money market instruments, cash and cash equivalents and derivative 
financial assets. Financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and derivative financial liabilities. The main risks arising from financial 
instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, each of which is discussed in further detail below.
The Group monitors and mitigates financial risk on a consolidated basis. The Group has implemented a framework to manage the risks of its 
business and to ensure that the Directors have in place risk management practices appropriate to a listed company. The management of risk is 
directed by the Board and reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Company’s material financial instruments are investments in the seed funds, and balances due to/from Group undertakings. Intercompany 
balances are classified as loans and receivables and are repayable on demand. No interest is charged on these balances. The Group has sufficient 
cash resources and hence management does not believe that the Company has a material exposure to credit risk. The Company’s financial risk is 
managed as part of the Group financial risk management process and therefore separate disclosures for the Company have not been provided. Record plc Annual Report 2017
95
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information
Credit risk
The Group has established a cash management team to manage Group cash in accordance with an approved cash management policy. 
The policy stipulates exposure limits by instruments, counterparty, tenor and duration. Counterparty exposures are measured against ratings 
published by credit-rating agencies and are monitored daily. The maximum single exposure to any counterparty under the policy is 20% of total 
assets managed as cash.
The primary objective of the cash management team is to diversify and manage counterparty risk within the risk appetite of the Group and the 
limits set by the policy. The secondary objective is to maintain yield given the constraints under the policy whilst ensuring sufficient liquidity to 
meet future cash flow commitments as instructed by the finance team. 
The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for reviewing the Group’s credit exposure and ensuring that any credit concerns are raised to the Risk 
Management Committee and that action is taken to mitigate these risks.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is as follows:
        2017 2016 
Financial assets at 31 March       £’000 £’000
Trade receivables        5,937 4,027

Cash and cash equivalents        19,120 21,720
        43,326 39,953
The debtors’ age analysis is also evaluated on a regular basis for potential doubtful debts. It is management’s opinion that no provision for 
doubtful debts is required. The table below is an analysis of trade receivables and accrued income by due date: 
       Neither  More than 
      Carrying impaired nor 0‑3 months 3 months

       98% 2% 0%
The Group offers standard credit terms of 30 days from invoice date. It is the Group’s policy to assess debtors for recoverability on an individual 
basis and to make a provision where it is considered necessary. In assessing recoverability the Group takes into account any indicators of 
impairment up to the reporting date. The application of this policy generally results in debts that are 0-3 months overdue not being provided 
for unless individual circumstances indicate that a debt is impaired.
Trade receivables are made up of 54 debtors’ balances (2016: 51). The largest individual debtor corresponds to 16% of the total balance 
(2016: 15%). Debtor days, based on the generally accepted calculation of debtor days, is 91 days (2016: 70 days). This reflects the quarterly 
billing cycle used by the Group for the vast majority of its fees. As at 31 March 2017 2% of debt was overdue (2016: 2%). No debtors’ balances 
have been renegotiated during the year or in the prior year. Record plc Annual Report 2017

21. Financial risk management continued
Liquidity risk
The Group is exposed to liquidity risk, namely that it may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due. The Group maintains 
sufficient cash and marketable securities to be able to meet all such obligations. Management review cash flow forecasts on a regular basis to 
determine whether the Group has sufficient cash reserves to meet the future working capital requirements and to take advantage of business 
opportunities. The average creditor payment period is 33 days (2016: 14 days).

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument will fluctuate due to changes 
in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities held by the Group. Interest-bearing assets 
comprise money market instruments and cash and cash equivalents which are considered to be short-term liquid assets. It is the Group’s policy 
to settle trade payables within the credit terms allowed and the Group does not therefore incur interest on overdue balances. 
A sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed for the impact of interest rate changes as any reasonable range of change in interest rate would not 
directly have a material impact on profit or equity.

Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial commitment or recognised asset or liability will fluctuate due to changes 
in foreign currency rates. The Group makes use of forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the risk relating to future transactions in 
accordance with the Group’s risk management policy. 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and cash holdings that are denominated in a currency other than sterling, and also on 
assets and liabilities held by the Record Currency – Strategy Development Fund (formerly Global Alpha Fund). The principal currencies giving rise 
to this risk are the US dollar, the Swiss franc, the euro and the Canadian dollar. 
During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group invoiced the following amounts in currencies other than sterling:
        Local Value in  
        currency reporting  
        value currency 
        ‘000 £’000
Swiss franc (CHF)        14,083 11,021
US dollar (USD)        8,046 6,297
Euro (EUR)         2,055 1,750
Canadian dollar (CAD)        660 390
Swedish Krona (SEK)        482 43
Singapore dollar (SGD)        36 20
         19,521
The value of revenues for the year ended 31 March 2017 that were denominated in currencies other than sterling was £19.5 million 
(31 March 2016: £16.7 million).
Record’s policy is to reduce the risk associated with the Group’s sales denominated in foreign currencies by using forward fixed rate currency 
sales contracts, taking into account any forecast foreign currency cash flows.
The settlement of these forward foreign exchange contracts is expected to occur within the following three months. Changes in the fair values 
of forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised directly in profit or loss.
Of the cash denominated in currencies other than sterling (refer to note 16), only the cash holdings of the Record Currency – Strategy 
Development Fund (totalling £1,042,229) are not covered by the Group’s hedging process, therefore the Directors consider that the foreign 
currency risk on cash balances is not material.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on all the assets and liabilities held by the Record Currency – Strategy Development Fund, 
which are consolidated into the Group financial statements. The impact of the valuation of the net assets of this seed fund is incorporated into 
the analysis of sensitivity to the sterling/US dollar rate below. Record plc Annual Report 2017

denominated in foreign currencies as experienced in the given period.
 Impact on profit after tax Impact on total equity

10% strengthening in the £/CHF exchange rate    (682) (583) (682) (583)
Sterling/US dollar exchange rate
The impact of a change of 10% has been selected as this is considered reasonable given the current level of exchange rates and the volatility 
observed both on a historical basis and market expectations for future movement. When applied to the average sterling/USD exchange rate of 
$1.30/£ this would result in a weakened exchange rate of $1.19/£ and a strengthened exchange rate of $1.44/£.
Sterling/Swiss franc exchange rate
The impact of a change of 10% has been selected as this is considered reasonable given the current level of exchange rates and the volatility 
observed both on a historical basis and market expectations for future movement. When applied to the average sterling/CHF exchange rate of 
CHF1.29/£ this would result in a weakened exchange rate of CHF1.17/£ and a strengthened exchange rate of CHF1.43/£.
Sensitivity analyses have not been disclosed for other currencies as any reasonable range of change in exchange rate would not have a material 
impact on profit or equity. 
Emerging Market Currency Fund
The Group seeded a product in December 2010 called the Record Currency – Emerging Market Currency Fund, which manages a portfolio of 
emerging market currency deliverable forward exchange contracts and emerging market currency non-deliverable forward exchange contracts 
in order to achieve a return. As Record plc exerts control over the fund, it has been consolidated into the Group’s primary statements. The net 
assets of the fund at 31 March 2017 were £5,411,855 (2016: £4,583,029). 
The Group is not materially exposed to any of the 19 Emerging Market currencies traded in its portfolio, but the Group has considered sensitivity 
to Emerging Market currencies as a group in the following table:
 Impact on profit after tax Impact on total equity 
 for the year ended 31 March as at 31 March
 
      2017 2016 2017 2016 
      £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000

10% appreciation in the Emerging Market portfolio    490 412 490 412
The impact of a change to the portfolio value of 10% has been selected as this is considered reasonable given the current level of exchange rates 
and the volatility observed both on a historical basis and expectations for future movement in emerging markets.
22. Fair value measurement
The following table presents financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position in accordance 
with the fair value hierarchy. This hierarchy groups financial assets and liabilities into three levels based on the significance of inputs used in 
measuring the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Record plc Annual Report 2017
99
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information
The level within which the financial asset or liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of input to the fair value measurement. 
The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into the fair value hierarchy as follows:

Basis for classification of financial instruments classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy
Both forward foreign exchange contracts and options are classified as level 2. Both of these instruments are traded on an active market. Options 
are valued using an industry standard model with inputs based on observable market data whilst the fair value of forward foreign exchange 
contracts may be established using interpolation of observable market data rather than from a quoted price.
Classes and fair value of financial instruments
It is the Directors’ opinion that the carrying value of all financial instruments approximates to their fair value.

23. Operating lease commitments
Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under these 
operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Benefits received as an incentive to sign a lease, 
whatever form they may take, are credited to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
On 25 January 2006, the Group signed a ten year lease on premises at First Floor, Morgan House, Madeira Walk, Windsor, at an annual 
commitment of £229,710 per annum and this expired on 19 June 2016. On 20 May 2016, a lease extension was signed allowing the business 
to remain in its current offices from 20 June 2016, for a maximum of nine months to 20 March 2017. Simultaneously, an agreement for lease was 
signed on alternative space in the same building, subject to the completion of refurbishment works, allowing the business to remain in the same 
building until September 2022. 
On 7 September 2016, the Group signed a new lease on premises at Second and Third Floors, Morgan House, Madeira Walk, Windsor, at an annual 
commitment of £507,603 per annum, expiring 1 September 2022. On 28 November 2016 staff relocated from First Floor, Morgan House to the new 
offices on Second and Third Floor, Morgan House. The lease extension for First Floor, Morgan House was terminated on 30 November 2016.
On 16 March 2016, the Group signed a three year lease on premises in New York City, at an average annual commitment of $125,840 per annum. 
The Group has considered the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased properties, and considers that they remain with the lessors. 
Consequently, all property leases are recognised as operating leases.
At 31 March 2017 the Group had commitments under non-cancellable operating leases relating to land and buildings as set out below:

During the year, one Director of the Company (2016: three) participated in the Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme.
Transactions with seeded funds
From time to time, the Group injects capital into funds operated by the Group to trial new products (seed capital). If the Group is able to exercise 
control over such a seeded fund by holding a majority interest (whether the majority interest is held by Record plc alone, or by combining the 
interests of Record plc and its Directors), then the fund is considered to be a related party.
Record Currency – Strategy Development Fund (formerly Global Alpha Fund) and Record Currency – Emerging Market Currency Fund are both 
related parties on this basis. Similarly, the Record Currency – FTSE FRB10 Index Fund has been a related party since the Record plc holding 
became a majority interest as a result of a divestment of an external investment from the fund. There were no transactions between the Company 
and these funds during the year. Record plc Annual Report 2017

26. Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are (i) to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, (ii) to provide an adequate 
return to shareholders, and (iii) to meet regulatory capital requirements set by the UK Financial Conduct Authority.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of 
changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the 
Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, or issue new shares. The Group had no debt 
in the current or prior financial year and consequently does not calculate a debt-to-adjusted capital ratio.
The Group’s capital is managed within the categories set out below:
        2017 2016 
        £m £m
Regulatory capital        8.9 8.5
Other operating capital        24.6 22.2
Operating capital        33.5 30.7
Seed capital        3.3 3.0
Total capital (excluding NCIs)       36.8 33.7
Operating capital is intended to cover the regulatory capital requirement plus capital required for day to day operational purposes and for other 
investment purposes. The Directors consider that the other operating capital significantly exceeds the actual day to day operational requirements.
Seed capital is the capital deployed to support the growth of new funds. Seed capital is limited to 15% of the Group’s total capital.
For regulatory capital purposes Record plc is subject to consolidated financial supervision by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). Our 
regulatory capital requirements are in accordance with FCA rules and consistent with the Capital Requirements Directive. Our financial resources 
have exceeded our financial resource requirements (regulatory capital requirements) at all times during the year. Further information is provided in 
the Business review.
27. Ultimate controlling party

PRODUCT CLASSIFICATION
Record has historically reported AUME and management fees between four core products, being Dynamic Hedging, Passive Hedging, 
Currency for Return and Cash and other.
However, clients may also elect for mandates with combined hedging and return-seeking objectives, which cannot readily be separated into 
hedging and return-seeking components. Therefore, to reflect such mandates held not only with current clients but also with potential future 
clients, a new product category has been introduced: Multi-product mandates. This new classification does not represent a new service line, 
but rather seeks to redefine the boundaries between existing products, and combinations of products.
To assist in understanding the changes, AUME, management fees and management fee rates by product have been presented under both 
historic and revised conventions. 
AUME for the Multi-product classification is based on the mandate size of those mandates, in order to maintain the clear link between AUME, 
fee levels and management fees. This change in definition gives rise to an AUME adjustment in the reconciliation below of -$1.5 billion as at 
31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: -$0.8 billion). These adjustments do not represent a genuine AUME flow.
