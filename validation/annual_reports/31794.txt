Case study
Mr and Mrs Price recently  
left their life in Wales behind to 
move closer to their family in the 
West Midlands. Since moving to 
McCarthy & Stone’s Algar Court 
Retirement Living development in 
Wolverhampton, there have been 
smiles all round as they spend more 
time seeing their grandchildren 
grow up.
Commenting on the decision to 
relocate, Mrs Price said, “We visited 
Algar Court with our son, daughter-
in-law and grandchild and we 
instantly fell in love - we felt the  
high-quality living and beautiful 

we could get used to. We were 
pleasantly surprised at how simple 
and stress-free McCarthy &  Stone 
managed everything - the estate 
agent and removal fees were 
all included in the price of the 
apartment and our House  
Manager was really helpful with  
the transition, she even showed  
us the local area and sorted our  
bus passes.”
 
As well as more quality time with 
family, the couple were also seeking 
companionship and security, as Mrs 
Price comments,s “While we have 
only been here a short time, we 
already feel right at home among 
the fantastic community at the 
development. We can go to the 

and there will always be someone 
to chat to. Everyone has been really 
welcoming - our family visit a lot and 
join in the social events with us and 
our grandson has been a hit with 
the other homeowners!”

“I viewed the development with my 
daughters and son-in-law, and was 
shown a south-facing one-bedroom 
apartment, which I was immediately 
taken by. I was impressed with the 
beautiful décor and wide range of 
facilities, and was delighted I would 
be able to bring my 13 year-old cat 
with me. 
I really enjoy being part of the active 
community here, and everyone has

Lifestyle Living is our product for 
customers aged 55 and over looking  
to downsize into modern, high-quality  
and low-maintenance apartments in 
prestigious locations. Developments 
typically have fewer, but larger, 
apartments than our other core  
products, with more car parking. 
They are intelligently and attractively 
designed to future-proof later living. 
Features are incorporated discreetly 

developments typically feature an 
enhanced lobby area and an open-plan 
feel, with fewer shared facilities. Each 
apartment has two or three bedrooms,  

an en-suite bathroom and a walk-in 
wardrobe. 
As homeowners tend to be more 
independent, developments have a  
visiting manager who is also on-call.

There is a growing need for 
low-maintenance and well-
situated bungalows among  
the older population and the 
appropriateness of this form  
of housing in later life is  
well-proven. The supply of 
bungalows in the UK has also 
been in steady decline, with  
only 2,210
1
 new bungalows 
registered with the NHBC  
in 2016, in comparison to 
26,408

 in 1986. The particular 
shortage of bungalows and 
other houses for older people 
means they are likely to attract  
a premium compared to 
standard housing.
 
As of 31 August 2017, we had 
222 bungalows in our land bank.
Case study
For Martin and Marion Irving from 
Stamford Bridge, the key to a happy 
marriage and indeed a happy and 
active retirement isn’t having his 
and hers TV remotes, but riding  
in perfect harmony on their  
tandem bike.
 
“We love to go on adventures 
together and see where we end 
up”, says Martin.
 
‘’There’s nothing better than being 
out on the bike and it’s amazing the 
things you can discover and some 
of the beautiful places it can take 
you. We’ve had our bike for over  
10 years now and it’s one of the 
best things we’ve ever done”
 
Having recently moved to a new 
apartment at McCarthy & Stone’s 
Lifestyle Living development, 
Sovereign Court in Stamford Bridge, 
the couple have been able to enjoy 
even more of the cycling they love.
 
“We were attracted to the 
development because of its 
beautiful rural setting, which was 
perfect for our love of spending 
time outdoors’’.

Case study
Don and Brenda decided it was time 
to downsize when the upkeep of 
their family home started to become 
too much trouble. Don said, “While 

years ago, my wife and I remained in 
the family home. When taking care 
of the maintenance of the house - 
and especially the garden - started 
to become a real hassle, we decided 
the time was right to downsize to 
a low-maintenance two-bedroom 
apartment.
Homeowners at Squire Court can 
relax in the homeowners’ lounge, as 
well as the development’s beautiful 
landscaped gardens. Should friends 
or relatives wish to stay over, a guest 
suite is available to ensure all visitors 
enjoy a comfortable rest. Brenda 
commented, “We didn’t want to lose 
our ability to have our children stay 
over when they visit us, so having the 
guest suite is ideal.
Our House Manager, Maria Stratton, 
is always coming up with ideas for 
fun activities and events and there is 
always something fun going on. Living 
in a low-maintenance apartment 
means we have so much more free 
time to enjoy ourselves.”

Annual Bonus Plan (‘ABP’)
Cash and deferred shares
For FY18 the maximum bonus opportunity is 150% of salary.
The performance conditions and their weightings for the FY18 annual bonus are as follows:
 
 
 Group customer satisfaction (10%)
 Group land exchanges (10%)
One-third of any bonus earned will be in the form of deferred shares, which will be  
deferred for three years. 
The precise details of the targets themselves are deemed to be commercially sensitive  
 
it appropriate to disclose annual bonus targets during the year. However, details of  
the performance targets will be disclosed on a retrospective basis in next year’s  
Remuneration Report.
The Annual Bonus Plan (‘ABP’) contains clawback and malus provisions.
Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The performance conditions for the FY18 LTIP awards are earnings per share (‘EPS’), return on 
capital employed (‘ROCE’) and relative total shareholder return (‘TSR’) against the comparator 
housing group and FTSE 250 (excl. Financial Services and investment trusts). All three measures 
are assessed over a three-year performance period.  
For the achievement of threshold performance, 25% of the element will vest with straight-line 
vesting in between to maximum performance. The LTIP contains clawback and malus provisions. 
Please see the full Remuneration Policy as set out on pages 63 to 74 in our FY16 Annual Report for 
further details.
In FY18 an LTIP award up to a maximum of 150% of salary will be awarded to the Executive 
Directors. As stated in the Chairman’s letter, the FY18 LTIP will have a two-year post vesting 
holding period during which executives cannot sell vested shares other than for tax purposes. 92          McCarthy & Stone plc
FY18 LTIP targets The previous LTIP performance measures and targets were set in line with market practice, 
investor expectations and the medium-term business plan following the IPO. In light of the current 
economic and political uncertainty, the Remuneration Committee concluded that a review of the 
current structure was appropriate from a business perspective and necessary in order to maintain 

other senior executives over the near future. 
The Remuneration Committee decided to retain the existing performance measures (‘EPS’, ‘TSR’ 
and ‘ROCE’), which focus executives on maximising returns to shareholders through growth in 

previous awards, threshold performance will result in 25% vesting against each element, with 
100% vesting at or above the maximum performance target. However, the Committee proposes  
to amend the weightings and targets for the FY18 awards. 
The FY18 LTIP proposed performance measures, weightings and targets are outlined in the table 
below alongside those operated in respect of the previous LTIP award in FY17.

Changes to FY18 performance measures and rationale for change:
Increase EPS weighting to 37.5% 
 
 
the outcome  
 The EPS targets are set based on the three-year business plan and analyst consensus
Increase ROCE weighting to 37.5% and reduce threshold target to 20%

business and its business plan as set out on IPO. Therefore it is appropriate to increase the 
weighting of this measure
 The Committee believes that the maximum target of 25% ROCE remains a suitably stretching 
target and that achieving this within the performance period would represent exceptional 
performance and hence justify full vesting of this element of the LTIP. In order to improve 
alignment with the Company’s business plan for FY20, the threshold target will be set at  
20%. The Committee considers this level of performance to be realistic yet challenging,  
and representative of the Company’s medium-term business plan

Reduce Relative TSR weighting to 25% and split comparator group into two groups
 Our largest shareholders have a strong preference for shareholder return measures and 

appropriate to retain TSR as a performance measure 

housebuilders’ performance, other housebuilders have recovered largely as a result of the 
Government’s help-to-buy scheme which is not applicable to the Company. Notwithstanding 
this, the Committee feels that housebuilders remain an appropriate comparator group for TSR 
but that this should be balanced against the broader market by the introduction of a FTSE 250 
comparator group. The use of two peer groups would provide a more holistic assessment of 
performance against both a cyclical industry and performance against the broader market. 
Constituents of our housebuilder peer group are set out on page 95.  
The Committee believe that the additional two year holding period and the new weightings and 
targets will create the right balance between supporting a successful execution of the three-year 
business plan and incentivising the Executive Directors.

Base salary Provides a base level of 
remuneration to support

the necessary experience  
and expertise to deliver  
the Group’s strategy.
Set on appointment and  
reviewed annually or when  
there is a change in position

in their role. In such cases 
subsequent increases in salary  
may be higher than the general  
rises for employees until the  
target positioning is achieved.
The Committee ensures  
that maximum salary

operating in a similar sector. 
The companies in the comparator
