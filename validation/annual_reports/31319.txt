the year has started well with good trading momentum and Huntsworth is 
well positioned for further growth in 2018.

Chairman’s Statement
A very strong 
year at 
Huntsworth
I am pleased to report a very strong 
year at Huntsworth. We have made 
significant progress in executing our 
strategy of transforming the Group into 
a Healthcare marketing services-
focused business, helped by the 
acquisition of The Creative Engagement 
Group (‘TCEG’). 
Our continued focus on operational 
efficiencies and the elimination of 
loss-making agencies combined with 
strong organic growth from the 
Healthcare division produced a very 
strong like-for-like growth in headline 
profit of 20%.
We continued to refine and execute the 
Group’s strategy during 2017. The 
restructuring of the Group into four 
principal divisions following the 
acquisition of TCEG gives a better 
balance to our reporting structure and 
provides greater insight into the 
performance of the Group.
Buoyant trading in the three Healthcare-
focused divisions was again led by 
Evoke (within the Marketing division) 
and ApotheCom (in the Medical 
division), both of which had outstanding 
years. I was delighted to welcome TCEG 
into the Group in July, an excellent team 
with a passion for their work. They bring 
new capabilities in mixed media and 
exhibitions to the Group, as well as 
access to new types of clients. TCEG has 
performed well in its first six months, it 
is now fully integrated within the Group 
and is increasingly engaged in joint new 
business with other Group agencies.
We have made significant 
progress in executing our 
strategy of transforming the 
Group into a Healthcare 
marketing services focused 
business.

In our Communications division, I am 
pleased to report that Grayling has 
responded positively to its restructuring 
and has now returned to profitability, 
with a notably strong performance from 
its UK operation. Red has had a good 
year despite some client attrition, but 
recent wins emphasise its fundamental 
strength. Citigate Dewe Rogerson has 
had a solid year despite difficult market 
conditions in the UK and Asia.
There is real momentum at Huntsworth 
as all the agencies focus on what is of 
most value to their clients. There is a 
very different sense of what is possible 
than there was just over three years ago 
when I joined the Group. So it is with 
much sadness that, given my other 
commitments, I will step down as Chair, 
subject to an orderly succession 
process.
After three years’ service, Tim Ryan, the 
Group’s Senior Independent Director, 
stepped down from the Board in 
December 2017. I would like to thank Tim 
for his support and help in guiding the 
Group over the critical restructuring 
period from 2014 to 2017. Andy Boland, 
who is the Group’s longest serving 
Non-Executive Director, will become the 
new Senior Independent Director. We 
also welcomed Liz McKee Anderson to 
the Board on 1 January 2018. Liz brings a 
wealth of experience in healthcare and 
will be a valuable asset for the Group as 
it expands its Healthcare focus in the 
coming years.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank the management team and staff 
for their hard work in achieving the 
growth we have enjoyed this year and 
look forward to more of the same during 
2018.
These impressive results are an 
encouraging indicator of the progress 
made over the past three years. We 
enter 2018 with good trading 
momentum and confidence for the year 
ahead.

M&A procedures
The Board reviewed its procedures 
concerning M&A and was 
particularly engaged in the 
acquisition of TCEG.
Internal audit appointment
Given the diverse geographical 
spread of the Group, KPMG were 
duly appointed as internal auditors 
in 2017.
Shareholder dialogue
Throughout the year the Board 
actively engaged with its principal 
shareholders, particularly at the 
capital markets day.

Market Review
The trends 
and drivers 
that influence 
our markets
Huntsworth comprises a broad range  
of businesses, with a diverse geographic  
and sector reach. As such each of our 
businesses operates in markets with their 
own characteristics and dynamics. 
However, there are also overarching trends 
and drivers which are common across our 
businesses, at both a macro and micro 
level, which influence demand trends for 
our products and services and help shape 
the Group’s future strategy and focus.
Economic and political uncertainty
The Group is overwhelmingly weighted to lower risk 
jurisdictions, with 91% of the Group’s revenues generated 
from the US, UK and western Europe. Nevertheless, the 
past 18 months have seen an increase in political and 
economic uncertainty, particularly following the Brexit 
decision in the UK, the elections in the US, and the 2017 UK 
elections and resulting minority government. While the 
political and economic environment has remained 
relatively stable to date despite these changes, significant 
policy changes may have an impact, whether in respect of 
US tax reform, healthcare reform in the US, or wider 
economic policy. 
Exchange rate fluctuations
Largely as a result of the political developments above, 
exchange rates have proved relatively volatile over the 
past 18 months. The result has been a material impact on 
the Group’s results. In light of this, to enable a better 
understanding of the Group’s results, our like-for-like 
measures exclude the impact of exchange rate 
movements. Currency headwinds are currently anticipated 
into 2018, primarily as a result of the weaker US Dollar.

The world is getting older
The global population is getting older all the time. Within 
10 years there will be one billion individuals over the age of 
60. Over the next thirty years the changes will be even 
more significant, with global life expectancy rising by eight 
years, the number of over-65-year-olds doubling and the 
number of over-80-year-olds tripling.
The world is getting sicker 
Demand for healthcare is rising globally, and especially 
quickly in the US. 133 million Americans currently have at 
least one chronic disease, a number expected to rise to 164 
million in the next 10 years. This is mirrored in the global 
demand for prescription drugs, which is expected to grow 
at an average annual rate of over 6% for at least the next 
five years.
Drugs are getting more complex
Whilst overall demand for prescription drugs and other 
treatments is growing strongly, more complex drugs are 
growing particularly quickly. Biotech products are 
expected to account for 29% of total drug sales by 2022, 
up from 26% in 2017. This creates additional opportunities 
for agencies which are best able to navigate the complex 
regulatory and institutional environment surrounding  
these drugs.
Healthcare is becoming more digital
Healthcare providers and consumers are both becoming 
increasingly digital. Healthcare professionals are twice as 
likely to use online sources than print when making clinical 
decisions. Globally, over 60% of people use the internet to 
search for advice on health, medicines or medical 
conditions, a figure which rises to 80% in the US.
Increasing pressure on client budgets
Pressures on marketing budgets continue to intensify and 
there is increasing pressure to justify spend. As a result 
there is a demand for better measurement to quantify 
success and a need to see new ideas and new ways of 
solving problems.
Disruption of traditional marketing  
and consultancy
The lines between traditional marketing, advertising, 
communications and public relations are becoming 
increasingly blurred. This has led to intensifying 
competition from new entrants and established players, 
leading clients to more frequently review the solutions 
available to them. In this environment, innovative offerings 
are increasingly rewarded over established ways of  
doing things.
Integrated offering
Clients increasingly demand an integrated offering, to 
avoid the friction and inefficiencies of working with 
multiple agencies. Within this context it is important to 
shift away from siloed thinking and to focus on the wider 
client needs to determine how best to achieve their goals. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Resources and relationships
Business Model
Strong brands
Huntsworth’s businesses, in both the Healthcare 
and Communications divisions, operate under a 
range of strong, well-respected brands. Brands 
continue to be essential in a market which places 
a premium on trustworthy, quality businesses.
Experienced talent
The experience, knowledge and creativity of our 
people is integral to the success of our business. 
We have in place employment policies and 
practices that enable us to attract, retain and 
develop our talent and ensure the Group retains 
its market-leading position.
Strong client base
Huntsworth works with a range of longstanding 
clients, big and small; nearly two-thirds of our 
clients have been a customer for more than five 
years. In our Healthcare divisions we work with the 
biggest pharma companies in the world, including 
all of the top 20, as well as a number of smaller, 
nimble biotech companies. In our Communications 
division we work with a range of blue chip 
companies and household names.
Global network
All of our businesses operate globally which means 
that we can be where our clients are. Whilst each 
business is focused on the specific needs of its 
clients, we can create integrated teams – within or 
across our divisions – to address challenges that 
require a multidisciplinary solution.
Enabling growth
Huntsworth the Parent Company enables 
innovation and growth in the agencies, by taking 
on much of the administrative burden in areas  
such as financial control, treasury, tax, M&A, 
investor relations, legal services and internal  
audit. This frees up the agencies to provide  
better quality service to their clients.
Huntsworth generates value through  
a network of specialist agencies.

Initiatives
Progress and outlook
Strengthen the Group’s  
focus on Healthcare  
marketing services
Extend and grow our 
capabilities and services
Improve profitability  
across the Group
The Healthcare industry has a good long-term outlook, 
underpinned by strong fundamentals, including an ageing 
population and a rise in chronic health conditions. At the 
same time it is becoming increasingly competitive with 
the established pharma companies facing challenges 
from small biotech firms and other niche players. In this 
environment, Healthcare marketing services have an 
increasingly important role to play. 
The lines between traditional marketing, advertising, 
communications and public relations are becoming 
increasingly blurred. With clients critically reviewing the 
solutions available to them, and with a premium placed on 
innovative solutions, it is important to continually review 
our service offering and to extend and develop new 
capabilities and services. 
The Group has made significant progress over the past 
two years in improving its profitability but we aim to 
drive further operational and cost efficiencies, as well as 
focusing on higher value-add services, in order to deliver 
market-leading margins.

13%
Headline operating margin
Development of new  
capabilities and services
Healthcare now accounts for 
79% of Group profits, up from 
77% in 2016. The increase has 
been driven by a combination 
of strong organic growth 
from all divisions, combined 
with the acquisition of TCEG 
in July 2017. The increased 
weighting of Healthcare has 
been reflected in the revised 
reporting structure of the 
Group. Further growth in 
2018, combined with the 
annualisation of TCEG, is likely 
to increase Healthcare as a 
proportion of the Group.
Huntsworth has a culture 
which incentivises the creation 
of new capabilities, and our 
businesses are constantly 
challenged to think about what 
they do and why. Close links 
are also encouraged between 
the agencies to develop cross-
selling and cross-fertilisation. 
Meanwhile the acquisition of 
TCEG has meant our offering 
has been strengthened in a 
number of key areas, including 
exhibitions, live experiences 
and virtual reality. Over the 
course of 2018 we expect 
to continue to add to our 
service offering, through a 
combination of targeted M&A 
and organic development as 
appropriate.
Group headline operating 
margins have risen from 9% 
in 2015, through 10% in 2016 
to 13% in 2017. We expect this 
margin to improve further in 
2018, reflecting the growing 
proportion of higher margin 
businesses, the impact of cost 
savings actioned mid-way 
through 2017, and the effect of 
gearing on our fixed cost base.
Our four divisions each have sector or 
service specialisations which are aligned 
to Group objectives. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information

Over-reliance on 
Healthcare sector
Whilst the fundamentals of the 
Healthcare sector are good 
and offer a strong platform 
for sustainable growth, being 
overweight in Healthcare means 
that any changes to the political, 
economic or regulatory regime 
could have a disproportionate 
effect on the Group. This risk is 
currently deemed low, given the 
current and growing importance 
of the Healthcare sector.
Acquisitions or 
investments do not 
deliver expected benefits
There is a risk that acquisitions 
or investments do not deliver 
the expected benefits. This 
would mean an opportunity 
cost in terms of both cash and 
management time and attention, 
together with lower growth 
rates than anticipated. This risk 
is mitigated through careful due 
diligence and strategic appraisal 
on acquisition targets, and clear 
implementation plans and exit 
routes for organic investments.
New capabilities and services
Service offering does not 
meet market needs
If the service offering does not 
meet market needs, this would 
lead to a failure to retain clients 
or to win new clients. In turn this 
would impact upon the Group’s 
ability to grow its revenues 
and deliver for its stakeholders. 
This risk is mitigated through a 
continual critical review of our 
service offering and a detailed 
assessment of low-growth 
regions.
Acquisitions or 
investments do not 
deliver expected benefits
There is a risk that acquisitions 
or investments do not deliver 
the expected benefits. This 
would mean an opportunity 
cost in terms of both cash and 
management time and attention, 
together with lower growth 
rates than anticipated. This risk 
is mitigated through careful due 
diligence and strategic appraisal 
on acquisition targets, and clear 
implementation plans and exit 
routes for organic investments.
Improved profitability
Underinvestment in 
future growth
There is a risk that a focus 
on profitability and margin 
performance leads to a failure 
to invest in the business, which 
would impact on the longer-
term growth prospects. This risk 
is mitigated by a culture which 
prioritises long-term sustainable 
growth over short-term margin, 
an approach which is reflected 
in the incentive plans for key 
management.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Our evolving 
business model 
and strategy
Introduction
Huntsworth made strong progress in 
2017 with all operating divisions growing 
profit. Revenue grew by 9% to £197.0 
million and headline profit before tax by 
52% to £24.4 million. On a like-for-like 
basis, this represents growth of 4% and 
20% respectively.
As part of the strategic development of 
the Group and its increased focus on 
Healthcare we took the decision to 
streamline how we organise ourselves, 
providing shareholders with a better 
understanding of the Group and offering 
clients easier access to multiple services 
when required. The Group now has two 
distinct areas of focus: Healthcare, 
which is made up of three divisions, 
Medical, Marketing, and Immersive; and 
Communications, which constitutes one 
division and contains the agencies 
Grayling, Red and Citigate Dewe 
Rogerson. 
Healthcare remains the primary focus of 
Huntsworth. Fast-moving innovation in 
healthcare treatments, along with growing 
global demand for new drugs to help 
ageing populations, are driving a complex 
market place that requires a combination 
of higher margin consultancy services and 
more effective marketing.
Following a decision to 
streamline how we organise 
ourselves, the Group now 
has two distinct areas of 
focus; Healthcare and 
Communications.

Headline profit before tax
We see increasing opportunities arising 
from healthcare-focused clients seeking 
a more differentiated and increasingly 
digital offering for their medical and 
marketing communications. To further 
support this we acquired The Creative 
Engagement Group (‘TCEG’) in July 
2017 for £25.0 million, settled in cash. 
TCEG consists of three agencies that 
provide experiential marketing, primarily 
to healthcare clients. Its integration will 
further strengthen our digital capability 
while allowing TCEG to benefit from 
access to the Group’s global resources. 
While Huntsworth is firmly focused on 
developing and adding to its Healthcare 
assets, Communications remains an 
important part of the Group, contributing 
21% of profits before central costs. 2017 
has seen further good progress in 
reorganising and right-sizing elements of 
the offering, leaving the division in a 
better position to compete and increase 
profitability in the coming years.
Group performance overview
The Group’s performance this year 
primarily reflects a combination of 
strong growth from the three Healthcare 
divisions, the impact of a favourable 
move in exchange rates and Grayling’s 
return to profitability. The bridge below 
shows the key movements in headline 
profits in 2017.
 
A weaker sterling in 2017 compared to 
2016 has generated a translational gain 
of £1.1 million, with a further £2.0 million 
incremental gain on hedging 
instruments. The acquisition of TCEG 
added £1.5 million to profits, net of 
interest. Reduced losses on operations 
disposed of in either 2016 or 2017 added 
a further £0.1 million to profits. After 
adjusting for these factors, like-for-like 
profits were up 20% reflecting strong 
organic growth.
Revenues were £197.0 million in 2017 
(2016: £180.1 million), with favourable 
currency movements contributing £7.1 
million. On a like-for-like basis, revenues 
£’m 2017 2016
Operating profit 24.9 (14.5)
Goodwill impairment – 30.5
Restructuring costs – 2.0
Amortisation 1.4 0.9
Other highlighted items 0.1 (0.9)
Operating profit before highlighted items 26.4 18.0
Margin 13.4% 10.0%
Interest (2.0) (2.0)
Headline profit before tax 24.4 16.0
grew by 4%, reflecting strong organic 
growth from the Healthcare divisions, 
offset by decreases in revenues from the 
Communications division as we 
eliminated loss making agencies and 
clients.
Headline profit before tax was £24.4 
million (2016: 16.0 million), an increase  
of 52% or 20% on a like-for-like basis. 
Operating profits were £24.9 million 
(2016: loss of £14.5 million), with much  
of the improvement attributable to a 
lower goodwill impairment charge. The 
table below reconciles statutory to 
headline profits.
The Group’s effective tax rate has 
increased to 21% (2016: 18%) principally 
as a result of the increase in profits. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share 
were 5.8p (2016: 4.0p), an increase of 
45%. Looking forward we expect the 
recently announced tax reforms in the 
US to have a moderately positive effect 
on the Group’s tax rate. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Divisional
performance
overview
Marketing
Marketing is led by US-based Evoke, the 
Group’s largest agency, which primarily 
specialises in the marketing of 
prescription drugs directly to patients. It 
also incorporates specialist Healthcare 
public relations agency Tonic and 
Healthcare Professional Marketing 
agencies First Hand and Nitrogen. 
During the year the division continued 
to make good progress in Healthcare 
Professional Marketing (HCP) and the 
growing area of Payer Marketing. Clients 
are increasingly looking for a single 
agency solution as healthcare marketing 
becomes more integrated, digital and 
seeks to reach multiple stakeholders. In 
this context, the combining of marketing 
agencies under one management team 
will create additional growth 
opportunities in 2018. Overall, the 
division continued to experience very 
strong growth this year, increasing 
revenue by 18% (13% on a like-for-like 
basis) to £73.6 million with operating 
profit increasing by 26% (16% on a 
like-for-like basis) to £15.5 million.
Medical
Medical is led by UK and US-based 
ApotheCom, which specialises in 
medical communications strategy, 
underpinned by data and analytics. The 
Group has been transformed over the 
past two years by strong leadership and 
an increased focus on consultancy led 
services which has resulted in record 
revenue growth and improved operating 
margins. The division grew revenue by 
22% (18% on a like-for-like basis) to 
£30.9 million with operating profit 
increasing by 40% (34% on a like-for-like 
basis) to £8.3 million. 
Huntsworth made strong 
progress in 2017 with  
all operating divisions 
growing profits.

Investment case
Healthcare focus
The Healthcare industry has a good 
long-term outlook, underpinned by 
strong fundamentals, including an 
ageing population and a rise in chronic 
health conditions. At the same time it is 
becoming increasingly competitive 
with the established pharma 
companies facing challenges from 
small biotech firms and other niche 
players. In this environment, Healthcare 
marketing services have an increasingly 
important role to play. 
Leading brands
Huntsworth’s businesses, in both the 
Healthcare and Communications 
divisions, operate under a range of 
strong, well-respected brands. Brands 
continue to be essential in a market 
which places a premium on 
trustworthy, quality businesses. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information
14 15
Immersive
Immersive is led by The Creative 
Engagement Group which joined 
Huntsworth in July 2017. The Creative 
Engagement Group, through its 
agencies, WRG, The Moment and Just, is 
focused on providing deeply immersive 
experiences in exhibitions, events, 
training and internal communications, 
mostly for healthcare clients. This 
division has great potential to grow in 
the US and expand its offering in internal 
communications and mixed media.  
The division delivered revenues of  
£14.9 million and operating profits of 
£1.9 million.
The Communications division is 
comprised of Grayling, Red and 
specialist financial agency Citigate Dewe 
Rogerson (CDR). The division achieved 
revenues of £77.6 million (2016: £89.3 
million), a decline of 7% on a like-for like 
basis, and operating profit of £7.0 million 
(2016: £5.5 million), an improvement of 
24% on a like-for like basis. Declining 
revenues were largely the result of 
closing loss-making agencies in Grayling 
in both 2016 and 2017.
During the year, Grayling has responded 
well to the prior year restructuring and 
has returned to profitability. This was led 
by the UK business which saw a 
particularly strong rebound in 
performance. Overall, Grayling reported 
revenues of £40.5 million, lower by 11% 
on a like-for-like basis, with operating 
profit of £1.1 million against a prior year 
loss of £0.8 million. Red had a good 
year, with revenue growth of 3% and 
operating profit growth of 4% despite a 
difficult marketplace and client churn 
largely driven by procurement-led 
tenders. The agency won a number of 
significant new mandates, and we 
anticipate little net effect on trading in 
2018. Citigate Dewe Rogerson 
performed solidly with revenues of 
£22.2 million (2016: £22.1 million) and 
operating profit of £3.5 million (2016: 
£3.6 million). The results reflect a mixed 
performance across the agency, with a 
strong performance in the Netherlands 
offset by a weaker UK performance. A 
quieter Asian market impacted the 
Greater China business early in the year, 
however, all CDR operations benefited 
from an improving market towards the 
end of the year.
Dividend
Given the strength of the Group’s 
performance, the Company will be 
proposing to increase its final dividend 
by 16% to 1.45p, giving a total dividend 
for the year of 2.0p, an increase of 14% 
on the previous year.
Group Outlook
Despite increasing foreign exchange 
headwinds, the Group remains well 
positioned for further growth. Our 
Marketing, Medical and Immersive 
divisions are continuing to grow on the 
back of multiple client wins, and the 
Communications division continues to 
make progress. Our focus is to better 
serve our Healthcare clients by 
developing and adding capability to the 
Group, and with a strengthening balance 
sheet we are well placed to continue to 
do so. Overall, we are well positioned for 
future growth and look forward to 
reporting further progress in 2018.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank our Chair Derek Mapp for his 
leadership in guiding us all through the 
restructure of Huntsworth to where we 
are today. His contribution through a 
period of significant change can be seen 
in these results and we are delighted 
that he will stay with us until a new Chair 
has been appointed.

Medical
The Medical division works 
primarily with medical 
affairs stakeholders across 
pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology clients in the 
development and delivery of 
strategy and activities across 
the life cycle of a product. 
Core services span scientific 
strategy and communications, 
publications planning 
and delivery, specialized 
medical writing, medical 
education, payer and value 
communications and support 
for internal medical teams. 
Increasingly, medical affairs 
is taking a strategic and lead 
role in bringing new products 
to market, particularly areas 
of specialised medicine and 
rare diseases. This is driven 
by increased evidence 
requirements; market access 
hurdles; proliferation of 
stakeholders including patients 
who require information 
about clinical studies; and the 
strict regulatory environment 
meaning that activities prior 
to launch are increasingly 
medically led. 
Smart science alone does not ensure best 
patient outcomes. That is why our Medical 
division, led by ApotheCom, drives an 
integrated approach to medical strategy – 
combining science, market access, data and 
analytics to deliver meaningful change.

Strong cash 
generation and 
financial position
Revenue
In 2017 the Group delivered £197.0 
million, up from £180.1 million in 2016. 
On a divisional basis, 37% of revenue 
came from Marketing, 16% from Medical, 
8% from Immersive and 39% from 
Communications.
Geographically, 50% of Group revenue 
in 2017 was from the US; 31% from the 
UK; 13% from Europe; and 6% from Asia, 
the Middle East and Africa. 
Currency
Changes in exchange rates versus 2016 
increased revenues by £7.1 million and 
operating profits by £3.1 million.
The strengthening of Sterling against 
the Dollar between 31 December 2016 
and 31 December 2017 has also resulted 
in a £8.2 million debit to Other 
Comprehensive Income and Expense 
due to the retranslation of the Group’s 
overseas assets. 
Operating profit
Operating profit was £24.9 million (2016: 
loss of £14.5 million), with much of the 
increase attributable to the £30.5 million 
impairment charge in 2016. Before 
highlighted items, operating profit was 
£26.4 million (2016: £18.0 million), which 
represents a margin of 13.4% (2016: 
10.0%).
Central costs increased from £5.0 
million to £7.6 million, with £2.4 million 
of the increase relating to variable 
executive remuneration, being annual 
bonuses together with increased share 
option charges.
After excellent cash 
generation during the year, 
the Group ended 2017 in  
a strong financial position, 
with significant headroom 
against both facility limits 
and covenant levels.

Operating highlighted items of £1.5 
million comprise the following:
£’m
Acquisition related costs 0.4
Disposal related credit (0.3)
Amortisation of intangible 
assets 1.4
1.5
Acquisition costs relate to the 
acquisition of The Creative Engagement 
Group (‘TCEG’) on 1 July 2017. The 
disposal related credit relates to 
adjustments in respect of deferred 
consideration receivable on Whiteboard 
Advisors together with the recycling of 
exchange gains held in reserves on the 
disposal of Audacity.
Cash Flow and Net debt
Cash conversion of operating profit into 
operating cash flows before highlighted 
items was 113% (2016: 87%).
Operating cash flow before highlighted 
items was £29.8 million (2016: £15.6 
million). Free cash flow (after interest, 
tax and capital expenditure) was £20.7 
million (2016: £2.9 million). Dividend 
payments were £4.9 million (2016: £5.6 
million), which is down slightly on prior 
year despite an increased interim 
dividend as a result of a greater scrip 
take up. Net expenditure on acquisitions 
and disposals was £20.3 million, 
primarily relating to the acquisition of 
TCEG.
The resulting net debt at year-end was 
£36.3 million, up from £31.6 million at 
31 December 2016 despite spending 
£25.0 million on the acquisition of TCEG. 
This represents a gearing ratio of 1.2x 
EBITDA, or 1.1x on a pro-rata basis, 
comfortably within our covenant terms 
of 3.0x EBITDA.
Financial covenants based on the 
Group’s facility agreements continue to 
be comfortably met. After the year end 
the Group amended and extended its 
existing facility, as a result of which the 
Group has total committed facilities of 
£75 million available until September 
2021, with a further accordion option of 
£40 million and an uncommitted 
overdraft of £5 million.
Dividends
At the forthcoming AGM, the Board will 
propose a final dividend of 1.45p, 
bringing the total dividend for 2017 to 
2.0p, up 14% from 1.75p in 2016 and 
reflecting the strong growth in earnings. 
Subject to shareholder approval, the 
final dividend will be paid on 5 July 2018 
to all shareholders on the register at 
25 May 2018. The shares will trade 
ex-dividend on 24 May 2018. A scrip 
dividend alternative will be available. 
The dividend payout ratio for 2017 is 
34% (2016: 44%).
Tax
The total tax charge of £7.3 million 
(2016: £1.8 million) comprises an 
underlying tax expense of £5.1 million 
(2016: £2.9 million) together with a 
charge of £2.2 million on highlighted 
items (2016: credit of £1.1 million). The 
full year underlying tax rate is 21% 
(2016: 18%). The highlighted tax charge 
of £2.2 million relates primarily to 
deferred tax on intangible assets and 
the sale of Whiteboard Advisors. 
For the periods ended 31 December 
2017 and 31 December 2016 the Group 
has reclassified the deferred tax expense 
on US intangible assets from profit 
before tax and highlighted items into 
highlighted items. This is on the basis 
that the deferred tax expense would 
only ever crystallise on a sale of the 
relevant businesses, which is not 
anticipated at the current time, and such 
a sale would be a highlighted item.
Net corporation tax paid in the year was 
£3.3 million (2016: £2.1 million).
Earnings per share
Profits attributable to ordinary 
shareholders before highlighted items 
were £19.3 million (2016: £13.1 million). 
Profits after highlighted items 
attributable to ordinary shareholders are 
£15.7 million (2016: loss of £18.3 million).
Before highlighted items, basic earnings 
per share for 2017 is 5.9p (2016: 4.0p) 
and diluted earnings per share is 5.8p 
(2016: 4.0p). The comparatives have 
been adjusted for the disclosure change 
on deferred tax.
After highlighted items, basic earnings 
per share is 4.8p (2016: loss of 5.6p) and 
diluted earnings per share is 4.7p (2016: 
loss of 5.6p).

Principal Risks
How we 
manage risk
The Risk Committee,  
on behalf of the Board, 
undertakes a robust 
assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group.
During the year the Group’s principal 
risks and internal controls have been 
reassessed and the outcome of this 
reassessment is shown on pages 27 to 
30. Our risk management approach is 
designed to identify risks to the Group 
using both a bottom-up and top-down 
approach. The Group considers macro, 
strategic and operational risks, which 
includes all operational, IT and financial 
risks.
The likelihood and impact of each risk is 
determined using a risk scoring system. 
Appetite is set for each risk and 
indicators established to determine 
whether the Group is operating within 
the risk appetite set by the Board. The 
Group obtains various forms of ongoing 
assurance over the controls in place to 
mitigate each of the risks identified. All 
risks are documented in the Group’s risk 
register which is reviewed at least six 
monthly or more frequently as required. 
Further details of the risk management 
processes undertaken in the year are 
included in the Corporate Governance 
Report. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information

Trend Risk Risk and impact Mitigating factors
MACRO
Economic 
downturn
Any economic downturn may result in 
fewer new client mandates, longer 
procurement processes and a squeeze 
on pricing, or an outright reduction in 
business. This can impact both 
revenue growth and operating 
margins. Subdued global financial 
markets can result in reductions to the 
level of transactional activity, reducing 
client mandates.
Weak economic conditions can 
increase the length of time that clients 
take to pay for services, which can put 
pressure on the Group’s working 
capital. There is also an increased risk 
of bad debts occurring as a result of 
clients’ financial problems. 
The Group has a wide spread of clients both 
across geography and industry sector, reducing 
reliance on any one particular economic 
environment. 
Costs are managed in each business such that 
they can be flexed where needed in a downturn. 
However, where there are protracted economic 
difficulties in the Group’s key markets, the 
ability of the Group to minimise the impact is 
constrained and performance may deteriorate.
The Group closely reports and monitors aged 
debts, and ensures local management have 
action plans in place to minimise the risk of any 
loss.
Political 
instability
Political instability or change in our 
countries of operation may impact on 
our ability to operate, for example 
through licensing or regulatory 
changes.
The political environment can also 
have an impact on the wider economic 
conditions, either through the direct 
impact of government policies in our 
countries of operation, or through the 
impact on business confidence. 
The Group operates primarily within low-risk 
jurisdictions, with 91% of revenues coming from 
the US, UK and western Europe. Although the 
Health sector is regulated, our agencies have 
extensive experience in navigating the 
regulatory environment and in providing 
compliant solutions to clients. In addition, the 
underlying sector fundamentals are strong and 
give protection against the possibility of 
material adverse regulatory change. 
Currency risk A substantial proportion of the Group 
operates outside of the UK, with 
significant operations in the US and 
Europe. 
As a result, the Group’s reported 
profits and asset values are impacted 
by any fluctuation of Sterling relative 
to other currencies, particularly the US 
Dollar and Euro. The Group may also 
suffer restrictions on the ability to 
repatriate cash.
The proportion of the Group’s profits 
made in the US is increasing which 
increases the level of risk when 
exchange rates fluctuate. Exchange 
rates have also continued to prove 
volatile, particularly in light of the 
ongoing uncertainty over Brexit.
Most of the Group’s revenue is matched by 
costs arising in the same currency. Foreign 
exchange exposure is continually monitored, 
and the Group uses derivative financial 
instruments to mitigate this risk where deemed 
necessary. 
Borrowings are also available to be drawn down 
in US Dollars and Euros if required to hedge 
foreign currency exposure. Surplus cash 
balances are swept to the UK to minimise any 
exposure to particular currencies or locations. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

STRATEGIC
Over-reliance 
on Health 
sector
One of the Group’s strategic aims is to 
strengthen its focus on the Healthcare 
sector. In doing so, the Group’s 
exposure to a single sector increases. 
Given the strength of the Healthcare 
sector in the US, and the fact that 
consumer marketing of prescription 
drugs is largely confined to the US, an 
increased focus on Healthcare is also 
likely to lead to an increased exposure 
to the US economy.
By increasing the Group’s exposure to 
a single sector and single geography, 
there is a risk that the Group will be 
more materially affected by a 
downturn in these markets.
The fundamentals of the Healthcare sector are 
strong, as a result of ageing populations and 
increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, 
particularly in the US. This leads to growing 
end-user demand which is relatively unaffected 
by economic cycles, thereby mitigating against 
the risk of a downturn. In addition, the 
Healthcare marketing services sector is 
fragmented, which means there would be 
continued opportunity for growth even if the 
overall sector were to enter a downturn.
The Group is also expanding its suite of 
services, both organically and through 
acquisition, which increases the diversity of its 
offering within the Healthcare sector. 
Service 
offering fails 
to evolve to 
meet changing 
market needs
The communications industry is 
always changing, driven by client 
changes, technological change or 
emergence of competitors. The Group 
needs to be pro-active in identifying 
and delivering solutions to changing 
client needs. 
Failure to evolve can result in loss of 
market share, client losses and 
pressures on pricing, which can 
impact on revenue and margins.
The Group’s range of services and international 
footprint increasingly allows us to offer clients 
an integrated portfolio of services across 
geographical locations which are attractive to 
new clients and help to strengthen existing 
client relationships. 
The Group continues to diversify its service 
offering to provide a full spectrum of healthcare 
communications and public relations services. 
Reviews of all new business opportunities won 
and lost across the Group are performed 
regularly. Appropriate actions are taken where 
new business conversion rates are below 
expectations.
Acquisitions 
or investments 
fail to deliver 
expected 
growth
The Group’s strategy includes 
investing in new business 
opportunities, talent, start-ups and the 
acquisition of businesses which will 
broaden and enhance existing 
business operations. 
There is a risk that investments are 
based on inaccurate information or 
assumptions which fail to meet client 
needs and which may result in the 
investment being less financially 
beneficial than anticipated. 
All significant investments are supported by a 
business case, which must be approved by 
Executive Management and the Board, where 
appropriate.
Rigorous due diligence procedures are 
performed prior to all acquisitions in order to 
identify and evaluate potential risks to the 
extent possible.
In addition to the receipt of legal warranties and 
indemnities, the total consideration paid for a 
business typically includes an element of 
deferred consideration contingent upon future 
performance which mitigates the risk of 
overpaying for a business.

OPERATIONAL
Client 
dissatisfaction 
and loss of key 
clients 
Any loss of a key client would result in 
reduced revenues and profits and 
potentially an inability to recover 
amounts due under the contract.
The Group endeavours to build long-term 
relationships with its clients and to obtain 
preferred supplier and agency of record status 
where possible.
The Group has a large portfolio of clients and 
seeks to expand and diversify its client base 
where possible. Within each of our large 
healthcare clients, the Group typically provides 
services to multiple brands within that client. 
Client satisfaction reviews are also undertaken 
periodically to evaluate service quality.
Loss of key 
talent
The Group’s talent base is its most 
important resource. There is strong 
competition within the industry for 
experienced healthcare 
communications and PR professionals. 
Recruitment and retention of key 
individuals is important both for 
maintaining client relationships and 
ensuring that our services are of the 
highest quality.
The Group’s policy is to recruit both Directors 
and employees of the highest quality and to 
remunerate them accordingly. The Group 
carries out succession planning and provides 
promotion opportunities as well as operating 
both short-term and long-term incentive plans 
to motivate and retain key individuals.
Restrictive covenants are included in employee 
contracts where legally enforceable.
Poor 
profitability
Overservicing or underpricing may 
lead to poor profitability on client 
contracts, which could mean static or 
reduced returns to shareholders even 
if revenues are increasing.
The Group monitors the profitability of its 
operations, at both a business and a contract 
level. Poor profitability is quickly highlighted 
and remedial action – such as removing costs, 
or improving pricing discipline – is taken where 
appropriate.
Information 
systems access 
and security
Any information systems failure could 
negatively impact the Group’s 
business operations, including delays 
to client work. 
Unauthorised access to confidential 
information held by the Group could 
compromise our client relationships 
and have a detrimental effect on our 
reputation.
Cyber security risks are perceived to 
be increasing across the industry at 
the moment.
Business and IT disaster recovery plans have 
been implemented to minimise any disruption in 
the event of an IT failure.
External access to data is protected by the 
Group’s IT security, which is reviewed and 
tested frequently to ensure that the Group’s 
network is as secure as possible. Internal access 
to data is restricted appropriately. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Unethical 
business 
practices
Both reputational and operational 
damage may arise if the Group 
engages in actual or perceived 
unethical client work. Ethical matters 
that are not identified or managed 
appropriately could cause reputational 
damage to the Group.
The Group strives to foster a culture of 
openness, responsibility and ethical behaviour 
and has an externally managed whistleblowing 
process for the reporting of any unethical 
conduct. The Group’s Code of Ethics is 
provided to every employee and they are 
expected to read and formally acknowledge the 
content and act accordingly. 
Referral processes, including divisional 
committees, are in place to manage all 
perceived ethical and conflict issues. 
Loan facility 
and covenant 
headroom risk
Any liquidity issues could result in 
reputational damage and potentially 
impair the Group’s ability to make 
future acquisitions or settle existing 
obligations.
The Group has £75 million of multi-currency 
loan facilities with a syndicate of banks 
maturing in 2021, with an accordion option for a 
further £40 million as well as a £5 million 
uncommitted overdraft. Management closely 
monitors all covenants on the Group’s facilities 
and actively manages undrawn headroom. 
The Group has robust cash management 
processes including weekly cash reporting from 
our operations and cash pooling arrangements.
Legal and 
regulatory 
compliance
Any failure to adhere to legislative 
requirements, including imposed 
sanctions on the supply of services to 
certain individuals, businesses and 
countries, could lead to reputational 
as well as financial damage to the 
Group.
The Group uses internal and external legal 
counsel throughout the world to advise on local 
legal and regulatory requirements and minimise 
the risk of loss.
 
In-house training is conducted on key legislative 
matters such as health and safety, and the UK  
Bribery Act. 
Policies on gifts, entertainment, anti-bribery 
and corruption, electronic communications, 
share trading and confidentiality are 
communicated to all employees using 
dedicated Policy Management Software.

Going concern 
The Group’s activities, financial performance, position, cash 
flows and borrowing facilities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position, 
over the next 12 months are described in this report.
After reviewing the Group’s performance, future forecasted 
profits and cash flows, and ability to draw down on its facilities, 
the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, the Directors are satisfied that it is appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Company’s 
and the Group’s financial statements.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Corporate 
Governance Code 2014, the Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Company over a longer period than 12 
months. The Board has conducted this review over a period of 
three-years, which was selected because it is in line with the 
Group’s long term strategic planning period. 
The Group has developed an annual business planning process 
which comprises a strategic plan; a detailed budget for the 
next financial year; and financial projections for the two-years 
thereafter, which combine to form a three-year plan. This 
process produces consolidated and divisional three-year plans 
which are reviewed and approved by the Board and used to 
monitor performance. These plans form the basis of detailed 
cash flow and covenant forecasting used by the Board to 
assess the ongoing liquidity and solvency of the Group.
In reviewing the three-year plan in 2017, the Board assessed the 
principal risks associated with the business model and strategy as 
outlined on pages 8 to 11, including the likelihood and potential 
impact of these occurring. These risks formed the basis of the 
reverse stress testing undertaken to assess the longer term 
viability of the Group. This considered severe but plausible 
scenarios and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions. 
In making their assessment, the Board considered the diversity of 
the Group’s operations, including the number of different 
agencies which make up the Group, our diverse client portfolio 
operating in a number of industry sectors and our broad 
geographic base. This naturally limits the impact on the Group of 
any individual severe event. The Group’s current committed loan 
facilities, which expire after the period of review, financial 
covenants, and other requirements set out therein were also 
considered.
Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the three-year period of their assessment. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Sustainability
Responsible 
business
The Group recognises the impact of its business 
operations on a diverse range of stakeholders, 
including our employees and the wider 
community. This report outlines the Group’s 
approach to responsible business practices  
and details some of the activities that we have 
undertaken in 2017. 
We remain dedicated to growing our business  
and delivering shareholder value while maintaining 
an uncompromising stance on unethical practices, 
products or organisations. Our approach reflects 
the diverse, independent operations of the Group 
and each business implements these practices in  
a way that is appropriate for them. 
Our ethics 
Our overriding aim is to continue to 
build and support a culture which values 
openness, accountability and disclosure.
 
Our Code of Ethics, which covers 
personal conduct and the professional 
standards of behaviour we expect from 
our employees, is published on the 
Group’s intranet and all employees have 
access to Group policies via a dedicated 
policy management system. 
Furthermore, senior management have 
to undertake Bribery Act training. Each 
employee is responsible for upholding 
the principles and practices set out 
within it. All employees have access to 
an independent whistleblowing hotline 
which enables them to voice any 
concerns without risk. 
Before accepting work that may pose an 
ethical risk, employees are required to 
seek advice from the responsible person 
or committee in their company and/or 
division. In certain circumstances the 
decision is referred to the Group CEO, 
who makes the final decision.
Huntsworth seeks to comply with all 
applicable laws and respect 
internationally recognised human rights 
standards in every location in which we 
operate. We aim to make a positive 
contribution to human rights through 
the clients we work with, our choice of 
suppliers and our own HR policies and 
practices. 
Huntsworth is committed to providing 
its workers with safe and legal 
employment in a stimulating and 
rewarding environment. We are  Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information

Our people
The experience, knowledge and 
creativity of our people is integral to the 
success of our business. We have in 
place employment policies and 
practices that enable us to attract, retain 
and develop our talent and ensure that 
the Group retains its market leading 
position.
Diversity
We actively deploy recruitment policies 
and practices which enable us to attract 
the widest possible sources of talent 
into our business, which develops an 
inclusive culture. 
All employees are recruited, appraised, 
trained and promoted on the basis of 
fairness, professional competence and 
contribution. We do not discriminate 
directly or indirectly against any 
individual on the basis of gender, marital 
status, race, nationality or ethnic origin, 
religion or belief, age, sexual orientation, 
disability, pregnancy or part-time or 
full-time employment status. 
The Group’s equal opportunities policy 
is designed to ensure that disabled 
people are given the same consideration 
as others and enjoy the same training, 
development and prospects as other 
employees. 
In terms of gender diversity, as at 
31 December 2017 women accounted for 
45% (13) of executive management, 39% 
(31) of senior management and 64% 
(996) of total employees. There are 
currently three female Non-Executive 
Directors on Huntsworth’s Board. The 
Board understands the benefits of 
boardroom diversity and its aspiration 
and expectation is to maintain the 
proportion of women on the Board at 
least at the current level, while 
maintaining flexibility to ensure that all 
appointments are made on the 
individual’s ability and competency to 
fulfil the requirements of the role. 
Training and development
We aim for all employees to receive an 
appraisal and performance evaluation at 
least annually to assist them in their 
career development. The Group 
provides access to a number of training 
initiatives which enable our people to 
develop skills which will support our 
businesses’ development and strategy.
 
Each of our Group companies also 
operate their own internal training 
programmes to keep staff up to date 
with developments in their sectors and 
provide additional skills in areas such as 
people management, leadership 
development, client management and 
international client director training.

Training and development (continued)
Training programmes include a mixture 
of externally and internally facilitated 
courses. A number of our businesses 
allocate a mentor or coach to support 
personal development, perform 
appraisals and identify training needs. 
Our talent management programmes 
aim to recognise our best talent through 
both monetary incentives and providing 
additional development opportunities, 
for example through secondments into 
other areas of the business.
Communication
The Group makes use of its intranet as a 
communication tool and each division 
also has its own intranet site and 
communication tools which deliver 
specialised information and tools which 
enable our people to work effectively 
and keep in touch with local news and 
developments. 
Employees have opportunities to attend 
international conferences on matters of 
significance to their division as a whole. 
On a local scale, regular meetings are 
held between local management and 
employees to facilitate employee 
involvement in decision making and 
businesses performance.
Health and wellbeing
The Board recognises the need to 
maintain a safe and healthy working 
environment for all employees. Each 
business is responsible for ensuring that 
they operate in compliance with Group 
policies and local health and safety 
legislation. 
The Group deploys policies and 
practices which assist its employees in 
achieving an appropriate work/life 
balance, including policies on parental, 
maternity and paternity leave, 
emergency time off and, where 
applicable, flexible working practices. 
Initiatives to promote health and 
wellbeing vary by company and include:
• Flexible working is promoted through 
a range of schemes including 
work-from-home schemes and 
flexible starting times and flexi-hours;
• Flexible benefits packages allowing 
employees to take their entire 
package as remuneration or opt for a 
range of benefits, including private 
medical insurance, staff pension 
schemes, life assurance, childcare 
vouchers, cycle-to-work schemes, 
discounted lifestyle vouchers or extra 
holiday days;
• Employee assistance programmes 
which provide confidential advice 
and counselling support across a 
range of areas; and
• Measures to promote a healthy 
working environment for employees, 
including on-site facilities for breaks, 
provision of showers for employees 
who wish to exercise in lunch breaks 
or cycle/run to work, provision of fruit 
and healthy refreshment options.
Our work
We apply our sustainability principles 
across all of our operations and 
wherever possible we make use of 
technologies that enable us to limit our 
environmental impact. Employees are 
trained in video-conferencing and 
webinar facilities, with virtual meetings 
being conducted where possible. When 
travel is the only option, our policy is 
that public transport should be used 
where possible. 
Many of our businesses have developed 
specific sustainability, Corporate Social 
Responsibility and ethical business 
practices, where we work with our 
clients to develop, manage and 
communicate their sustainability and 
corporate responsibility activities. We 
work with various ‘not for profit’ and 
government organisations to tackle 
issues relating to the environment and 
to raise awareness of social issues. 
Community
The Group recognises its responsibility 
towards the communities in which its 
businesses operate. In support of our 
communities, Group businesses 
throughout the world organise activities 
for staff to raise money for a wide range 
of charities as well as offering pro bono 
support to non-profit projects, helping 
to raise money and awareness for good 
causes. 
During 2017, our Dutch office CFF 
Communications and Grayling in the US 
provided pro bono support for ‘The 
Ocean Clean Up’, an innovative and 
potentially world-changing project to 
help get rid of plastic in our oceans. 
Huntsworth Health’s staff in the UK 
donated to Save the Children and 
Shelter through charitable activities, as 
did Head Office for the charity Breast 
Cancer Now. Grayling Europe 
participated in the 2020 Challenge, 
targeting 2020 acts of kindness from 
charitable activities to acts designed to 
lower their carbon footprint. In the wake 
of the Grenfell tragedy in London, Red 
raised funds towards children’s projects 
in the memory of those lost.

The Group also made formal 
contributions of over £22,000 to 38 
different charities around the world.
Environment
The Group recognises its responsibilities 
to conserve resources and is committed 
to continuous improvement in the 
environmental impact of its operations. 
Due to the nature of our businesses, the 
Group does not have a high 
environmental impact. Our principal 
impact arises from energy, paper and 
water consumption. 
Greenhouse gas emissions
During 2017, we have measured our 
greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions from 
our global operations. The Group 
measures GHG emissions based on 
financial control boundaries, so that all 
operations which are consolidated as 
subsidiaries in the Group’s financial 
statements are included in the 
measurement exercise.
We have identified the following key 
activities as being within the GHG 
reporting requirements:
• Scope 1: Natural gas, company cars, 
on-site fuel consumption and 
refrigerants;
• Scope 2: Purchased electricity, heat 
and steam.
At present, Scope 3 activities, including 
business travel, are excluded from the 
reporting scope.
We have identified GHG emissions per 
employee as the most appropriate KPI 
for the Group. 
We have collected data from offices 
across the Group. We have followed the 
2013 UK Government Environmental 
Reporting Guidelines and used emission 
factors from the UK Government’s GHG 
Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting 2016. The results are 
presented in the table below.
In some offices in the Group’s portfolio, 
electricity and heat charges are included 
in the office rental charges and therefore 
information on the exact amounts 
consumed by those particular 
businesses is not available. In these 
instances, we have calculated an 
estimate based on the size of the 
property being let and usage data from 
similar properties. In addition, it has not 
been practicable to measure the Group’s 
emissions from refrigerants, although 
these are not expected to be significant.
We are pleased to report a reduction in 
our carbon emissions this year, due to 
continued efficiencies in the use of our 
property portfolio.
Actions
A network of Employee Champions 
promote positive environmental actions 
around the Group. We aim to minimise 
energy and water consumption, through 
encouraging staff to switch off 
electronic appliances and using 
electricity generated from renewable 
sources. 
Paper wastage is minimised through 
promoting reuse, use of electronic 
communications and using paper from 
sustainable forests. By recycling, the 
Group’s UK businesses together saved

Corporate Governance
Letter from the Chairman
On behalf of the Board, I present 
Huntsworth plc’s Corporate Governance 
Report for the financial year ended 
31 December 2017.
In this section of the Annual Report 
insight is provided into the activities 
which have supported the Company’s 
corporate governance during the year.
Board and Committee changes
In October 2017 we announced that, 
owing to his other business 
commitments, Tim Ryan would be 
resigning from the Huntsworth Board 
with effect from 31 December 2017 on 
the expiry of his first three-year term. 
On 1 January 2018 Elizabeth McKee 
Anderson joined the Board of 
Huntsworth as an Independent Non-
Executive Director and member of the 
Audit Committee. Elizabeth brings 
extensive pharmaceutical industry 
experience to the Board, particularly in 
the US – the key area of strategic focus 
for the Group.
On 22 March 2017 we had a change of 
chair of the Audit Committee, with Andy 
Boland deciding to step down from this 
role and Pat Billingham being appointed 
in his place. Andy had occupied this role 
since he joined the Board on 11 August 
2014 and continues to be a member of 
both the Audit and Nomination 
Committees. 
In December 2017, we also announced 
that Pat Billingham and Nicky Dulieu 
would both be joining the Nomination 
Committee with effect from 1 January 
2018. 
Lastly, Andy Boland also agreed to 
serve as the Huntsworth Senior 
Independent Director with effect from 
1 January 2018. 
Shareholder Dialogue
Throughout the year, the Board actively 
engaged with its principal shareholders.
In particular, in October 2017 the 
Company held a capital markets day, 
which focused on the Company’s 
healthcare business.
On 6 September 2017 the Company 
announced the appointment of Dowgate 
Capital Stockbrokers as the Company’s 
Joint Broker, to act alongside Numis 
Securities, to assist the Board in 
engaging with smaller investors.
There were a number of changes of note 
in the shareholder base of the Company 
during 2017, the most notable of which 
was the sale by BlueFocus of its entire 
shareholding in the Company and the 
acquisition of sizeable shareholdings in 
the Company by Fidelity International 
and Hargreave Hale (now Canaccord 
Genuity Inc.). Further details in respect 
of the Company’s major shareholders 
can be found on page 60.  Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information
2017 Board Evaluation
Due to its size, the Company is not 
required to have an externally facilitated 
Board evaluation once every three 
years. However, as announced last year, 
the Board took the decision to appoint 
an external firm, being Independent 
Audit Limited, to facilitate its 2017 Board 
evaluation. The results of the evaluation 
were presented to the Board in July  
2017 and further detail can be found on 
page 42. 
Annual Re-election of Directors
Following the adoption of new Articles 
of Association at the Company’s 2016 
Annual General Meeting (AGM), the 
Company’s Directors are now subject to 
annual re-election. The Board agreed to 
implement this measure in the interests 
of good corporate governance, 
notwithstanding that the Company is 
not obliged to comply with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code provision 
that all directors be subject to annual 
re-election. Accordingly, all Directors 
submitted themselves for re-election at 
the 2017 AGM.
Electronic General Meetings
In line with a number of other companies, 
it is proposed that the Company will 
amend its Articles of Association at the 
2018 AGM in order to permit the holding 
of general meetings electronically as well 
as physically in accordance with the 
Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) 
Regulations 2009 and the Companies 
Act 2006. 
Appointment of KPMG as internal 
auditors
Given the diverse geographic spread of 
the business, it was felt that using 
external advisers to provide internal 
audit services to the Company was 
preferred and hence KPMG were duly 
appointed to this role during the year.
Compliance with the 2016 UK 
Corporate Governance Code 
I am pleased to be able to report that 
the Board has been able to operate 
effectively and within the principles of 
good governance, and confirm that the 
Company has complied throughout the 
year ended 31 December 2017 with all of 
the provisions of the Code that are 
relevant to a smaller company outside of 
the FTSE 350.

and governance. The Non-Executive Directors have a 
particular responsibility for challenging the Group’s strategy 
and monitoring the performance of Executive Directors 
against goals and objectives.
The formal Schedule of Matters reserved for the Board

the Board during the year, in accordance with the formal 
Schedule, can be found on page 40 to 41.
The Board is supported by the Audit, Remuneration and

terms of reference, which can be found online at www.
huntsworth.com. The activities of each of these Board 
Committees are set out in separate sections of this Report.
The Audit Committee is, in turn, supported by the Risk 
Committee. 
Decisions on operational matters and the day-to-day 
management of the business are delegated to the Executive 
Directors and divisional management. This includes 
implementing Group policy, managing client service, 
monitoring financial performance and human resource 
management. 
Key roles and responsibilities
Effective operation of the Board relies on clarity of the various 
roles and responsibilities of the individual Board members. Of 
particular importance are the roles of the Chairman and Chief

The Board was particularly engaged in the acquisition of The 
Creative Engagement Group, which had a short acquisition 
timetable. The Board also visited The Creative Engagement 
Group’s offices in Manchester and met with key members of 
staff and management.
The Board reviewed its procedures concerning M&A activity 
and agreed that the Executive Directors would, at each Board 
meeting, present a summary of potential and ongoing M&A 
activity to enable the Board to better assess this element of 
the Group’s strategy for growth.
The Board agreed that, in order to improve its awareness of 
the investor marketplace, the Chief Financial Officer would 
present at each Board meeting a paper summarising investor 
activity as a standing agenda item. 
During 2017, the Board appointed Dowgate Capital 
Stockbrokers as joint broker with Numis Securities to assist the 
Board in engaging with smaller investors.
Following the success of the approach in 2016, the Board again 
held a strategy day during which it discussed and considered a 
number of items, including:
• the presentation of the Group into four divisions 
(Huntsworth Health being split into Medical, Marketing and 
Immersive, and the remainder of the Group as one 
Communications sub-group); 
• targeted acquisitions, particularly in the US healthcare 
marketplace; and
• exploring the opportunities for cross-selling to clients to 
leverage the capabilities of The Creative Engagement 
Group.
The holding of a separate strategy meeting enabled the Board 
to focus on developing the Company’s strategy. It is intended 
to continue to hold an annual strategy day in future years.
The Board receives periodic (typically annually) updates in 
respect of IT, tax, property and treasury matters. Furthermore 
the Board receives updates for approval on the Group’s key 
policies.
How the Board operates
Board information
Board papers containing, amongst other things, current and 
forecast trading results, governance, and treasury and 
shareholder information, are distributed in advance of the 
meetings to allow the Directors sufficient time for preparation. 
Minutes of the meetings are also circulated to all Directors. The 
Board receives presentations from Executive Directors. 
Furthermore, presentations from divisional management are 
provided to the Board. All Directors have direct access to 
senior operational management within the Group as required. 
Executive Directors are also members of operating company 
boards and are involved in regular meetings to consider 
financial, operational and compliance matters arising 
throughout the year.
Independent advice
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary who, through the Chairman, is responsible 
for ensuring that Board procedures are followed and that 
applicable rules and regulations are complied with. In addition, 
all Directors have access to independent professional advice, if 
required, at the Company’s expense. The Chairman also holds 
meetings with the Non-Executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors being present.
Induction and personal development
All Board members receive updates on regulatory and legal 
changes as well as operational briefings. Training and 
development needs are kept under review by the Chairman.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that induction and 
training is provided for each Director. Each new Director 
receives an induction pack and undertakes a bespoke 
induction programme that provides them with information on 
the Group, their responsibilities, and obligations.  Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
42 43
Review the role and remit of 
the Nomination Committee.
As well as discussing 
succession planning for senior 
management, the Nomination 
Committee has expanded its 
role to include consideration of 
the Group’s people strategy 
and culture.
The Chairman is monitoring progress against all action points 
identified. The Senior Independent Director also led an 
evaluation of the Chairman through interviews with relevant 
Directors.
Composition of the Board
The Board aims to have a diversity of skills, experience, length 
of service, knowledge and gender. The biographies of the 
Directors are set out on pages 36 to 37. These demonstrate a 
broad range of experience, expertise, and sufficient calibre to 
bring independent judgement on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources and standards of conduct, which are 
vital to the success of the Group.
Independence
The Board considers that, notwithstanding their interests in the 
shares of the Company as set out in the Report of the Directors 
on Remuneration, all of the current Non-Executive Directors are 
independent of the management of the Group and are free from 
any business or other relationship that could materially interfere 
with the exercise of their independent judgement. 
Previously, Directors had been subject to re-election every 
three years. However, the Board believed it appropriate to 
adopt best practice in this area and proposed changes to the 
Company’s Articles to make all Directors subject to annual 
re-election. Following the adoption of new Articles of 
Association at the 2016 AGM, all Directors are subject to 
reappointment by shareholders at the first Annual General 
Meeting after their appointment and annually thereafter. All 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial period of 
three years, subject to annual re-election at each AGM.
Conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to 
consider and, if it sees fit, to authorise situations where a 
Director has an interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, 
with the interests of the Company. The Board has put in place 
a formal system for Directors to declare conflicts to be 
considered for authorisation by those Directors who have no 
interest in the matter being considered. Furthermore, the 
Board has in place measures to manage any actual or potential 
conflict of interest situations that may arise, which operate 
effectively. In deciding whether to authorise a potential or 
actual conflict, the non-conflicted Directors are required to act 
in the way that they consider would be most likely to promote 
the success of the Company. They may impose limits or 
conditions when giving authorisation or subsequently, if they 
think this is appropriate. 
Risk management and internal control
The Board has ultimate responsibility for establishing, 
monitoring and maintaining the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems. These systems are designed to enable 
the Board to be confident that such risks are mitigated or 
controlled as far as possible, although no system can eliminate 
the risks entirely. 
Corporate Governance Report continued
In order to give new Directors insight into the various 
businesses within the Group, a series of meetings are held with 
the Board members and senior executives. Meetings are also 
held with the external auditor and/or other advisers as 
appropriate.
In early 2018, Elizabeth McKee Anderson received a Board 
induction, which included: meetings with the Executive 
Directors and senior management; law and regulation 
pertinent to the role; the Group’s commercial strategy; and 
details of the Company’s shareholders, bank facilities and 
insurance arrangements.
Board performance evaluation 
Even though this is not a requirement for the Company under 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board and 
Nomination Committee agreed that the 2017 performance 
evaluation should be externally facilitated. The Company 
engaged Independent Audit Limited, which has no other 
connection with the Company, to facilitate its 2017 
performance evaluation.
This evaluation included Independent Audit Limited’s 
attendance at the Board’s April meeting to observe, a review 
of prior Board papers and minutes, interviews with each 
Director and with the Company Secretary, and a presentation 
of the results at the Board’s July meeting. 
The review suggested a number of actions for the Board to 
consider including, together with progress, the following:
Action Progress
Appointment of a Non-
Executive Director with 
pharmaceutical experience.
Liz McKee Anderson was 
appointed to the Board with 
effect from 1 January 2018. Liz 
has extensive pharmaceutical 
experience – particularly in the 
US market.
The Board to get frequent 
updates on the progress in 
the US healthcare 
communications business 
and for the Non-Executive 
Directors to meet senior 
management on a more 
frequent basis.
The Board’s strategy meeting 
in September 2017 was held in 
New York and afforded Board 
members an opportunity to 
meet with the Group’s key 
senior management in the US 
– including those from Evoke 
Group. The strategy meeting 
also focused on healthcare in 
particular.
Ensuring that the Executive 
Directors have a good 
understanding of the 
Non-Executive Directors’ 
needs and expectations in 
relation to proposed 
acquisitions.
As stated on page 41, the 
Executive Directors present a 
summary at each Board 
meeting of M&A activity 
(including pipeline).
Review scheduling of 
meetings to eliminate long 
gaps where possible.
Board meetings are now 
scheduled to take place every 
two months. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information
The Board has established a number of ongoing processes to 
identify, evaluate and manage the key financial, operating and 
compliance risks faced by the Group and for determining the 
appropriate course of action to manage and mitigate those 
risks. The Board delegates the monitoring of these internal 
control and risk management processes to the Audit 
Committee. These measures have been in place throughout 
the year and up to the date of this Report. 
Given the Group’s divisional structure, a flexible approach to 
risk management has been implemented so that each 
operating business can tailor and adapt its processes to its 
specific circumstances. The Group’s operating divisions have 
some autonomy with regards to the implementation of risk 
management and internal control systems which meet their 
particular business risks and requirements. 
A representative from each division is included on the Group’s 
Risk Committee, which reports to the Audit Committee on all 
risk management matters, including the design and 
effectiveness of these risk management and internal control 
systems. 
The Group has sought to implement the FRC Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting. Further details are included in the Audit 
Committee Report.
The key features of the risk management and internal controls 
system, which the Directors have established with a view to 
providing effective internal control are: 
• ongoing review of strategy by the Board, which aims to 
identify potential strategic risks facing the Group;
• establishing and monitoring of the formal schedule of 
matters reserved for decision by the Board;
• establishing a defined list of authority and approval limits;
• monitoring of actual performance against budget and 
forecasts. A detailed monthly management pack is 
prepared, which includes consolidated results and 
summarised results for each individual business and 
division. The performance of each business is reviewed 
monthly by the Executive Directors and reported to the 
Board at each meeting;
• frequent Executive Director meetings with the management 
team of each division, which cover any emerging 
operational, financial, strategic or compliance issues and 
controls;
• at least annually, the Board review the principal risks 
identified;
• confirmations of key internal controls, including financial 
controls, are received quarterly from each business. The 
purpose of these confirmations is to confirm the operation 
of an appropriate system of internal controls and to 
highlight any potential new risks facing the business;
• the Executive Directors are responsible for appraising 
investments; those which are above pre-specified limits are 
put to the Board for approval;
• the Audit Committee reports to the Board at each Board 
meeting. Risks and controls are reviewed through the Risk 
Committee to ensure effective management of appropriate 
strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues; and
• internal audit provides an independent assessment of the 
systems and controls in place across the Group. Businesses 
are selected for internal audit on a risk focused basis; the 
results of internal audits are reported to management and 
to the Audit Committee. 
The Board and Group management continue to review and 
enhance the Group’s risk management framework to ensure 
that they are actively identifying and managing risks in the 
most efficient and effective way for the Group.
Company Ethics and Whistleblowing 
The Company is committed to the highest standards of 
integrity and honesty and expects all employees to maintain 
the same standards in everything they do at work. The 
Company recognises that effective and honest communication 
is essential to maintain our business values and to ensure that 
any instances of business malpractice are detected and dealt 
with. 
The Company has a number of policies available via an online 
policy management portal. These include a Code of Ethics, an 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, Guidance on Gifts and 
Entertainments Policy and a Whistleblowing Policy. In 
particular, the Whistleblowing Policy has procedures for 
disclosing malpractice and is intended to act as deterrent to 
fraud or other corruption or serious malpractice. It is also 
intended to protect the Group’s business and reputation. 
During 2017, an external firm continued to provide access to 
confidential whistleblowing helplines across the Group. The 
Whistleblowing Policy encourages reporting of any instances 
of malpractice for investigation and action as required. During 
the year, one issue was raised, which was investigated by 
senior management and appropriate actions carried out to 
resolve the matter.
Investor relations
Relations with shareholders
The Company is committed to ongoing dialogue with all of its 
shareholders. 
The Company holds presentations and conducts meetings 
with its institutional shareholders and City analysts throughout 
the year. The Chairman and the Executive Directors, as 
appropriate, also meet with various institutional shareholders 
from time to time. The outcomes of the meetings are reported 
to the Board to ensure that the Board keeps in touch with 
shareholder views. 
In October 2017, the Company held a capital markets day. The 
capital markets day focused in particular on the Group’s 
healthcare communications business and included 
presentations from the senior management of the Evoke, 
ApotheCom and The Creative Engagement Group businesses.
All shareholders are welcome to attend the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting and are encouraged to take advantage of the 
opportunity to direct questions to members of the Board. An 
overview of the Company’s results and future development 
plans is given by the Chairman at the Annual General Meeting 
prior to the commencement of the formal business of the 
meeting.

2 Tim Ryan resigned as a Director of Huntsworth plc and member of 
the Audit Committee with effect from 31 December 2017.

with effect from 1 January 2018.
The Committee’s Terms of Reference were reviewed  
during 2017 and are available on the Company’s website at  
www.huntsworth.com.
Members of the Audit Committee are provided with sufficient 
resources, and have broad business and financial experience 
which has been gained in a variety of disciplines, which the 
Board considers provides recent and relevant experience to 
enable the Committee to carry out its responsibilities. The 
Directors’ biographies on pages 36 to 37 provide further detail. 
Committee meetings
The Audit Committee held three meetings during the year. The 
Audit Committee provides a forum for reporting by the 
Group’s external auditors. Meetings were also attended, by 
invitation, by the Chief Financial Officer, the Head of Finance 
and Internal Audit. Provision is made for the external auditors 
and Internal Audit to discuss any concerns they may have with 
the Committee in the absence of management. 
The Committee receives reports from management which 
provide additional information to facilitate their review.
Activities of the Committee 
The activities of the Committee are designed to assist the 
Board in carrying out its responsibilities in respect of financial 
reporting, risk management and internal control. In forming its 
opinions, the Audit Committee takes into account 
representations made by the Company’s subsidiaries in respect 
of financial statements and internal controls; the results 
presented by the Company’s Internal Audit function in respect 
of the operation of the Company’s internal controls; the 
findings of the Company’s external auditor; and the work of the 
Risk Committee. 
The Committee considered, discussed and made decisions in 
relation to a range of matters throughout the course of the 
year, the most significant of which are highlighted below:
Financial reporting
The Committee reviewed with management and the external 
auditor:
• whether the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position, performance, business model and 
strategy; and
• the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of 
accounting and whether the Group can meet its liabilities as

Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information
The primary issues and areas of judgement considered by the Committee in relation to the 2017 Interim Report and 2017 
Annual Report and Accounts were: 
Goodwill impairment
The assumptions underlying the calculation of value in use 
require significant judgement to be exercised, primarily in 
respect of the achievability of budgets and medium-term 
forecasts.
The Committee has addressed these issues through review, and 
raising challenge where appropriate, of reports prepared by 
management outlining the basis of their assumptions and 
analysing the impact of a number of different scenarios. 
Individual business forecasts are reviewed and approved by the 
Board. Further detail is included in Note 12.
Covenant compliance, going concern and viability
The Group has to demonstrate that it can continue to meet the 
covenants of its banking facility for a period of at least 12 
months from the date of approval of the financial statements in 
order for the Board to conclude that the Group is a going 
concern. 
The Board also has to make an assessment of the prospects of 
the Company over a longer period of three years and state 
whether they consider the Group to be viable over this period. 
Budgets, forecasts and assumptions underlying the cash flow 
and covenant compliance model are approved by the Board and 
different scenarios are prepared by management for the 
Committee to consider.
The Committee reviewed the processes undertaken by 
management in preparing the viability assessment, including the 
potential impact of principal risks and mitigating actions. 
Management and the Board considered a number of scenarios 
and performed stress testing before concluding they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the three-year period of their assessment.
Further detail on the viability assessment process can be found 
on page 31.
Revenue recognition
Revenue reflects the fair value of the proportion of the work 
carried out in the year and therefore judgement exists over 
revenue cut off at year end.
Management reports to the Committee on this matter, including 
details of any significant judgements made.
Highlighted items
Certain acquisition and transaction related costs and 
amortisation charges have been classified as highlighted items, 
in line with the Group’s accounting policies. 
Particular consideration was given to the consistency of 
classification of highlighted items and whether their presentation 
can be considered fair, balanced and understandable. The 
Committee addressed this judgement by reviewing with 
management the definition of highlighted items as per the 
Group’s accounting policy and the items disclosed to satisfy 
themselves that they are in accordance with this policy. Refer to 
detailed disclosure in Note 6.
All of the above were key areas of audit focus and the auditor 
also provided detailed reports to the Committee on their 
procedures, findings and conclusions.
Having undertaken the review processes detailed above, the 
Audit Committee is satisfied with the underlying assumptions 
and judgements made in respect of these issues and supports 
the conclusions reached by management.
Notably, the Committee also reviewed the potential impact of 
the changes to be introduced through IFRS 15 Revenue 
Recognition and IFRS 16 Leases.
Risk management and internal control
The Audit Committee monitors controls which are in force  
and any perceived gaps in the control environment, and also 
considers and determines relevant action in respect of any 
control issues raised by the external and internal auditors.  
The findings of the Audit Committee are communicated to  
the Board. 
The main areas of activity for the Audit Committee during the 
year were:
• reviewing reports provided by the Risk Committee on risk 
management activities in the year, including a proposal for 
the Company’s risk appetites and how to monitor the 
Group’s current status against the appetite;
• reviewing the Group’s risk documentation and challenging 
the classification and completeness of the risks identified;
• reviewing the Group’s risk register;
• reviewing the controls which are in force to ensure the 
integrity of the information reported to shareholders;
• monitoring the Group’s litigation register;
• assessing the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
systems, including fraud and bribery risk and controls; 
• reviewing the Company’s first statement under the Modern 
Slavery Act 2015 and recommending its adoption to the 
Board; and
• reviewing the Group’s IT and cyber security arrangements. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
46 47
The Committee reviewed and challenged a number of reports 
prepared by management in conducting these activities.
Risk Committee
The Risk Committee reports to the Audit Committee on risk 
management activities undertaken by the Group. The 
Committee comprises senior management representatives 
from each division, Group management and a member of the 
Audit Committee. The Committee has a formal schedule of 
matters delegated to it which includes:
• developing and maintaining risk management policies and 
procedures as appropriate;
• developing and maintaining the Company’s overall risk 
appetite, tolerance and strategy;
• developing and maintaining a risk register and report to the 
Audit Committee on the key risks the Company is exposed 
to;
• assigning responsibilities to manage specific risks, as 
appropriate and review the Company’s capability to identify 
and manage new risks and assess the steps taken to 
mitigate them;
• reviewing Group policies to ensure that they are up to date 
and relevant to risk management objectives;
• reviewing the Company’s annual statement on Internal 
Controls, with specific reference to risk management, prior 
to endorsement by the Audit Committee, and
• taking appropriate action relating to findings from Internal 
Audit work. 
During 2017, the Risk Committee provided the Audit 
Committee and Board with proposals for the Company’s risk 
appetite as well as key indicators to enable effective 
monitoring of risk. In addition, the Risk Committee reviewed 
the Company’s first statement under the Modern Slavery Act 
and recommended its adoption to the Audit Committee. 
Internal audit
Internal audit performs reviews as part of a programme 
approved by the Audit Committee. During the year, it was 
agreed that the Company should engage KPMG LLP to provide 
internal audit services, as it was considered that an external 
appointee would be able to provide the breadth of coverage 
required by the business and the geographic spread of the 
business lends itself to using external advisers. 
Internal Audit has a direct reporting line to the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. The Committee considers any issues or risks 
arising from internal audit reviews and monitors the 
implementation of actions arising.
During the year the main activities of the Audit Committee 
regarding internal audit matters were:
• appointing KPMG LLP as the Group’s internal auditor;
• reviewing and approving the scope of internal audit 
activities for 2017 and KPMG LLP’s proposed internal audit 
plan for 2017/18; 
• monitoring the effectiveness of internal audit activities, 
including reviewing the results of all internal audit 
procedures undertaken during the year; and
• monitoring the status of any deficiencies in the control 
environment, ensuring active follow up and resolution.
External audit
The remit of the Audit Committee includes:
• advising the Board on the appointment, reappointment and 
removal of the external auditor and on their remuneration 
both for audit and non-audit work; 
• approving the nature and scope of the external audit with 
the external auditor;
• discussing the findings of the external audit with the 
external auditor and assessing the effectiveness of the 
audit; and
• reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditor, including the level of fees paid.
Audit effectiveness
One of the key responsibilities of the Audit Committee is to 
assess the effectiveness of the external audit process. Since 
December 2016, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) has 
served as the Company’s external auditor.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the reports they 
received from PwC in their capacity as the auditor, including 
the audit plan and the results of the audit work performed. The 
Committee challenged, where necessary, the risks identified 
and the results of the work performed, and sought feedback 
from management on the effectiveness of the audit process.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the cost effectiveness, 
independence, objectivity and expertise of the external 
auditors and following this review recommended to the Board 
that PwC be proposed for reappointment as the external 
auditors for 2018.
Auditor’s independence and objectivity and non-audit services
It is the Committee’s policy to ensure that there is audit partner 
rotation every five years to safeguard the external auditor’s 
objectivity and independence. PwC were initially appointed in 
December 2016, following a tender process and their 
reappointment was approved by shareholders at the 2017 
AGM.
The Committee continually reviews the nature and extent of 
non-audit services provided to the Group by the external 
auditor and receives confirmation from them, at least annually, 
that in their professional judgement, they are independent with 
respect to the audit. The Audit Committee oversees the nature 
and amount of non-audit work undertaken by the external 
auditor each year to ensure that external auditor independence 
and objectivity is safeguarded. 
The Audit Committee has a policy governing the use of the 
external auditor for non-audit related services. The policy 
prohibits the external auditor from engaging in certain services 
that may give rise to actual or perceived audit independence 
issues. In addition, the Committee has to approve all services 
that are to be provided by the external auditor that exceed a 
prescribed monetary threshold. A copy of the policy is 
available on the Company’s website (www.huntsworth.com). 
This policy was reviewed by the Committee during the year 
and it was agreed to amend the policy such that over any 
three-year period, the annual fees for non-audit services 
should not exceed 70% of the average of the audit fees for the 
preceding three-year period in addition to the existing financial 
cap of £75,000 for an individual service or specific project.
Since their initial appointment in December 2016, PwC have 
provided covenant compliance services. Details of the non-
audit fees paid to the external auditors are set out on page 84. 
The provision of non-audit services, within the constraints of 
applicable UK rules, is assessed on a case-by-case basis so 
that the best-placed adviser is engaged.

Annual Statement
Dear Shareholder, 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 
31 December 2017. This Report is split into two parts:
• This Annual Statement, setting out the key remuneration 
decisions made during the year, and
• The Annual Remuneration Report, detailing the 
implementation of the Company’s Remuneration Policy 
during the 2017 financial year. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy as approved at the 2016 
AGM is available on the Company’s website at http://www.
huntsworth.com/media/1278/remuneration-policy-2015-
huntsworth.pdf. This Policy will remain in place until the 2019 
AGM at the latest when a new policy will be submitted to 
shareholders for approval. 
Key decisions made by the Committee in 2017
Overall, 2017 has been a successful year for the Company; our 
share price has grown by 114% over the course of the year and 
we have made significant progress towards the Company’s 
strategic aims, including the acquisition of The Creative 
Engagement Group (‘TCEG’). 
Given the improvement in the Company’s financial 
performance and the progression of its strategic aims into 
areas such as M&A activity, the Committee has addressed 
specific remuneration issues arising from these positive 
developments. The Company’s accounting disclosure change 
regarding US tax on goodwill amortisation (Tax Disclosure 
Change) has had a potential impact to existing incentive 
arrangements that have also required review. All decisions 
have been made with a view to ensuring that Executive 
remuneration arrangements are aligned to the long-term 
performance of the Company and remain equally stretching as 
originally envisaged. The Committee has also been mindful of 
the wider changing landscape for Executive Remuneration 
matters and the evolving views of investors and other 
stakeholders. 
M&A activity
To take into account the impact of the Company’s M&A 
activity during 2017, the Remuneration Committee made 
amendments to the existing performance targets of awards 
made to Paul Taaffe and Neil Jones under The Huntsworth 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the replacement awards 
under The Huntsworth Executive Share Option Scheme 2006 
(2006 ESOS Scheme), the awards made to the Executive 
Directors under The Huntsworth Long Term Incentive Plan 
2016 (2016 LTIP Scheme), and the Executive Directors’ 2017 
Annual Bonus (together the Existing Remuneration 
Arrangements). In making these amendments, it was the 
Remuneration Committee’s intention to ensure that the 
Existing Remuneration Arrangements continued to be 
comparably stretching as was the aim when the awards  
were granted.
Tax Disclosure Change
As explained on page 25, the Company changed its 2017 
accounting disclosure for US tax on goodwill amortisation. The 
Remuneration Committee discussed the impact of this change 
and agreed that the impact of the Tax Disclosure Change 
should be removed from the actual headline EPS (HEPS) 
reported results in determining the performance outcomes of 
the long-term incentive awards made in 2015, 2016 and 2017. 
The Committee considered this adjustment necessary to 
ensure that performance targets remained stretching and that 
participants did not benefit from the Tax Disclosure Change.
2017 Performance Targets and Annual Bonus outcome
The Remuneration Committee set the performance targets for 
Paul Taaffe and Neil Jones in respect of their 2017 Annual 
Bonus and share awards. 
The 2017 Annual Bonus was based upon achieving headline 
PBT (HPBT) and revenue targets of £21.3 million and £200.7 
million respectively, after adjusting for M&A activity in the year, 
with HPBT having an 80% weighting and revenue a 20% 
weighting. As was the case in previous years, the 
Remuneration Committee agreed that any bonus would only 
be payable to the extent that it did not reduce HPBT to below 
£21.3 million. The Company achieved HPBT of £24.4 million (or 
115% of the HPBT threshold target) and revenues of £197.0 
million (representing 98% of the revenue threshold target). The 
2017 Annual Bonus payable to the Executive Directors 
represented 119% of their salary during the year (which equates 
to 79% of the maximum bonus opportunity). 
50% of any bonus payment in excess of 100% of salary is 
subject to compulsory deferral under The Huntsworth 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan 2016 (2016 DSBP Scheme). 
However, whilst not included within the initial terms and 
conditions, the Executives have voluntarily agreed to increase 
this and will now defer 100% of the bonus payment in excess of 
100% of salary. Accordingly, awards will be made under the 
2016 DSBP Scheme to Paul and Neil equivalent in value to 
£112,400 and £65,500 respectively.
Further details on the performance targets for the 2017 Annual 
Bonus and share awards, including on the outcome of the 2017 
Annual Bonus, can be found on pages 51 to 52. 
Long-term incentive outcomes in respect of 2017 performance
Long-term incentive awards granted to Paul Taaffe in 2015, 
being the PSP award and the replacement award under the 
2006 ESOS Scheme, are due to vest in 2018 following 
completion of their performance periods. Vesting of the PSP 
award was subject to the achievement of stretching HEPS and 
TSR performance targets, whilst the award under the 2006 
ESOS Scheme was subject to an HEPS performance target. 
Given the Company’s strong financial performance since the 
grant of the awards, the 2015 PSP award is expected to vest at 
82% of maximum subject to completion of the TSR 
performance period in May 2018, and the replacement award 
under the 2006 ESOS Scheme will vest in full.
Further details on the performance targets and the 
performance outcomes can be found on page 52.  Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
50 51
2018 Performance Targets
The Remuneration Committee has also agreed the 2018 
Executive Annual Bonus and share award targets. 
As part of its discussions regarding the proposed framework 
for the 2018 share awards under the 2016 LTIP Scheme, the 
Remuneration Committee agreed a number of changes to the 
format of the awards. In previous years, performance targets 
have been based on a combination of HEPS and TSR targets. 
However, for the proposed 2018 awards under the 2016 LTIP 
Scheme, the Committee has determined that performance 
targets are based solely on achieving stretching HEPS targets, 
which support the strategic aim of growing the core business 
whilst also delivering accretive M&A activity.
Further detail, including the performance targets, can be found 
on page 58.
Holding Periods
In line with evolving best practice, in particular increasing 
expectations from investors for post-vesting holding periods to 
be applied to share awards, the Committee has determined 
that share awards granted in 2018 will include a two-year 
holding period after the end of the three-year performance 
period.
Furthermore, whilst not included within the original terms and 
conditions of the awards, the Executive Directors have 
voluntarily agreed to a one-year holding period in respect of 
the existing share awards under the PSP granted to Paul in 
2015 and to the share awards granted to the Executive 
Directors in 2016 and 2017. 
2018 Executive Salaries
The Committee reviewed Executive Director salaries during 
2017 and determined that Neil’s salary would increase by 2.8% 
to £360,000 (a £10,000 increase), with effect from 1 January 
2018. Whilst this represents his first salary increase since 
joining the Company on 1 February 2016, the Committee were 
keen to ensure that his salary increase was no greater than 
salary increases seen within the Group’s wider employee 
population. Paul’s annual salary remains unchanged at US 
$936,000.
Senior management
The Remuneration Committee reviewed various incentive 
arrangements in place across the organisation during 2017, 
with a continued focus of expanding awards granted under the 
2016 LTIP Scheme. As a result of this review, a higher 
proportion of our senior management team now participate in 
the 2016 LTIP Scheme, aligning their interests with those of 
shareholders, and aligning the various businesses to the 
Group’s overall performance. This also helps to achieve the 
appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration 
within senior management and allows equity awards to be 
used as a mechanism to both retain and attract new talent.
Dilution position
The Investment Association’s guidelines state that companies 
should not issue new shares for employee share awards where 
doing so would result in share issues in a ten-year period which 
would exceed 10% of the Company’s share capital in the case 
of all employee share plans, or 5% of the share capital in the 
case of discretionary share plans. 
The Remuneration Committee continues to monitor the 
Company’s dilution position as a result of broadening the 
equity awards to senior management.
Conclusion
The Remuneration Committee believes that the key decisions 
taken during the year represent a fair balance between the 
Company’s performance and shareholder outcomes over the 
relevant periods. 
We welcome the opportunity to engage with shareholders 
about any aspect of our Remuneration Policy and its 
implementation. We were pleased to receive good shareholder 
support at our 2017 AGM and I look forward to receiving your 
support once more. Shareholders will have the opportunity to 
vote on the 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Report at our 2018 
AGM to be held on Thursday 24 May 2018.
Lastly, I wish to thank my Committee colleagues for their full 
support over the year.

salary in USD for 2017 was unchanged from 2016 at $936,000 – this equates to £727,606 based on the prevailing conversion rate of circa 1.29 for 2017. 
However, for calculation of bonus and LTIP awards, Paul Taaffe’s pre-1 October 2016 GBP denominated base salary of £600,000 will continue to be used.

3 Benefits received by Paul Taaffe are private medical insurance, life assurance and UK tax return preparation services.
4 Benefits received by Neil Jones are private medical insurance and life assurance. 
5 This reflects the estimated vesting outcome of Paul Taaffe’s 2015 PSP award and the replacement award under the 2006 ESOS Scheme based on a 
three-month average share price to 31 December 2017. Further details on the vesting of these awards can be found on page 52 The value will be restated 
in next year’s report to reflect actual performance outcome of the 2015 PSP award and the actual share price on the respective vesting dates. 
6 Under the terms of their service agreements, neither Executive Director receives a pension benefit or payment in lieu of a pension. 
Neil Jones is a non-executive director of Taptica International, an AIM listed Ad-Tech business, for which he received an annual 
fee of £35,000 until 31 May 2017. From 1 June 2017, the annual fee increased to £40,000 per annum.
The following sections of the report explain how each element of remuneration was calculated.
Annual Bonus (audited)
The Annual Bonus targets for 2017 were based upon achieving stretching 2017 financial targets. The targets were an adjusted 
profit before tax target (HPBT Performance Target), based on normalised earnings, and a revenue target (Revenue Performance 
Target). As described on page 49, the performance targets for the 2017 Annual Bonus were adjusted (by increasing the HPBT 
and Revenue Performance Targets) to reflect the impact of M&A activity undertaken in 2017.
The amount of Annual Bonus payable was based on actual performance as a percentage of each target, as shown in the table 
below. In addition, the Remuneration Committee determined that for 2017, the Annual Bonus would only be payable to the extent 
that it did not reduce post-bonus HPBT below the budgeted target of £21.3 million. The payment of any Annual Bonus was 
contingent on the threshold level of HPBT being achieved.

52 53
The 2017 Annual Bonus is subject to the compulsory deferral of 50% of any bonus payment in excess of 100% of salary under the 
terms of the 2016 DSBP Scheme. However, whilst not included within the initial terms and conditions, the Executives have 
voluntarily agreed to increase this and will now defer 100% of the bonus payment in excess of 100% of salary. Therefore, for 2017, 
share awards equivalent to the cash figures below will be made to Paul Taaffe and Neil Jones under the 2016 DSBP Scheme, as 
the bonus payments were in excess of 100% of their salaries:
• Paul Taaffe: £112,400
• Neil Jones: £65,500
Malus and clawback provisions apply to the 2017 Annual Bonus.
Paul Taaffe’s 2015 award under The Huntsworth Performance Share Plan
In 2015, Paul Taaffe was granted an award under the Performance Share Plan equivalent to 3,057,324 shares. The award was 
subject to achieving an HEPS target for the year ended 31 December 2017 and a TSR target calculated at the date of vesting 
(being 10 May 2018). Given the performance conditions are substantially complete at 31 December 2017, an estimated value of the 
award vesting has been included in the single total figure table for Paul Taaffe on page 51. The actual performance outcome will 
be disclosed in next year’s report, following the completion of the TSR performance period, and the value of the award at vesting 
will be restated to reflect actual performance outcome and the share price on the date of vesting (i.e. 10 May 2018).
As explained on page 49, the HEPS performance targets attaching to Paul’s award under the PSP were adjusted (i.e. by 
increasing the targets) during 2017 to take into account the impact of M&A activity during 2017. The adjusted performance 
targets for the award are detailed below:
67% based on HEPS for the year ended 31 December 2017 as follows:
Less than 4.8p 0% vest
Equals 4.8p = threshold vesting 50% vests
More than 4.8p but less than 5.3p Straight-line vesting between 50% and 100%
Greater than or equal to 5.3p 100% vest
33% is subject to the achievement of a TSR Target as follows:
Below median 0% vest
Median = threshold vesting 50% vests
Median to upper quartile Straight-line vesting between 50% and 100%
Upper quartile 100% vest
The TSR comparator group comprises the FTSE 250 excluding financial services and extraction companies.
The Company’s actual HEPS reported for the year ended 31 December 2017 was 5.8p. For the purposes of determining the 
vesting of Paul Taaffe’s 2015 PSP award, the impact of the Tax Disclosure Change was removed to give a revised HEPS figure of 
5.03. Based on this outcome, 73% of the HEPS element will vest, resulting in an award of 1,493,342 shares.
The Company’s estimated TSR performance puts Huntsworth plc in the upper quartile. Provided that the Company remains in 
this quartile, 100% of the TSR element will vest, which equates to 1,008,916 shares. 
Subject to the final TSR outcome, it is estimated that the total number of shares that will vest on 10 May 2018 is 2,502,258 (i.e. 
1,493,342 plus 1,008,916) (82% of maximum). 
As stated above, Paul Taaffe has voluntarily agreed to a one-year holding period in respect of the shares subject to the PSP 
award, despite this not being included in the original terms of the award.
Paul Taaffe’s 2015 replacement award under the Executive Share Option Scheme 2006
Upon Paul Taaffe’s appointment to the Board in April 2015, he was awarded an option under the Company’s Executive Share 
Option Scheme 2006 over 2 million shares with an exercise price being calculated as the market value of a share on the date of 
grant plus 5% (i.e. 42.14p) by way of compensation for awards forfeited at his previous employment. 
This award vests in April 2018 subject to HEPS for the year ended 31 December 2017 being greater than 3.7p. The Company’s 
revised HEPS figure of 5.03p (as noted above) for the year ended 31 December 2017 results in this award vesting in full.
LTIP awards (audited)

3  The share price of 81.25p (as at 31 December 2017) has been taken for the purpose of calculating the current shareholding as a percentage of salary/fees. 
Unvested share awards do not count towards satisfaction of the shareholding guidelines. Vested share awards and shares awarded under the 2016 DSBP 
Scheme are counted towards the shareholding requirement. Vested but unexercised awards count towards the shareholding requirement based on the 
intrinsic gain in the award as at 31 December 2017. For vested market-priced awards, the number of shares which count toward the shareholding guideline 
is calculated as the number of shares that could be purchased based on the intrinsic value of such awards, i.e. the value of shares less the exercise price. 
Where the exercise price is above the value of the shares, no value is attributed to these awards.
Shareholding policy – Executive Directors
Under the Company’s shareholding policy, all Executive Directors are expected to hold shares (including vested share awards 
where applicable) equivalent in value to a minimum of one times their salary. Executive Directors will be required to retain 50% of 
after-tax vested share awards until their shareholding requirement is met. 
Shareholding policy – Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are not subject to a minimum shareholding requirement. However, they are encouraged to hold shares 
in the Company.

Executive Directors
Salary
The Committee reviewed Executive Director salaries during 2017, and it was determined that Neil Jones would receive an increase 
in his salary equivalent to 2.8%, with effect from 1 January 2018. This represents his first salary increase since joining the Company 
on 1 February 2016, and the Committee was keen to ensure that it was no greater than salary increases seen within the Group’s 
wider employee population. Paul Taaffe’s annual salary remains unchanged at US $936,000.

including any annual bonus payment or LTIP awards, Paul Taaffe’s awards will continue to be determined based on his original GBP base salary figure of 
£600,000. In the single figure table on page 51, his salary is presented in GBP, giving a salary figure of £727,606 during the full year 2017 at an exchange

Annual Bonus performance targets
The 2018 annual bonus for Paul Taaffe and Neil Jones will be based on achieving specific HPBT and revenue performance targets. 
The awards sizes will be in line with the Remuneration Policy and awards made in 2017 (i.e. a maximum opportunity of 150% of 
salary for Executive Directors). For Paul Taaffe this will be based on his GBP denominated base salary of £600,000.
The Committee is of the opinion that given commercial sensitivity, disclosing precise HPBT and revenue targets for the annual 
bonus in advance would not be in the interests of shareholders or the Company. Actual targets, performance achieved and 
awards made will be published after the end of the performance period so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay 
outs.
Both awards will be subject to malus and clawback provisions and will be subject to compulsory deferral of any bonus payment in 
excess of 100% of salary under the 2016 DSBP Scheme.
 
Long-term incentive plan targets
Awards will be made to Paul Taaffe and Neil Jones in line with the Remuneration Policy, the 2016 LTIP Scheme rules and award 
sizes in 2017 (i.e. 100% of salary) and, depending on the 2018 Annual Bonus outcome (see above), under the 2016 DSBP Scheme. 
For Paul Taaffe, as per the approach for his annual bonus, the award under the 2016 LTIP Scheme will be based on his GBP 
denominated base salary of £600,000.
For awards to be made under the 2016 LTIP Scheme to Paul Taaffe and Neil Jones, these awards will be based solely on achieving 
stretching HEPS targets that grow the core business and deliver accretive M&A activity as detailed below. 
Cumulative HEPS for the three years ending 31 December 2020 as follows:
Less than 20.0p 0% vest
Equals 20.0p = threshold vesting 25% vests
More than 20.0 pence but less than 22.8p Straight-line vesting between 25% and 100%
Greater than or equal to 22.8p 100% vest
The cumulative HEPS required for maximum vesting (22.8p) is approximately 54% higher than the cumulative HEPS required for 
maximum vesting in respect of the 2017 awards (being 14.77p), illustrating the stretching nature of the targets. 
In addition, the Committee has determined that the 2018 share awards will include a two-year holding period after the end of the 
three-year performance period. Furthermore the awards will include conditions to accommodate M&A activity within acceptable 
gearing levels.
The 2018 share awards will be subject to malus and clawback provisions.

Following a review of the fees payable to independent Non-Executive Directors, the Board agreed to amend the fees payable to 
the Non-Executive Directors with effect from 1 January 2018 as shown below. Non-Executive Directors are paid a base fee with 
an additional fee payable for chairing a Committee. No additional fee is payable to the Company Chairman where he also chairs 
the Nomination Committee. An additional fee is payable for performing the Senior Independent Director role.

In addition, the Committee reviewed the fee payable to the Company’s Chairman and agreed to increase this fee from £130,000

strategic M&A activity.
The intention is that the fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors and Chairman from 1 January 2018 will be fixed for two to 
three years (minimum two years).

Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
During 2017, the Committee engaged the services of Deloitte LLP as independent Remuneration Committee advisers. 
Deloitte LLP were retained as advisors to the Remuneration Committee and provided advice to the Committee on executive and 
long-term incentive remuneration. Deloitte LLP also provided certain other tax advisory services to the Group during the year. 
The nature of these services was not considered to conflict with their role as external adviser to the Committee. Total fees 
payable to Deloitte in 2017 for Remuneration Committee matters were £38,535 and were based partially on a retainer and 
partially on a time and materials basis.
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Group’s Code of 
Conduct when providing advice on executive remuneration in the UK.

himself or herself for re-election.

Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information
Changes in the Company’s share capital during the year are 
given in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Details of the Company’s employee share schemes are set out 
in the Remuneration Report.
Purchase of own shares
At the Annual General Meeting in 2017 the Directors were 
granted the authority to purchase up to approximately 10% of 
the Company’s ordinary shares (either for cancellation or for 
placing into treasury) to support the Group’s capital 
management policies. Further details of the Group’s capital 
management policies are included in Note 21 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. The authority granted 
amounted to 32,862,392 ordinary shares. The Company may 
either retain shares purchased under this authority as treasury 
shares with a possible view to reissue such shares at a future 
date, or cancel them. This authority expires on the earlier of 
24 August 2018 or the conclusion of the 2018 AGM on 24 May 
2018. No ordinary shares were purchased during the year or up 
to the date of this report.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, no shares were 
transferred out of treasury to satisfy obligations under 
employee share plans. The total number of shares held in 
treasury as at 31 December 2017 and at the date of this report 
was 1,686,681 ordinary shares. 
Employment policies
The Group operates internationally and therefore has 
developed employment policies that meet local conditions and 
requirements. Further details of these policies including 
policies in relation to diversity and applications for 
employment made by disabled persons and provisions for 
disabled employees and employee involvement can be found 
in the Responsible Business Report on pages 32 to 35.
Political donations
The Companies Act 2006 (‘the Companies Act’) and the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (‘the Regulations’) require 
disclosure of any political donation made to or political 
expenditure incurred in relation to any political party or other 
political organisation or any independent election candidate if 
such donation(s) or expenditure incurred in a year exceeds 
£2,000. Political parties, political organisations, political 
donation and political expenditure are all defined in the 
Companies Act.
As part of their normal work on behalf of clients and as part of 
their own marketing, certain companies in the Group need to 
attend or sponsor events which are organised by political 
parties or other political organisations, for which a charge is 
made. These companies also from time to time invite clients 
and prospective clients to attend events that fall within the 
meaning of the Companies Act’s provisions. The Companies 
Act defines ‘donations’ and ‘expenditure’ very broadly such 
that this sort of activity falls within its ambit. It similarly defines 
‘political organisation’ widely such that it includes, for example, 
bodies concerned with policy review and law reform, with 
representation of the business community or with the 
representation of their communities or special interest groups, 
which the companies may wish to support.
During the year, Group companies made the following 
payments that might be deemed to fall within the definition of 
‘political donation’ or ‘political expenditure’ in the Companies 
Act: political expenditure amounting to £11,294 was paid 
attending conferences and to cover function expenses. This 
was made up of £7,679 paid to the Conservative Party and 
£3,615 to the Labour Party.
Additional information for shareholders 
The following information, which summarises certain provisions 
of the current Articles of Association of the Company and 
applicable English law concerning companies (including the 
Companies Act), is required to be provided to shareholders as 
a result of the implementation of the European Directive on 
Takeover Bids (2004/25/EC) into English law. This is a 
summary only and the relevant provisions of the Articles and 
the Companies Act should be consulted if further information 
is required.
Rights and obligations attaching to ordinary shares
Subject to applicable law and to any existing shareholders’ 
rights, shares may be issued with or have attached to them 
such rights and restrictions as the Company may by ordinary 
resolution decide or, if no such resolution has been passed or 
so far as the resolution does not make specific provision, as the 
Board (as defined in the Articles) may decide. Subject to the 
Articles, the Companies Act and to any resolution passed by 
the Company and without prejudice to any rights attached to 
existing shares, the Board may offer, allot, grant options over 
or otherwise deal with or dispose of shares in the Company to 
such persons, at such times and for such consideration and 
upon such terms as the Board may decide. 
Voting rights
Upon a show of hands every member who is present in person 
at a general meeting of the Company and entitled to vote shall 
have one vote. On a poll every member who is present in 
person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share held. In 
the case of joint holders of a share the vote of the senior who 
tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be 
accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint 
holders and seniority shall be determined by the order in which 
the names stand in the register in respect of the joint holding. 
The notice of any general meeting of the Company shall 
specify the deadlines in relation to exercising voting rights with 
respect to each resolution to be proposed at such meeting. 
Votes are exercisable at the general meeting of the Company 
in respect of which the business being voted upon is being 
heard. Votes may be exercised in person or by proxy. The 
Articles provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms of 
not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding 
the meeting, except in the case of a poll taken subsequently to 
the date of the meeting or adjourned meeting, for which proxy 
forms must be received not less than 24 hours before the time 
appointed for the taking of the poll. 
No member shall be entitled in respect of any share held by 
him to attend or vote (either personally or by proxy) at any 
general meeting or class meeting of the Company or upon a 
poll or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in 
relation to general meetings or polls unless all calls or other 
sums presently payable by him in respect of that share have 
been paid. In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if he 
has been served with a restriction notice (as defined in the 
Articles) after the failure to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those shares required to be 
provided under the Companies Act. The Company is not aware 
of any agreements between shareholders that may result in 
restrictions on the exercise of voting rights. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Dividends and other payments
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company 
may by ordinary resolution from time to time declare dividends 
in accordance with the respective rights of the members, but 
no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the 
Board. The Board may pay such interim dividends as appear to 
the Board to be justified by the financial position of the 
Company and may also pay any dividend payable at a fixed 
rate at intervals settled by the Board whenever the financial 
position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies 
its payment. If the Board acts in good faith, it shall not incur 
any liability to the holders of any shares for any loss they may 
suffer in consequence of the payment of an interim or fixed 
dividend on any other class of shares ranking pari passu with 
or after those shares.
Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Act, all or any of the rights attached 
to any existing class of shares may from time to time be varied 
either with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than 
75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class 
(excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares) or 
with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate 
general meeting of the holders of those shares. 
Restrictions on transfer of shares
The Board may permit title to shares of any class to be held in 
uncertificated form and, subject to the Articles, title to 
uncertificated shares may be transferred by means of a 
relevant system. Provisions of the Articles do not apply to any 
uncertificated shares to the extent that such provisions are 
inconsistent with the holding of shares in uncertificated form 
or with the transfer of the shares by means of a relevant 
system. Registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share 
may be refused in the circumstances set out in the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations (as defined in the 
Articles) and where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, 
the number of joint holders to whom the uncertificated share is 
to be transferred exceeds four.
Subject to the Articles, any member may transfer all or any of 
his certificated shares by an instrument of transfer in any usual 
form or in any other form which the Board may approve. The 
instrument of transfer of a certificated share shall be executed 
by or on behalf of the transferor and (in the case of a partly 
paid share) the transferee. The transferor of a share shall be 
deemed to remain the holder of the share concerned until the 
name of the transferee is entered in the register in respect of it. 
The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving 
any reason for so doing, decline to register any transfer of any 
share which is not a fully paid share. The Board may also 
decline to register any transfer of a certificated share unless:
(i) the instrument of transfer is duly stamped or duly certified 
or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be 
exempt from stamp duty and accompanied by the 
relevant share certificate and such other evidence of the 
right to transfer as the Board may reasonably require; 
(ii) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of 
share; and 
(iii) in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of 
joint holders to whom the share is to be transferred does 
not exceed four.
Other restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company 
may from time to time be imposed:
(i) by applicable laws and regulations (for example, insider 
trading laws and market requirements relating to closed 
periods);
(ii)  pursuant to the Company’s Share Dealing Code whereby 
employees require the approval of the Company to deal in 
the Company’s securities; and
(iii) in relation to shares issued pursuant to acquisitions made 
by the Company. 
As at 31 December 2017 there were no shares of the Company 
subject to lock-in restrictions. The Company is not aware of 
any agreements between shareholders that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of shares.
Rights and obligations attaching to the deferred shares
The holders of deferred shares are not entitled to receive 
dividends when declared nor the Company’s report and 
accounts. The holders of deferred shares have no right as such 
to receive notice of or to attend or vote at any general meeting 
of the Company unless a resolution to wind up the Company or 
to vary or abrogate the rights attaching to the deferred shares 
is proposed. 
The deferred shares are also subject to the following terms: 
(a) the deferred shares may not be transferred without the 
prior written consent of the Directors of the Company; 
(b)  holders of deferred shares are not entitled to receive any 
share certificate in respect of their holdings; 
(c)  any cancellation of the deferred shares for no consideration 
by way of reduction of capital shall not involve a variation 
or abrogation of the rights attaching thereto; 
(d)  the Company has irrevocable authority at any time to 
appoint any person to execute on behalf of the holders of 
the deferred shares a transfer thereof and/or an agreement 
to transfer the same, in either case, to Numis Securities 
Limited or such other person as the Company may 
determine and to execute any other documents which such 
person may consider necessary or desirable to effect such 
transfer, in each case without obtaining the sanction of the 
holder(s) and without any payment being made in respect 
of such acquisition; and
(e)  the entitlement of a holder of a deferred share on a return 
of assets on a winding up of the Company is limited to the 
repayment of the amount paid up or credited as paid up on 
such share up to a maximum of 49p per share and shall be 
paid only after the holders of any and all ordinary shares 
then in issue shall have received payment in respect of such 
amount as is paid up or credited as paid up on those 
ordinary shares held by them at that time plus the payment 
in cash or specie of £10,000,000 for every 1p paid up or 
credited as paid up on those ordinary shares.
The rights attached to the deferred shares shall not be deemed 
to be varied or abrogated by the creation or issue of any new 
shares ranking in priority to or pari passu with or subsequent 
to such shares or by any amendment or variation to the rights 
of any other class of shares of the Company.

exercised by the Trustees. The Trustees of the EBT may vote or 
abstain from voting on shares held in the EBT in any way they 
think fit and in doing so may take into account both financial 
and non-financial interests of the beneficiaries of the EBT or 
their dependants. The EBT waived its rights to both the 2016 
final dividend and the 2017 interim dividend.
Appointment and replacement of Directors 
Unless otherwise determined by ordinary resolution of the 
Company, the Directors (disregarding alternate Directors) shall 
be not less than two nor more than 12 in number. Directors may 
be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution or by the 
Board. Any Director appointed by the Board shall retire at the 
next Annual General Meeting of the Company and shall then 
be eligible for election.

new Articles of Association were adopted, at every subsequent 
AGM all Directors shall retire from office and may offer 
themselves for re-appointment by the members.

accept such offer; 
(ii) his resignation is requested by all of the other Directors and 
all of the other Directors are not less than three in number;

resolution.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Articles 
and to any directions given by the Company in general 
meeting by special resolution, the business of the Company 
shall be managed by the Board which may exercise all the 
powers of the Company whether relating to the management 
of the business of the Company or not. In particular, the Board 
may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money 
and to mortgage or charge all or any part of the undertaking, 
property and assets (present and future) and uncalled capital 
of the Company, to issue debentures and other securities and 
to give security, whether outright or as collateral security, for 
any debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of any third 
party.
 
Repurchase of shares 
Subject to authorisation by shareholder resolution, the 
Company may purchase its own shares in accordance with the 
Companies Act. Any shares which have been bought back may 
be held as treasury shares or, if not so held, must be cancelled 
immediately upon completion of the purchase, thereby 
reducing the amount of the Company’s issued share capital. 
The Company has the power to buy back up to 32,862,392 
ordinary shares. This authority expires on the earlier of 
24 August 2018 or the conclusion of the 2018 AGM on 24 May 
2018. The minimum price which must be paid for such shares is 
1p and the maximum price payable is the higher of: (i) 5% 
above the average of the closing middle market quotations for 
ordinary shares (as derived from the London Stock Exchange 
Daily Official List) for the five dealing days immediately 
preceding the date of purchase; and (ii) the higher of the price 
of the last independent trade and the highest current 
independent purchase bid on the London Stock Exchange 
Official List at the time the purchase is carried out.
Significant agreements
The following significant agreement contains provisions 
entitling the counterparties to exercise termination or other 
rights in the event of a change of control of the Company: 
• Under the £75 million revolving credit and up to £40 million 
accordion facilities agreement dated 28 February 2018 
between, amongst others, the Company, Lloyds Bank plc 
(as facility agent) and the banks named therein as lenders 
(the New Facilities Agreement), upon a change of control, 
the agent may, if the lenders so require, cancel the facilities 
by giving not less than 30 business days’ notice and declare 
all outstanding amounts under the facilities, together with 
accrued interest, immediately due and payable.
The New Facilities Agreement replaced a £65 million credit 
facility agreement dated 23 May 2014 between, amongst 
others, the Company, Lloyds Bank plc (as facility agent) and 
the banks named therein as lenders and the £5 million 
committed overdraft facility dated 23 May 2014 between, 
amongst others, the Company and Lloyds Bank plc (together, 
the Previous Facilities Agreements). Under the Previous 
Facilities Agreements, upon a change of control, the agent was 
permitted, if the lenders so required, to cancel the facilities by 
giving not less than 30 business days’ notice and to declare all 
outstanding amounts under the facilities, together with 
accrued interest, immediately due and payable.
There are no agreements between the Company and its 
Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of 
office or employment (whether through resignation, purported 
redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover 
bid. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to 
auditors
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of 
approving the Report of the Directors are listed on pages 36 to 
37. Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the 
Company’s auditors, each of these Directors confirms that:
• so far as each Director is aware, there is no information 
relevant to the preparation of the Company’s auditor’s 
report of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
• each Director has taken all the steps a Director might 
reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of 
relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’, and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Group and Parent Company for that period. In 
preparing the financial statements, the Directors are required 
to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the Group financial 
statements and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101, have been followed for the Company 
financial statements, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Parent Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
Parent Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and Parent Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Group and Parent Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group and Parent Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 36 to 37 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Parent Company financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’, and applicable law), give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss 
of the Company;
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Group; and
• the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and Parent Company, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it 
faces.
This Directors’ Report has been approved by the Board and 
signed on its behalf by Martin Morrow, Company Secretary.

• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (‘the Annual Report’), which 
comprise: the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2017; the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expense, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the 
significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group.
Other than those disclosed in note 5 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group in the 
period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.
Our audit approach
Overview
• Overall Group materiality: £1.22 million (2016: £0.8 million), based on 5% of profit before tax 
adjusted for highlighted items as defined in note 2 to the financial statements.
• We carried out procedures on parts of the business which accounted for 76% (2016: 81%) of Group 
revenues and 53% (2016: 69%) of Group profit before tax and highlighted items.
• Audits of the complete financial information were performed on the Company (‘plc’), Red 
Consultancy and The Creative Engagement Group in the UK and Evoke and ApotheCom in the US, 
which accounted for 55% (2016: 44%) of revenue.
• Audit procedures were performed over revenue in six further components, which accounted for 
21% (2016: 37%) of revenue.
• Risk of fraud in revenue recognition in relation to cut-off – with a particular focus on stage of 
completion of project-based revenues.
• Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.
• Measurement and presentation of highlighted items.
• Acquisition accounting for The Creative Engagement Group. 
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it operates, 
and considered the risk of acts by the Group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We 
designed audit procedures at group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on 
laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the Group and Parent Company financial statements, 
including, but not limited to, Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules and UK tax legislation. Our tests included, but were not 
limited to, review of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, review of correspondence with 
the regulators and with legal advisers, enquiries of management and review of internal audit reports in so far as they related to  Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Independent Auditor’s Report continued
To the members of Huntsworth plc
the financial statements. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed 
non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely 
we would become aware of it.
We found risk of fraud in revenue recognition in relation to cut-off to be a key audit matter, and this is discussed further below. As 
in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and 
evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or 
not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we 
make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all 
risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition in relation to cut-off 
– with a particular focus on stage of completion of 
project-based revenues
Refer to page 45 (Audit Committee Report) and note 2 to the 
financial statements for the Directors’ disclosures of the related 
accounting policies, judgements and estimates.
Our specific audit focus was on the risk that revenue may be 
recorded in the incorrect period in respect of the stage of 
completion of project-based revenues, in light of the incentive 
schemes for management designed to reward performance. 
Assessment of the stage of completion can also be 
judgemental in nature, and increases the risk around the timing 
of revenue recognition.
We evaluated the revenue recognition policy of the Group and 
on a sample basis we determined that the related revenue had 
been recognised in conformity with the Group’s policy and 
applicable IFRSs.
For a sample of transactions close to the year end, we 
examined supporting documentation, such as underlying 
contracts, approved purchase orders and statements of work, 
to determine that these sales had taken place and the amount 
recognised in the year was appropriate.
Where amounts recorded were based on the percentage of 
the projects’ completion, we further verified that the income 
was correctly calculated through agreement to timesheet 
records and expected completion costs and/or corroborated 
amounts recorded through discussion with the responsible 
project managers.
There were no material issues identified by our testing of 
revenue recognition in the period.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
Refer to page 45 (Audit Committee Report), page 78 
(Significant Accounting Policies) and page 89 (notes).
The Group carried £181.2 million of goodwill and other 
intangible assets at 31 December 2017 (2016: £159.7 million).
The carrying value of goodwill is contingent on the future cash 
flows of the underlying cash generating units (‘CGUs’) and 
there is a risk that if these cash flows do not meet the 
Directors’ expectations, the assets will be impaired.
Determining if an impairment charge is required involves 
significant judgements about the future results and cash flows 
of the business, including forecast growth in future revenues 
and operating profit margins, as well as determining an 
appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate. 
The Directors aggregate CGUs into segments which represent 
the level at which the cash flows of the businesses (and 
goodwill) are monitored and therefore this is the level at which 
the Directors perform their impairment assessment.
We evaluated and sensitised the Directors’ future cash flow 
projections and evaluated the process by which they were 
drawn up, and tested the underlying value in use calculations.
We challenged:
• the key assumptions for short and long-term growth rates in 
the projections by comparing them to historical results, as 
well as economic and industry forecasts and comparable 
companies; and
• the discount rate used in the calculations by assessing the 
cost of capital for the CGU and comparable organisations.
We considered the Directors’ potential bias through 
performance of our own sensitivity analysis on key 
assumptions, to understand the impact of reasonable changes 
in the key assumptions on the available headroom. 
This included sensitising the discount rate applied to the future 
cash flows, and the short and longer-term growth rates and 
profit margins. In performing these sensitivities we considered 
the historical budgeting accuracy and how the assumptions 
compared to the actual values achieved in prior years and post 
year end. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
66 67
Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Directors used a value in use model to compute the 
present value of forecast future cash flows for each segment 
which was then compared to the carrying value of the net 
assets of each segment (including goodwill and intangible 
assets) to determine if there was an impairment.
The Directors’ impairment assessment showed that all 
segments had headroom above the carrying value of the net 
assets including goodwill when subject to the Directors’ 
sensitivity analysis. 
With regard to the above procedures, including the reflection 
of historical levels of variance from budget into the future 
forecasts, we determined that the inputs to the value in use 
model were appropriate. This provided sufficient evidence to 
support the Directors’ assessments that no impairments were 
recognised.
The Directors determined that no impairment and no 
sensitivity disclosures were necessary for all CGUs. We found 
that these judgements were supported by reasonable 
assumptions that would require significant downside changes 
before any impairments were necessary.
Measurement and presentation of Highlighted items
Refer to page 45 (Audit Committee Report), page 81 
(Significant Accounting Policies) and page 84 (notes).
The Group presents profit before taxation adjusted for 
highlighted items to enable users of the financial statements to 
gain a better understanding of the underlying results.
The classification of items as highlighted is an area of 
judgement, and we therefore focused on whether each item 
was properly classified as a highlighted item. This included 
assessing the completeness of items classified as highlighted, 
in that it includes items that both increase and decrease the 
adjusted profit measure. 
Current year highlighted charges relate to the £1.4 million 
amortisation of intangible assets, £0.4 million acquisition 
related costs and a £0.3 million disposal related credits in 
respect of an adjustment to the deferred consideration 
receivable.
We considered the appropriateness of the adjustments made 
to statutory profit before taxation to derive profit before tax 
and highlighted items. 
We understood the rationale for classifying items as 
highlighted and considered whether this is reasonable and 
consistent, in that it includes items that both increase and 
decrease the adjusted profit measure, and are in accordance 
with the Group’s accounting policy. 
Our work in relation to each type of highlighted item is 
summarised below. 
• Amortisation of acquired intangible assets – the cost of 
amortising acquired intangible assets including trademarks, 
brands and customer relationships has been treated as 
highlighted, consistent with prior years. We concluded that 
classifying this item as highlighted is appropriate as the 
assets upon which the amortisation is charged arise as a 
result of business combinations. As this is distinct from 
underlying business performance, the Directors’ view the 
additional analysis as beneficial to the understanding of 
performance. 
• Acquisition related costs – costs associated with the 
acquisition of The Creative Engagement Group were 
recognised as highlighted in line with Group’s historic 
treatment of acquisition related costs. We tested the 
accuracy and completeness of the costs incurred, by 
agreeing a sample of expenses to underlying invoice. 
• Deferred consideration adjustment – the estimated deferred 
consideration receivable associated with disposals was 
adjusted to reflect the final position. The original transaction 
was treated as a highlighted item historically. We concluded 
that classifying this item as highlighted is appropriate and 
consistent with prior years’ treatments of such items. 
We also reviewed the tax related to highlighted items 
including the change in the classification of the deferred tax 
expense on US intangible assets from profit before tax and 
highlighted items into highlighted items. The Directors made 
this change, including updating comparatives, on the basis 
the deferred tax expense would only ever crystallise on a sale 
of the business and such a sale would be a highlighted item. 
We concluded that the tax related to highlighted items was 
classified appropriately and consistent with the Group’s 
accounting policy.
We also tested the reconciliation of adjusted profit to 
statutory profit in note 6, and agreed material adjustments to 
underlying accounting records and our audit work performed 
over other balances. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
68 69
Independent Auditor’s Report continued
To the members of Huntsworth plc
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
We determined that the rationale for including or excluding 
items from adjusted profit has been consistently applied across 
gains and losses, and provides a balanced view of the 
performance of the Group. 
We reviewed the disclosures explaining the rationale for 
providing alternative profit measures in the accounting policy 
note as well as the clarity of reconciliations of these measures 
to their statutory equivalent.
Acquisition accounting for The Creative Engagement 
Group (‘TCEG’)
Refer to page 77 (Significant Accounting Policies) and page 82 
(notes).
During the year, the Group acquired TCEG for a cash 
consideration of £21.2 million and settlement of third party 
debt of £3.8 million. 
The Directors provisional purchase price allocation of the 
identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has 
resulted in the recognition of intangible assets of brands and 
customer relationships of £1.5 million and £8.6 million 
respectively giving rise to a provisional goodwill balance of 
£18.8 million.
We evaluated the Directors’ provisional purchase price 
allocation for the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities 
including the acquired intangibles assets. We evaluated the 
process by which the assets were valued, and tested the 
underlying discounted cash flow valuation models used in the 
valuation of intangibles assets. 
We considered the Directors’ assumptions and judgements 
through challenge of the following:
• auditing the opening balances and provisional fair value 
adjustments which feed into allocation model including the 
completeness of the liabilities assumed based on known and 
potential liabilities; 
• the discount rate used in the calculations by assessing the 
cost of capital for TCEG and comparing to comparable 
companies;
• the royalty rate and contributory asset charges by reviewing 
the underlying workings and comparing to industry practice 
and benchmarking against companies in similar industries; 
• the forecast cash flows from customers including historical 
customer retention rates and operating margin assumptions 
used in the valuation of customer relationships;
• we have confirmed the consideration to underlying records 
and the sale and purchase agreement.
We determined that the provisional fair values agree to the 
underlying accounting records and the valuation models used 
and key assumptions made were appropriate based on the 
information available.
We have also reviewed the disclosures within the financial 
statements and consider these to be appropriate.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and 
the industry in which the Group operates.
Taken together, our audit procedures accounted for 76% of Group revenues and 53% of Group profit before tax adjusted for 
highlighted items. 
The Group consists of the Company (‘plc’) and four divisions: Communications; Medical; Marketing; and Immersive. 
The Group’s accounting process is structured around a local finance function for each division who maintain their own 
accounting records and controls and report to the plc finance team in the UK through submission of management reporting 
packs. The plc finance team consolidates the reporting packs of Communications; Medical; Marketing; and Immersive and the 
central functions.
In our view, due to their significance and/or risk characteristics, as defined in our areas of focus, Red Consultancy in the 
Communications divisions, The Creative Engagement Group in the Immersive division, Evoke within the Marketing division and 
ApotheCom US within the Medical division, required an audit of their complete financial information. These procedures 
accounted for 55% of the Group’s revenues. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
68 69
Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information
Specific risk-based audit procedures were performed over revenue in the Grayling UK, the Citigate Dewe Rogerson Financial and 
Corporate businesses, ApotheCom UK and two further Marketing division businesses based on the audit risks we had identified 
in these areas. These procedures accounted for 21% of the Group’s revenues.
The Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of complex items were audited at the Group’s head office. 
These included goodwill, acquisition accounting, highlighted items, tax and share-based payments.
Taken together, these procedures gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent 
of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality £1.22 million (2016: £0.8 million).
How we determined it
5% of profit before tax adjusted for highlighted items as defined in note 2 to the financial 
statement.
Rationale for benchmark applied
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality by applying a 
benchmark of 5% of profit before tax and highlighted items. We believe that profit 
before tax and highlighted items is the most appropriate measure as it eliminates any 
disproportionate effect of one-off charges and provides a consistent year-on-year basis 
for our work.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The 
range of materiality allocated across components was between £2,000 and £900,000. For the purposes of our group audit we 
allocated materiality of £900,000 to the Parent Company. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £59,000 
(2016: £30,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
respect of the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the 
Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements and the Directors’ identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at 
least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to. However, because 
not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, this statement is not a 
guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to Going Concern in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in 
this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on 
these responsibilities. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
70 71
Independent Auditor’s Report continued
To the members of Huntsworth plc
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we also considered whether the 
disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not 
identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
Corporate Governance Statement
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance 
Statement (on pages 42 to 43) about internal controls and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes 
and about share capital structures in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 
sourcebook of the FCA (‘DTR’) is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not 
identify any material misstatements in this information. (CA06)
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance 
Statement (on pages 40 to 43) with respect to the Parent Company’s corporate governance code and practices and about its 
administrative, management and supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the 
DTR. (CA06)
We have nothing to report arising from our responsibility to report if a corporate governance statement has not been prepared 
by the Parent Company. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of 
the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The Directors’ confirmation on page 60 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The Directors’ explanation on page 64 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting 
their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘Code’); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group 
its environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the Directors, on page 64, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group obtained in the course 
of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on pages 44 to 46 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The Directors’ statement relating to the Parent Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure 
from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 64, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.
org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the Directors on 6 December 2016 to audit the 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is two years, covering the years ended 31 December 2016 to 31 December 2017.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial statements of Huntsworth plc for the year ended 31 December 
2017 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information
1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006. On 5 March 2018 the consolidated financial statements of the Group were authorised for issue in accordance with a 
resolution of the Directors. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the 
nearest thousand pounds (‘£000’) except where otherwise indicated.
2. Significant accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments which have 
been measured at fair value. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants 
would use when pricing the asset or liability. The Group uses valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable inputs 
and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. All assets or liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial 
statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, as set out within IFRS 13.
The Group’s significant accounting policies are listed below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years 
presented unless otherwise stated.
Changes in accounting policies
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations were mandatory for the first time for the financial 
year beginning 1 January 2017, but had no significant impact on the Group:
• IAS 7 (amendment) – Statement of Cash Flows 
• IAS 12 (amendment) – Income Taxes 
New Standards and amendments not applied
Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that have been published as mandatory for later accounting 
periods but are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group are as follows:
• IFRS 2 (amendment) – Share-based Payments (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 01 January 2018);
• IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 01 January 2018);
• IFRS 10, IAS 28 (amendment) – Sale or Contribution of Assets (effective date postponed);
• IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 01 January 2018); 
• IFRS 16 – Leases (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 01 January 2019);
• IFRS 4 (amendment) – Insurance Contracts (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 01 January 2018); 
• IAS 40 (amendment) – Investment Property (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 01 January 2018);
• Annual improvements (2014-2016 Cycle) (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 01 January 2018); and
• IFRIC 22 – Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
01 January 2018).
The initial assessment, involving a review of standard and material contracts, is that the Group does not expect there to be any 
material change to the financial statements of the Group from adopting IFRS 15.
The impact that IFRS 16 will have on the financial statements is as yet unquantified. Because of the Group’s diverse geographic 
portfolio of businesses, the Group has a significant number of leases which will need to be assessed individually against the 
requirements of the standard.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the other Standards and amendments listed above will have a material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group in future periods. 
Basis of consolidation
Huntsworth plc (‘the Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. These financial statements 
consolidate the financial statements of Huntsworth plc and all entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Control is 
achieved when the Company:
• has power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses 
control. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement 
from the date the Company gains control until the date the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. Non-controlling interests 
are identified separately from the Group’s equity. Profit and loss and each component of other comprehensive income are 
attributed to the owners of the Company and to any non-controlling interests. 
Business combinations
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at 
the aggregate of the fair value of the assets given, liabilities assumed or equity instruments issued by the Group. Any acquisition-
related transaction costs are recognised in the income statement within highlighted items as they are incurred. On acquisition of 
a business, all of the assets and liabilities of that business that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values 
reflecting their condition at that date.

For the year ended 31 December 2017
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Business combinations continued
Where the consideration for the acquisition includes a deferred contingent consideration arrangement, this is measured at fair 
value at the acquisition date. Any subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are adjusted against the 
cost of the acquisition if they occur within the measurement period of 12 months following the date of acquisition. Any 
subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration after the measurement period are recognised in the income 
statement within highlighted items. 
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of 
the fair value of the consideration, the amount of any non-controlling interest and the fair value of any previously held interest in 
the acquiree over the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed. Goodwill comprises the value of expected 
synergies arising from an acquisition that do not qualify for separate recognition.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually and in any period in which events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combinations. Impairment testing is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which the 
goodwill relates. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount of the cash-generating units, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill and then to other assets of the relevant cash-generating unit.
Acquired intangible assets comprise separable corporate brand names, intellectual property and customer relationships. 
Intangible assets are amortised systematically over their estimated useful lives, which vary from two to 20 years depending on 
the nature of the asset. These intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in any periods in which events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Costs associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group and that will 
probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs are recognised as intangible assets. Costs are capitalised from the point 
that the asset first meets the recognition criteria. These are reviewed for impairment until the asset is completed, after which 
point costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of two to seven years.
Disposals and Assets held for sale
Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if: their carrying amount will be recovered principally through 
sale; they are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probably. A disposal group consists of assets that are to be 
disposed of in a single transaction together with the directly associated liabilities. Goodwill arising from business combinations is 
included where the disposal group is a CGU or an operation within a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets or components of a disposal group are remeasured at the lower of 
their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill and then 
to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis. Impairment on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or 
losses on remeasurement are recognised in the income statement in highlighted items. No amortisation or depreciation is 
charged on non-current assets classified as held for sale. Assets classified as held for sale are disclosed separately on the balance 
sheet and classified as current assets or liabilities, with disposal groups being separated between assets held for sale and 
liabilities held for sale.
Disposals are disclosed as discontinued operations when they represent a single major line of business or a geographical area of 
operations. When the Group disposes of, or loses control over, a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and 
liabilities of the entity. The fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained is recognised. The 
resulting gain or loss on disposal is recognised in the income statement in highlighted items.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less the estimated residual value, on a straight-line 
basis over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
• Motor vehicles    25%
• Equipment, fixtures and fittings  10%–35%
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the shorter of the useful economic life or the period of the lease, from three to 15 
years. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. If the balance 
is expected to be recovered in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current 
assets. Provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in 
full. Balances are written off when the possibility of recovery is assessed as being remote. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Work in progress
Work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, and consists of third party costs incurred on behalf of 
clients which have still to be recharged.
Investments in associates
An associate is an investment over which the Group has significant influence through the power to participate in the financial and 
operating policy decisions of the investee. The Group accounts for its interests in associates using the equity method. Under the 
equity method, the investment in the associate is initially measured at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to 
recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate 
is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. The Group’s 
share of profits of associates, net of tax, interest and non-controlling interests is included in the income statement and the 
Group’s share of net assets is shown within interests in associates in the balance sheet. The Group assesses the carrying value of 
its associates to determine if any impairment has occurred. 
Where the Group has disposed of a business or made other contributions to an associate, a gain or loss is recognised only to the 
extent of the portion that has been disposed of, as set out in IAS 28.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and short-term deposits. Bank overdrafts are an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement.
Loans and borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the related contracts and are measured 
initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. If the amounts involved are material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate which reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to 
the liability. Where discounting is applied to provisions, the increase in the value of the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as a finance cost.
Where a leasehold property substantially ceases to be used for the Group’s business, or a commitment is entered into which 
would cause this to occur, provision is made to the extent that the recoverable amount of the interest in the property is expected 
to be insufficient to cover the future obligations relating to the lease.
Acquisitions made by the Group typically involve an earn-out arrangement whereby the consideration payable includes a 
deferred element that is contingent on the future financial performance of the acquired entity. No material contingent 
consideration will become payable unless the acquired entity delivers revenues or profits during the earn-out period that are 
greater than those used for calculating the initial consideration. The provision for deferred contingent consideration is recorded 
at fair value, which is the present value of the amount expected to be paid in cash or shares. The provision represents the 
Directors’ best estimate of future business performance based on internal business plans.
Turnover and revenue
Turnover represents amounts received or receivable from clients, exclusive of value added tax, for the rendering of services and 
comprises charges for fees, commissions, rechargeable expenses incurred on behalf of clients and sales of marketing products.
Revenue is turnover less amounts payable on behalf of clients to external suppliers where they are retained to perform part of a 
specific client project or service, and represents fees, commissions and mark-ups on rechargeable expenses and marketing 
products.
Turnover and revenue reflect the fair value of the proportion of the work carried out in the year by recording turnover and related 
costs as service activity progresses.
Revenue derived from retainers is recognised evenly on a monthly basis over the lifetime of the retainer contract, verified to 
ensure that there are no material distortions for known periods of intense activity. Revenue for time-charge based work is 
recognised when the service is performed in accordance with the contract and is a reflection of the actual hours worked as a 
proportion of total hours expected to be required. For fixed fee projects, revenue is only recognised once the final outcome can 
be assessed with reasonable certainty. The stage of completion is determined relative to the total number of hours or significant 
milestones expected to complete the work or provision of services. Revenue in the form of commissions on media placements 
and fees for creative and production services provided is recognised as the services are performed. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
80 81
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Share-based payments
The Group awards equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value at the date of 
grant. Details of how the fair value of awards made in the year has been calculated are set out in Note 24. The fair value of the 
equity-settled share-based payment is recognised in the income statement as an expense spread straight-line over the relevant 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the 
Group revises its estimate of the number of awards expected to vest, with the impact of any revision recognised in the income 
statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
Employee share ownership plans
Consideration paid to acquire shares in Huntsworth plc through Employee Benefit Trusts has been deducted from equity.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a distribution in the period in which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim 
dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Pensions
The Group operates defined contribution money purchase pension schemes and makes contributions to individual employees’ 
personal pension schemes. The Group’s contributions are charged against profits in the year in which the related employee 
services are performed.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have 
passed to the Group, and hire purchase contracts, are capitalised on the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives. 
The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the 
Balance Sheet. The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged in the income statement over the periods of the 
finance leases and hire purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments 
outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease 
incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the lease term. Sub-let income on operating 
leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
Sterling is the functional currency of Huntsworth plc and the presentational currency of the Group. Transactions denominated in 
foreign currencies are initially translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are translated into the presentational currency of the Group on consolidation. Assets and 
liabilities are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date with items in the Income Statement being translated 
at the average rate for the period. Exchange differences arising on consolidation are recorded in a separate component of equity, 
but are recognised in the consolidated income statement on disposal of the subsidiary to which they relate.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of an overseas subsidiary are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
overseas subsidiary and translated at the closing rate.
Highlighted items
The Group presents highlighted items charged to profit before tax by making adjustments for costs and credits which 
management believe to be significant by virtue of their size, nature or incidence or which have a distortive effect on current year 
earnings.
Such items would include, but are not limited to, costs associated with business combinations and disposals, restructuring costs, 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, and amortisation of intangible assets arising on business combinations.
Restructuring costs comprise cost-saving and right-sizing initiatives of a significant and a non-recurring nature.
In addition the Group presents an adjusted profit after tax measure by making adjustments for certain tax charges and credits. 
The Group uses these adjusted measures to evaluate performance.
Borrowing costs and finance income
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred unless they meet the criteria to be capitalised. Finance income is 
recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest rate method).

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Taxation
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except where it relates to 
items taken directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and expense or equity. Current tax assets and 
liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and 
laws that are enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
• In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future.
• Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate 
to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate movements. The 
Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading purposes. Derivatives that do not qualify for 
hedge accounting are accounted for at fair value through the income statement. Derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value at the contract date and continue to be stated at fair value at the balance sheet date with gains and 
losses on revaluation being recognised immediately in the income statement.
Interest rate swaps are used to hedge against fluctuations in future cash flows on the Group’s debt funding due to movements in 
interest rates. When a cash flow hedge is employed, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging 
instrument is recognised directly in equity (hedging reserve) until the gain or loss on the hedged item is realised and recognised 
in the income statement. Any ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Foreign currency instruments are used to hedge against unfavourable exchange rate fluctuations that affect the results of the 
Group’s overseas operations when translated into Sterling. Hedge accounting is not applied to these instruments and the 
associated cost is recognised at fair value through the income statement. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is 
positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of derivatives is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements and assumptions about the 
future, based on historical experience and other factors which are considered to be relevant. The resulting accounting estimates 
will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
(a) Highlighted items
In order to ensure comparability between the Group’s results year-on-year, the Directors present certain large, unusual or one-off 
items separately in highlighted items, so that the reader of the accounts can better understand the underlying performance of 
the business. The decision to present an item as highlighted is a judgement of the Directors and is reserved for items of an 
unusual or non-recurring nature that are outside of the ordinary course of business, or of such significant size such that they 
would materially distort the results of any particular period. The Directors consider it appropriate to continually present 
amortisation as a highlighted item in each period because the value of intangible assets being amortised can vary considerably 
from period to period depending on the amount of acquisition activity undertaken by the Group and the remaining useful life of 
individual assets.
(b) Carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the procedures set out in Note 12. 
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations. The value in use 
calculation requires the Directors to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from each cash-generating unit and a 
suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.  Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
82 83
2. Significant accounting policies continued
(c) Revenue recognition
The Group recognises revenue on projects based on the proportion of work completed at the balance sheet date. 
Judgement is required in assessing the fair value of the proportion of work completed and hence the appropriate value of 
revenue to be recognised in the year. Management make this judgement using estimates of expected hours required to complete 
the project against the budget, alongside any milestones set out in the contract. 
(d) Going concern
Judgement is required in performing the Group’s going concern assessment as it requires estimates of forecast future profits and 
cash flows to be made in order to assess future covenant compliance over the forecast period. At the time of approving the 
financial statements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and are forecasting to remain in compliance with future covenant 
facility requirements. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of preparation in the financial statements.
Reclassification of prior period information 
For the period ended 31 December 2016 the Group has reclassified the deferred tax expense on US intangible assets from profit 
before tax and highlighted items into highlighted items to be consistent with the presentation for the year ended 31 December 
2017. This is on the basis that the deferred tax expense would only ever crystallise on a sale of the relevant businesses, which is 
not anticipated at the current time, and such a sale would be a highlighted item. There is no impact of the statutory results. 
Appendix 2 on page 121 includes details of the Group’s subsidiaries and associates and forms part of these financial statements. 
3. Acquisition of The Creative Engagement Group 
On 1 July 2017, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of The Creative Engagement Group Limited (‘TCEG’). Acquisition 
accounting has been performed in accordance with IFRS 3 (revised) Business Combinations.
TCEG has contributed £12.2 million to revenue and £2.0 million to profit before tax for the period between the date of acquisition 
and the year end. If the acquisition of TCEG had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues post 
highlighted items for the period would have been £211.0 million and Group operating profit would have been £27.3 million.
The fair values of the net assets at the date of acquisition were as follows:

Net cash outflow arising on acquisition:

22,751
Goodwill comprises the value of expected synergies arising from the acquisition and other intangible assets that do not qualify 
for separate recognition. 
Acquisition related costs of £395,000 were incurred and these are included within highlighted items in the Consolidated Income 
Statement. The Creative Engagement Group forms part of the Immersive Operating Segment.

4. Segmental analysis
The following is an analysis of the Group’s revenue and operating profit before highlighted items by reportable segment.
During the year there was a reorganisation of the Group’s operating segments. Huntsworth Health was split into 3 segments – 
Medical, Marketing and Immersive. Grayling, Citigate Dewe Rogerson (‘CDR’) and Red have been combined into one operating 
segment, Communications.
These revised segments are the basis on which information is reported to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, which has 
been determined to be the Group Board. The segment result is the measure used for the purposes of performance assessment 
and represents profit earned by each segment, but before highlighted operating expenses, net finance costs and taxation.
Details of the types of services from which each segment derives its revenues are included within the Strategic Report. The 
accounting policies applied in preparing the management information for each of the reportable segments are the same as the 
Group’s accounting policies described in Note 2.

Amortisation of acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets are amortised systematically over their estimated useful lives, which vary from two to 20 years depending on 
the nature of the asset. The amortisation charge in respect of intangible assets is excluded from adjusted results as they relate to 
historic business combinations rather than normal ongoing operations. 
Goodwill impairment
No impairment was recognised in the year. Further disclosures are given in Note 12. Impairments totalling £30.5 million were 
recognised in 2016 relating to goodwill in the Grayling CGU. Impairment charges are individually disclosed and are excluded from 
adjusted results as they do not relate to underlying trading. 
Impairment of software development costs 
No impairment was recognised in the year. In 2016 the impairment related to significant adverse changes in the extent to which 
internally developed software is expected to be used. The recoverable amount is the value in use which was determined to be 
£nil. The charge was excluded from adjusted results as it does not relate to underlying trading. 
Restructuring costs
No restructuring costs were incurred in 2017 as the restructure was completed. Restructuring costs in 2016 comprised of 
cost-saving and right-sizing initiatives including severance payments, compensation for loss of office and other contract 
termination costs. Property costs relating to onerous contract provisions raised for property leases because of restructuring 
initiatives were included. These costs, which were part of the new management team’s strategic refocus of the business, were 
excluded from adjusted results as they do not relate to underlying trading. 
Acquisition and transaction related costs/(credit)
In 2017 the costs relate to the acquisition of subsidiaries. These costs are excluded from adjusted results as they are one-off in 
nature. The credit in 2016 related to subsequent re-measurement of the fair value of deferred contingent consideration. These 
costs were excluded from adjusted results as they relate to historic business combinations rather than ongoing operations. 
Disposal related credit
This represents profit on disposal of subsidiaries including adjustments for deferred consideration receivable and recycled 
foreign currency translation reserves. These credits have been excluded from adjusted results as they do not relate to 
ongoing operations. 
Taxation
The tax related to highlighted items is the tax effect of the items above. The Group presents highlighted items charged to profit 
before tax by making adjustments for costs and credits which management believe to be significant by virtue of their size, nature 
or incidence or which have a distortive effect on current year earnings. The Group uses these adjusted measures to evaluate 
performance and as a method to provide shareholders with clear and consistent reporting.

1 Because basic EPS results is a loss per share the diluted EPS is calculated using the undiluted weighted average number of shares.
The basic earnings/(loss) per share calculation is based on the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to the Parent Company’s 
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share takes the basic earnings/(loss) per share and adjusts for the potentially dilutive impact of 
employee share option schemes and shares to be issued as part of contingent consideration on acquisitions of subsidiaries.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated in order to provide information to shareholders about underlying trading performance 
and is based on the profit attributable to the Parent Company’s shareholders excluding highlighted items.

During the year there was a reorganisation of the Group’s operating segments. Huntsworth Health was split into 3 segments – 
Medical, Marketing and Immersive, with The Creative Engagement Group included in the Immersive operating segment. Grayling, 
Citigate Dewe Rogerson (‘CDR’) and Red have been combined into one operating segment, Communications. 
Medical, Marketing and Immersive will now represent separate CGUs. Goodwill has been allocated to each using a relative value 
approach. The Grayling, CDR and Red CGUs will remain as management continue to monitor goodwill at this level. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions used in determining 
the value in use are summarised below.  Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
90 91
12. Intangible assets continued
Cash flow forecasts
For each CGU, the forecast cash flows for the first five years are based on the 2018 financial budget approved by the Directors 
adjusted based on past experience and historic trends. Growth rates in years two to five are based on management’s medium-
term forecasted revenue and operating margins for each of the businesses.
Long-term growth rate
After the initial five-year forecast period, a long-term growth rate between 1.5% and 2.5% (2016: 2.0–2.5%) has been applied to 
the cash flow forecasts into perpetuity. This growth rate is based on an estimate of the long-term average growth rate for the 
market that each CGU operates in.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate
The pre-tax discount rate applied to all CGUs is 12.6% (2016: 14.3%). The discount rates applied to the cash flows of the Group’s 
operations are based on the risk-free rate for 20-year UK government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the 
increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the Group’s individual CGUs. In making this adjustment, inputs 
required are the equity market risk premium (that is the increased return required over and above a risk-free rate by an investor 
who is investing in the market as a whole) and the risk adjustment (‘beta’) applied to reflect the risk of the CGU relative to the 
market as a whole.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
In assessing the value in use of a CGU, the forecast future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could change materially over 
time due to the impact of market growth, discount rates and unexpected changes in key clients and personnel. 
The Board has considered various alternative performance scenarios for the CGUs, including sensitising all of the key 
assumptions noted above, and have not identified any reasonably possible changes which would give rise to an impairment.

Deferred contingent consideration for acquisitions
Acquisitions made by the Group typically involve an earn-out arrangement whereby the consideration payable includes a 
deferred element, payable in either cash or a combination of cash and shares at the Company’s option, which is contingent on the 
future financial performance of the acquired entity. The amount utilised in the year represents the cash paid or shares issued 
under the earn-out arrangements. The amount arising or released in the prior year represented a change in the estimated future 
financial performance of the acquired company. Where deferred consideration was not contingent on the outcome of future 
events the amount was included in trade and other payables. 
Property provisions
Provisions for property represent amounts set aside in respect of property leases which are onerous and the unavoidable costs 
of restoring leasehold properties to the condition specified in the lease at the end of the contractual term. The quantification of 
these provisions has been determined based on external professional advice and is dependent on the Group’s ability to exit the 
leases early or to sub-let the properties. In general, property costs are expected to be incurred over a range of one to eight years.
Reorganisation and other provisions
This provision relates principally to redundancy provisions. In addition, when acquiring businesses, provisions have been made to 
cover the best estimate of the Group’s exposure to liabilities arising due to the acquisition. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Deferred tax balances:

Deferred tax has been calculated using the anticipated rates that will apply when the assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. 
The recoverability of deferred tax assets is supported by the expected level of future profits in the countries concerned.
Unrecognised temporary differences in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences amounting to £38.7 million (2016: 
£41.4 million), have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain. These comprise tax losses 
and other temporary differences of £26.4 million (2016: £29.1 million) and capital losses of £12.3 million (2016: £12.3 million). Of 
this total, tax losses of £12.3 million (2016: £9.8 million) will expire at various dates between 2018 and 2029 and the remaining 
losses can be carried forward without restriction.
Overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 are largely exempt from UK tax but may be subject to foreign withholding 
taxes. The unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries affected by such taxes is £4.0 million (2016: £3.8 million). No 
deferred tax liability is recognised on these temporary differences as the Group is able to control the timing of reversal and it is 
probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The US Government has enacted a reduction in the Federal rate of corporation tax to 21% with effect from 1 January 2018. The 
UK Government has enacted a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. The impact of 
these changes is incorporated in the reported numbers where relevant.

21. Financial instruments continued
Financial risk management policies and strategies
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts and cash and short-term deposits. The main 
purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other financial 
assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and foreign currency derivatives. The purpose is to 
manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. It is the Group’s policy 
that no speculative trading in financial instruments should be undertaken. The main risks arising from the Group’s financial 
instruments are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for 
managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations 
with floating interest rates.
The Board has endorsed principles and policies to manage the Group’s interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts. 
To enable this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps. Where appropriate, these agreements are designated to hedge 
underlying debt obligations. As at 31 December 2017, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 
55% (2016: 55%) of the Group’s gross borrowings was at a fixed rate of interest. The Group continually reviews and assesses the 
balance of debt held at fixed and variable rates and the need for additional instruments to meet both short-term and long-term 
requirements.
Interest rate swap contracts
The Group uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates increasing the cost of servicing its debt. By 
fixing interest rates, the Group is willing to forgo the potential economic benefit that could result from a low interest rate 
environment in order to protect its downside risks and ensure the predictability of its interest cash flows. The fair value of interest 
rate swaps at the end of the reporting period is determined by reference to a market valuation. All interest rate swaps are 
designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on 
borrowings. The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount accumulated in 
equity is reclassified to profit or loss over the period that the floating interest rate payments on debt affect profit or loss.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the 
reporting date and the impact on the Group’s fixed and floating rate debt profile.

The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above table are non-interest bearing and are therefore 
not subject to interest rate risk. Floating rate surplus cash earns interest based on relevant local LIBID equivalents. Bank 
overdrafts bear interest based on the Lloyds Bank plc base rate. The bank loans payable bear interest based on LIBOR in the 
relevant country.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The interest rate sensitivity analysis below is based on the exposure arising from the Group’s borrowings and derivative financial 
instruments as at the balance sheet date. A 1% (100 basis points) movement is considered to represent a reasonably possible 
change in interest rates. All other variables have been held constant.
If UK interest rates had been 1% higher or lower, the Group’s profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2017 would 
decrease/increase by £269,000 (2016: £258,000). If US interest rates had been 1% higher or lower, the Group’s profit before tax 
would decrease/increase by £nil (2016: £nil). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable 
rate borrowings.
If UK interest rates had been 1% higher or lower, the Group’s other comprehensive income would increase or decrease by 
£353,000 or £356,000 respectively (2016: £600,000 or £616,000 respectively). This is as a result of the changes to the fair value 
of the Group’s interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is therefore affected by movements in foreign exchange rates, particularly the US Dollar 
and Euro. This is largely through the retranslation of the Group’s foreign operations’ results and balances into Sterling. The Group 
has few other transactional currency exposures apart from certain foreign currency bank accounts and intercompany balances 
that are held between companies with different functional currencies.
It is the policy of the Group to consider entering into foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risk associated with the 
impact of changes in exchange rates on the Group’s operating profit. The Group does not hedge foreign exchange risk that arises 
from the retranslation of overseas assets and liabilities. During the year, the Group took out foreign exchange contracts to cover a 
proportion of the Group’s Euro and US Dollar denominated operating profit. These contracts were not accounted for as a hedge.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in the US Dollar and Euro exchange rates, with all 
other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax. Since the majority of the Group’s expenses are denominated in the 
same currency as the associated revenues, only the net profit is exposed to currency fluctuations.

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the potential loss that the Group would incur if a debtor or other counterparty failed to fulfil its contractual 
obligations. The Group trades only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. Customers who wish to trade on credit terms 
are subject to credit verification procedures prior to credit being granted. In addition, receivable balances are closely monitored 
on an ongoing basis by each business with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts has not been significant. There are 
no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group has a minimal concentration of credit risk in relation to 
trade receivables as it trades with a large number of customers from a wide range of business segments and geographies.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and 
derivative financial instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum 
exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial 
instruments is considered low since the majority of counterparties are banks with high credit ratings.
Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and undrawn banking facilities and by continuously 
monitoring the forecast and actual cash flows. 
During the year the Group utilised a £65 million multi-currency revolving credit facility and a £5 million committed overdraft 
facility. In July 2017, the Group exercised its accordion option under the facility agreement to increase the limit on the revolving 
credit facility by £10 million to £75 million.
After the year end, the Group completed an amend and extend of its facility, as a result of which the Group has available a £75 
million multi-currency revolving credit facility with a £40 million accordion option, committed until September 2021, together 
with a £5 million uncommitted overdraft.

Fair values of financial liabilities and assets
All financial assets and financial liabilities have been recognised at their carrying values which are not materially different to their 
fair values.
Fair value measurement
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities.
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group within the vesting period. Any share options which remain unexercised 
after the exercise period will expire. Certain grants of share options are also subject to specific performance conditions relevant 
to an employee, such as the Group’s adjusted basic earnings per share and total shareholder return relative to a peer group. 
Specific details of the exercise conditions of options granted to Directors are set out in the Report of the Directors on 
Remuneration.

Fair value of share options
The fair value of share options granted in 2017 and 2016 were calculated using either the Monte Carlo model or the Black-Scholes 
model. The inputs to these models were:
2017 2016
Weighted average share price 43.86 42.2 pence
Weighted average exercise price nil 5.4 pence
Expected volatility 41%–46% 39%–45%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Risk-free rate 0.17%–0.3% 0.09%–0.6%
Expected dividend yield 2.8%–4.22% 4.0%–4.2%
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not 
necessarily be the actual outcome. The Group recognised a total charge of £1.3 million (2016: £0.2 million) related to equity-
settled share-based transactions during the year.
25. Reserves
Share premium account
The share premium account is used to record the premium on shares issued.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve is used to record the premium on shares issued as consideration (both initial and deferred) for acquired 
businesses where the Group acquires 90% or more of the ordinary share capital of the acquired business.
There were no movements in the merger reserve in the current year. In 2016, following the impairment of certain investments held 
by Huntsworth plc, £1.5 million relating to the acquisition of those subsidiaries was transferred from the merger reserve to the 
profit and loss reserve.
Foreign currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of financial 
statements of overseas subsidiaries.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve is used to record the effective portion of the movements in the fair value of the Group’s derivative financial 
instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and are deemed to be effective hedges.
Treasury shares
The Group did not transfer any shares to employees pursuant to the settlement of share options in neither the current nor prior 
year. As at 31 December 2017 the Group held 1,686,681 shares (2016: 1,686,681 shares) in treasury.
Investment in own shares
Investment in own shares represents the cost of own shares acquired in the Company by the Huntsworth Employee Benefit Trust 
and other Employee Benefit Trusts (‘the Trusts’). The purpose of the Trusts is to facilitate and encourage the ownership of shares 
by employees, by acquiring shares in the Company and distributing them in accordance with employee share schemes. The 
Trusts may operate in conjunction with the Company’s existing share option schemes and other share schemes that may apply 
from time to time.
Pursuant to the settlement of share options, the Trusts transferred 200,000 shares to employees and past employees (2016: 
4,051,129 shares, including 231,081 accrued dividend shares), for proceeds of £114,500 (2016: £251,449).
The Trusts did not purchase any shares in 2017 (2016: nil). At 31 December 2017 the Trusts held 2.2 million shares (2016: 2.4 million 
shares) in the Company which had a market value at 31 December 2017 of £1.8 million (2016: £0.9 million).

adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.
The Company and its subsidiaries have entered into a number of indemnifications, performance and financial guarantees, in the 
normal course of business, which gives rise to obligations to pay amounts or fulfil obligations to external parties should certain 
conditions not be met or specified events occur. As at the date of this report, no matter has come to the attention of the Group 
which indicates that any material outflow will occur as a result of these indemnities and guarantees. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Report on the audit of the Parent Company financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Huntsworth plc’s Parent Company financial statements (‘the financial statements’):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and applicable law); and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (‘the Annual Report’), which 
comprise: the Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2017 and the Company statement of changes in equity for the year 
then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group or the Parent Company.
Other than those disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the 
Group and its subsidiaries in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.
Our audit approach
Overview
• Overall materiality: £2.38 million (2016: £2.26 million), based on 1% of net assets.
• We carried out audit procedures on the complete financial information on the Parent Company.
• Risk of impairment in relation to investments in subsidiaries.
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Parent Company and the industry in which 
it operates, and considered the risk of acts by the Parent Company which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, 
including fraud. We designed audit procedures to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate 
concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws and regulations 
that could give rise to a material misstatement in the Parent Company’s financial statements, including, but not limited to, 
Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules and UK tax legislation. Our tests included, but were not limited to review of the financial 
statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, review of correspondence with the regulators, review of 
correspondence with legal advisers and enquiries of management. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures 
described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions 
reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the 
risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by 
the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or 
not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the

allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we 
make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all 
risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Impairment of investment in subsidiaries 
Refer to page 113 (Significant Accounting Policies) and page 115 
(notes).
The Company has £229.5 million of investments in and loans 
to subsidiaries as at 31 December 2017 (2016: £203.3 million).
Determining if an impairment charge is required involves an 
assessment of the net assets of the underlying investments 
and judgement about the future results and cash flows of the 
investments, including forecast growth in future revenues and 
operating profit margins. 
The Directors’ impairment assessment showed that no 
impairment was required for investments in and loans to 
subsidiaries as at 31 December 2017. 
We reviewed the Directors’ impairment assessment for 
investments in and loans to subsidiaries. This included 
comparing the investments carrying value against the net 
assets of the subsidiary and by reference to the discounted 
future cash flows the Directors expect the subsidiary to 
generate. We challenged the Directors’ assumptions used in 
these discounted cash flow models including growth rates, 
discount rate and cash flows from operations.
In addition, we confirmed the market capitalisation of the 
Company exceeded the carrying value of investment in and 
loans to subsidiaries as at 31 December 2017. 
For all investments the Directors determined that no 
impairment was required, we found that these judgements 
were supported by reasonable assumptions that would 
require significant downside changes before any impairments 
were necessary.
How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which it operates. 
We scoped the balances to be audited in line with the materiality determined for the year. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent 
of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall materiality £2.38 million (2016: £2.26 million).
How we determined it 1% of net assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that net assets is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing 
the position of the entity, and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £59,000 
(2016: £30,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
respect of the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the 
Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements and the Directors’ identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a 
period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to. However, because 
not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, this statement is not a 
guarantee as to the Parent Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to Going Concern in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in 
this report, any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, 
we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a 
material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these 
responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we also considered whether the 
disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we 
did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
Corporate Governance Statement
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance 
Statement (on pages 42 to 43) about internal controls and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes 
and about share capital structures in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 
sourcebook of the FCA (‘DTR’) is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we 
did not identify any material misstatements in this information. (CA06)
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance 
Statement (on pages 40 to 43) with respect to the Parent Company’s corporate governance code and practices and about its 
administrative, management and supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the 
DTR. (CA06)
We have nothing to report arising from our responsibility to report if a corporate governance statement has not been prepared 
by the Parent Company. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Parent Company and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the Parent Company
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The Directors’ confirmation on page 64 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Parent Company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The Directors’ explanation on page 64 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Parent 
Company, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Parent Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Parent Company and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Parent Company. 
Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ 
process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and 
understanding of the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules) Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
108 109
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the Directors, on page 64, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Parent Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Parent Company obtained in 
the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on pages 44 to 46 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The Directors’ statement relating to the Parent Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure 
from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 64, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the Directors either intend to liquidate the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.
org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, Huntsworth plc has not presented its own profit and loss account.  
The Company’s significant accounting policies are set out below.
2. Significant accounting policies
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets, less the estimated residual value, on a straight-line 
basis over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
• Motor vehicles    25%
• Equipment, fixtures and fittings  15%–35%
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Trade and other receivables
Trade debtors are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Provision for 
impairment is made when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are 
written off when the possibility of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Current tax
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
• In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future.
• Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities.

Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Foreign currencies
Sterling is the functional currency and presentational currency of the Company. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
are initially translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the resulting gains and losses are 
recorded in the profit and loss account.
Investments
Investments are recognised and carried at cost less any identified impairment losses at the end of each reporting period. 
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable 
amount in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or 
cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset 
does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit and loss account. Central costs are not allocated to individual 
investments.
Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, loans and 
receivables or available for sale financial assets, as appropriate. The Company determines the classification of its financial assets 
at initial recognition. All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and short-term deposits. 
Loans and receivables
All Company financial assets are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets 
with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest (EIR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance revenue in the profit 
and loss account. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit and loss account in other operating expenses.
Derecognition of financial assets
A financial asset is derecognised when (i) the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or (ii) the Company has 
transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the 
risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Impairment of financial assets
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial 
assets is impaired. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has 
been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value 
of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced, 
with the amount of the loss recognised in administration costs. 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal 
of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not 
exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
Operating lease commitments
Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases and rentals payable are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
114 115
Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2017
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Share-based payments
The Company awards equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value at the date of 
grant. The fair value of the equity-settled share-based payments is recognised in the profit and loss account as an expense 
spread straight-line over the relevant vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the number of awards that will 
eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of awards expected to vest, with the 
impact of any revision recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves. 
Loans and borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the related contracts and are 
measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate movements. The 
Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading purposes but derivatives that do not qualify 
for hedge accounting are accounted for at fair value through the profit and loss account. Derivative financial instruments are 
initially recognised at fair value at the contract date and continue to be stated at fair value at the balance sheet date, with gains 
and losses on revaluation being recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Employee share ownership plans
Shares in the Company held by the Employee Benefit Trust have been included within equity and are stated at cost.
Borrowing costs and finance income
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred. Finance income is recognised as the interest accrues (using the 
effective interest rate method).
Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements and assumptions about 
the future, based on historical experience and other factors which are considered to be relevant. The resulting accounting 
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Carrying value of investments 
The Company tests annually whether investments have suffered any impairment. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating 
units have been determined based on value in use calculations. The value in use calculation requires the Directors to estimate the 
future cash flows expected to arise from each investment and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Central 
costs are not allocated to individual investments.

12. Reserves
Called up share capital

of the Company’s equity share capital, comprising £0.01 ordinary shares.
Share premium account
The share premium account is used to record the premium on shares issued. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
118 119
12. Reserves continued
Merger reserve
The merger reserve is used to record the premium on shares issued as consideration (both initial and deferred) for acquired 
businesses where the Group acquires 90% or more of the ordinary share capital of the acquired business. 
There were no movements in the merger reserve in the current year. In 2016, following the impairment of certain investments held 
by Huntsworth plc, £1.5 million relating to the acquisition of those subsidiaries was transferred from the merger reserve to the 
profit and loss reserve.
Treasury shares
The Group did not transfer any shares to employees pursuant to the settlement of share options in neither the current nor prior 
year. As at 31 December 2017 the Group held 1,686,681 shares (2016: 1,686,681 shares) in treasury.
Investment in own shares
Investment in own shares represents the cost of own shares acquired in the Company by the Huntsworth Employee Benefit Trust 
and other Employee Benefit Trusts (‘the Trusts’). The purpose of the Trusts is to facilitate and encourage the ownership of shares 
by employees, by acquiring shares in the Company and distributing them in accordance with employee share schemes. The 
Trusts may operate in conjunction with the Company’s existing share option schemes and other share schemes that may apply 
from time to time.
Pursuant to the settlement of share options, the Trusts transferred 200,000 shares to employees and past employees (2016: 
4,051,129 shares, including 231,081 accrued dividend shares), for proceeds of £114,500 (2016: £251,449).
The Trusts did not purchase any shares in 2017 (2016: nil). At 31 December 2017 the Trusts held 2.2 million shares (2016: 2.4 million 
shares) in the Company which had a market value at 31 December 2017 of £1.8 million (2016: £0.9 million).
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve is used to record the effective portion of the movements in the fair value of the Group’s derivative financial 
instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and are deemed to be effective hedges.
Other reserves
The amount held in other reserves represents the credit to equity where Huntsworth plc grants rights in its equity instruments to 
employees of a subsidiary and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial 
statements. The credit represents a contribution from the Parent Company to its subsidiaries.
13. Related parties
Details of Executive and Non-Executive Directors’ emoluments and their interests in shares and options of the Company are 
shown in the Report of the Directors on Remuneration in the sections ‘Directors’ emoluments’, ‘Directors’ interests in shares’ and 
‘Directors’ interests in share options’. The key management personnel of the Company are considered to be the Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors. 
14. Contingent liabilities
(i) The Company is registered with HM Revenue and Customs as a member of a Group for VAT purposes and, as a result, is 
jointly and severally liable on a continuing basis for amounts owing by any other members of that Group in respect of unpaid 
VAT. At the balance sheet date, the outstanding VAT liability in the other Group companies amounted to approximately £1.2 
million (2016: £1.6 million).
(ii) In connection with the Group’s banking and borrowing facilities, the Company and certain of its subsidiary undertakings have 
entered into cross-guarantee and indemnity arrangements with Lloyds Bank plc, Barclays Bank plc and HSBC Bank plc.
(iii) In the normal course of business, the Company is, from time to time, subjected to legal actions, contractual disputes, 
employment claims and tax assessments. In the opinion of the Directors, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have 
a material adverse effect on the Company.
(iv) The Company has entered into a number of indemnifications, performance and financial guarantees, in the normal course of 
business, which gives rise to obligations to pay amounts or fulfil obligations to external parties should certain conditions not 
be met or specified events occur. As at the date of this report, no matter has come to the attention of the Company which 
indicates that any material outflow will occur as a result of these indemnities and guarantees.
15. Post balance sheet events
After the year end, the Company completed an amend and extend of its banking facilities, as a result of which the Company has 
available a £75 million multi-currency revolving credit facility with a £40 million accordion option, committed until September 
2021, together with a £5 million uncommitted overdraft.

Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information
This report makes reference to various non-IFRS measures, which are defined below. All performance-based measures are 
presented to provide insight into ongoing profit generation, both individually and relative to other companies.
Headline operating profit/profit before tax
Calculated as operating profit/profit before tax excluding highlighted items. Highlighted items in the current year comprise 
amortisation of intangible assets, acquisition/transaction related costs and disposal related credits. In the prior year, goodwill 
impairment, impairment of software development costs and restructuring costs were also included in highlighted items. Both 
headline profit and IFRS profit measures are presented in the income statement. An analysis of highlighted items is presented 
in Note 6. 
Margin
Headline operating profit as a percentage of revenue. 
Headline basic and diluted EPS
Headline basic EPS is calculated using profit for the period before highlighted items. Headline diluted EPS is the same calculation 
but takes into account the impact of share options in issue and deferred consideration that could be settled in shares. Details of 
the underlying inputs to headline and IFRS measures of EPS are included in Note 11.
Net debt 
Net debt is the total of current and non-current borrowings and derivative financial instruments, less cash and cash equivalents. 
The Group uses this as a measure of indebtedness. An analysis of net debt is included in Note 27.
Cash conversion 
Cash conversion is the net cash inflow from operations before highlighted items expressed as a percentage of adjusted operating 
profit and provides an understanding of how much profit the group has converted to cash. 
Highlighted cash flows are the cash flows directly attributable to the items presented within highlighted items in the income 
statement. A reconciliation of the difference between cash flows before highlighted items and IFRS cash flows is included in 
Note 27.
Effective tax rate 
The effective tax rate is the total tax charge incurred by the Group on headline profit before tax, expressed as a percentage. This 
provides a more comparable basis to analyse our tax rate both individually and relative to other companies.
Like-for-like
Like-for-like results are stated at constant exchange rates and excluding the effect of acquisitions and disposals. Constant 
currency results are calculated by translating prior period foreign currency results using the current period exchange rate. This 
provides insight into the organic growth of the business. A reconciliation of the material adjustments made between IFRS 
revenues and operating profit and like-for-like results are included in the table below:
