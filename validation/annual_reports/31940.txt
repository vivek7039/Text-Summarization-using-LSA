   Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   5 Results
For the year ended 30 June 2017 , the Group delivered 
revenue of £352.1m and underlying profit before 
tax of £38.3m, together with an underlying basic 
earnings per share of 55.7 pence.
As set out in more detail in the Chief Executive’s 
Statement on pages 8 to 10 and the Financial Review 
on pages 26 to 29, the Group has delivered a resilient 
set of results with marginal growth in underlying 
profit before tax and earnings per share. These results 
are positive in the context of an uncertain political 
and economic climate experienced in the year, 
together with the changes within the automotive 
industry, as many of our customers plan for an 
increasingly electrified future.
The strategy of the Group has been established 
on the need to have a diversified business, both 
geographically and across market sectors. It is 
through the implementation of this strategy in recent 
years that the Group has been able to deliver these 
results, with strong performance from our Rail and 
Environmental consultancy businesses, together 
with our Performance Products business. After an 
unsettled start, the Group saw increasingly strong 
order intake as we progressed through the financial 
year, including electric and hybrid vehicles within our 
Automotive business, ending the year with a record 
order book overall for the Group.
The Group continues to pursue its strategic 
objectives through organic growth and carefully 
targeted acquisitions. The Group’s performance 
against its strategic objectives is outlined on pages 14 
and 15. We also continued to invest in research and 
development (as described on pages 24 and 25), our 
people and our facilities.
People
I would like to thank all of our employees for their 
hard work and professionalism over the last year. 
As set out on pages 30 and 31, Ricardo is a people 
business and our employees underpin everything 
that the Group achieves. We are extremely pleased 
The Group continues to pursue its strategic objectives through organic growth 
and carefully targeted acquisitions within Transport & Security, Energy, and 
Scarce Resources & Waste. Following the acquisition of Exnovo early in the year 
and Control Point Corporation after the year-end, I would like to welcome those 
employees to Ricardo.
Sir Terry Morgan, CBE - Chairman
 
6   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Chairman’s statement  Chairman’s statement 
that one of Ricardo’s highest performing employees, 
Angela Johnson, our Head of Knowledge & 
Technology Strategy, has been recognised in the 
inaugural Autocar list of the 100 most influential British 
women in the car industry. 
Other notable achievements include Ricardo 
Certification being formally accredited by the United 
Kingdom Accreditation Service (‘UKAS’) to provide 
independent assurance services for the international 
rail sector. Ricardo Energy & Environment has been 
re-appointed as the UK’s National Atmospheric 
Emissions Inventory (‘NAEI’) agency on behalf of the 
Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy. 
In addition, Ricardo Performance Products has been 
nominated by Aston Martin to design, develop and 
supply an advanced transmission for the ground-
breaking Valkyrie hypercar, which is being created 
as a result of a unique collaboration between Aston 
Martin and Red Bull Advanced Technologies. Finally, 
Ricardo Strategic Consulting has been named by 
Forbes among the leading management consultants 
in the United States. It is the commitment of our 
employees that enables us to deliver these results and 
which underpins our reputation with clients.
I would also like to congratulate all those individuals 
and team members who have won awards under the 
various Ricardo recognition programmes during the 
year, together with those members of staff who have 
gained academic success or peer group recognition 
in their chosen career paths.
Corporate governance
The Board firmly believes that robust corporate 
governance and risk management are essential to 
maintain the stability of the Group and its financial 
health. I am reporting separately on Corporate 
Governance on pages 72 to 81 of this Annual Report.
The Board
As announced on 24 April 2017 , Ian Lee intends to 
step down as Non-Executive Director and Chair 
of the Audit Committee at the close of our AGM 
in November 2017 . I would like to thank Ian for his 
contribution to the Board, not only as Non-Executive 
Director, but also the guidance he brought as Chair 
of the Audit Committee. Bill Spencer has joined the 
Board as Non-Executive Director and it is intended 
that he will succeed Ian Lee as Chair of the Audit 
Committee with effect from the close of the AGM in 
November 2017 . Bill has a wide range of experience 
in senior financial roles and I am confident that his 
experience will be of great benefit to Ricardo.
Dividend
The Board has declared a final dividend of 13.88 
pence per share to give a total dividend of 19.3 pence, 
an increase of 7% on the prior year. This is in line with 
the Board’s policy to pay progressive dividends and 
reflects its confidence in the prospects of the Group.
Outlook
The Ricardo strategy is underpinned by trends which 
will affect an ever-increasing number of people 
around the globe; with a growing population, mass 
urbanisation, poorer air quality, climate change, 
stringent emissions legislation and resource scarcity.
These long-term trends bring with them significant 
change, and Ricardo is a business that thrives on 
change. With a record order book and a good 
pipeline of opportunities across all sectors, the Group 
has the platform for future growth and to address 
these challenges as an increasingly diverse, balanced 
and global Automotive, Rail and Environmental 
consulting business.

  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   7 Strategy
Our strategy continues to be balanced around 
growth and risk mitigation – to capture the 
opportunities of global, societal and technological 
change, whilst ensuring risk mitigation, where 
possible, in anticipation of economic, industrial, 
customer and political cycles. We achieve this 
through carefully selected diversification to avoid 
any undue dependence on individual clients, 
markets or regions of the world. Our engineering 
and consulting businesses primarily in the markets 
of Automotive, Rail and Energy & Environment are 
all linked around common long-term trends, shared 
resources wherever possible, and serve shared 
customers in many cases. Our Performance Products 
business provides links to our other businesses in 
terms of products, but also provides a longer-cycle 
business that is measured in a decade of supply 
rather than a comparatively short-term engineering 
or consulting contract. A portfolio of businesses 
that have different cycles and longevity provides 
additional resilience.
We expand and adapt these businesses both 
through organic and acquisitive actions. Organic 
development is supported by investment in 
excellent people through our apprenticeship 
programmes, graduate recruitment, and industry 
hires and by investment into the right technologies 
and the right assets. In an ever changing 
environment we focus on being ‘Agile, Adaptable 
and Ambitious’ and we look for our team and assets 
to be capable of this philosophy: it is important for 
the business to be fluid. 
Our strategy continues to be underpinned by 
long-term trends – population growth, urbanisation, 
energy security and efficiency, rising demand for 
natural resources and increasing environmental and 
emission regulations. All of these drive demand for 
innovative services and products. In many regions 
around the world, urbanisation is happening very 
rapidly and we are seeing significant infrastructure 
spend in the developing countries as they 
implement new rail-based transportation systems. 
This year we have also seen a significant focus on 
I am pleased to report another solid year of progress for Ricardo, against a backdrop 
of significant political and market change. Based on the foundation of a diversified 
strategy and an increasingly balanced business, we have navigated an uncertain and 
volatile year, with parts of our business performing strongly, some less so, providing a 
satisfactory result overall. 
Dave Shemmans - Chief Executive Officer
Chief executive’s statement 
 
8   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Chief executive’s statement 
Ricardo is collaborating on the design, 
development and manufacture 
of the transmission of the Aston 
Martin Valkyrie (see case study ‘Ultimate 
Performance’ on pages 64 to 67)
emissions both at the local city level and in relation 
to the Paris Climate Agreement CO 2 reduction 
targets globally. These, together with the additional 
pressure brought by the intense diesel debate in 
the automotive industry, has led to an increased 
impetus around long-term electrification of vehicles, 
a short-term improvement of combustion engine 
performance and new ways of vehicle operation to 
enhance efficiency such as driverless or autonomous 
vehicles. 
These global and strategic changes require new 
technologies, strategic oversight, programme 
management and certification – this is our heritage, 
and through our future-focused technology 
roadmapping, it is our business both today and 
tomorrow. Ricardo is well placed and benefits from 
global change. By looking forward and acting at 
the right time we adapt our footprint, technology 
investment, people skills and product mix. 
Our process to enhance the future readiness 
of the business led us to invest in electric vehicle 
and hybrid technology a decade ago and to move 
into developing regions of the world early on: as a 
result, we already have the skills and connections 
to support our customers wherever they are 
with the solutions required today. As the pace in 
electrification and autonomous vehicles increases 
(across all forms of transportation), we will continue 
to be ready and will match our offerings and our 
asset base to the requirements of our customers. 
Further information on the execution of our 
strategy can be found on pages 14 and 15.
Highlights from the year
We closed the year with record order intake £366m 
and order book £248m, with good order intake 
contributions from all areas of our business and all 
core regions of the world. The Group saw growth 
in revenue of 6% to £352.1m (2016: £332.4m) and in 
underlying profit before tax of 2% to £38.3m  
(2016: £37 .7m). Using exchange rates consistent 
with the prior year, revenue and underlying profit 
before tax would have been £336.9m and £38.2m, 
respectively, both of which represent growth of 1% 
on the prior year. Further details on the results for 
the year are provided in the Financial Review on 
pages 26 to 29.
Our Rail and Environmental consultancies 
delivered strong results at both revenue and 
operating profit levels, as did our Performance 
Products business. Within Performance Products 
we were pleased to deliver our 10,000
th
 engine to 
McLaren and to be selected to design and produce 
an advanced hypercar transmission for Aston Martin.
Our Automotive business in Europe experienced 
a disrupted year of order flows which led to a 
less efficient business operation, as the industry 
digested and evaluated its product plans in reaction 
to developments such as the various referenda, 
elections, the diesel issue and the increased focus 
on electrification. The year ended with strong 
order intake in both the engines and electrification 
businesses and we are pleased to see a return to 
more normal order intake patterns in recent months 
as client plans are now more settled. 
Group overview Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report Case studies
  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   9 With the US business underperforming, a 
changing customer dynamic and the increased 
emphasis on electrification, we are repositioning 
the US business to enhance our electrified and 
autonomous vehicle service offering, led from 
California where many new entrants are based. This 
involves some changes in team mix and regional 
emphasis, and asset reduction where appropriate.
We were also pleased to welcome Exnovo to 
the Ricardo Group early in the year, bringing with 
it core expertise in the motorcycle industry and a 
good base in Italy. Post year-end we completed 
the acquisition of Control Point Corporation. This 
business brings with it additional clients and 
expertise in the classified US defence sector.
At the heart of Ricardo’s success is the ability of 
our staff to deliver excellence and create value for 
customers across industries. Some examples of 
excellent project delivery are presented in the Case 
Studies section between pages 42 and 67 . Each 
of the case studies illustrates the skills, technical 
expertise, innovation and motivation of Ricardo’s 
staff across the world:
• Tackling nanoparticle emissions: the emission 
of vehicle exhaust particles as small as just ten 
nanometres is an increasing concern around the 
world in terms of air quality and risk to public 
health. Ricardo is spearheading research into 
the measurement and control technologies, 
working with industry bodies and the European 
Commission;
• Charge of innovation: one of the major 
challenges holding back the market penetration 
of Battery Electric Vehicles (‘BEVs’) is the high cost 
of rechargeable energy storage. Ricardo is helping 
to pave the way for a new, lighter-weight and 
safer lithium-sulfur based rechargeable battery 
chemistry that aims to overcome the cost, capacity 
and safety challenges of today’s lithium-ion based 
systems;
• Semi-autonomous semi truck: the platooning 
of large vehicles represents the most attractive 
early application of automated driving. Ricardo 
engineers have developed platooning applications 
in some of the highest profile demonstration 
projects on either side of the Atlantic – and 
Ricardo has developed an enviable reputation as a 
leading innovator and technical partner for semi-
autonomous vehicle platooning, reinforcing the 
Group’s leadership position in the development of 
connected and autonomous vehicle technologies;
• Shipping steers a clear course on emissions: 
with pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions 
from shipping seen as a significant and growing 
part of global emissions, Ricardo has been 
commissioned to deliver a comprehensive update 
of the shipping emissions inventory for the UK 
National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (‘NAEI’);
• Smart monitoring: Ricardo Rail has developed 
PanMon, an innovative pantograph monitoring 
system which helps operators improve the 
reliability of electrified routes and protect critical 
infrastructure. Network Rail has formally approved 
the use of PanMon for use across the whole UK 
national rail system – a highly significant step as 
PanMon remains the only such system certified for 
use by a major network operator; and
• Ultimate performance: Ricardo has been 
selected as technical and supply partner for 
the transmission of the Aston Martin Valkyrie – 
the ultra-high performance hypercar, itself the 
product of a partnership between Aston Martin 
and Formula One’s Red Bull Racing.
Outlook
We enter the new financial year with a well balanced 
business and welcome the in-year acquisition of 
Exnovo and the recent Control Point Corporation 
acquisition post year-end. We continue to address 
and adjust to the changes in our individual markets 
to ensure we both mitigate risk and capitalise on 
the significant global opportunities which lie ahead. 
These opportunities, together with our progress, our 
people and our technology, in addition to our record 
order book, provide a good platform for further 
growth in the years to come.

Performance growth: profitable growth delivered by focusing on future market 
demands driven by technology change, customer needs and prevailing or impending 
policies and regulation
The increase in revenue is due to improvements in 
Technical Consulting activity primarily in Rail and Energy 
& Environment, offset by a challenging financial year 
in Automotive across Europe and the US. Performance 
Products also saw increased activity as a result of growth 
in engine sales during the year. More details of this are 
described in the Financial Review section on pages 26 to 
29, and also in the Technical Consulting and Performance 
Products sections on pages 16 to 21 and 22 to 23, 
respectively.
After a disrupted flow of orders in the first half of 
the year, the order flow returned to normal patterns 
in the second half. The year-end order book was at 
another record level, with significant order intake 
from Rail, Automotive in Europe and Performance 
Products, in particular.
The Group has used net cash of £3.5m in the year, 
which includes £1.9m spent on acquisitions net 
of cash acquired, and £4.4m of acquisition-related 
payments. Working capital management remains a 
key focus for the Group.

Scope 1 emissions vary based on project mix. We 
encourage improvements to reduce underlying emissions 
and improve effective use of resources on projects. Our 
emissions per employee decreased this year, partly as 
a result of the reduction in CO 2 e tonnes per kWh in UK 
electricity generation. This is due to a reduction in the UK’s 
dependency on coal, together with a growing proportion 
of the UK’s electricity being generated from renewable 
sources.

  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   15 Performance
Ricardo’s Technical Consulting activity 
accounts for around 80% of Group 
revenue and underlying operating profit 
primarily in the Automotive, Rail and 
Environmental consulting markets. We 
provide innovation-focused services 
in engineering, technical and strategic 
consulting, together with independent 
safety assurance services to private 
and public sector customers in the rail 
industry.
As set out in Note 2 to the financial 
statements, revenue has grown by 5% to 
£280.5m (2016: £267 .9m) and underlying 
operating profit increased by 1% to 
£32.8m (2016: £32.5m), impacted by 
the underperformance of our US and 
European Automotive businesses, as 
noted in the Financial Review on pages 
26 to 29. The underlying operating profit 
margin decreased to 1 1.7% (2016: 12.1%) 
due to a disrupted flow of orders which 
led to operational inefficiency. Order 
intake in the year stood at £288m  
(2016: £258m) and there has been a good 
balance of order intake within Technical 
Consulting across all core regions and 
with good levels of diversification across 
different market sectors. Highlights can 
be found on pages 18 to 21.
Growth in our Technical Consulting 
business continues to be underpinned 
by the following global trends:
• The reduction of carbon dioxide 
emissions, supported by agreements 
reached at COP21 and COP22, and 
the elimination of the release of 
noxious pollutants and particulates;
• Improvements in the efficient use of 
energy and increasing diversification 
of the global energy mix;
• The rise of global connectivity, the 
increase of connected devices in the 
commercial and industrial sectors 
and their safety case;
• Electrification and automation of 
vehicles and transport systems; and
• Increasing levels of urbanisation and 
resource scarcity.
This year the Automotive business has 
had mixed performances. 
The Automotive EMEA
(1)
 Division, 
which includes Ricardo’s Automotive 
businesses across Europe and certain 
regions of Asia, including India, Japan 
and South Korea, remains the largest 
business in terms of profit generation. 
The division secured a range of 
large, multi-year programmes in 
the Automotive and Off-Highway & 
Commercial Vehicles sectors and across 
many regions during the year. We are 
particularly pleased that over 15% of the 
order intake in the year within Technical 
Consulting was in connection with 
vehicle electrification programmes (17% 
for the total Group). Although activity 
has remained at a good level across all 
T echnical Consulting
(1) Formerly the European Technical Consulting 
(‘EUTC’) Division
 
16   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 engineering disciplines, with increasing 
demand for powertrain application, 
calibration, electrical and electronics 
skills, many of our customers did delay or 
put programmes on hold because of the 
uncertainty following the UK referendum 
vote to leave the European Union, 
together with the US election.
Trading in the Automotive US business 
was challenging, where solid levels 
of activity in the Commercial Vehicles 
business, driven by new legislation 
requiring in-use compliance testing, did 
not compensate for the reduced levels 
of work we saw primarily in the Detroit 
region. This was due to the Detroit 
automakers consolidating to fewer 
powertrain platforms whilst at the same 
time increasing in-house test facilities 
and resources. We believe that longer 
term growth opportunities exist in the 
Commercial Vehicles business, especially 
around platooning technologies, and 
in autonomous vehicle and connected 
car technologies and their safety cases. 
Our expertise in these areas provides a 
solid foundation for the future success of 
Ricardo’s US business and we continue 
to develop our presence in Silicon Valley 
to service the new automotive clients in 
California.
China remains a key market for the 
Technical Consulting business and this 
year we secured a number of contracts 
in the Automotive sector, some of which 
are being delivered locally through our 
technical centres in Shanghai and Beijing. 
These contracts have included a mixture 
of work for hybrid vehicles, engines and 
transmissions. 
In the motorcycle and urban 
mobility business, through two recent 
acquisitions, Ricardo Motorcycle has 
created a unique complete motorcycle 
engineering offering. Our projects in this 
area encompass styling and concept 
development, through to detailed 
design, engineering, prototype testing 
and industrialisation.
We have completed the integration of 
the Rail business into Ricardo and Ricardo 
Rail has closed the financial year with its 
highest ever order book. The business 
is well positioned to take advantage 
of positive trends within the global rail 
market, where we continue to see solid 
growth.
Ricardo Energy & Environment 
has continued to grow its base of 
international and private sector clients. 
Our air quality team has delivered 
innovative projects, such as the 
implementation of new technology to 
monitor driving emissions at the roadside, 
both in the UK and internationally, and we 
have expanded the offer of our services 
to a number of infrastructure businesses 
outside the water and energy practice 
areas.
In the Defence sector, Ricardo Defense 
Systems has won a number of new 
contracts primarily in land defence, 
including further contracts to develop 
safety of the US Army’s iconic High 
Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle 
(‘HMMWV’). 
Ricardo’s Strategic Consulting business 
continues to operate well across all 
geographies. Our teams’ multi-industry 
knowledge, deep technical expertise 
and management consulting skills offer 
a unique proposition to customers in the 
sectors that we serve.
Business model
We provide engineering, technical and 
environmental consulting services, 
together with accreditation and 
independent assurance services to the 
rail industry. Our services are typically 
delivered on a fixed-price basis for a 
scope of work which is specific to our 
clients’ needs; our projects have defined 
deliverables and range in length from 
projects which last a few weeks or 
months to programmes that extend over 
several years.
Management of projects, resources 
and customers are key skills to enable 
efficient delivery of our services. Our 
capabilities are based on the application 
of intellectual property, know-how and 
knowledge developed through our 
investment in research and development 
(‘R&D’) and our participation in 
collaborative R&D programmes in several 
industries and geographies, as well 
as on the expertise of our staff. These 
capabilities are complemented by a wide 
range of design, test and development 
tools and equipment. 
People are at the heart of Ricardo’s 
Technical Consulting business and 
we have a balance of experienced 
professional engineers, scientists and

the technical centres are deployed on 
projects across the globe using common 
engineering processes. 
Our Energy & Environment consulting 
services are delivered mainly from the UK 
but the business is making increasing use 
of Ricardo’s global network in support of 
its growth objectives. Ricardo’s Rail and 
Strategic Consulting businesses have 
global teams operating from a number 
of different locations. 
Market sector highlights 
Automotive 
The Automotive sector remains the most 
significant for Ricardo. 
CO 2 reduction is a top global priority 
for this sector and is being driven 
strongly by consumers. Additionally, 
the increased focus on air quality 
and, in particular, NO 2 emissions, is 
resulting in demand for all aspects 
of vehicle electrification, from mild 
hybrids to full battery electric vehicles 
(‘EVs’). Projections suggest that 30% of 
all new passenger cars will have electric 
powertrains (including hybrids and EVs) by 
2025.
We have secured a range of 
programmes in vehicle systems, hybrid 
and electric systems, advanced driveline, 
and in the core powertrain areas of our 
business, focused on both new and 
existing product upgrades.
We have developed R-Intelect (‘Integrated 
Electrification’); an integrated approach 
to electrified vehicle development 
which combines a focus upon functional 
systems engineering, together with the 
application of an integrated model-
based development toolset. We continue 
to invest in advanced combustion 
and transmission solutions and other 
key technologies in areas related to 
improvements in overall vehicle efficiency 
such as lightweighting, intelligent driveline 
and vehicle electrification.

T echnical Consulting The future of mobility solutions, 
including connected and autonomous 
vehicle technology in particular, 
is attracting significant interest 
in North America, along with the 
associated challenges of the regulatory 
environment, safety, assurance and 
cyber security of autonomous vehicles. 
Interest in hybrid and electric vehicle 
architectures, battery pack and battery 
management system design and vehicle 
attribute development also feature 
strongly as OEMs increasingly look to 
accelerate the launch of Plug-in Hybrid 
Electric Vehicles (‘PHEVs’) and Battery 
Electric Vehicles (‘BEVs’) based on existing 
vehicle platforms and also, increasingly, 
dedicated hybrid powertrains.
With the Ricardo Motorcycle business, 
we now have the capability to deliver for 
our customers the full development of 
motorcycles, scooters and urban mobility 
vehicles, including their powertrains.
We see growth in this market driven 
by tightening emissions legislation, 
along with consumer demand for higher 
capacity motorcycles in developing 
markets.
Rail
Ricardo Rail delivered a strong 
performance throughout the year and 
reported a record year-end order book. 
The business is also well positioned 
to take advantage of positive trends 
within the global rail market, namely 
high levels of new-build activity and 
the opening up of a once notoriously 
parochial sector, both of which are 
leading to the development of an 
increasingly globalised supply chain. This 
is particularly notable in our relationships 
with major international rolling stock 
manufacturers such as Hitachi Rail and 
CRRC, where our established presence 
in their domestic markets has led to our 
involvement supporting the introduction 
of their vehicles into the European, North 
American and Australasian markets.
This year we set up a rail product 
development team to exploit 
opportunities for new technologies 
within the sector, particularly in the 
area of asset optimisation. For example, 
Ricardo Rail’s pantograph condition 
monitoring system, PanMon, which 
has recently been approved for use 
across the UK main line. The Belgian 
state railway operator, InfraBel, is also 
currently trialling the system, with a view 
to an eventual certification for its own 
network. See case study on pages 60  
to 63.
Ricardo Certification 
Since achieving accreditation and to the 
date of this report, Ricardo Certification 
has issued:
• Over 30 Safety Assessment Reports 
as an Assessment Body under 
the EU Common Safety Method 
Risk Assessment and Evaluation 
Regulations, principally from the UK, 
Netherlands, Denmark and Spain;

  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   19
T echnical Consulting • Over 80 certificates as a Notified 
Body or Designated Body under 
national regulations that satisfy the 
requirements of the EU Interoperability 
Directive, principally from the UK, 
Netherlands, Denmark and Spain;
• Over 50 Accredited Independent 
Safety Assessment (‘ISA’) reports, 
principally from Spain and China; and
• Over 50 Railway Product Certifications, 
all from China.
Furthermore, an extension to the scope 
of accreditation has been granted for the 
delivery of Assessment Body services for 
On-track Plant and Engineering Change 
of Rail Vehicles according to RIS1710 and 
RIS2700, respectively.
Energy & Environment 
Ricardo Energy & Environment has 
continued to deliver leading work in 
global climate change, supporting 
governments across the world, including 
Rwanda, India, Nigeria and Thailand, with 
the development and implementation 
of their climate commitments. For 
example, in Nigeria, Ricardo Energy & 
Environment has advised the Federal 
Ministry of Environment on how to 
take forward its Nationally Determined 
Contribution (‘NDC’) climate action 
plan under the Paris Agreement, and 
the team of national and international 
experts has supported the development 
of sectoral action for the power, 
transport, agricultural and oil and gas 
industries.
We have also seen high demand for 
our services in the area of air quality, in 
which Ricardo Energy & Environment has 
demonstrated its innovation capabilities. 
This is highlighted in the unique 
approach established for the collection 
of marine emission data on a national 
scale and the implementation of new 
technology in monitoring real-world 
driving emissions at the roadside.
The extensive breadth and depth 
of expertise within our energy and 
water practices has contributed to 
increased private sector sales, helping 
to bring these into balance with the 
traditional public sector portfolio. 
Demand has also increased for cross-
discipline environmental services from 
infrastructure-focused customers 
beyond water and energy, such as 
airports. We believe this trend will 
continue, driven by requirements for 
compliance with global regulations and 
more sustainable business growth.
In the renewable energy business our 
strategic consulting team is delivering 
another substantial programme to 
improve manufacturing output, 
efficiency and quality for a world-leading 
wind turbine manufacturer. 
Off-Highway & Commercial 
Vehicles 
We have seen growth and secured a 
number of large engine and transmission 
projects across the medium- and heavy-
duty sectors. We continue to see interest 
across Asia, in particular, for Ricardo’s 
capabilities in the Commercial Vehicles 
business. The order pipeline is based 
around a broad mix of largely engine and 
transmission opportunities. In the US, 
greenhouse gas and low NOx standards 
are driving interest in powertrain and 
trailer efficiency, emissions control and 
the use of alternative fuels. Commercial 
vehicle platooning is also a fast-growing 
area of opportunity. A Ricardo-run climate change commitments workshop for Rwanda’s Government ministries 
Emelia Holdaway (centre), International Climate Change Policy Manager for Ricardo Energy & Environment, 
joins the expert panel on the role of adaptation planning at COP22 in Marrakech
20   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
T echnical Consulting Strong engagement in this sector 
has driven increased engine test 
activity – especially in North America, 
where new regulations requiring in-use 
compliance are now creating significant 
demand for powertrain testing and 
analysis. We have also seen growing 
interest in our fuel cell capabilities 
at our technical facility in California. 
We have focused on developing our 
product offering in the areas of ultra-low 
emissions, fuel economy improvement, 
system optimisation, platooning and 
hybridisation: we see all these as areas of 
significant future growth.
In the Off-Highway business, activity 
remains at a relatively low level in Europe 
following the recent implementation of 
Stage IV emissions standards, while in 
Asia the industry is showing renewed 
growth, especially in the transmission 
and driveline area; Ricardo is securing 
an increasing number of projects, 
including large multi-year programmes. 
Our focus in the coming years will be on 
assisting clients to meet EU, US and Asian 
emissions regulations and 2020 emissions 
targets, together with the introduction 
of new technologies for efficiency 
improvements.
We see increasing demand for high-
speed diesel generator sets and main 
propulsion systems for marine vessels, 
and for the conversion of engines for 
gas or dual fuel operation. The majority 
of our activities in this industry have 
been based around failure analysis, 
investigations, specialist design and 
development.
Defence
In the US, the Ricardo Defense Systems 
business has won a number of new 
contracts, mainly in the land domain, and 
is focused on growth into new areas of 
the US defence market.
In the UK, we have grown our marine 
defence business, both surface and 
sub-surface. In Europe and Asia we 
have secured contracts to deliver new 
engine and transmission designs for land 
vehicles and are pursuing other large 
opportunities.
Outlook 
We end the financial year with a 
good order book across all regions 
and sectors. This gives us confidence 
in future revenue and profit growth 
as we continue to seek diversified 
opportunities in our three core growth 
areas of Transport & Security, Energy, 
and Scarce Resources & Waste, whilst 
exploiting the breadth of our skill set and 
global footprint.
Toyota’s ‘Project Portal’ is designing a heavy-
duty hydrogen fuel cell system for class 8 truck

T echnical Consulting Performance
The Performance Products business 
accounts for around 20% of Group 
revenue, with a large proportion of that 
revenue generated through the supply 
of products and services to a single 
customer.
As set out in Note 2 to the financial 
statements, revenue increased by 1 1% 
to £71.6m (2016: £64.5m) and underlying 
operating profit increased by 13% to 
£8.0m (2016: £7 .1m). Operating profit 
margins were also up slightly to 1 1.2% 
(2016: 1 1.0%). Profit performance was 
higher than the prior year, primarily due 
to increased volumes in respect of the 
engine supply contract for McLaren and 
the start of production of transmissions 
for the Bugatti Chiron. Order intake in 
the year stood at £78m (2016: £103m), 
which was lower than last year when we 
secured a multi-year transmission supply 
contract.
The Performance Products business 
continues to focus on the development 
of long-term strategic relationships 
with customers, and the consistent 
achievement of high product quality and 
on-time delivery to win new and large 
contracts.

Consulting side of our business, by our 
motorsport products design team within 
Performance Products, or by our clients. 
We manage the complete supply chain 
and earn revenue either for the products 
that we supply or for the manufacturing 
or assembly services that we provide.
Our productive resources are centred 
on a highly flexible transmissions 
manufacturing facility at our Midlands 
Technical Centre and an engine assembly 
facility based at our Shoreham Technical 
Centre. To service our clients we also 
have a global support network with 
technical and engineering centres in the 
US, UK, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Czech 
Republic and China. 
The products and services that we 
supply are critical for our customers. The 
key skills to deliver these products and 
services include: product design and 
development, production and operations 
management, supply chain management 
and customer management. Ricardo’s 
manufacturing know-how and ability 
to manage low-volume production and 
assembly complements and adds value 
to our customers’ in-house capabilities 
and also gives us an advantage over our 
competitors. High customer satisfaction 
means that our programmes can extend 
over many years and several of our larger 
programmes include agreements for the 
supply of spare parts and other support 
services.
The Performance Products business 
also includes the activities of the Ricardo 
Software Division, which develops 
and commercialises a wide range of 
computer-aided engineering (‘CAE’) 
software products for virtual engineering 
in the automotive, water and renewable 
energy industries. Ricardo’s CAE products 
are licensed and supported globally by 
staff in Europe, North America and Asia, 
and in select regions via channel partners. 
We have also established partnerships 
with companies like Modelon to bring 
new software products to market.
Market sector highlights  
High-Performance Vehicles & 
Motorsport
The new expanded engine assembly 
facility is now fully operational, doubling 
capacity and generating the capability to 
deal with an increased number of engine 
variants. Production of engines for the 
McLaren 540C, 570S, 570GT, 675LT and 
the McLaren P1™ GTR hypercar continued 
during the year in line with expectations, 
and full production of engines for the 
new 720S has been added. We also 
secured the transmission supply contract 
for the Aston Martin Red Bull Valkyrie 
hypercar, whilst continuing to support 
Bugatti with supply of the complete 
driveline system for the Chiron.
Ricardo remains a key supplier to 
the motorsport sector. Ricardo is now 
supporting a key manufacturer within 
the Formula E Championship with a 
collaboratively designed and tested 
product. We continue to manufacture for 
Formula One, and we supply products such 
as the Ricardo-designed transmissions 
for BMW and Multimatic (for Ford) GT3 
programmes, the M-Sport World Rally 
Championship Ford Fiesta, the Hyundai 
R5 Rally programme, the Japanese Super 
Formula Championship, Indy Lights and 
the World Series Formula V8 3.5. 
Defence
Ricardo continues to supply spare parts 
to the UK Ministry of Defence (‘MOD’) 
to support the Cougar and Weapons 
Mount Installation Kit (‘WMIK’) vehicle 
fleets. Ricardo Defense Systems and 
Lightweight Innovations For Tomorrow 
(‘LIFT’), a Manufacturing USA institute, 
are working together to identify and 
deploy a new, robust and reliable 
solution to documented braking and 
stability problems in the current High 
Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle 
(‘HMMWV’) configuration.
Outlook
We have a significant pipeline of 
new opportunities, which gives us 
confidence in the continued growth 
of the Performance Products business 
– and which further demonstrates the 
value that our advanced production and 
manufacturing techniques can deliver to 
customers operating in a range of market 
sectors and geographies.

  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   23 As global specialists in Transport & 
Security, Energy, and Scarce Resources 
& Waste, Ricardo has an extensive R&D 
portfolio. The portfolio covers a variety 
of surface transportation sectors, such as 
Automotive, Commercial Vehicles, High-
Performance Vehicles & Motorsport and 
Rail, and our research is well aligned with 
our customers’ future needs.
R&D projects include developing next-
generation components for electrified 
vehicles, including electric motors and 
inverters, and delivering a framework 
for automotive cyber security through 
assurance. This project will address the 
increased threat from cyber attacks 
with the proliferation of connected 
and automated road vehicles, with the 
objective of developing a 5-star type 
consumer rating framework analogous to 
existing Euro NCAP safety ratings.
The key technical achievements 
delivered this year are:
• Completing a full demo vehicle for the 
ADEPT 48V diesel hybrid passenger 
car technology demonstration project. 
The current cost analysis shows an 
on-cost of €60 per g/km CO 2, which 
is better than current full hybrid 
solutions; 
• Designing the next-generation small 
electric motor (‘e-motor’) with a very 
high output, which is aligned with our 
electric powertrain strategy. The next-
generation electric motor strategies 
and requirements are under 
development with a European OEM 
research consortium. Ricardo has been 
challenged to develop an electric 
motor with approximately 50% 
increased peak power density 
compared to first generation products. 
The design is an electric motor sized at

demonstrates Ricardo’s lightweighting 
expertise for tackling future driveline 
challenges including the integration of 
e-machines;
• Concluding the initial testing for 
the CryoPower programme, which 
demonstrated the potential for 
circa 60% brake thermal efficiencies 
for heavy-duty and large engine 
applications; this technology injects a 
cryogen to decarbonise heavy-duty 
power;
• Progressing the next-generation 
direct injection gasoline engine 
programme. Test results demonstrate 
fuel consumption benefits in the range 
of 12-16%. The on-cost of less than €20 
per g/km CO 2 is competitive with other 
technologies; and 
• Generating real-time data using the 
SensorLife™ condition monitoring 
system, analysing wind turbine 
drivetrain health on installed 
demonstration units of Ricardo’s 
MultiLife™ bearing system. The real-
time data is validating a predicted 
500% improvement in bearing life. 
The demonstration unit is a 600 kW 
active wind turbine operated by 
ScottishPower.
Active improvement projects
Ricardo continually invests in its own 
techniques and processes to ensure that 
Ricardo’s engineering capabilities are 
relevant and customer-focused. We invest 
in collaborative projects funded through 
European and UK technology boards. Key 
projects this year include:
• Automotive Cyber Security through 
Assurance project (‘5*StarS’): the 
project will address the increased threat 
from cyber attacks with the proliferation 
of connected and autonomous road 
vehicles;
• Lean Gasoline Emissions 
Aftertreatment (‘LEAN-G’): identifying 
the next possible lean gasoline vehicle 
aftertreatment solutions based on the 
latest emissions legislation from Europe 
and the US via a V-SIM model based 
simulation;
• Validating Intelligently Through 
Accelerated Life (‘VITAL ’): a project 
that aims to develop a software toolset 
that can quickly produce efficient 
design validation plans to meet 
increased reliability expectations from 
customers; and
• Diesel Engine NOx Aftertreatment 
(‘ULTRA LOW NOx’): aims to develop 
a base engine methodology to 
achieve a 90% reduction in tailpipe 
nitrogen oxides (‘NOx’) compared 
to current legislation for on-highway 
trucks.
We continue to build our academic links 
through university collaboration in order 
to extend our capability to develop 
customer-centric solutions. Ricardo and 
the University of Sheffield’s Advanced 
Manufacturing Research Centre (‘AMRC’) 
have entered into a Memorandum of 
Understanding targeting powertrain 
electrification projects. Target areas are 
advanced manufacturing projects for

Research and Development GROUP RESULTS
The Group has delivered an underlying 
operating result which is in line with 
expectations for the year ended 30 June 
2017 . Total Group revenues increased to 
£352.1m, representing a 6% increase on 
the prior year (2016: £332.4m). Underlying 
profit before tax, which excludes specific 
adjusting items as set out in more detail 
in Note 4 to the financial statements, 
increased by 2% to £38.3m (2016: £37 .7m), 
with the margin reducing slightly to 
10.9% from 1 1.3% in the prior year. Using 
exchange rates consistent with the prior 
year, revenue and underlying profit 
before tax would have been £336.9m 
and £38.2m, respectively, both of which 
represent growth of 1% on the prior year. 
This growth in underlying profit before 
tax includes an additional £0.1m from the 
performance of acquisitions on a like-for-
like basis with the prior year. 
The financial year ended with another 
record closing order book of £248m 
(2016: £231m), which is a 7% increase on 
the prior year. Our order book comprises 
the value of all unworked purchase 
orders received. The closing order book, 
together with a very good pipeline 
of further opportunities, continues to 
represent a diversified spread of orders 
across market sectors, customers and 
geographies. 
Reported profit before tax for the  
year decreased by 2% to £32.2m  
(2016: £33.0m). The decrease is primarily

Financial review
During the financial year the Group has navigated its way through an unsettled 
political climate and a period of substantial change in the marketplace. The 
diversification of the Group across multiple sectors and geographies has enabled 
it to meet these challenges and deliver a set of results with marginal growth 
in underlying profit. We start the next financial year with another record order 
book that has grown organically by 7% to £248m and we look forward to the 
opportunities in the year ahead.

(2016: £Nil). In the prior year, non-recurring income of £1.5m for claims under the Research & Development 
Expenditure Credit (‘RDEC’) scheme was also included.

as a result of a £0.6m increase in the 
amortisation charge on acquired 
intangible assets, reorganisation costs 
of £0.4m and a £0.7m increase in 
net interest payable on borrowings, 
together with a net reduction in income 
from claims under the Research & 
Development Expenditure Credit (‘RDEC’) 
scheme of £0.3m. This movement is 
partially offset by a £1.1m decrease in 
net acquisition-related expenditure 
and £0.1m of profit generated from 
acquisitions on a like-for-like basis with 
the prior year.
The Group results include the 
acquisition completed during the year 
of Motorcycle Engineering Italia s.r.l., 
which was formed from the operating 
assets and employees of Exnovo s.r.l., a 
vehicle design house which creates class-
leading aesthetics for global motorcycle 
and scooter brands. This business 
was subsequently renamed Ricardo 
Motorcycle Italia s.r.l. The performance of 
the acquired entity has been reported in 
the Technical Consulting segment (see 
Note 12 to the financial statements on 
page 135).
SEGMENTAL RESULTS
The segmental results for the Group’s 
operating segments are set out above.
Technical Consulting results
Segmental operating results for Technical 
Consulting are discussed on pages 
16 to 17 . Technical Consulting had 
revenues and underlying operating 
profits of £280.5m (2016: £267 .9m) and 
£32.8m (2016: £32.5m), respectively, with 
marginal growth in profit on the prior 
year. 
Our businesses in the Automotive and 
Commercial Vehicles sectors in Europe 
experienced a disrupted flow of orders 
in the year as customers evaluated their 
product plans in light of the unsettled 
political climate and change within the 
industry. This was particularly evident in 
the first half of the year. In the second 
half, we saw order flow return to normal 
patterns with orders at the end of the 
financial year being slightly ahead of 
the prior year. This led to a less efficient 
business operation during the year, 
impacting margins during the period of 
disrupted order flow. With a good order 
book at the end of the year the business 
is in a good position to grow.
Elsewhere in the Automotive and 
Commercial Vehicles sectors, the business 
in Asia has become a more profitable 
operation than it was in the prior year 
and continues to make good progress. 
However, the market in Detroit remains 
challenging and our US business ended 
the year with a loss. Order intake has 
been below historical levels in recent 
years and we are taking steps to 
reposition the business and enhance our 
electrification and autonomous service 
offering. 
The Rail business is now completely 
integrated with the rest of the Group 
and has performed well, with strong 
order intake in the year from a wide 
geographical spread of customers. Rail’s 
revenue and operating profit reported in 
the year also benefited from favourable 
foreign exchange translation.
The Energy & Environment business 
also had a good year, with good levels 
of growth in revenue and profitability 
across its practice areas. The business has 
extended its order book heading into the 
new financial year by winning a number 
of multi-year orders for UK Government 
programmes, whilst also continuing to 
broaden its customer base in the private 
sector.
Performance Products results
Segmental operating results for 
Performance Products are discussed on 
page 22. Performance Products had a 
strong year, as revenues increased on  
the prior year by 1 1% to £71.6m  
(2016: £64.5m) and underlying operating 
profits increased on the prior year by 
13% to £8.0m (2016: £7 .1m). The current 
year performance was driven principally 
by increased volumes of engines in 
respect of the contract for McLaren, 
together with increased transmissions 
for both Bugatti and Porsche. This has 
been partially offset by lower application 
engineering work than the prior year 
within the Software business.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) and International 
Financial Reporting Standards 
Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC’) 
interpretations adopted by the European 
Union (‘EU’) and the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS. The Group’s principal accounting 
policies are detailed in Note 1 to the 
financial statements on pages 122 to 
127 . Those accounting policies that have 
been identified as being particularly 
sensitive to complex or subjective 
judgements or estimates are disclosed in 
Note 1(c) to the financial statements on 
pages 122 and 123.
We have also commenced work to 
assess the potential impact of IFRS 15 
‘Revenue from contracts with customers’, 
which becomes applicable to the Group 
for the year ending 30 June 2019. Whilst 
a more detailed exercise has yet to be 
performed, our current expectations 
arising from an initial assessment of the 
new standard, as set out in Note 1(x) 
to the financial statements, is that the 
impact on revenue recognition is unlikely 
to be material.

Acquisitions and acquisition-
related intangible assets
As set out in more detail in Note 12 to 
the financial statements, the Group 
acquired the entire issued share capital 
of Motorcycle Engineering Italia s.r.l. on 
29 July 2016, a business that was formed 
from the operating assets and employees 
of Exnovo s.r.l., for consideration of £1.9m 
(€2.2m).
This investment added goodwill 
of £3.2m to the Ricardo Motorcycle 
cash-generating unit which, as set 
out in more detail in Note 13 to the 
financial statements, has subsequently 
been reallocated as a result of the 
integration of the Motorcycle business 
into Automotive EMEA (formerly Europe 
Technical Consulting). Acquisition-
related intangible assets have also been 
identified, with a net book value at year-
end of £0.2m. 
An exercise to assess the fair value 
of the identifiable net assets as a result 
of this acquisition has been completed 
during the year. In addition, the 
preliminary assessment made in the 
prior year of the provisional fair value of 
identifiable net assets in respect of the 
Chinese joint venture operation acquired 
from the Lloyd’s Register Group on  
1 March 2016 has been finalised during 
the year, which added £0.2m of goodwill 
to the Ricardo Rail cash-generating 
unit. Total goodwill at 30 June 2017 is 
£62.0m (2016: £57 .0m), which includes 
retranslation of goodwill denominated in 
foreign currencies of £1.6m.
Amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangible assets has increased to £4.0m 
(2016: £3.4m), charged primarily on the 
intangible assets from the Rail acquisition, 
which are predominantly denominated 
in Euros. The Group also incurred net 
acquisition-related expenditure of £1.7m 
(2016: £2.8m) during the year, £0.8m of 
which was in respect of the acquisition 
completed in the year. The acquisition-
related expenditure and amortisation 
of acquisition-related intangible assets 
have been charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement as specific adjusting 
items. Further detail is disclosed in Note 4 
to the financial statements on page 130.
After the reporting date, the Group 
also acquired the entire issued share 
capital of Control Point Corporation on  
8 September 2017 , for initial consideration 
of £5.3m ($7 .0m), rising to £7 .8m ($10.2m) 
subject to post-acquisition performance 
and retention of specific individuals. The 
provisional assessment of identifiable 
net assets acquired is £3.3m ($4.3m), 
together with provisional goodwill and 
other acquisition-related intangible assets 
of £2.0m ($2.7m). Given the proximity of 
the acquisition to the date of approval of 
the financial statements, a preliminary fair 
value exercise has yet to be performed. 
This is disclosed in Note 39 to the financial 
statements on page 157 .
Research and Development
The Group continues to invest in Research 
and Development (‘R&D’), and spent 
£9.5m (2016: £9.4m) before government 
grant income of £2.4m (2016: £1.3m). This 
includes costs capitalised in accordance 
with IFRS of £3.1m (2016: £3.2m) in respect 
of continued development expenditure 
on a range of product developments 
around the Group and reflects our 
continued focus on development activity 
within Europe and the US. An overview 
of current R&D activities is presented on 
pages 24 and 25.
The total Research and Development 
Expenditure Credit (‘RDEC’) recognised 
in the current year is £6.6m (2016: £6.9m). 
This is comprised of an estimated RDEC 
credit in respect of the current year of 
£5.2m (2016: £5.4m), together with £1.4m 
arising from the routine amendment of 
open applications as a result of further 
analysis of the qualifying expenditure 
incurred. In the prior year, an additional 
non-recurring credit of £1.5m was 
recognised within specific adjusting items 
for claims made on transition to the new 
regime in respect of the open periods 
between the substantive enactment of 
the RDEC scheme by the UK Government 
and its subsequent adoption by the 
Group.
Net finance costs
Finance income was £0.2m (2016: £0.3m), 
which is similar to the prior year, and 
finance costs were £2.7m (2016: £2.2m), 
giving net finance costs of £2.5m  
(2016: £1.9m). Finance costs were higher 
as a result of interest payments on the 
Group’s loan facilities drawn throughout the 
year, partially offset by a slightly favourable 
shift in respect of the interest charge on the 
defined benefit pension scheme.
Taxation
The total tax charge for the year was £7 .4m 
(2016: £7 .4m), with the total effective rate of 
tax being 23.0% (2016: 22.4%).
Regarding the Group’s deferred tax assets 
of £14.3m (2016: £13.0m), the Directors have 
considered the recoverability of the net 
deferred tax assets of £2.4m (2016: £3.6m) 
and £5.9m (2016: £4.9m) which primarily 
relate to the expected utilisation of historic 
losses in Germany and R&D tax credits in 
the US, respectively.
In Germany, £1.5m of the deferred tax 
asset relating to historic losses has been 
derecognised to ensure that the expected 
period of utilisation remains reasonable. 
Consistent with the prior year, a deferred 
tax asset has not been recognised for 
the current year tax losses within the 
consolidated tax group controlled by 
Ricardo GmbH, within which Ricardo 
Deutschland GmbH is the primary trading 
entity.
The Directors remain satisfied that it is 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will 
be generated in the foreseeable future, 
against which the recognised assets can be 
utilised.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share decreased by 
4% to 46.8p (2016: 48.6p). The Directors 
consider that an underlying earnings per 
share provides a more useful indication of 
underlying performance and trends over 
time. Underlying basic earnings per share 
for the year increased by 1% to 55.7p  
(2016: 55.2p).
Basic earnings per share, with a 
reconciliation to an underlying basic 
earnings per share, which excludes the 
net-of-tax impact of specific adjusting 
items, is disclosed in Note 10 to the financial 
statements on page 134.
Dividend
The total (paid and proposed) dividend for 
the year has increased by 7% to 19.3p per 
ordinary share (2016: 18.1p) and amounts 
to £10.3m (2016: £9.5m). The proposed 
final dividend of 13.88p (2016: 13.03p) 
 
28   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Financial review
will be paid on 17 November 2017 to 
shareholders who are on the register of 
members at the close of business on  
27 October 2017 , subject to approval at 
the Annual General Meeting on  
8 November 2017 .
Capital investment
Cash expenditure on property, plant and 
equipment was £6.3m (2016: £8.5m) as 
we continue to invest in our business 
operations. This expenditure included 
new and upgraded test cell equipment 
and IT hardware, together with continued 
spend to finalise the construction of 
the Centenary Innovation Centre at our 
Shoreham Technical Centre in the UK.
During the year we commenced a 
process to market the test cell facilities 
and related equipment situated at the 
Group’s Chicago Technical Centre for sale, 
as described in Note 19 to the financial 
statements on page 140. We continue 
to review the management and usage 
of our other test facilities outside the 
UK, in light of changes in the market 
and our desire to increase operational 
effectiveness.
In addition, having been approached 
by the landlord of leased premises at our 
Midlands Technical Centre, an agreement 
was reached to sell and lease back a 
property which had been built on the 
site, together with an extension in the 
term of the overall lease. The profit on 
disposal arising from this transaction was 
£0.7m, the details of which are described 
in Note 15 to the financial statements on 
page 139.
Net debt
Closing net debt was £37 .9m  
(2016: £34.4m). The Group had a net cash 
outflow of £3.5m (2016: £48.7m), after 
£1.9m (2016: £45.4m) of consideration 
paid in respect of acquisitions net of 
cash acquired, and £4.4m (2016: £3.4m) 
of acquisition-related payments. The 
composition of net debt is defined in 
Note 34 to the financial statements on 
page 153.
The Group continues to focus on its 
management of working capital, which 
increased during the year primarily within 
our Automotive EMEA and Energy & 
Environment businesses. This was as a 
result of a number of factors, including 
revenue growth, an increasing mix of 
customers in the Middle East and Asia 
where payment terms have been longer, 
together with the phasing of revenue 
towards the fourth quarter as a result 
of a disrupted flow of orders. We also 
continued to invest in our major long-
term assembly programme.
Banking facilities
At the end of the financial year, the  
Group held total facilities of £91.1m  
(2016: £90.9m), which included 
committed facilities of £75.0m  
(2016: £75.0m). Of the committed 
facilities, a £35.0m facility is available until 
September 2019 and £40.0m is available 
until April 2020. In addition, the Group 
has uncommitted facilities including 
overdrafts of £16.1m (2016: £15.9m), which 
mature throughout the next financial 
year and are renewable annually.
Committed facilities of £59.7m  
(2016: £54.5m) net of direct issue 
costs were drawn primarily to fund 
acquisitions. These are denominated in 
Pounds Sterling and have variable rates 
of interest dependent upon the Group’s 
adjusted leverage, which range from 1.6% 
to 2.35% above LIBOR and are repayable 
in the year ending 30 June 2020.
Foreign exchange
On consolidation, income and expense 
items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the year. The Group 
is exposed to movements in the Pound 
Sterling exchange rate, principally from 
work carried out with customers that 
transact in Euros, US Dollars and Chinese 
Renminbi. The average value of Pound 
Sterling was significantly lower against 
the Euro (13.1%), US Dollar (14.5%) and 
Chinese Renminbi (9.5%) during the year 
compared to the previous financial year. 
This was as a result of the UK referendum 
vote to leave the EU on 23 June 2016, 
which had a favourable impact on 
revenue during the year, but a marginal 
impact on profit.
Had the current year results been 
stated at constant exchange rates, 
revenue would have been £15.2m lower 
and reported profit before tax would 
have been £0.3m higher. The impact 
on reported profit before tax is due to 
the effect of foreign exchange on the 
amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets denominated in foreign currencies. 
Significant resulting exposures are 
hedged through foreign currency 
contracts.
Pensions
The Group’s defined benefit pension 
scheme operates within the UK. 
The accounting deficit measured in 
accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee 
Benefits’ was £22.2m before tax, or £18.1m 
after tax (2016: £21.5m and £17 .5m, 
respectively).
The £0.7m increase in the pre-tax 
pension deficit was primarily due to 
both a reduction in the discount rate 
assumption to 2.6% (2016: 2.95%) and an 
increase in inflation to 3.2% (2016: 2.8%), 
offset by the use of an updated set of 
demographic assumptions and return on 
plan assets of £6.9m, together with £4.3m 
of cash contributions paid to the scheme 
during the financial year.
Ricardo remains committed to paying 
£4.3m each year until January 2021 
to fund the pension deficit. The next 
triennial actuarial valuation, which will 
assess the level of Ricardo’s future annual 
contributions, is currently in progress.

  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   29 Since the celebration of our centenary 
year drew to a close, we have been 
focusing on our vision for the start 
of Ricardo’s second century. As a 
consultancy, services and specialist 
manufacturing business, our people are a 
key factor in that vision – those employed 
with us today, as well as those who will 
form our workforce in the future.
At Ricardo, people are respected 
for their contribution: integrity is 
demonstrated in all that we do. We 
provide exciting work which allows 
innovation and creativity to flourish and 
where our passion is tangible. We are 
conscious that the key to an engaged 
workforce is for everyone to understand 
our vision, strategy and values, together 
with how they can contribute to that 
as individuals. We continue to share 
this information by using a multimedia 
approach with web-based channels, 
films, strategy brochures and face-to face 
information sessions. An increased use of 
social media has opened new channels of 
communications – and not just with the 
younger generation. To further encourage 
our employees to embrace Ricardo’s 
values and give their best possible 
performance for the business, various 
recognition awards are established 
around the Group. 
With our growth strategy in mind, 
recruitment remains one of the key tasks 
of the human resource agenda around 
the globe. We continue to be viewed 
as an employer of choice for top-level 
science and engineering opportunities, 
together with technical and non-technical 
graduate and apprenticeship roles. Our 
recruitment processes and employee 
value proposition are constantly reviewed 
to make sure we not only attract highly 
qualified engineers and scientists, but that 
we are also appealing to a diverse range 
of possible candidates.
True to our vision of an increasingly 
diverse and inclusive culture within 
Ricardo, we have continued to 
concentrate our efforts on promoting 
science and engineering careers for 
women. This includes hiring female 
apprentices, graduates and professionals, 
and reviewing our internal promotion 
processes to exclude any implicit gender 
bias. With a broader sense of social 
responsibility, we have also established 
a mentoring programme for female 
undergraduates and are in our second 
year of sponsoring a prize for the ‘most

improved female undergraduate’, which 
has been extremely well received. The 
prize was awarded to a student from 
Cambridge University for the second time.
Going forward, we will continue on the 
path we have successfully started out on; 
concentrating on focusing our employer 
branding to be more appealing to 
women, a modified on-boarding process 
for female technical staff including a 
mentoring programme and inclusion 
training for managers.
We remain committed to the 
promotion of the Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (‘STEM’) 
agenda in schools, in order to nurture our 
future engineering resources. We have 
also established a programme in the 
UK that engages our own engineering 
graduates in these activities, allowing 
them to take on social responsibility, 
grow their interpersonal skills and share 
their enthusiasm at the same time. Similar 
activities are being undertaken in other 
international locations.
In the UK, commitment to apprentice 
development continues to be strong, 
with most apprentices achieving 
further qualification. Our apprentice 
programme now encompasses a broader 
range of functions across our business, 
including human resources and finance, 
in addition to traditional engineering 
apprenticeships. The Apprenticeship 
Levy, introduced by the UK Government 
with effect from April 201 7 , has given the 
apprenticeship discussion a new push, 
introducing new funding possibilities for 
degree apprenticeships. 
Once hired, we make sure our new 
employees have the best possible on-
boarding experience, with a globally 
standardised induction programme that 
includes a ‘buddy scheme’, structured 
induction plans, interactive online 
material and training, as well as a survey 
at the end of the on-boarding period 
to ensure continuous improvement. 
From the beginning, we encourage our 
employees to actively engage in their 
own career development by stretching 
their wings and seeking opportunities to 
broaden their experiences and deepen 
their knowledge. In addition to any 
formal training, this might be through 
taking part in one of our various internal 
strategic- or improvement-oriented 
projects, working on a customer project 
at a different technical centre or on-site 
at a client organisation, or by going on an 
international assignment. 
There will be significant and interesting 
changes in people, technology and 
society in the future – and with Ricardo’s 
shared vision of contributing to safety 
and sustainability in mobility and energy 
generation while protecting scarce 
resources, our people will have a chance 
to positively contribute to them all.

  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   31 Why it matters to Ricardo 
Ricardo has a proactive and engaged 
approach to corporate responsibility and 
sustainability. The environment is a key 
driver for our strategy and is seen in many 
of our activities, where Delivering Excellence 
Through Innovation & Technology provides 
the central focus for all of our teams. This 
is embedded in what we do and the 
solutions we deliver:
• Developing new combustion systems 
and engineering solutions to meet 
the next steps in vehicle emissions 
regulations;
• Improving vehicle fuel economy and 
energy efficiency through engine 
developments, lightweight vehicle 
structures and transmissions, hybrid 
vehicle systems and electrification, 
renewable energy and rail operating 
efficiency;
• Helping governments and cities address 
climate change, emissions, air quality, 
energy and waste challenges; 
• Providing policy and technical advice 
across the public and private sector to 
improve the environmental, social and 
economic performance of the transport 
sector;
• Improving rail safety through the 
provision of safety audit services, 
innovative safety products (see 
pages 60 to 63) and the activities of 
Ricardo Certification, providing third 
party independent oversight on new 
railways, rolling stock and safety-critical 
technologies; and
• Proving chemical emergency response 
advice to emergency services and 
industry through the National Chemical 
Emergency Centre.
We rely on innovation, talent, skills and 
customer care from our employees, in 
whom we invest and develop for the 
benefit of all our stakeholders. Our values 
and policies are designed to ensure that 
we and our suppliers operate ethically, 
honestly and meet human rights 
obligations.
Ricardo’s employees are engaged as 
active members of the communities 
where most of our larger sites operate, 
with a strong focus on working to promote 
Science, Technology, Engineering and 
Maths (‘STEM’) subjects in schools and 
colleges as this links directly to the next 
generation of engineers and scientists who 
will be the core of our future value chain.
As a responsible employer, we seek 
to protect and care for our employees 
by providing a safe and healthy work 
environment and by minimising the 
environmental impact of our operations.
The environment – a strategic 
driver in action
The environment is at the heart of what 
we do and is embedded in our strategy, 
shown on page 1 1:
• Transport & Security work is driven 
by the worldwide trends in climate 
change, emissions and fuel consumption 
legislation;
• Energy work is similarly driven by the 
need to provide more sustainable 
and efficient solutions in the areas of 
power generation and renewable and 
clean energy; and
• Scarce Resources & Waste teams 
provide solutions to improve air 
quality, reduce environmental risk 
and improve efficiency in the use of 
resources and waste management.
We support all of these areas with 
research and development activities 
to enhance our capabilities. This is 
described on pages 24 and 25.
Environmental thought 
leadership
As an organisation, Ricardo Energy & 
Environment is renowned for providing 
strategic consultancy on a wide range 
of technical environmental issues. As a 
result, we regularly provide key thought 
leadership through a number of different 
routes. These include attending and 
co-chairing the technical working

Environmental benefits
Ricardo delivers many positive 
environmental outcomes which are the 
result of the work we undertake in the 
Technical Consulting businesses. This can 
be categorised as:
• Ricardo-funded and client-funded 
engineering projects where 
technology is developed to provide 
low-emissions and high-efficiency 
technologies for incorporation into 
products in all parts of the world;
• Lower carbon use from the results of 
engineering projects which lead to 
more efficient consumer products 
manufactured by our clients;
• Environmental consulting work which 
is largely undertaken by Ricardo 
Energy & Environment; and
• Operating efficiency work for 
rail operators and rolling stock 
manufacturers undertaken by  
Ricardo Rail.
group meetings of a broad range of 
international bodies and directly advising 
major donor organisations and country 
governments, through to speaking at 
events, running webinars and providing 
practical information on our website. The 
subject matter includes:
• Policy development for international 
governments;
• Guidance and advice on 
environmental issues and legislation 
for national and multi-national 
companies, such as the EU’s Non-
Financial Reporting directive or global 
transportation of dangerous goods 
regulations; and
• Developing practical toolkits and 
guides for international development 
organisations.
This support is aimed at directly helping 
governments and organisations to 
reduce their environmental impact and 
stem the effects of climate change: the 
aim is to position Ricardo as a ‘go-to 
expert’ in the relevant markets.
Since the 2015 Paris Agreement, 
Ricardo has been delivering thought 
leadership to help countries understand 
a best-practice methodology for 
implementing the agreement’s 
commitments. The series of online 
and live events have been attended 
by over 1,500 government officials and 
key stakeholders within international 
donors and development partners. 
Ricardo’s climate change experts, 
in conjunction with the Climate & 
Development Knowledge Network 
(‘CDKN’) have developed a reference 
manual Planning for NDC implementation: 
a quick-start guide that has been used 
by governments around the world to 
support the implementation of their 
climate change commitments.
In addition, Ricardo has developed 
and delivered thought leadership 
to the aviation, marine and heavy 
manufacturing industries, providing 
guidance on the development of 
sustainable business growth and 
regulatory compliance.
Ricardo is currently piloting remote sensing 
measurements around the UK. Our vehicle 
emissions database currently holds 50,000 real-
world driving emission measurements from road 
vehicles and we anticipate that this number will 
exceed 100,000 by the end of 2017

These products and services will have an 
impact on the future levels of emissions, 
waste, energy usage, water consumption 
and noise across the sectors we serve. 
The cumulative benefits of projects we 
complete each year saves many multiples 
of our operational carbon footprint over 
the life of the products we engineer.
The very nature of Ricardo Energy & 
Environment’s consultancy work provides 
a further significant environmental 
benefit: we work with businesses, 
governments and international 
organisations to help find solutions to 
some of the most pressing environmental 
challenges. We have a comprehensive 
environmental consulting capability 
which provides:
• Excellence in thought leadership 
around economic, societal and 
environmental interactions;
• Extensive understanding of the 
climate change, resource scarcity and 
sustainability agendas;
• Deep understanding of policy drivers, 
providing insight and project delivery 
for business and industry; and
• Economic modelling and data 
management to identify and realise 
value for business and industry.
Operational environmental 
impact and greenhouse gas 
emissions
Ricardo is committed to keeping the 
environmental impact of the Group’s 
facilities and activities to a minimum 
as well as ensuring that our services 
have positive impacts on society. The 
Board’s commitment is embodied in 
our environmental policy. It is available 
through our intranet and to the public via 
the website www.ricardo.com. The drivers 
for the policy are:
• Delivering services that enable strategic 
improvements for our clients and the 
end users of their products and services;
• The need for continuous improvement; 
and
• The desire to be responsible members 
of the local communities in which 
Ricardo operates.
The impact of our operations, particularly 
testing and manufacturing, are the largest 
contributors to our operational carbon 
footprint and greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) 
emissions. Our testing for customer and 
research programmes primarily uses 
fuels and electrical energy in addition 
to heating some of our buildings. 
Our manufacturing energy use is 
predominantly power for machine tools 
and assembly facilities and gas used in 
our heat treatment plant. Our Scope 2 
use is all electricity. We do not currently 
measure our Scope 3 emissions.
We comply with the Companies Act 
2006 (Strategic and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013 on GHG Emissions and 
have stated our comparative history in 
our Strategic Performance on page 15. 
As this requires us to include fuels used 
in engine and vehicle testing, variability 
in results year-on-year can be expected 
due to the varied mix in types of test and 
engine size.
Projects to reduce energy 
consumption and manage waste 
responsibly are actively encouraged 
and have become more important 
as unit fuel costs increase and waste 
streams have become more significant 
as the manufacturing activities of our 
Performance Products business have 
grown. 
We focus our operational carbon 
footprint improvements on underlying 
energy efficiency prior to use of fuels for 
testing. We continue to use tonnes of 
carbon dioxide equivalent (‘tCO 2e’) per 
employee as an intensity measure.
This year we also calculated our 
market-based Scope 2 emissions in 
the UK, as well as our location-based 
emissions, which have been reported 
on page 35 using government and 
International Energy Agency (‘IEA’) factors 
in accordance with the GHG protocol’s 
Scope 2 guidance. Our UK operations 
are our biggest consumer of electricity, 
and the supply we procure includes 
some coal and natural gas but over 50% 
is from renewable or zero emissions 
sources. This means that, when using 
the market-based approach, our Scope 
 
34   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Corporate responsibility and sustainability
2 emissions are reduced by around 45%. 
Even though this is the case we still strive 
to continually reduce our underlying 
consumption. 
Other environmental impacts include 
waste streams, which are monitored 
to identify potential improvement 
opportunities and to ensure legislative 
compliance. Higher-risk areas of the 
facilities, such as fuel storage and 
distribution systems, have containment 
and inspection regimes which meet local 
legislative requirements.
Many of Ricardo’s clients require 
certification to the environmental 
management system standard ISO 14001 
for their key suppliers. We are accredited 
to this standard in the majority of our 
locations. The application of the policy 
is defined by appropriate processes and 
procedures as part of the quality system 
in each division. Many of these are 
closely linked to both quality and health 
and safety procedures. 
The suite of certifications and the 
supporting internal and external audit 
programmes are used to check policy 
effectiveness, share best practice, 
identify improvement opportunities 
and ensure compliance. Staff training 
in health and safety and environmental 
matters is a priority and is reviewed 
annually as part of normal appraisal 
processes. 
Governance – corporate 
responsibility
The Board reviews the key elements of 
corporate responsibility on an annual basis. 
To underline the importance of integrity 
in all relationships between employees 
and stakeholders, we have ethics, fraud 
prevention and whistleblowing policies 
which are communicated to all employees. 
A summary of these is communicated 
externally through our Code of Conduct, 
which includes the policy elements to 
meet our human rights obligations. 
Under our ethics policy we do not 
permit bribery, anti-competitive or corrupt 
business practices in any dealings. Under 
our fraud prevention policy, we do not 
allow intentional acts by one or more 
individuals within the business to use 
deception or theft to gain unjust or illegal 
advantage. Under our whistleblowing 
policy we provide a procedure for any 
employee to raise any malpractice 
concerns in an appropriate manner, with 
protection to the whistleblower. Ethics and 
whistleblowing is reviewed annually by the 
Audit Committee.

We implemented the requirements of 
the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and have

Committee.
Human rights 
The Group firmly believes in the 
principles behind the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. We 
support this by having a strong 
commitment to compliance with laws 
and regulations where we operate, 
and by expecting the same from our 
suppliers. We articulate this via our Values 
and Code of Conduct, the relevant policy 
elements of which are:
• Being honest, ethical and above 
reproach with each other and with 
our stakeholders in all our business 
dealings;
• Treating all others as we would like to 
be treated ourselves;
• We will not engage in activity that can 
be considered as trafficking in persons, 
including the use of forced labour or 
procurement of immoral services for 
the performance of contracts;
• There should be no discrimination 
against, or harassment of, any 
employee or job applicant either 
directly or indirectly;
• We encourage all our employees to 
take an active role against all forms of 
discrimination and harassment; and
• Ricardo will only employ or use staff 
who are appropriately vetted and have 
the proven right to work in the country 
of employment for the type of work 
being undertaken.
The Group’s position on human rights is 
supported through a number of ethics 
and employment policies which are 
designed to ensure we conduct business 
in a legal and ethical manner at all times.
Health and safety 
Ricardo is committed to compliance 
with local health and safety legislation, 
to a safe working environment and to a 
very low level of reportable accidents. 
We support training in health and safety 
awareness, impending changes in 
relevant legislation and other specialist 
health and safety subjects. Health 
and safety activities are verified by 
regular internal audits and inspections 
and certification to OHSAS 18001 in 
our technical centres in the US, UK, 
Netherlands, Germany and Czech 
Republic.
Ricardo Energy & Environment has a 
Gold Award from the Royal Society for 
the Prevention of Accidents (‘RoSPA’) – a 
demonstration of our commitment 
to good governance and to being an 
employer of choice. Our health and 
safety policy is available through our 
intranet and to the public via the website.

accidents as a primary performance 
indicator. The number of reportable 
accidents reduced in 2017: the overall 
level is still low and shows the success 
of our health and safety policies. 
We continue to focus on reducing 
accidents and near-misses as part 
of our commitment to continuous 
improvement and loss prevention.
Suppliers
Relations with our suppliers are essential 
in achieving client and shareholder 
satisfaction. Our policy is that key 
suppliers should be certified to ISO 
9001 and ISO 14001 standards, and all 
suppliers are encouraged to obtain these 
certifications. Local suppliers are used 
where commercially practical. There are 
no significant supply contracts which are 
essential to the business of the whole 
Group, and we are not reliant upon any 
suppliers that would jeopardise the 
independence of the business.
Initiatives are managed by our Head of 
Global Procurement and deliver savings 
by consolidating the supply base and 
reducing the total cost of doing business. 
We strongly encourage our suppliers to 
comply with our Code of Conduct or 
their own equivalent policies.
Local communities
It is our policy and objective to make 
a positive contribution to all countries 
and communities in which we operate, 
particularly in education in areas local 
to our main sites. Most of the larger 
Ricardo offices support local community 
activity and give charitable donations, 
particularly where employees participate 
in community or charitable fund-raising 
activities. The focus is on creating 
sustainable links and on improving 
the image and understanding of the 
business and the engineering profession 
in the community.
Community engagement promoting 
STEM subjects and diversity has been a 
key part of our employee involvement. 
A wide range of activities have been 
undertaken:
• Close partnerships with secondary 
schools close to our larger UK sites 
supporting curriculum delivery and 
teacher engagement in STEM;
• Most of our UK graduates are 
automatically enrolled as STEM 
ambassadors when they join the 
business;
• Sponsorship of regional ‘Big Bang’ 
STEM events where over 1 1,000 
students attended to experience 
opportunities from many employers; 
and
• Ricardo Software supports university 
teaching with its products in 200 
locations across 38 countries.
We also work with our local communities 
to provide business input on economic 
regeneration, and we actively engage in 
local partnerships, particularly in the area 
where our Shoreham Technical Centre is 
located, where we are the largest private 
sector employer. 
We often match staff donations 
to charitable activities, particularly 
where there is active staff participation 
in events. Financial contributions to 
charities in the year to 30 June 2017 were 
£35,652 (2016: £26,226). The effectiveness 
of these policies is informally measured 
by community feedback.

  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   37 The Board has overall accountability for 
ensuring that risk is effectively managed 
across the Group. We consider that 
effective risk management is critical to 
the achievement of Ricardo’s strategic 
objectives and the long-term sustainable 
growth of our business. That said, such 
systems are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve Ricardo’s objectives and can only 
provide reasonable assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
Risks are reviewed by all business areas 
on a half-yearly basis and measured 
against a defined set of likelihood and 
impact criteria. Risks are measured 
before mitigation and with the effect of 
compensating controls being applied. 
This is captured in consistent reporting 
formats, enabling the Group Risk 
Manager to consolidate and rank the 
risk information and summarise the key 
risks in the form of the Group risk profile 
ahead of it being submitted to the Board 
for final approval.
As part of the risk management 
process, Directors and Senior Managers 
are required to certify on a bi-annual 
basis that they have established effective 
controls to manage risk and to comply 
with legislation and Group procedures 
and disseminated Group policies.
Ricardo’s internal control and 
monitoring procedures include:
• Clear and understood responsibility by 
both line and financial management 
for the maintenance of good financial 
controls and the production of 
accurate and timely management 
information;
• Divisional finance leads are required to 
confirm that appropriate controls are 
in place and identify any exceptions 
on a monthly basis, with the outcome 
being reviewed by the Group Financial 
Controller and Head of Internal Audit;
• Divisional finance leads have line 
management responsibility to their 
divisional Managing Directors, but also 
have an independent reporting line to 
the Chief Financial Officer;
• Control of key financial risks through 
clearly set authorisation levels and 
appropriate segregation of accounting 
duties, the control of key project risks 
through project delivery and review 
systems, and the control of other key 
business risks through a number of 
processes and activities recorded in 
the Group risk register;
• Detailed monthly forecasting and 
reporting of trading results, financial 
position and cash flow, with regular 
review by management of variances 
from budget;
• Reporting on compliance with internal 
financial controls and procedures by 
Internal Audit; and
• Review of reports by external auditors.
To ensure our risk process drives 
continuous improvement across the 
business, we monitor the ongoing status 
and progress of key action plans against 
each risk on a half-yearly basis. Risk is a 
key consideration in all strategic decision-
making at Board level. In the June 2017 
risk review cycle, risks associated with 
our customers, our employees and 
our finances included consideration of 
the potential impact as a result of the 
referendum vote for the UK to leave the 
EU and the subsequent triggering of 
‘Article 50’. 
The Group has risk management 
processes in place for projects and other 
business risks. Contract risks are managed 
through a project management process 
which is closely linked to measurement 
of financial performance. The majority 
of active Technical Consulting projects 
are reviewed on a monthly basis. The 
highest risk category projects are either 
independently reviewed on a quarterly 
basis or once significant milestones 
are deemed to have been achieved. 
Non-contract risks are owned by the 
leaders of global product groups, Group 
functions and divisional Managing 
Directors. These non-contract risks are 
analysed and reviewed regularly and are 
recorded in the Group’s risk register in 
liaison with the Group Risk Manager, who 
has an independent reporting line to the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. The 
Group’s approach to risk management is 
to identify key risks early and to remove, 
control or minimise the impact of them 
before they occur.
Risk transfer, via insurances, is managed 
by the Group Risk Manager under the 
direction of the Chief Financial Officer. 
The insurance programme is reviewed 
annually by the Board to ensure that it 
meets the business needs as the risk 
profile changes. 
Risk appetite is managed by a number 
of internal controls via authority limits as 
well as setting excesses on insurances. 
Risk appetite was reviewed during the 
year as part of the Board’s review of 
risks and stated as an internal policy 
document.
The Group’s internal audit function 
provides assurance regarding the 
systems of internal control and risk 
management and compliance with 
applicable legislation and regulations. 
This is complemented by the internal 
audits required as part of maintaining 
certifications to international standards 
for management systems. These 
risk management and internal audit 
processes and their effectiveness 
are reviewed annually by the Audit 
Committee.
Financial risks faced by the Group 
comprise capital risk, liquidity risk, credit 
risk and market risk (comprising interest 
rate risk and foreign exchange risk) and 
the Group’s objectives, policies and 
strategies in respect of these risks are set 
out in Note 24 to the financial statements 
on pages 143 to 145.
We comply with the Code by ensuring 
that:
• We are classifying risks as either 
strategic or operational and as either 
internally or externally driven;
• The risks are evaluated on a gross and 
net risk basis; and
• The Chief Executive Officer reviews 
the higher-rated risks on the register 
with the Audit Committee twice each 
year, with the Executive Directors and 
Chairman present.

Customers and 
markets
The Group is largely dependent on 
a dynamic, increasingly diverse and 
politically volatile marketplace which 
is exposed to many external political 
and economic pressures, such as the 
referendum vote for the UK to leave 
the EU, as well as competition and 
structural change caused by global 
economic, cost base, environmental, 
technological, climate change and 
capacity concerns.
This could cause changes or uncertainty in client product 
plans or government policy, leading to delays in the 
placement of orders, the redirection, delay or curtailment 
of contracts, slippage in payments or variations in demand 
for resources, and availability of R&D funding sources. 
The precise timing of order receipt and rate of ramp-up 
of project workload delivering the subsequent revenue, 
profit and cash streams may give some volatility in our 
ability to forecast future performance.
These risks are mitigated by the strategy of broadening 
the base of the business to reduce exposure to any one 
specific client, territory or market sector, and the success 
of this strategy is measured by the key performance 
indicators for client dependency and sector diversity 
shown on page 14 and by the geographic spread 
of revenue, as disclosed in Note 3(b) to the financial 
statements. In the event of a sudden downturn, 
contingency plans are quickly deployed to minimise the 
short-term performance effects and preserve cash whilst 
protecting the long-term needs of the stakeholders. The 
impact of insolvency risk is mitigated by robust working 
capital management and the use of credit insurance 
where this is economically available.
Contracts
The majority of the Group’s revenue 
arises from fixed-price contracts 
for engineering and environmental 
consulting, and certification 
services, with an increasingly broad 
range of projects, customers and 
geographies. The costs and liabilities 
to complete these contracts may 
be different from initial estimates, 
thus reducing or increasing 
margins and project timescales. In 
product supply contracts, there is 
a risk of dependency on specialist 
suppliers; additional risks include 
product liability, recall or warranty 
claims. Contracts denominated in 
foreign currencies can be subject to 
exchange rate risk.
Failure to perform on contracts, the infringement of the 
rights of others, or a faulty product could potentially 
subject the business to a claim from a customer and loss 
of reputation or reduced opportunity for repeat business 
or increased costs. On contracts where we exceed 
planned performance, additional profit may be generated. 
Failure of production processes or product validation 
could lead to warranty or recall claims. Failure or poor 
performance of a supplier could disrupt delivery to clients 
and increase operating costs. Adverse foreign exchange 
rate movements could affect profitability.
These risks are proactively managed by clearly defined 
lead qualification, bidding, contracting and project 
management processes, whereby projects are categorised 
according to their risk level, which in turn dictates the 
level of approval or review required. Internal procedures 
are in place to ensure that the technical content of our 
output is of high quality and meets client requirements 
without infringing the rights of others, within time and 
cost targets. We are increasing our focus on project 
leadership competencies. These processes are subject 
to continued improvement focus with the central 
leadership of the Chief Operating Officer and are core to 
our strategy. Procurement processes are in place to assess 
critical suppliers and selections are often made with the 
involvement of the client. In product supply contracts, 
there are rigorous quality assurance processes in place 
to reduce the risk of product liability, warranty and recall 
claims. Significant contracts in foreign currencies are 
hedged to protect against volatility. 
People
Ricardo is a business that is 
knowledge-driven and people-
led, with a focus on attracting 
and retaining the best talent. 
Recruiting, developing and retaining 
knowledge and talent in the right 
locations is essential.
The failure to recruit, develop or retain the very best talent 
would restrict growth and the execution of the strategy 
and have an impact on delivery and client relationships.
We are focusing on a model of ‘bringing in and bringing 
on’ the best talent. We aim to ensure that we actively 
develop and manage staff to encourage their optimum 
contribution, encourage mobility and professional 
development, and provide appropriate remuneration 
and working conditions. As our business grows further 
internationally, we will be able to increase the range of 
services we deliver from more locations by focusing on 
mobility. Our people as stakeholders are reviewed further 
on pages 30 and 31.
uncertainties not presently known to management, or currently 
deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on 
the business. The mitigation of all the principal risks is within the 
Group’s risk appetite, which is reviewed annually by the Audit 
Committee.
In common with all businesses, we face risk and uncertainties 
on a daily basis. It is the effective management of these that 
places us in a better position to be able to achieve our strategic 
objectives and to embrace opportunities as they arise.
We set out below, and on the following page, details of our 
principal risks, the mitigating activities in place to address them, 
and additional actions implemented to further reduce net risk 
to the Group. It is recognised that the Group is exposed to a 
number of risks, wider than those listed. Additional risks and Increased risk Reduced risk

  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   39 Impact Mitigation
Technology
The business is driven by changes 
in technology to meet the needs of 
markets, sectors and regulators on 
varying time scales.
If the Group invests in the wrong technologies, it could 
lose marketplace advantage and business levels could 
reduce. If there are movements in the implementation of 
new regulations, which in turn accelerate or delay client 
programmes dependent on new technology, the time 
taken to deliver returns from our R&D programmes may 
also increase.
Our R&D programmes are developed through a mixture 
of client consultation, long-range forecasting, thought 
leadership and deep technology roadmap development. 
Many of our programmes are collaboratively developed 
and delivered with governments, clients, partners and 
suppliers, which creates strong links to the market 
and ensures the output is relevant and credible. The 
programmes are approved and delivered by the Ricardo 
Innovations Division, which operates within Ricardo 
as a global R&D organisation singularly focused on 
delivery and exploitation of approved programmes. 
This enables staff and facilities to be dedicated onto 
relevant programmes regardless of geography, which will 
accelerate delivery of innovation to market and promote 
the exploitation of developed intellectual property and 
know-how. Further details of our R&D programmes are 
given on pages 24 and 25. 
Compliance 
with laws and 
regulations
The Group’s operations are subject 
to an increasingly wide range 
of domestic and international 
laws, regulations, restrictions and 
standards.
Non-compliance with these laws, regulations, restrictions 
and standards could expose the Group to fines, penalties 
or loss of reputation, or result in trading restrictions which 
could have a material adverse effect on the business.
To mitigate these risks, the Group has a number of 
defined policies and operating procedures, and takes 
professional advice, where considered necessary, to 
ensure that employees and others act with the highest 
ethical standards and within local legal and regulatory 
requirements. Our Code of Conduct is published on  
www.ricardo.com to increase awareness and provide 
availability to external stakeholders. Also, the Group’s 
internal audit programme includes within its remit the 
review of compliance with applicable legislation and 
regulations, and awareness of key policies. Policies are 
updated as regulations change and as our knowledge of 
best practice increases. We aim to anticipate the effects 
of working in new countries and new sectors, particularly 
within our Rail business where the range of regulations, 
standards and laws with which we need to comply and 
the list of new territories where laws, regulations and 
cultures are addressed.
Defined benefit 
pension scheme
The Group has a UK defined benefit 
pension scheme which currently 
has a funding deficit. The result of 
the referendum vote for the UK to 
leave the EU has the potential for 
increasing volatility. 
Any decline in the value of the pension fund assets, 
improvement in the life expectancy, long periods of 
high inflation or future decreases in interest rates could 
increase the funding deficit and require additional funding 
contributions in excess of those currently expected.
The current UK funding plan was agreed on the basis of a 
valuation undertaken at 5 April 2014 and anticipates deficit 
recovery contributions being made until January 2021. 
The next triennial actuarial valuation, which will assess the 
level of Ricardo’s future annual contributions, is currently 
in progress. The Group also closed the pension fund to 
future accrual on 28 February 2010. In addition, the Group 
regularly monitors the performance of the pension fund. 
Financing
The Group is in a net debt position, 
having drawn on available facilities 
primarily to fund acquisitions.
There is a risk of the Group being unable to secure 
sufficient funds or the cost of funds and facilities being 
high.
This risk is managed by robust cash management, 
regular improvement initiatives, monitoring forecast and 
actual cash flows, maintaining good relationships with 
the Group’s bankers and ensuring sufficient borrowing 
facilities are in place at all times to support the Group’s 
requirements, with additional headroom available to meet 
possible downside scenarios. The Group has ample facility 
and covenant headroom. Further details of the Group’s 
borrowing facilities and other financial risks can be found 
in Note 24 to the financial statements. 
Cyber risk
Ricardo has valuable intellectual 
assets comprised of propriety, 
customer, and supplier data.
The theft or loss of intellectual assets could result in 
reputational damage, loss of competitive advantage, 
business disruption and financial penalties.
Ricardo has adopted an information governance 
framework based on the ISO 27001 Information Security 
standards. Dedicated Information Security resources 
monitor and manage our threat profile. IT risks are 
discussed monthly and are formally reviewed each 
quarter; external penetration tests are conducted to 
augment our control regime. The outputs from the IT 
Risk Register are integrated with Ricardo’s Enterprise 
Risk Management process. The Group IT Director is 
accountable for managing cyber resilience; biannual 
briefings are made to the Audit Committee.
Principal risks and uncertainties 
40   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 The Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group in accordance 
with provision C.2.2 of the 2016 UK 
Corporate Governance Code for this year 
ended 30 June 2017 .
The context supporting the 
assessment
The Group’s prospects are underpinned 
by its business model and strategy, 
which can be found on pages 8 to 
23. The Group continues to follow a 
balanced approach to its strategy, which 
is subject to ongoing monitoring and 
development as described below. The 
underlying operating profit of the Group 
has grown on average by 1 1% over 
the last five years and the Group has a 
closing year-end order book of £248m, of 
which 38% is expected to be workable 
beyond 12 months from the year-end. 
The order book comprises the value of all 
unworked purchase orders received.
The Group continues to be focused on 
global engineering and environmental 
consulting together with the 
development of longer-term, multi-year 
contracts and relationships, underpinned 
by global macro trends. The Board has 
considered the risk appetite and profile 
of the Group in this context, and has 
determined that this remains appropriate 
for the Group as a whole.
Assessing the prospects of the 
Group
The Group’s prospects are assessed 
primarily through its annual strategy 
review and business planning processes, 
which cover a five-year period and a 
three-year period, respectively, and are 
both led by the Chief Executive Officer. 
The strategy review is a forward-
looking process and is undertaken by 
the divisions, with full participation by 
members of the Board, which results 
in a five-year strategic plan. Part of the 
Board’s role is to review the performance 
of the Group in the last financial year 
and to consider whether the strategic 
plan remains appropriate. This includes 
an assessment of changes in the market 
and competitive environment, together 
with macroeconomic, political, social 
and technological changes. Actions are 
implemented as necessary to continue to 
support the strategic plan.
Detailed business plans are also 
prepared during the last quarter of each 
financial year by all divisions and relevant 
functions are involved, including Finance 
and Treasury, which are then reviewed 
and approved by the Board. The first year 
of the business plan forms the Group’s 
annual operating budget. This is subject 
to a re-forecast on a monthly basis. 
The second and third years are based 
on the overall content of the year one 
business plan together with the strategic 
plan, having been flexed for known or 
anticipated events.
Assessment of viability
The three-year business plan reflects the 
best estimate of the future prospects of 
the Group and has been stress tested 
for certain scenarios. The impact on the 
Group’s detailed financial plan has been 
quantified and presented to the Board 
as part of the approval process. These 
scenarios, which are based on aspects of 
the principal risks including customers 
and markets, contracts and financing as 
set out on pages 39 and 40, represent 
severe but plausible circumstances that 
the Group could experience.
The results of the stress testing 
showed that the Group would be able to 
withstand the impact of these scenarios 
occurring over the period of the plan 
by making adjustments to its operating 
activities within the normal course of 
business.
The Group also considered a number 
of scenarios that would represent serious 
threats to its liquidity, including reverse 
stress testing. None of these scenarios 
were considered to be plausible.
Statement
The Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group over the three-
year period to 30 June 2020 and confirm 
that their assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group was robust. A 
three-year period was selected for the 
following reasons:
• This period reflects the detailed 
business planning cycle; 
• Customer lead times and typical 
engineering programmes are no 
longer than three years; and
• Although the strategic plan covers 
a five-year period, the Group’s order 
book and pipeline of opportunities 
does not extend significantly beyond 
three years.
Whilst the Directors have no reason to 
believe the Group will not be viable 
over a longer period, given the inherent 
uncertainty involved, the stress testing 
scenarios considered as part of the 
three-year business plan, together with 
the reasons outlined above, a three-year 
period is deemed most appropriate. 
Based on their assessment of 
prospects and viability, the Directors 
confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the three-
year period ending 30 June 2020.
Going concern
Given the viability statement above, 
the Directors therefore considered it 
appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on a going concern basis, 
as explained in Note 1(a) to the financial 
statements on page 122.

Group overview Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report Case studies
 Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   45 The control of particulate emissions in vehicle 
exhausts has been something of a success story 
for the automotive industry in recent years. In a 
ground-breaking initiative by Ricardo and its partners 
on the Particle Measurement Programme (‘PMP’) 
in the early 2000s, the technology and standards 
frameworks for the measurement of particle number 
(‘PN’) were developed, in contrast to the conventional 
measurement of aggregate particulate mass. 
Now this work is being taken forward once more, 
and Ricardo and its research partners are pushing 
even further with the aim of measuring particles of a 
size range only marginally greater than the molecular 
level. 
The original work of the PMP was crucial in moving 
the science of particle emission regulation to a stage 
where tangible improvements would effectively 
show through in every new vehicle sold. In particular, 
Diesel Particulate Filters (‘DPFs’) became a standard 
fitment which, if maintained correctly, effectively 
eliminate the problem of particle emissions from 
diesel engines. The regulations enabled by the 
original work of the PMP now prescribe that, in 
addition to meeting the previous mass-based 
requirement, new vehicles may not emit more than 
6x10
11
 particles per kilometre over the standard 
homologation drive cycle. 
This particle number limit is based on (non-
volatile) PN measurement above a size threshold of 
approximately 23 nanometres (‘nm’). This limit was 
established both in terms of what was practical to 
achieve accurately and in a repeatable manner at the 
time, as well as representing the approximate primary 
particle size of soot or black carbon emitted as a 
result of incomplete combustion.
Size matters
The need to improve urban air quality is the 
major impetus for ongoing research by Ricardo 
and its partners on the PMP . This work is aimed 
at monitoring and regulating particle emissions 
down to sizes in the region of just 10 nm. There is a 
growing body of settled scientific opinion that the 
negative health effects associated with particulate 
emissions are more closely correlated with either the 
number of particles or the total surface area of those 
particles, rather than with the overall mass emitted. 
There are in effect two reasons for this. Firstly, for 
a given mass of particulate emission, a much larger 
surface area will be available if there are a greater 
number of smaller particles rather than fewer larger 
ones. The particle surface is effectively the transport 
medium for other compounds generated by 
combustion or surviving it, meaning that it is not just 
the particle that can be ingested into people’s lungs, 
but what it carries too. A larger surface area – albeit 
spread over a greater number of smaller particles 
– therefore means an increased likelihood of these 
compounds being ingested.
Secondly, while the human respiratory system 
has evolved to deal with larger particles such as 
dust or pollens, it is not so well equipped to deal 
with much smaller ultra-fine and nanoparticles. 
Nanoparticles can enter the bloodstream directly 
during respiration through a process of translocation 
and can collect in vital organs such as the brain or 
liver, with consequent negative health effects.
Gasoline is the future focus for 
nanoparticles
With DPFs now standard equipment for diesel 
vehicles (and proving effective in capturing down to 
the very smallest of nanoparticles) the concern over 
sub-23 nm particle emissions revolves principally 
around emissions from the latest generation of 
gasoline-powered vehicles. This concern relates 
to a fundamental change in the way that non-
combustible compounds are emitted.
As a general rule, the more efficient a gasoline 
engine’s combustion process, the less soot it 
produces. This soot is emitted by the engine in the 
form of ‘agglomerates’ averaging 80-100 nm in size, 
which also include compounds such as metal oxides 
that arise from the non-combustible components 
of the fuel and lubricant additive packs, and engine 
wear. These compounds of elements such as zinc, 
phosphorous and calcium frequently appear as 
particles as small as 10 nm, but they effectively 
attach to the surface of abundant larger soot 
agglomerates. 
The concern with future high-efficiency gasoline 
combustion is thus that as engine fuel efficiency 
increases, the lower level of soot will result in much 
larger numbers of these near-10 nm particles being 
emitted independently.
T ackling nanoparticle emissions 
46   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Demonstrating the challenge
To investigate the level of sub-23 nm particles 
emitted by a typical current production gasoline 
powered car, Ricardo worked with industry body, 
the Association for Emissions Control by Catalyst 
(‘AECC’) on a project in which measurements of 
gases and PN were recorded on the road over 
a real driving emission (‘RDE’) cycle. These RDE 
measurements were then duplicated in the vehicle 
test laboratory yielding two sets of highly accurate 
PN measurements, taken at sizes down to just 7 nm 
and above 23 nm, both with and without a gasoline 
particulate filter (‘GPF’) fitted to the vehicle.
The results of this work clearly demonstrated that 
despite the test vehicle satisfying current particle 
emission regulations which measure particles from 
23 nm upwards, without the GPF the emissions 
frequently exceeded the 6x10
11
 particles per km limit 
when the threshold was lowered to 7 nm. The reason 
for this was that in terms of numbers of particles 
counted, approximately 20 to 25 per cent of the total 
was emitted in this lower range, which is below the 
current threshold of regulation. 
Further research 
With widespread and increasing concern over the 
health consequences of nanoparticle emissions, the 
European Commission is supporting Ricardo and 
other researchers, including the PMP group, in further 
investigations into measurement technologies, 
systems and methodologies that might support a 
lowering of the current particle size threshold.
Ricardo is an active participant in the three-year 
‘Down To 10’ project, the main thrust of which is 
to consider the application of both condensation 
particle counter and diffusion charger methods of 
particle counting, representing methods that are 
applicable to test laboratory, RDE and onboard 
diagnostics system requirements. 
Work on the Down To 10 project has only just 
started, but it builds upon previous efforts by Ricardo 
and the PMP team examining sub-23 nm particle 
emissions, as well as the 15 or so years of research that 
led to the original regulatory regime that has been 
so effective in reducing the particle emissions of 
modern diesel engines. With the proactive approach 
being adopted by the European Commission, the 
work of Ricardo and its PMP partners is aimed at 
providing a modified framework for measurement 
and regulation of sub-23 nm nanoparticle emissions. 
Through this research, Ricardo is helping to ensure 
that the next generation of high-efficiency gasoline 
engines will be able to offer significant advances in 
fuel efficiency, while avoiding the potential health 
risks of nanoparticle emissions.

Ricardo is helping to pave the way 
for a new, lighter-weight and safer 
lithium-sulfur based rechargeable 
battery chemistry – an innovative 
technology that aims to overcome the 
cost, capacity and safety challenges of 
today’s lithium-ion based systems
One of the major challenges holding back the market 
penetration of battery electric vehicles (‘BEVs’) is 
today’s high cost of rechargeable energy storage. 
Battery systems represent a very significant cost 
element of a typical BEV, meaning that manufacturers 
need to strike a balance between product 
affordability and available range between recharges. 
The consequence of this high cost of battery 
systems is that BEVs are at present restricted to 
exploiting market niches – in particular the markets 
for small, urban commuting vehicles, and for larger, 
high-end sedans and SUVs equipped with high-
capacity batteries whose costs are more readily 
absorbed within these luxury vehicle types.
For BEVs to break out beyond these niches is likely 
to require the development and refinement of battery 
technology based on entirely new, more affordable, 
and lighter-weight cell chemistries than those used 
in today’s lithium-ion (‘Li-ion’) based battery packs. 
Moreover, a further objective is to improve safety 
by adopting cell chemistries that avoid the well-
publicised propensity of Li-ion packs for thermal 
runaway in the event that they sustain physical 
damage.
Exploring the potential of lithium-sulfur 
In partnership with Imperial College London and 
Cranfield University, Ricardo’s hybrid and electric 
systems team has been actively participating in a joint 
research project with OXIS Energy to investigate the 
potential vehicle application of the latest concept in 
lithium-sulfur (‘Li-S’) cell technology developed by 
OXIS. Li-S cells offer the potential for lighter-weight 
and lower cost energy storage, potentially allowing a 
greater depth of discharge than today’s Li-ion systems

  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   49 of thermal runaway. With part funding from Innovate 
UK, the project, under the name Revolutionary 
Electric Vehicle Battery (‘REVB’), aimed to evaluate the 
potential of the OXIS Li-S cells by developing a battery 
module and Battery Management System (‘BMS’) that 
would be appropriate for an automotive application. 
To bridge the gap between a promising new cell 
chemistry and verifying it for a given application is, in 
its own right, a considerable engineering endeavour. 
In order to be able to create a viable battery pack 
design, the individual cells need to be understood 
in terms of their thermal, mechanical and electro-
chemical properties. In addition to meeting external 
packaging envelope restrictions, the pack needs to 
be engineered to be capable of securely housing 
the individual cell pouches, while also allowing 
for expansion and contraction, and providing the 
requisite thermal management of the cells through its 
cooling system. 
In addition to the engineering task of creating 
the pack design, a further higher level challenge is 
represented by the required control technology. In 
common with existing products, the entire Li-S pack 
needs to be managed by the BMS, which is optimised 
for the cell chemistry as well as for the design of the 
cell modules forming the pack and the application for 
which the battery is to be used.
Ricardo battery management systems 
expertise 
Key Ricardo responsibilities in the REVB project 
derived from the Group’s long-standing industry 
leadership in battery pack design and BMS control 
technology. The control of new cell chemistries can 
require a far greater level of sophistication than that 
needed for current products, so the opportunity was 
taken to significantly increase the available computing 
power of the previous generation of Ricardo BMS by 
almost an order of magnitude, from approximately 90 
to 800 million instructions per second. 
This increase in capacity enables the adoption 
of highly sophisticated model-based battery 
management. This model-based approach enables 
the BMS to control the cells based on parameters 
that might be impractical or impossible to measure. 
For example, while the exterior temperature of 
a cell might easily be measured, it is the internal 
temperature that is crucial for control purposes. But 
if a mathematical representation of the cell is used, 
which combines the external temperature with a 
prediction of internal heat rejection based on the 
chemical and electrical performance, a far more 
accurate prediction of the instantaneous temperature 
within the cell could be possible. 
By adapting and using mathematical algorithms 
supplied by Cranfield University to describe the 
electrical and chemical performance of the cells, 
Ricardo was thus able to optimise the BMS operation 
of the battery to make best use of the performance 
of the Li-S cells. To maximise its potential use 
beyond the REVB project, the improved Ricardo 
BMS has been designed so as to provide a flexible 
and future-proofed architecture that will enable the 
development of control systems based on all new-
technology battery packs, regardless of their cell 
chemistry.

To assess the potential of the Li-S cells in a typical 
automotive BEV battery pack, Ricardo also created 
the design of an individual module which might be 
assembled to form such a pack. This work required 
particular attention to the high level of physical 
expansion and contraction of this generation of 
Li-S cells as well as the development of the battery 
module cooling system and thermal management 
strategy. 
Computer-aided Engineering (‘CAE’) methods were 
employed extensively in the design of the battery 
module, including the use of the Ricardo VECTIS 
computational fluid dynamics package, which was 
modified to enable a conjugate heat transfer analysis 
of the battery module and its cooling system. This 
approach enables the simultaneous solution of both 
the structural and fluid heat transfer calculations, 
providing a far more accurate prediction of the 
product’s thermal and fluid dynamic performance. 
The final design of the battery module combined 
the mounting of the individual cells into a backing 
plate assembly, which doubled as part of the thermal 
management system, maintaining the desired 
operating temperature of the individual cells. 
Having engineered the upgraded Ricardo BMS 
and purpose-designed battery module, Ricardo 
constructed a total of five proof-of-concept 
‘A-samples’ of both the BMS and battery module for 
testing. This work broadly confirmed the potential of 
the OXIS Li-S cell chemistry to achieve the target of 
400 Wh/kg capacity. 
Commercial interest
The REVB project clearly showed the functional 
potential of the OXIS Li-S cells for vehicle applications. 
In their current stage of development, while OXIS Li-S 
cells offer a low-weight solution, their comparatively 
larger size than current alternatives could make their 
application more attractive in large vehicles such as 
buses, where package space is less restricted than in 
passenger cars. 
Together with the continued progress on 
automotive BEV development, Ricardo’s work on the 
REVB project demonstrates the Group’s industry-
leading capability to assist with the crucial enabling 
control technologies and innovative application 
expertise – know-how that can help bring forward 
the deployment of next-generation battery cell 
chemistries. 
In this way, Ricardo is helping the automotive 
industry to move closer to the long-awaited 
breakthrough point at which battery-electric traction 
approaches commercial parity with combustion 
engine-based powertrains.

SEMI TRUCK
Ricardo has been assisting the Texas A&M Transportation 
Institute in creating and demonstrating technology to improve 
the safety and productivity of the ubiquitous North American 
‘semi trucks’ – the Class 8 articulated tractor-trailer combinations 
that ply the US Interstate network delivering the goods and 
materials that are the life-blood of the American economy  
Group overview Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report Case studies
  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   53 Ricardo has developed an enviable reputation 
as a leading innovator and technical partner for 
semi-autonomous vehicle platooning, where an 
experienced driver in a lead vehicle is also responsible 
for a train of multiple following vehicles. This concept 
offers significant advantages for long-haul truck 
applications. Firstly, as there is almost instantaneous 
reaction time between the application of braking 
demand on the lead vehicle and that on the entire 
platoon, it offers improved safety. This faster reaction 
time enables the inter-vehicle distance to be closed 
up, considerably improving both the aerodynamics 
and hence, fuel economy and CO 2 emissions of the 
trucks in the platoon. Previous work has demonstrated 
that with truck platooning, these fuel and CO 2 savings 
can be as high as 8 per cent for the lead truck, and 16 
per cent for following vehicles.
But these are far from the only potential advantages 
of truck platooning. The operation of platoons 
would also improve road space utilisation, enabling 
more free-flowing traffic on congested routes and 
potentially avoiding the requirement for significant 
capital investment in infrastructure upgrades. In the 
future, platooning might also enable the drivers of 
the platooned vehicles following the leader to enjoy 
some level of partial rest credit. This would not only 
lower costs and improve productivity but might also 
help in regions where skilled and experienced truck 
drivers are in short supply.
A proven track record in platooning 
In 2012, Ricardo worked with a European partnership 
including Volvo on the SAfe Road TRains for the 
Environment (‘SARTRE’) project, which demonstrated 
a platoon comprising three cars and two rigid-
chassis trucks, the first of which was the lead vehicle 
controlling the entire platoon. In 2016, Ricardo’s North 
American engineers built upon this already proven 
experience to develop a platooning application 
for the largest class of American trucks. In a project 
sponsored by the Texas Department of Transport, 
Ricardo was contracted to support the Texas A&M 
Transportation Institute (‘TTI’) to demonstrate 
platooning based on two heavy-duty Class 8 tractor-
trailer trucks. This work would go further than many 
previous platooning demonstrations in that the 
following vehicles would be subject to both lateral 
and longitudinal control, providing automated 
steering, acceleration and braking without driver 
input.
In the first phase of the work, Ricardo was 
responsible for system integration and software 
development of the platooning system for the two-
truck platooning project. Ricardo engineers led a 
team of suppliers in conjunction with TTI, integrating 
their hardware and developing software that would 
be deployed on the two Class 8 trucks. The team 
integrated dedicated short range communication 
(‘DSRC’), steering and braking actuation, and speed 
controls. The team also developed key software 
algorithms for sensor fusion, platooning management 
and both lateral and longitudinal motion control. 
Platoon control
The platooning manager algorithm developed 
by Ricardo automatically assesses distance, speed 
and user inputs for both vehicles, and allows the 
following vehicle driver to be ‘hands off, feet off and 
eyes on’. In effect, therefore, the following vehicle 
driver is required only for emergencies or to resume 
control once platooning is finished. The longitudinal 
algorithm was developed to control acceleration

‘gap’ between the trucks. The lateral algorithms 
control the steering to allow the following vehicle 
to track the path of the lead vehicle. At the current 
phase of development, the following vehicle can 
autonomously follow the lead vehicle and perform 
a lane change manoeuvre or a figure of eight, while 
maintaining autonomously the desired inter-vehicle 
gap and platoon speed. 
Ricardo integrated the vehicle-to-vehicle (‘V2V’) 
technology to serve as the communication link 
between the lead and following vehicles. This allows 
the trucks to seamlessly communicate critical safety 
data and information in real time. When combined 
with a Human Machine Interface (‘HMI’), this allows 
the platooned trucks to demonstrate a precisely 
controlled inter-vehicle gap that can be specified 
between 5 and 70 metres.
The HMI is used to determine if and when the 
vehicles can form and platoon, and also when the 
platoon is to be dissolved. The platoon is formed by 
the lead vehicle accepting a request to platoon by a 
suitably equipped following vehicle. Once the lead 
vehicle has accepted the platoon request, by selecting 
the ‘join platoon’ button on the HMI, the following 
vehicle – and subsequent vehicles wishing to join – 
are able to form the platoon.
Sensor technologies
The platooning system was based on multiple radar, 
camera, and other sensors in each vehicle, as well as 
a safety controller. The V2V architecture provides for 
the full communications requirements of the platoon, 
enabling the vehicles to share data and information 
to help the following trucks in the platoon respond in 
the appropriate way. 
Ricardo called on its extensive experience in 
simulation and testing to evaluate all aspects of the 
demonstration vehicles throughout development to 
ensure the systems would perform as expected. The 
final demonstration was conducted on the Texas A&M 
University System’s RELLIS Campus in the summer of 
2016, when the two-truck platoon performed several 
manoeuvres, including a figure of eight, at speeds of 
up to 50 mph (80 km/h).
The project with TTI is part of a multi-phase 
initiative. Having demonstrated the platooning 
technology at the RELLIS Campus, Ricardo and its 
partners are now progressing work on the second 
phase, which will see the system being updated to 
handle public road trails, including manoeuvres such 
as merging and lane changing.
Stepping stone to full autonomy 
The platooning of large vehicles, both on long-
distance public highways as well as in the form of 
captive fleets such as mining vehicles, represents 
perhaps the most attractive early application of 
automated driving corresponding to the higher 
levels 3-5 of autonomy as defined in SAE International 
standard J3016. Subject to appropriate regulation, this 
is a technology which appears to be close to market 
readiness, and promises significant societal and 
environmental benefits. 
Ricardo is already a leader in the development of 
connected and autonomous vehicle technologies, 
and with its proven experience with some of the 
highest profile platooning demonstration projects 
on either side of the Atlantic – which now includes 
the highest class of heavy-duty trucks – the Ricardo 
Group is well positioned to assist customers with the 
future automation of commercial vehicle fleets. In this 
way, the freight transportation networks of the future 
can be more efficient, more productive, and more 
environmentally sustainable.

emissions from shipping seen as a significant 
and growing part of global emissions, 
Ricardo has been commissioned to deliver 
a comprehensive update of the shipping 
emissions inventory for the UK National 
Atmospheric Emissions Inventory
STEERS A CLEAR COURSE ON
Shipping steers a clear course on emissions
Group overview Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report Case studies
 Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   57 Under the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, 
some 200 countries agreed to establish and report 
their individual national greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) 
emissions inventories as the first step towards 
applying targeted reductions. For the UK, this is the 
National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (‘NAEI’) and 
is coordinated by Ricardo Energy & Environment.
Although the reporting obligations cover domestic 
shipping, they do not need to include international 
shipping. For some nations – especially island states 
such as the UK that are on busy shipping lanes – the 
reporting of purely inland sources is insufficient to 
provide a complete picture of atmospheric pollutants. 
Such is the intensity of shipping around Britain, 
through the English Channel and around some 
UK ports, that emissions that occur at sea are likely 
to have a significant effect on air quality in coastal 
communities on land; they can make a sizeable 
contribution further inland too. 
Although the existing UK inventory of shipping 
emissions is reasonably detailed, it does not cover 
several important classes of shipping activity. What 
is more, levels of shipping activity are forecast 
to rise significantly in the coming years as global 
trade expands. For these reasons, Ricardo Energy 
& Environment was commissioned by the UK 
Government to undertake an update of the shipping 
emission inventory component of the NAEI.
The NAEI is an especially useful resource as it is 
spatially disaggregated to a very high resolution, 
meaning that it shows the distribution of emissions 
from each sector and emission source; this makes it a 
vital tool for local air quality modelling. 
Ricardo’s new analysis, in conjunction with project 
partner University College London Consultants, 
has addressed several drawbacks to the existing 
UK maritime inventory – principally that they were 
based on estimated rather than actual routes taken 
by ships, that they did not take account of variation in 
vessels’ engine loads or speeds, and that they failed 
to capture certain types of craft, especially fishing 
vessels, offshore fleet and service vessels.
Reviewing the available options, Ricardo and its 
partners opted for an entirely new methodology 
relying on Automatic Identification System (‘AIS’) data 
from the UK’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency. In 
addition to identifying and tracking individual vessels, 
AIS messages also provide information on speed, 
draught and other parameters. This enables very 
precise plotting of ships’ courses and speeds.
The ships’ identities are then cross-referenced to a 
register of world shipping containing technical details 
for the majority of the world’s registered vessels over 
100 gross tonnes. Marrying the two streams of data 
together enables the model to predict the emissions 
of any AIS-tracked vessel with a high degree of 
accuracy and at any given speed and load condition; 
even when in port or at anchor, the emissions of the 
ship’s auxiliary engines and boiler are accounted for.
The only drawback of this approach is the 
enormous amount of data that it generates. The 2014 
Position density of 
AIS Class A shipping

Data generated

emissions inventory

58   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Shipping steers a clear course on emissions survey data for all the vessels around the UK, each 
reporting up to every three seconds, resulted in more 
than 2 billion data points. This meant the data had to 
be thinned down to around 100 million AIS messages, 
but it was still a considerable data processing task.
The new model estimates the emissions to air 
of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane 
and nitrous oxide), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, 
particulate matter, carbon monoxide and volatile 
organic compounds. The 2014 inventory has so 
much detail and so many layers that it can serve as 
a starting point to model future forecasts as well as 
a basis for ‘back-casting’ to earlier years to provide 
historical emissions inventories which also have to be 
reported. This same data, overlaid with estimates of 
the improvements in engine efficiency over time and 
changes in the fuel type driven by legislation, can be 
used to generate accurate forecasts for future years. 
Given the success of the inventory capture rate 
around the UK coast and through the English 
Channel, a natural next step would be to extend the 
scheme further afield. The reach of the data gathering 
is effectively only limited by the range of terrestrial 
AIS receivers, and the use of satellite AIS data could 
potentially be added to widen the system’s operating 
radius. The system already estimates emissions for the 
UK fishing fleet even after these vessels travel a long 
way out of terrestrial AIS range before returning to 
land their catch in the UK; emissions for the whole trip 
can be calculated and included.
The multi-layered emissions inventory will be a 
very valuable resource on a technical level and also 
from a planning perspective. Future environmental 
measures could be modelled and their effects 
predicted with some degree of confidence; this 
could be done relatively simply by changing some of 
the assumptions in the existing forecasting models. 
Forecasts have already been completed as far into 
the future as 2035 to model the effects of projected 
changes in shipping activity, transport efficiency, fuel 
types and emission factor improvements. 
Yet one thing is abundantly clear. Despite the 
greater coverage of smaller craft, such as tugs, service 
vessels and passenger ships that are now included in 
the emissions inventory, as far as the UK is concerned 
it will still be the larger vessels that are the dominant 
source of emissions. And in contrast to domestic 
traffic, which has remained roughly level since 2009, 
international movements are on an upward trend. 
According to estimates from the International 
Maritime Organisation (‘IMO’), shipping accounts for 
between 2 and 3 per cent of global man-made CO 2. 
The IMO has put into place efficiency improvement 
measures for categories of shipping responsible for 
85 per cent of maritime CO 2 emissions, but even 
on a business as usual basis the same organisation 
forecasts that, by 2050, CO 2 from international 
shipping could have grown by between 50 and 250 
per cent to as much as 2,500 million tonnes a year – 
which gives a chilling idea of the scale of the problem.
The Ricardo maritime air quality project thus comes 
in the context of growing international concern 
over pollution at sea, be it in the atmosphere or in 
the water. In addition to the work by the Company’s 
air quality specialists, therefore, Ricardo Energy & 
Environment’s water practice is also ideally placed 
to offer expertise in areas including the monitoring 
of port water quality for environmental permit 
compliance, while the Group’s Technical Consulting 
business can offer specialist expertise at the forefront 
of innovation in marine propulsion engines and 
auxiliary power systems.

Smart monitoring Over recent years, electrification has been 
fundamental to the improvement of rail services 
across Europe. In 1990, less than a third of Europe’s 
railways were electrified. Today, more than half of 
its lines are electrified – including routes that carry 
around 80 per cent of traffic. 
The favoured electrification solution, especially 
where higher speeds and longer distances are 
involved, is achieved via high-voltage overhead 
line equipment (‘OLE’), where trains pick up their 
power through roof-mounted pantographs tipped 
with contacts that slide along the underside of an 
overhead contact wire. 
The crucial interface in this system is that between 
the pantograph and contact wire. Poorly maintained 
or damaged pantographs can be a significant cause 
of so-called ‘dewirement’ incidents, where snagging 
can incur extensive damage to the electrification 
infrastructure. Though infrequent, such incidents can 
lead to extensive and costly disruption to rail services, 
in some cases costing multiple millions of pounds 
in repairs and in ’performance regime’ payments. 
These are the rebates paid to train operators in lieu of 
infrastructure-related delays.
To help tackle this issue, Ricardo Rail engineers have 
developed PanMon, an innovative system that uses 
highway enforcement (speed camera) technology 
to continually monitor the pantographs of passing 
trains, automatically identifying incipient problems. 
The system then provides engineers with real-time 
warnings that enable them to take corrective action 
before further wear and tear causes more serious 
damage to the infrastructure.
As with many successful monitoring innovations, 
PanMon represents a combination of existing sensing 
technologies, working with smart analysis software 
and real-time processing and reporting. The system 
includes a high-speed camera system, provided by 
the Sensys Gatso Group, that is fitted to a gantry 
immediately above the running rails and contact 
wire. These cameras then capture high-speed digital 
images of each passing pantograph. 
In addition to the Sensys camera, the PanMon 
system uses a high-speed video camera provided by 
DMA, a provider of trackside monitoring technologies 
based in Italy. These cameras are mounted at 
pantograph height on a mast alongside the rails 
and capture the uplift of the contact wire as each 
pantograph passes, using LED lights to illuminate the 
video sequence. Finally, a tag reader identifies each 
carriage of each passing train, such that any fault can 
be immediately traced back to a given vehicle and 
individual pantograph.
Automatic analysis
As each PanMon installation captures high-speed 
photography and video of passing pantographs, 
it uses specialist software to rapidly process the 
images and characterise the condition of each 
passing pantograph. The first task is to correct for 
the perspective and view angle of the camera: 
this enables an orthogonal representation of the 
pantograph to be constructed from the image. The 
software then compares the captured image against 
a library of types and designs of pantograph known 
to pass the location, followed by an assessment 
 
62   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Smart monitoring for any physical damage, such as broken or bent 
structural components that might pose a risk of 
snagging the contact wire or its catenary support. 
Such damage can be caused by vandalism or where 
maintenance equipment has been erroneously left 
in place. PanMon can then immediately identify any 
risk of consequential dewirement – for example, at a 
junction or a points/switch location where the train 
crosses between lines.
At the same time, PanMon will assess the wear 
on the carbon strip inserts of the pantograph. 
Here the system looks for both the general level of 
wear – should a replacement be considered at the 
next planned depot inspection, for example – and 
identifies whether any localised damage has occurred 
in the form of chipping, which might risk snagging 
the contact wire.
Finally, the video is analysed for the uplift of the 
contact wire as the pantograph passes, and for its 
dynamics as the wire re-settles. Pantographs generally 
apply upward force either through a spring-loaded 
or pneumatic system, or a combination of both: 
PanMon can be programmed to take account of local 
conditions, and provide warnings if the uplift exceeds 
design limits.
Fault notification from a PanMon installation can be 
provided in almost real time. In extreme cases where 
there is an imminent risk of dewirement occurring, 
the network control centre might be alerted to halt, at 
the next available opportunity, a train showing a fault. 
It would then either withdraw it from service, lower 
the offending pantograph of a multiple-unit train, or 
switch pantographs on a high-speed train. Conversely, 
less severe damage might instead be flagged for the 
next scheduled maintenance. 
Commercial interest
The UK rail infrastructure manager Network Rail 
was the first customer to recognise the potential 
of PanMon to deliver reliability improvements and 
cost savings. Following an initial installation at 
Cheddington on the West Coast Main Line (‘WCML ’), 
Network Rail formally approved the use of PanMon for 
application across the whole UK national rail system 
– a highly significant step as PanMon remains the 
only such system certified for use by a major network 
operator. 
Plans to install PanMon systems to protect the 
Heathrow airport spur and at further locations on the 
WCML are now progressing, with potential further 
applications on many other UK electrified mainlines.
In Belgium, the national rail infrastructure manager, 
InfraBel, is also in the process of evaluating the system 
with a view to an eventual certification of PanMon 
for the national network. Work is now ongoing to 
develop the software-based library of pantograph 
types and fault analysis to capture the requirements of 
the Belgian system.
Ricardo Rail enjoys a unique position in the 
international rail sector in that its engineers have 
detailed knowledge of both rolling-stock and 
infrastructure systems, as well as day-to-day 
operational and maintenance concerns. As such, 
PanMon is just one of a range of innovations based 
upon real-time condition monitoring, automated 
analysis, and reporting that Ricardo is now developing. 
Collectively, these intelligent systems can help rail 
infrastructure and operations businesses to manage 
safety-related risks in real time, and to develop 
improved asset management and cost-effective 
maintenance processes. In this way, Ricardo can make 
a significant contribution in improving international 
railway reliability while also driving down costs.

Ultimate performance The Aston Martin Valkyrie is an ultra-high 
performance hypercar and the product of a unique 
innovation partnership between Aston Martin and 
Formula One’s Red Bull Racing, combining the vision 
and skills of two world-leading brands to create a 
road car the like of which has never been seen before. 
The Aston Martin Valkyrie is a car engineered to be 
entirely usable and enjoyable as a road car, but with 
the capability to perform on a race track like no car 
before it. One hundred and fifty roadgoing examples 
will be built, with 25 track-only versions to follow. First 
deliveries are due to start in 2019.
Building upon its strong reputation in the design, 
development and manufacture of advanced 
transmission and driveline systems for some of the 
world’s highest performing supercars, Ricardo has 
been selected as technical and supply partner for 
the transmission of the Aston Martin Valkyrie. This 
prestigious contract follows on from previous high-
profile projects which have seen the Performance 
Products Division create high-performance 
transmissions for Bugatti, Ferrari, Jaguar, McLaren and 
Porsche. 
The new bespoke seven-speed paddle-shift 
transmission is being designed and manufactured 
by Ricardo in accordance with the demanding 
specifications, channelling the huge power of the 
Aston Martin Valkyrie’s 6.5-litre naturally aspirated 
Cosworth V12 engine. Conforming to the hypercar’s 
Ultimate performance 
66   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 ethos of minimal mass and maximum efficiency, and 
led by Red Bull Advanced Technologies’ simulation 
work, Ricardo will deploy intelligent engineering 
solutions to achieve the vehicle’s uncompromising 
goals. Ricardo’s responsibilities include both 
mechanical design and control software 
development as well as manufacture. 
The combination of features in this advanced 
transmission has resulted in a unique design, driven 
by the need for uncompromised performance and 
calling on the full breadth of knowledge Ricardo 
has developed over its long, proud and successful 
history in motorsport and performance driveline 
technology.
To deliver such a demanding project, Ricardo 
combined its best talents from both its motorsport 
and road transmission design teams into a new 
dedicated and highly skilled project team especially 
for the Aston Martin Valkyrie programme. Technical 
reviews with both Aston Martin and Red Bull have 
driven numerous innovations, with the key drivers 
being the smallest possible package in terms of 
space and weight, at the same time as achieving the 
quickest possible shift times with no compromise 
given to durability or driver engagement. 
The result is a transmission that is a state-of-
the-art blend between race-car performance and 
road-car manners; the design’s seven sequentially 
shifted forward ratios have been closely matched 
through real-world lap time simulation to give 
optimum performance. Among the circuits used in 
the simulation was one of Europe’s most modern 
Formula One venues, the Circuit de Barcelona-
Cataluña.
The advanced manufacturing facilities of the 
Ricardo Midlands Technical Centre will be used 
from the prototype stage through to production-
intent transmissions. These will undergo exhaustive 
mechanical test and control system development 
prior to the final design released for series 
production in 2018. 
Following a similar approach to the many other 
high-profile extreme-performance car transmission 
projects delivered previously by the Performance 
Products Division, Ricardo will continue to be closely 
involved throughout this prestigious vehicle’s life. 
Aston Martin Valkyrie transmissions can be returned 
through Aston Martin to undergo servicing by 
Ricardo to precisely the same high standards and in 
the same advanced manufacturing environment in 
which they were originally built. In this way, Ricardo 
ensures that its performance manufacturing clients 
– and their own valued customers – are supported 
throughout the life of some of the most impressive, 
high performing, innovative and exciting cars ever 
created.

Board of Directors UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Board confirms that the Company has complied with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code published in 
April 2016 (‘the Code’) throughout the year ended 30 June 201 7 .
The 2016 update to the Code was driven by the consequential 
changes required by the Financial Reporting Council’s 
implementation of the European Union’s Audit Regulation 
and Directive. The FRC also issued updated Guidance on Audit 
Committees. These took effect for financial years commencing 
on or after 1 7 June 2016 and are therefore applicable for the 
Company’s year ended 30 June 201 7 . 
This report describes how the Company has applied the 
principles and standards set out in the Code during the year and 
sets out our activities relating to the main sections of the Code:
Leadership, Effectiveness, Accountability, Remuneration and 
Relations with Shareholders. 
The Code and associated guidance are publicly available on the 
Corporate Governance page of the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website, www.frc.org.uk/directors/corporate-governance-and-
stewardship.
LEADERSHIP 
The Role of Ricardo’s Board
Our role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership and we 
recognise that we are collectively responsible for the long-term 
success of the Group.
We set strategy and oversee its implementation by the 
executive team. We assess business opportunities and seek 
to ensure that appropriate controls are in place to assess and 
manage risk. We are responsible for reviewing the executive 
team’s performance and we oversee senior-level succession 
planning within the Group.
Sir Terry Morgan – Chairman
Corporate governance statement
CHAIRMAN’S OVERVIEW
I am pleased to introduce the Corporate Governance Statement for the year ended  
30 June 201 7 . Governance is an important contributor to the success of Ricardo and the 
Board is committed to ensuring that appropriate standards of governance are maintained 
throughout the Group.
This report sets out the way we comply with good corporate governance principles. 
It describes how the Board and its committees work, and also our approach to risk 
management and internal control.
As part of the Board’s succession planning, during the year our Nomination Committee 
conducted a search for an additional Non-Executive Director to succeed Ian Lee when he 
stands down from the Board at the close of the AGM in November 201 7 . I am pleased to 
advise that Bill Spencer joined the Board on 24 April 201 7 and it is intended that he will be 
appointed Chair of the Audit Committee at the close of the AGM in November 201 7 .
Sir Terry Morgan, CBE
72   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
  We agree the Company’s values and standards and ensure that 
the Company’s obligations to its shareholders are met.
We have a formal schedule of matters reserved for our approval 
which are not delegated to the executive team. These include:
• Strategy;
• Acquisitions and disposals of businesses (over a certain size);
• Annual budgets;
• Capital expenditure (over a certain size);
• Financial results;
• Overseeing systems of internal control, governance and risk 
management;
• Dividends; and
• Appointment and removal of Directors and the Company 
Secretary.
The full schedule of matters reserved for our decision is 
available on our website, www.ricardo.com. We delegate certain 
responsibilities to our Nomination, Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. These committees comprise our independent Non-
Executive Directors (save for the Nomination Committee, which 
includes the Chief Executive Officer) and all play a key role in 
supporting us.
There are seven scheduled Board meetings a year and 
otherwise as required. Details of attendance at scheduled Board 
and Committee meetings are shown in the table above. Board 
meetings focus on driving Ricardo’s strategy, developing strong 
leadership, succession planning, reviewing financial business 
performance, monitoring risks and protecting the strength of our 
relationships with clients, employees and other stakeholders. Our 
agendas allow time for debate and long-term strategic discussion. 
Our forward planner gives Board members visibility of what is on 
future agendas for their consideration. The Board agenda is set by 
the Chairman in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and 
the Company Secretary.
We have spent considerable time focusing on the Group’s 
strategies and reviewing progress against respective objectives. 
We held a strategy meeting in November 2016, at which we 
reviewed progress and improvements on the five-year strategy 
agreed in 2014.
EFFECTIVENESS

Director
Malin Persson Independent Non-Executive 
Director
Bill Spencer Independent Non-Executive 
Director
Biographies of Directors, giving brief details of their experience 
and other commitments are set out on pages 70 and 71. The 
wide-ranging experience and backgrounds of the Non-Executive 
Directors enable them to debate and constructively challenge 
management in relation to the strategy and performance of the 
Group.
On 24 April 201 7 the Company announced that Ian Lee 
intended to step down as Non-Executive Director and Chair of 
the Audit Committee at the close of the AGM on 8 November

Group overview Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report Case studies
Corporate governance statement certification company, Intertek Group plc, during a period of 
international expansion. Prior to that he held a number of senior 
financial appointments with Inchcape plc, Olivetti UK Limited, 
Rexam plc and Centrica plc. Since 2010, he has developed a varied 
non-executive career. His former non-executive roles include; 
UK Mail plc where he was audit committee chairman and Exova 
Group plc where he was the senior independent director and 
audit committee chairman. Currently Bill is the senior independent 
director and audit and risk committee chairman of Northgate 
plc. Bill has a BSc in Management Sciences from the University of 
Manchester, is a member of the Association of Corporate Treasurers 
and has been a member of the Chartered Institute of Management 
Accountants since 1986. 
The Board has concluded that Sir Terry Morgan CBE, Ian Lee, 
Peter Gilchrist CB, Laurie Bowen, Malin Persson and Bill Spencer 
are independent in character and judgement. Sir Terry Morgan is 
also the non-executive chairman of Crossrail Limited, which is a 
customer of the Group and therefore a related party, as disclosed 
in Note 37 to the financial statements. As part of the Board’s 
conclusion on independence, this relationship was considered and 
determined to be immaterial to this assessment. No non-executive 
member of the Board has ever been an employee of the Company, 
nor have they participated in any of the Company’s share schemes, 
pension schemes or bonus arrangements. They receive no 
remuneration from the Company other than the Directors’ fees 
disclosed, and travel expenses. Their fees are determined by the 
Board as a whole on the recommendation of the Chief Executive 
Officer. No Director is involved in deciding their own fees. They all 
held office throughout the year, with the exception of Bill Spencer 
who joined the Board on 24 April 201 7 . 
The Company has procedures in place to ensure that the Board’s 
power to authorise conflicts of interests are operated effectively 
and such procedures have been followed during the year.
Letters of appointment for the Non-Executive Directors are 
available for inspection by shareholders at each Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’) and during normal business hours at the 
Company’s registered office.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for specified terms 
of three years which can be extended by agreement provided 
that the individual’s performance continues to be effective. In 
accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and the 
Code, all Directors will retire at the AGM in November 201 7 and, 
being eligible, will offer themselves for election and re-election (as 
appropriate), save for Ian Lee who will retire from the Board. We 
believe that each of the Directors should be elected and re-elected 
by the shareholders because each continues to be effective and 
demonstrates commitment to the role that each of them performs.
During the year the Chairman met the other Non-Executive 
Directors without the attendance of the Executive Directors on a 
number of occasions. 
There were several other occasions during the year when 
informal discussions between various Directors took place.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors have provided 
assurances to the Board that they remain fully committed to their 
respective roles and can dedicate the necessary amount of time 
to attend to the Company’s affairs. During the year, Malin Persson 
reduced her other non-executive roles and now holds seven 
appointments. Malin continues to demonstrate her commitment 
and time to the Company and always makes herself available to the 
Company, when called upon to do so outside of the Board schedule.
Executive Directors must obtain the prior consent of the Board 
before accepting a non-executive directorship in any other company. 
Executive Directors may retain the fees from any such directorship. 
Two Executive Directors, Dave Shemmans and Mark Garrett, held 
non-executive directorships during the year under review.
Board objectives
The Company is confident that the Board and the wider leadership 
team have the experience and track record to meet the Company’s 
aims of delivering long-term growth and successfully managing the 
challenges of an expanding international group. The Board sets its 
specific future objectives at the end of each year and these reflect 
the particular focus of the Company in the year ahead. Progress 
against each objective is tracked by the Company Secretary and 
reviewed with the Chairman and the Board at the mid-year point.
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Senior 
Independent Director
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and 
the Chief Executive Officer, which is documented, clearly understood 
and approved by the Board.
Sir Terry Morgan is primarily responsible for leading the Board and 
ensuring its effectiveness. Dave Shemmans has direct responsibility 
for the Group on a day-to-day basis and is accountable to the Board 
for the financial and operational performance of the Group.
Dave Shemmans chairs the Executive Committee, which meets 
formally at least three times a year. The Executive Committee 
is primarily responsible for developing and implementing our 
corporate strategy and policies. 
The responsibilities of the Senior Independent Director are also 
documented and include the provision of an additional channel 
of communication between our Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors. The Senior Independent Director also provides an 
additional point of contact for our shareholders should they have 
concerns that communication through normal channels has failed to 
resolve their enquiry or where these contacts are inappropriate.
Board appointments
We recognise our responsibility for planned and progressive 
refreshing of the Board. There is a formal and transparent procedure 
for the appointment of new directors, the primary responsibility for 
which is delegated to the Nomination Committee. Further details 
of the work undertaken by the Committee during the year under 
review are contained on page 76. Our Board has continued to discuss 
matters relating to succession planning and talent management for 
leadership succession.
Diversity
Our Board is committed to promoting equality of opportunity for all 
employees and job applicants, free from all forms of discrimination. 
Ricardo is an inclusive employer and values diversity of skills, 
knowledge, background, industry and international experience and 
74   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
 Corporate governance statement gender in its employees and aims to recruit the best person for 
the role in all its positions Group-wide.
Our Board appreciates that a diverse range of backgrounds 
is an important part of succession planning at all levels in the 
Group. Our Board continually monitors tenure profile and is 
very conscious of the need to continue to promote diversity at 
Board level and throughout the Group. Upon engagement of 
external search consultants our Board requires that full account 
of all aspects of diversity are considered in preparing candidate 
lists. Details of the diversity of our workforce are described in the 
Strategic Report on pages 30 and 31.
Induction
There is a written framework for the full, formal and tailored 
induction of new directors. Malin Persson’s and Bill Spencer’s 
induction has and will include site visits, meetings with senior 
management and advisors and the provision of corporate 
documentation to facilitate their understanding of our business, its 
operations, key markets and risks.
Support and professional development
Our Chairman is responsible for ensuring the Directors receive 
accurate, timely and clear information, with Board and Committee 
papers being circulated sufficiently in advance of meetings.
The Board and its committees are kept informed of corporate 
governance and relevant regulatory developments as they arise 
through the Company Secretary.
In addition, we keep ourselves informed about the Group’s 
activities through a structured programme of presentations from 
each of the businesses within the Group and from a number 
of Group functional leaders. During the year under review we 
received presentations from the Group Human Resources Director 
and the Group Risk Manager, together with specific presentations 
on key projects for the business.
Directors are updated continually on the Group’s business 
with monthly performance packs and by means of additional 
presentations on matters including insurance, treasury, health and 
safety, and environmental risk management.
The Audit Committee is routinely briefed on accounting and 
technical matters by senior management and external auditors.
The Remuneration Committee receives updates on 
remuneration trends and market practices as part of its regularly 
scheduled business, and during the year under review FIT 
Remuneration Consultants LLP provided updates on the proposals 
and reporting requirements for executive remuneration.
Training for directors is available as required and is provided 
mainly by way of external courses. A register of the training 
that individual directors have undertaken is maintained by the 
Company Secretary and is reviewed by the Chairman individually 
with each Director as part of the Board evaluation process. The 
Board considers that it is the primary responsibility of each Director 
to identify the individual training and development needs he or 
she requires.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and each Director has been informed that, 
in the furtherance of his or her duties, they are entitled to seek 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. The 
Company arranges appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal 
actions against its Directors. In addition, the Company has entered 
into indemnities with its Directors as described on page 106.
Board evaluation
The Board undertakes a formal review of its performance and that 
of its Committees each year. Following recommendation by the 
Nomination Committee during 2016, the Board commissioned an 
externally-facilitated review, conducted by Condign Consulting 
Limited, with no other connection to the Company.
The review consisted of attendance at a Board meeting by 
Duncan Reed of Condign Consulting and one-to-one meetings 
with each of the Directors and the Company Secretary. 
The review and meetings were conducted towards the latter 
end of the previous financial year and a report was prepared which 
was discussed in detail by the Board in the July 2016 meeting. Areas 
for focus and improvement were identified and agreed.
Additionally, Ricardo’s auditors and remuneration consultants 
provide an evaluation on the performance of our Audit and 
Remuneration Committees, respectively.
Overall, the conclusion from the evaluation and appraisal process 
was positive, with each Director actively contributing to the 
effectiveness of the Board and the Committees of which he or she 
is a member.
Board committees
Our Board has Nomination, Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
Written terms of reference for each committee are reviewed 
annually and are available on our website, www.ricardo.com or on 
request from the Company Secretary.
REMUNERATION  
Composition 
The Remuneration Committee, which is chaired by Peter Gilchrist, 
comprises the independent Non-Executive Directors, Sir Terry 
Morgan, Ian Lee, Laurie Bowen, Malin Persson and, since his 
appointment on 24 April 201 7 , Bill Spencer.
Responsibilities
During the year, the Committee had four scheduled meetings. 
The work of the Committee, including the Chairman’s Overview, 
is described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 82 to 
105. The Directors’ Remuneration Report is the subject of a binding 
vote by shareholders at the 201 7 AGM.
ACCOUNTABILITY
This Report provides shareholders with a clear assessment of the 
Group’s and Company’s position and prospects, supplemented by 
other periodic financial and trading statements, as required.
The Board’s arrangements for the application of risk 
management and internal control principles are detailed on pages 
38 to 40. The Board has delegated oversight of the relationship 
with the Group’s and Company’s external auditors to the Audit 
Committee. Their work is outlined in the Audit Committee report 
on pages 77 to 81.

CHAIRMAN’S OVERVIEW
A key focus during the year has been the 
appointment of an additional Non-Executive 
Director. This appointment was managed in 
conjunction with recruitment consultants, the 
Inzito Partnership. Further details of this process are 
included in the Responsibilities section below. 
In the forthcoming year we will continue to focus

for management below Board level.
Sir Terry Morgan, CBE 
COMPOSITION
The Nomination Committee, which is chaired by Sir Terry 
Morgan, comprises the independent Non-Executive Directors, 
Peter Gilchrist, Ian Lee, Laurie Bowen, Malin Persson and, since 
his appointment on 24 April 2017 , Bill Spencer, together with the 
Chief Executive Officer, Dave Shemmans. The Committee has 
one scheduled meeting per year, which is supplemented by ad 
hoc meetings as necessary and informal meetings between the 
Committee members.
RESPONSIBILITIES
The Committee:
• evaluates the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of 
the Board;
• monitors the leadership needs and succession planning of the 
Company;
• considers the training needs of the executive and non-
executive members;
• regularly reviews the structure, size and composition of the 
Board; and
• makes recommendations to the Board for executive and non-
executive appointments.
Before such recommendations are made, descriptions of the 
roles and skills required in fulfilling these roles are prepared 
for particular appointments. To attract suitable candidates, 
appropriate external advice is taken and interviews conducted 
by at least two members of the Nomination Committee to 
ensure a balanced view.
The search for our new Non-Executive Director during the year 
was managed with the assistance of recruitment consultants, the 
Inzito Partnership, who have signed up to the voluntary Code 
of Conduct for executive search firms. The Inzito Partnership 
provided a shortlist of candidates who were interviewed by 
Dave Shemmans and Sir Terry Morgan. Peter Gilchrist, Ian Lee, 
Laurie Bowen and Malin Persson then interviewed Bill Spencer 
before it was unanimously agreed to offer Bill the role. Bill will 
undertake an extensive induction programme to ensure a 
rounded understanding of the business and our ambitions. The 
Inzito Partnership have no other connection with the Company.
When an appointment of a non-executive director is made, 
a formal letter is sent setting out clearly what is expected 
regarding time commitment, committee membership and 
involvement outside Board meetings. The chosen candidate 
is required to disclose to the Board any other significant 
commitments before the appointment can be ratified.
The Committee recognises the need for diversity, in its 
broadest sense, when considering the composition of the Board. 
Diversity in all its aspects, including gender diversity, continues 
to be important to the Company.
The Board’s policy on diversity is set out on pages 74 and 75, 
and the details of female representation elsewhere within the 
Group is set out on page 30.
The Chairman of the Committee is the Chairman of the Board, 
Sir Terry Morgan, except when a new Chairman of the Board is 
being sought, when it is the Senior Independent Director.
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, are subject 
to rigorous review when they continue to serve on the Board for 
any term beyond six years.

 Corporate governance statement AUDIT COMMITTEE
CHAIRMAN’S OVERVIEW
The Audit Committee takes an active role in 
discussing and evaluating risk, as delegated by 
the Board, to ensure that appropriate challenge 
and guidance is provided to management and 
continues to report its key considerations in respect 
of the significant accounting judgements taken by 
management during the year.
The Group has now materially completed the 
integration of the Rail business, together with the 
Motorcycle business acquired during the financial 
year, and the Committee has fully incorporated 
these businesses into its assessment of risk and 
internal audit. The Group has also acquired Control 
COMPOSITION
The Audit Committee, which is chaired by Ian Lee, comprises 
the independent Non-Executive Directors, Peter Gilchrist, Laurie 
Bowen and Malin Persson. Following his appointment on 24 
April 2017 , Bill Spencer also attended the July and September 
Committee meetings in anticipation of his planned succession 
of Ian Lee as Chairman of the Audit Committee with effect from 
the close of the AGM on 8 November 2017 . The competence and 
experience of the members of the Audit Committee is set out on 
pages 70 and 71, and is considered to be relevant to the sectors 
in which Ricardo operates.
The Committee’s Chairman, Ian Lee, has recent and relevant 
financial experience and a professional accountancy qualification 
as considered desirable by the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Guidance on Audit Committees, issued in April 2016. The 
Chairman, Executive Directors and the Company’s external 
auditors have standing invitations to attend all Committee 
meetings. In addition, the Committee meets our external 
auditors and the Head of Internal Audit without management 
being present at least once a year. The Committee has three 
scheduled meetings per year and ad hoc meetings as required. 
As set out on page 75, the performance of the Audit Committee 
has been evaluated and is considered to be effective.
Point Corporation subsequent to the year-end 
and the implications of this acquisition on risk 
management will be considered by the Committee 
during the course of the next financial year.
Following the introduction of the viability 
statement in the previous financial year, the 
Committee has reviewed the assumptions and 
results of stress-tested scenarios made by executive 
management in connection with the provision 
of an updated viability statement within this 201 7 
Annual Report and Accounts.
With the heightened risk to all businesses of 
cyber attacks, the Committee reviewed the 
effectiveness of general IT controls and the 
vulnerability of the Group to cyber risks, as well as 
how these vulnerabilities are being addressed.
I intend to step down as Non-Executive Director 
and Chairman of the Audit Committee at the close 
of the AGM on 8 November 201 7 and Bill Spencer 
will succeed me in this role. It has been a pleasure 
to oversee Ricardo’s success over the last nine 
years and I am confident that the breadth of Bill’s 
experience will be extremely valuable to Ricardo in 
the years ahead.

The Chairman of the Audit Committee meets regularly with the 
Head of Internal Audit and executive management on matters of 
risk, controls, audit and accounting.
The Audit Committee receives reports from management 
and internal audit on the effectiveness of the system of internal 
controls and risk management systems. The Committee also 
receives from the external auditors a report of matters arising 
during the course of the audit which the auditors deem to be of 
significance for the Audit Committee’s attention.
The Committee has completed its review of the effectiveness 
of the Group’s systems of internal control during the year and up 
to the date of the Annual Report, in accordance with the guidance 
on internal control published by the FRC. The Committee confirms 
that no significant failings or weaknesses were identified in the 
review.
The Committee meeting in September 2017 carried out a full 
review of the year-end consolidated financial statements and of 
the audit, based upon reports prepared by the Chief Financial 
Officer and the external auditors, together with taking into account 
any significant accounting policies, any changes to them and any 
significant estimates or judgements. A similar, but less detailed, 
review was carried out in February 2017 when the Interim Report 
was considered. At both of these meetings, management were 
challenged as to the existence of any significant or unusual 
transactions where the accounting treatment could be open to 
different interpretations.
The Committee also reviewed the processes to assure the 
integrity of the Annual Report and Accounts, in particular that the 
information presented in the report, when taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and contains the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
The July meetings in both 2017 and 2016 focused on the risk 
management process, the risk profile, terms of reference, the 
results of internal audits for the year, the plan for the following 
year, and the systems for internal control, together with the ethics 
and whistleblowing processes. At the July 2017 meeting it also 
reviewed the principles to be applied in respect of significant 
financial reporting issues and, together with the Board, also 
reviewed the assumptions used to form the basis of executive 
management’s viability statement, the results of which were 
reviewed in the September 2017 meeting.
The February 2017 meeting considered the Company’s 
approach to risk appetite and the risk profile of the Group.
The Audit Committee is authorised by the Board to seek and 
obtain any information it requires from any officer or employee of 
the Company and to obtain external legal or other independent 
professional advice as is deemed necessary by it. The topics covered 
by the Committee during the year under review included:
• Review of any significant financial reporting issues and judgements 
in respect of the condensed interim and consolidated year-end 
financial statements;
• Review of any significant matters raised by the internal auditors;
• Review of risk management processes and impact assessment on 
the risk profile of the Group as a result of recent acquisitions;
• Discussion and evaluation of risk, as delegated by the Board, to 
ensure that appropriate challenge and guidance is provided to 
management;
• Review of the assumptions used to perform the assessment and 
confirmation made in connection with the viability statement;
• Consideration of the audit fee and the balance between audit and 
non-audit fees;
• Annual review of the terms of reference of the Committee;
• Evaluation of auditor independence and effectiveness;
• Recommending the re-appointment of the external auditors;
• Review of the effectiveness of internal control systems; and
• Review of the effectiveness of IT general controls and the reduction 
of vulnerability to cyber risks.
Significant financial reporting issues considered by 
the Audit Committee
The Committee receives and considers reports from the Chief 
Financial Officer and senior management in relation to the critical 
accounting judgements, key sources of estimation uncertainty, 
proposed disclosure of these in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, 
and on the outcome of the interim review and annual audit. 
The Committee supports PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in 
displaying the necessary professional scepticism their role requires. 
Following discussions with management and the external auditor, 
the Committee approved the critical accounting judgements and 
proposed disclosure. 
The Committee considered the following significant issues and 
judgements in approving the 2017 financial statements:
Contract accounting and performance
The Group derives a significant proportion of its revenue from fixed-
price contracts that may extend for a substantial period of time. All 
contracts are based on detailed proposals issued to clients which are 
approved in accordance with the Group’s authority limits, which may 
include Board approval where contract values dictate. Revenue and 
margin performance is measured based on costs incurred to date 
as a percentage of total expected costs. Management judgement 
and experience is required to determine the completeness of those 
forecasts, the recoverability of the costs incurred and the revenue 
recognised on contracts. Unforeseen future events may adversely 
impact the accuracy of those forecasts and recoverability judgements.
Project risk is assessed and determined at the proposal stage of a 
contract and is refreshed throughout the life of a contract on a regular 
basis. The risk rating of a contract is categorised into five levels, with 
one being the lowest and five being the highest. The risk category 
of a contract is determined from the application of quantitative and 
qualitative criteria. As a contract progresses the project is allocated a 
‘red’, ‘amber’ or ‘green’ rating to categorise its performance against a 
number of factors, including cost and cash performance, schedule, 
78   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
 Corporate governance statement customer relationship, availability of resources and technical 
complexity.
High-risk contracts (Category 4 and 5 contracts) which experience 
significant challenges are categorised internally as ‘red’ contracts, 
which are monitored and controlled at the senior management level 
and reported as appropriate to the Board as part of the monthly 
performance review. Net Group project over- and under-spends 
are also monitored and reported to the Board on a monthly basis. 
A summary of these ‘Red Category 4/5’ contracts is presented bi-
annually by senior management to the Committee at the February 
and September meetings, where the significant judgements taken 
are reviewed, challenged and evaluated. Following the September 
review, the Committee satisfied itself with the judgements taken 
by management with regards to the Red Category 4/5 contracts. In 
addition, these contracts were subjected to a more focused level of 
audit work during the external audit process.
Capitalisation and carrying value of development costs
Certain directly attributable costs incurred in the development of 
an intangible asset are capitalised. These costs are recognised as an 
asset once the Group has determined that it has the intention and 
the necessary resources to complete the relevant project, and it is 
probable that the resulting asset will generate economic benefits 
for the Group and the attributable expenditure can be measured 
reliably. Determining whether it is probable that the resulting asset 
will generate economic benefit requires management judgement. 
During the year ended 30 June 2017 , £3.1m of development 
costs were capitalised and amortisation of £3.0m was charged. 
The net book value of development assets as at 30 June 2017 after 
reclassification adjustments of £0.1m was £8.4m.
The Committee received reports from senior management 
detailing their analysis and the assumptions used when assessing 
whether the costs incurred during the year met the requirements for 
capitalisation under IFRS. The reports also assessed whether future 
economic benefits support the recoverability of all development 
assets. The Committee reviewed, challenged and evaluated the 
significant judgements taken and was satisfied that both the level 
of capitalisation during the year and the carrying value of the 
development assets was appropriate. In addition, this matter was a 
key focus for the external audit.
Deferred taxation
The Group holds a £9.3m deferred tax asset in relation to 
accumulated tax losses in Germany and R&D tax credits in the US, 
as outlined in Note 26(b), ‘Deferred tax’, to the financial statements. 
A key management judgement is the extent to which deferred tax 
should be recognised in respect of these accumulated tax losses 
and R&D tax credits and recovered against future profits. 
The Committee received reports and detailed analysis from senior 
management which included the assumptions used when assessing 
the recoverability of the deferred tax asset. This assessment included 
the derecognition of £1.5m (€1.7m) of the German deferred tax asset, 
reducing the asset to £2.4m (€2.7m). This was as a result of further 
contract losses recognised during the year and an extension to the 
expected period of utilisation against future profits.
The Committee critically evaluated and challenged the 
appropriateness of management’s business plans and expectations 
which underpin future taxable profits. The Committee was 
satisfied that the carrying value of the deferred tax asset was 
appropriate. In addition, this matter was a key focus of the external 
audit. 
Internal audit
As set out in the Strategic Report on page 38, internal audit is 
considered by the Committee to be a key function for effective risk 
management. Internal audit and risk comprises both the Group 
risk and internal audit function. Whilst the Group risk function 
facilitates and manages the risk process that is ultimately owned by 
the Board, internal audit is accountable to the Audit Committee.
Internal audit is centrally managed and led by suitably skilled 
staff from head office or parts of the business independent 
from the business or function being audited. It is resourced by 
staff from around the Group with suitable skills, experience and 
independence from the area they are auditing. 
Where relevant, external specialists are used to supplement 
internal resources when specialist knowledge is required. This 
approach not only ensures independence in the process but also 
the relevance of the recommendations and the sharing of best 
practice around the Group.
The following examples illustrate how internal audit work 
supports Group risk management whilst driving improvements to 
our control environment and adding value in core business areas:
• Project reviews look at a range of risk and process control areas 
across projects in divisions: these reviews identify best-practice 
techniques which can be shared across divisions, and ensure 
that lessons learned have been applied;
• Selected in-depth process reviews evaluate control risks and 
efficiency, leading to re-evaluation of risks during the risk review 
processes; and
• Testing of controls and process awareness in our Fraud and 
Bribery Risk Assessment.
Management actions from all of our internal audits are tracked to 
completion and the status of these actions is reported to the Audit 
Committee to ensure that the risks identified are appropriately 
addressed.
As part of the annual process the Committee’s review of the 
effectiveness of the internal audit function includes:
• The internal audit process, the audit plan and resources;
• The internal audit reports and management’s response to the 
findings and recommendations; and
• Meetings with the Head of Internal Audit without management 
being present; additionally, the Head of Internal Audit is invited 
to attend audit committee meetings where considered 
appropriate.
The Audit Committee considers that the internal audit process 
is an effective tool in the overall context of the Group’s risk 
management system.
Whistleblowing, ethics and fraud prevention
Internal audit scope includes a review of compliance with Group 
policies, including established whistleblowing, ethics, Bribery Act 
and fraud prevention policies.
  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   79
Group overview Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report Case studies
Corporate governance statement The whistleblowing policy is designed to deal with concerns, 
which must be raised without malice, in relation to specific issues 
which are in the public interest and which fall outside the scope 
of other Company policies and procedures. The whistleblowing 
policy is overseen by the Chairman of the Audit Committee, and 
has been reviewed during the year and is promoted via the staff 
briefing process and the Company’s intranet site. No such matters 
were reported to the Committee during the year.
External audit
One of the Committee’s duties under its Terms of Reference is 
to ensure that at least once every ten years, commencing 1 July 
2013, the audit services contract is put out to tender to enable 
the Committee to compare the quality and effectiveness of the 
services provided by the incumbent auditor with those of other 
audit firms. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were appointed as 
external auditors in 1990 and no formal tender for audit services 
has been conducted to date since their appointment.
Subject to shareholder approval at the AGM in November 
2017 , it is expected that the audit services contract will remain 
with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the financial year ending 
30 June 2018. In addition, and subject to Board and shareholder 
approval, it is expected that the audit services contract will be 
put out to tender during the next financial year and that the 
appointment of the selected audit firm will commence after the 
AGM in November 2018. This would coincide with the conclusion 
of the five-year rotation cycle of the incumbent audit partner from 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , Andrew Paynter, who has been the 
audit partner for four years.
The external auditors are required to give the Committee 
information about policies and processes for maintaining their 
independence and compliance with requirements regarding the 
rotation of audit partners and staff.
Both the Board and the external auditors have for many years 
had safeguards in place to avoid the possibility that the auditors’ 
objectivity and independence could be compromised. 
The Committee considers all relationships between the external 
auditors and the Group to ensure that they do not compromise 
the auditors’ judgement or independence, particularly with the 
provision of audit-related and other non-audit services where a 
policy relating to these has been agreed by the Board.
The external auditors would be precluded from carrying out 
non-audit services if they are put in the position of auditing their 
own work, making management decisions for the Group, if a 
mutual interest between the Group and the auditors is created, 
or if the auditors take on the role of an advocate for the Group. 
The provision of certain non-audit services is also specifically 
prohibited. Our policy in respect of non-audit services provided by 
the external auditors is as follows:
Audit-related services
The external auditors are invited to provide services which, in their 
position as auditors, they must or are best placed to undertake. 
This includes review of the interim results and any other review 
of the financial statements for regulatory purposes; assurance 
work related to accounting standards, compliance and corporate 
governance, including high-level controls; work in connection 
with listing particulars and prospectuses, if required; and regulatory 
reviews or reviews commissioned by the Audit Committee.
Approval of audit-related services which are routinely provided by 
the auditor, such as the review of the interim results, are delegated 
to the Audit Committee Chairman and the CFO. Prior approval by 
the Audit Committee Chairman is required for other audit-related 
services where the cost is estimated to exceed £50,000. Such 
services are pre-approved if estimated to cost less than £50,000 on 
the basis that the cost and nature of those services is considered to 
be clearly trivial.
Other non-audit services
There may be occasions when the external auditors are best 
placed to provide other accounting, advisory, consultancy and 
due diligence work on behalf of the Group due to their in-depth 
knowledge of the business. However, the following services are 
specifically prohibited:
• Tax services relating to the preparation or calculation of any form 
of tax, supporting tax inspections (unless required by law) or the 
provision of tax advice;
• Bookkeeping and preparing accounting records and financial 
statements;
• Payroll and human resources services, including organisational 
structure design and cost control;
• Secondments to management positions that involve any 
decision-making;
• Services relating to the internal audit function, or design 
and implementation of internal control or risk management 
procedures;
• Valuations, including actuarial or litigation support services;
• Legal services, including the provision of general counsel, 
negotiating or acting in an advocacy role in the resolution of 
litigation;
• Services linked to financing, capital structure and allocation, and 
investment strategy;
• Promoting, dealing in, or underwriting shares; and
• Any other work which is prohibited by UK ethical guidance.
Prior approval by the Audit Committee Chairman is required for 
non-audit services provided by the external auditors in respect of 
acquisitions and disposals where the cost is estimated to exceed 
£50,000. Prior approval by the Committee as a whole is required for 
any other permissible non-audit services provided by the external 
auditors in excess of £50,000. Such services are pre-approved if 
estimated to cost less than £50,000 on the basis that the cost and 
nature of those services is considered to be clearly trivial.
From 30 June 2020, non-audit services are prohibited from 
exceeding more than 70 per cent of the average audit fees for the 
preceding three-year period. The split and ratio between audit and 
non-audit fees for the year ended 30 June 2017 and information 
on the nature of non-audit fees are disclosed in Note 6, ‘Auditors’ 
remuneration’, to the financial statements.
Other business relationships
There are instances where the Energy & Environment business 
enters into business relationships or joint arrangements with the 
external auditors to pursue commercial opportunities, either as a 
80   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
 Corporate governance statement prime contractor, sub-contractor or as part of a consortium, with 
either party or a third party being the project manager.
These business relationships are considered acceptable to the 
extent that the resulting relationships remain immaterial to both 
organisations and do not compromise the auditors’ independence. 
In addition, the following arrangements would lead to a conclusion 
that the relationship with the auditor is material, and hence they are 
not permitted:
• Co-branding, profit-sharing or other joint sharing of economic 
benefit; or
• Any member of the audit firm’s audit engagement team having 
client-facing involvement.
The following policy applies:
• The maximum allowable annual revenue derived from non-audit 
client-facing relationships between Ricardo and the external 
auditors is £1,000,000. In the event that this might be exceeded, 
the CFO, Audit Committee Chairman and audit engagement 
partner shall recommend action to the Audit Committee;
• The audit firm’s engagement partner must be involved prior 
to the agreement to bid, through the CFO, Group Financial 
Controller or Group Risk Manager;
• Prospective contracts in excess of £100,000 must be approved 
by the CFO and the Audit Committee Chairman before the bid is 
released; and
• Prospective contracts lower than £100,000 must be approved by 
the CFO, Group Financial Controller or Group Risk Manager.
All bids must be structured to ensure that no commonality of 
interest exists, or could be perceived to exist, between the two 
parties.
The Audit Committee confirms that during the year it has 
maintained formal and transparent arrangements for considering 
corporate reporting, risk management and internal control and for 
maintaining an appropriate relationship with the external auditors.
Independent auditors’ effectiveness
The independent auditors’ quality and effectiveness is assessed 
on its own merits on an annual basis after the completion of each 
audit. The Committee carried out a formal effectiveness assessment 
of the external auditors, including:
• The continuity and objectivity of the audit partner and audit 
team;
• Effectiveness of audit planning, execution and reporting;
• The role of management in ensuring an effective audit; and
• Communication with and support of the Audit Committee.
The assessment was completed with input from an internal 
questionnaire completed by senior and relevant finance staff. 
The Committee also considered the external auditors’ annual 
transparency report on its own internal quality control procedures.
Re-appointment of independent auditors
The Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that the 
re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be proposed to 
shareholders at the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS 
Shareholder dialogue
The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer 
regularly meet with institutional shareholders to foster a mutual 
understanding of objectives, answer their questions and to keep 
them updated on our performance and plans.
These meetings range from one-to-one discussions to group 
presentations and investor conference calls following our results 
announcements. Any presentations provided in these meetings are 
uploaded to our website and comments are fed back to us.
Additionally, the Chairman communicates with key shareholders 
at least once a year and the Chairman, the Senior Independent 
Director and the Chairman of the Audit Committee are available 
for discussions with major shareholders, if required. The Chairman 
also looks to shareholder groups’ annual voting guidelines to better 
understand their policies on governance and voting.
The Chair of the Remuneration Committee engaged with 
majority shareholders in May 201 7 to discuss and gain input to the 
Company’s revised Directors’ Remuneration Policy. Further details 
are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 86 to 
94.
For an independent view, Investec, the capital markets advisory 
firm, provides us with regular reviews of major investors’ views on 
company management and performance. Surveys of shareholder 
opinion are normally carried out following announcements of 
results and are circulated to the Board.
Ricardo’s AGM
The Notice of Meeting sets out the resolutions being proposed at 
the AGM on 8 November 201 7 at 10:00am. Last year all resolutions 
were passed with votes ranging from 99% to 100%. Shareholders 
unable to attend the AGM are encouraged to vote in advance of the 
meeting.
The AGM in November 2016 was attended by all Directors in 
office at the time of the meeting. The Directors encourage the 
participation of all shareholders, including private investors, at the 
AGM and as a matter of policy the level of proxy votes (for, against 
and vote withheld) lodged on each resolution is declared at the 
meeting and displayed on the Company’s website.
Ricardo’s website, www.ricardo.com, contains a wealth of 
information, including:
• Latest Ricardo news, stock exchange announcements and press 
releases; and
• Annual report and investor presentations.

Corporate governance statement PART 1 – CHAIRMAN’S SUMMARY
Dear Shareholder, 
Chairman’s overview
Ricardo’s 201 7 Annual Report shows that 
the Company has continued to pursue and 
execute its long-standing strategy amidst 
an operating environment of change and 
uncertainty. We have continued to manage 
the Group for growth by maintaining 
investment both in acquisitions and organic 
growth. The most recent acquisitions 
expand both the motorcycle division with 
Exnovo, and Ricardo Defense Systems in 
the US with Control Point Corporation 
(the latter of which completed post year-
end). Ricardo’s underlying profit before 
tax (‘PBT’) was 2% up on the previous 
year (before adjustments for acquisition-
related expenditure) and our net debt 
was £(37 .9)m compared with £(34.4)m 
last year. Although our Rail and Energy & 
Environment Divisions performed strongly, 
the performance of our Automotive Division 
has been volatile. The combined effects of 
Brexit, the US elections and the intense diesel 
debate have created uncertainty and extremely 
challenging conditions. The consequence is 
that, despite a creditable performance in parts 
of the business, no annual bonuses will be paid 
to the Executive Directors for the financial year 
even though they have made sound, long-
term decisions and performed very well against 
their personal objectives. The Annual Report 
on Remuneration says more on page 99. 
We remain confident, however, that the 
strategic priorities are right. These priorities 
have endured for several years under the 
leadership of Dave Shemmans, Ricardo’s 
CEO, and have delivered significant value to 
our shareholders. Over the last five financial 
years, Ricardo’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’) 
has grown by 155.3% and by 29% over the 
last three. The TSR chart on page 97 shows 
Ricardo’s TSR performance over the last eight 
years. 
Peter Gilchrist – Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Directors’ remuneration report
82   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
  Pay outcomes and the review of our 
policy in 2016/2017
Our superior performance over the three 
years following Ricardo’s long-term share 
awards made in October 2014 has resulted 
in a second year in which all the shares 
under award have vested. EPS growth over 
the period was 56% and, in real terms, 14.6% 
a year. The Remuneration Committee’s 
policy seeks to ensure a direct link between 
pay and performance; the pay outcomes 
during the year in respect of the long-term 
incentive arrangements and the annual 
bonus demonstrate the implementation of 
this policy.
The Remuneration Committee has taken 
time during the year to review the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (‘the Policy’) and 
we have also engaged with our top 20 
shareholders and the voting guidance 
services on the proposed new Policy. At 
the Annual General Meeting in November, 
shareholders will be asked to approve this 
new Policy. Our strategic aims remain the 
same as they were in 2014 and hence the 
new Policy will remain substantially the 
same although we are proposing some 
modifications in light of shareholders’ views. 
The modifications that we are proposing to 
the Policy are, in brief, as follows:
• The extension of clawback provisions to 
the annual cash bonus and the shares 
awarded which are linked to the cash 
bonus. 
• The tightening up of Ricardo’s share 
ownership policy which makes the 
ownership guideline of 100% a minimum. 
Our longest-serving Executive Directors, 
namely Dave Shemmans and Mark 
Garrett, already hold shares to the value of 
168% and 340% of salary, respectively. Our 
policy approach takes into account (i) the 
requirement that 100% of the net value of 
vested long-term incentive shares must 
be retained until Executive Directors have 
reached the minimum holding required as 
well as (ii) the face value of awards under 
those arrangements (further described on 
page 101). 
• Limits will be imposed on all elements of 
pay. 
As the summary of our Policy shows on 
page 85, we are retaining the so-called 
deferred bonus matching shares. The 
Remuneration Committee has looked at 
whether these shares should be eliminated 
in favour of shares awarded under the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan. We have decided 
that to do so would forfeit the double 
performance test which applies to the 
deferred bonus matching shares. Under the 
current and proposed Policy, the Executive 
Directors must first earn a bonus and then 
defer half of it before the ‘matching’ shares 
are awarded. 
Some of our shareholders have suggested 
that we should simplify Ricardo’s long-term 
incentive arrangements and have also 
questioned why the same performance 
measures and targets apply to all the 
shares. We have, in response, simplified the 
language that we use to describe the shares 
to make clearer that the Remuneration 
Committee views Ricardo’s long-term 
share-based incentive arrangements as 
comprising a single share award which 
will normally vest three years after grant. 
Part of the award (now called the Bonus-
Linked Shares) is dependent on a bonus 
being earned, investment by the Executive 
Director and that investment being retained 
for three years. This means that it will only 
be made if a bonus is earned. The extension 
  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   83
Group overview Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report Case studies
Directors’ remuneration report intend to maintain an approach to target 
setting which we believe is both fair to 
shareholders and to the leadership team.
We have decided to change the approach 
for the awards which will be made in 
November 201 7 to enhance ‘line of 
sight’, simplify and also to recognise the 
international scope of Ricardo. As we 
explain on page 105, we have decided to 
set absolute EPS targets and to express the 
desired range of EPS outcomes. The target 
range will still be set based on the business 
plan (which, in turn, is based on our long-
term strategy) and consensus forecasts. 
Conclusion
I hope that our shareholders will find the 
2016/1 7 Directors’ Remuneration Report 
clear and helpful. Our last Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and the Annual 
Report on Remuneration both received 
over 98% of votes in favour and I continue 
to be grateful for this support. If you have 
any questions, feel free to contact me 
through Ricardo’s Group Legal Counsel and 
Company Secretary, Patricia Ryan, at  
patricia.ryan@ricardo.com
Peter Gilchrist
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
and alignment of Ricardo’s clawback 
provisions, so that they can be applied 
in the same way to all share-based pay, 
reinforces our policy objective here.
The figures above illustrate that we think 
the current approach creates a stronger link 
between pay and performance, which is 
particularly apparent in a year in which no 
bonus is paid. 
We are not proposing to introduce longer 
performance or vesting periods in excess 
of three years, although the extension of 
clawback provisions to all variable pay will 
allow us to reclaim remuneration for three 
years after payment or two years after 
vesting. We think three-year performance 
periods remain appropriate for a company 
like Ricardo where business cycles tend to 
be short.
Other activities in 2016/17
It might be helpful to know that we 
increased the basic salaries of the executive 
directors from 1 January 201 7 by 3%, which 
was the average increase across the Group. 
We also looked carefully at the approach 
to measuring growth in Earnings Per Share 
(‘EPS’) for the purposes of the long-term 
incentive arrangements. Annual compound 
EPS growth has for several years been 
measured against Retail Price Index (‘RPI’) 
inflation and the target range has been 
compound annual growth of 3% to 10% 
in excess of RPI. The vesting outcomes, 
as a percentage of the maximum award, 
have ranged from 35% to 100% over the 
last seven years and averaged 66%. We

Directors’ remuneration report PART 2 – DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY 
Introduction
This Directors’ Remuneration Policy provides an overview of 
the Company’s policy on directors’ pay that is designed to align 
with and support Ricardo’s strategic plan and operate over 
the next three years from the AGM to be held on 8 November 
2017 (the ‘2017 AGM’) until the AGM to be held in 2020. The 
previous policy that was approved by shareholders at the AGM 
held on 29 October 2014 will continue to operate until the 2017 
AGM and indeed the new policy will permit the execution 
of remuneration arrangements that were agreed when the 
previous policy was in effect. 
In accordance with the requirements of the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (as amended) (the ‘Regulations’), the policy 
contained in this part will be subject to a binding vote at the 
2017 AGM and will take effect immediately upon receipt of such 
approval from shareholders. 
As discussed in the Chairman’s introductory letter, following 
a thorough and careful review of the structure of the 2014 
policy, its operation in our business and the views of our 
largest shareholders, their industry bodies and other corporate 
governance commentators, the Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee – what we do
The Committee’s primary purpose is to make recommendations to the Board on the Group’s framework or broad policy for executive remuneration. The 
Board has also delegated responsibility to the Committee for determining the remuneration, benefits and contractual arrangements of the Chairman 
and the executive directors. No individual is involved in deciding his or her remuneration. 
The Committee has written terms of reference, which are available at www.ricardo.com, and its responsibilities include:
• determining and agreeing with the Board the policy for executive remuneration and monitoring and considering the policy for and structure 
of senior management remuneration taking into account that the ultimate decision-making responsibility for the remuneration of the senior 
management team (other than the executive directors) lies with the Chief Executive Officer;
• agreeing the terms and conditions of employment for executive directors, including their individual annual remuneration and pension arrangements, 
and reviewing such provisions for senior management;
• agreeing the measures and targets for any performance-related bonus and share schemes;
• agreeing the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board;
• ensuring that, on termination, contractual terms and payments made are fair both to the Company and the individual so that failure is not rewarded 
and the duty to mitigate loss is recognised wherever possible; and
• agreeing the terms of reference of any remuneration advisors it appoints.
Taking shareholders’ views into account
When considering Ricardo’s remuneration policy and its implementation, 
the Committee is always keen to ensure that it takes into account the 
views and opinions of all the relevant stakeholders in the business. In 
particular, when preparing its policy for approval at the 2017 AGM, the 
Committee undertook a programme of engagement with the Company’s 
largest institutional investors and their representative bodies in order to 
better understand their perspective on our existing pay practices and 
the proposed new policy for 2017-2020. Shareholders were given an 
early opportunity to raise any questions and in finalising the proposals 
a number of questions were raised and answered: for example, on the 
use of the same performance measures in respect of the deferred bonus 
matching shares and the change in nomenclature to the Bonus-Linked 
Shares. Both are designed to simplify Ricardo’s long-term incentive 
arrangements.
In the spirit of continuous improvement and in order to ensure that our 
remuneration policy continues fully to support achievement of business 
objectives and delivery of value to shareholders, the Committee will 
continue to review our policy periodically in the context of the changing 
business environment. Any material future changes to policy will be 
discussed with shareholders in advance.
Consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Company
While Ricardo does not consult directly with employees on the subject 
of directors’ remuneration, the remuneration packages for each executive 
director and their fixed and variable elements are reviewed annually. This 
process takes into account a number of factors, including the following:
• Individual and business performance;
• Pay arrangements for similar roles in other companies and consultancy 
organisations of Ricardo’s size, complexity and international reach;
• Risk management; and
• Pay and employment conditions of employees of the Group.
The Remuneration Committee also looks at the differential between the 
CEO’s pay and Ricardo’s average employee earnings over time. 
 
is satisfied that this policy continues to support Ricardo. The 
policy motivates the executive team and supports the essential 
alignment between the Group’s strategy and shareholders’ 
interests. Consequently, the new policy to be proposed at the 
2017 AGM remains the same as the 2014 policy, save that it:
1. Introduces – as far as possible – ceilings on the elements of 
our policy which are not yet capped, namely base salary and 
benefits.
2. Aligns and extends the clawback provisions which already 
apply to shares awarded under the Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (‘LTIP’) to the annual cash bonus and deferred bonus 
shares (i.e. both the shares invested by each individual and 
the accompanying contingent award of performance shares). 
This change does two things. It ensures that malus and 
clawback provisions apply to all Ricardo’s variable pay. It also 
underscores the view held by the Remuneration Committee 
that the deferred bonus matching shares (now called the 
Bonus-Linked Shares) are effectively LTIP shares but with an 
additional pre-grant performance linkage which determines 
(a) whether an award is made in the year and (b) the size of 
that award.
3. Has been simplified in terms of presentation.
86   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
 Directors’ remuneration report Overview of Ricardo’s proposed remuneration policy for 2017-2020
The objective of Ricardo’s executive remuneration policy is to support the business strategy and timescales of an international 
consultancy business by not only rewarding the standard of performance and the outcomes that our shareholders require, but also 
encouraging share ownership and fostering alignment of interest between the executive directors and shareholders. We do this by 
setting base levels of salary that are competitive, compared with companies of similar size and complexity to Ricardo, and providing 
other remuneration package elements, namely the short-term annual bonus plan and long-term incentive arrangement, that only 
pay for performance. Taken together, our two variable pay platforms focus on growing the profitability of the business, its resilience, 
the achievement of discrete non-financial targets and linking executive outcomes with the shareholder experience both by delivering 
rewards in the form of Ricardo shares and also by using a relative total shareholder return performance measure over the longer term. 
The remuneration policy proposed for shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM is:
• simple and straightforward;
• well-understood, both internally and externally;
• competitive but fair; and
• aligned to performance.
THE STRUCTURE OF OUR DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION PACKAGE – THE POLICY TABLE
Pay element and 
link to strategy Maximum Operation Framework for assessing performance
Base salary
To provide a core 
level of remuneration 
to enable the 
Company to 
attract and retain 
skilled, high-calibre 
executives to deliver 
its strategy
Base salary increases 
will not ordinarily be 
more than 10% p.a. 
with exceptional 
increases over the 
normal maximum 
limit capped at 25% 
p.a.. 
However, generally 
speaking, increases 
will be in line with 
salary increases for 
employees across 
the Group.
Salary levels are reviewed annually in January each 
year.
Pay is set by considering market levels of total pay 
for comparable roles in companies of similar size, 
complexity and sector, as well as each individual 
director’s experience, scope of responsibilities and 
performance and the salary increases for employees 
across the Group.
Ricardo places a strong emphasis on internal 
succession planning. This emphasis may mean that 
talented individuals are promoted rapidly. In such 
circumstances, the Committee’s policy is to set a 
relatively low base salary initially and then increase 
this to a market competitive level for the role over 
time. This may mean relatively high annual salary 
increases as the individual gains experience in the 
new role. We will notify shareholders where this is 
the case.
None
Other benefits
To provide market-
competitive benefits
The total value of 
benefits will not 
exceed 10% of 
base salary p.a., 
save in the case of 
relocation.
The Company provides other cash benefits and 
benefits in kind to executive directors in line with 
market practice. These include a company car or cash 
alternative, private fuel, private medical insurance, 
life assurance and permanent health / disability 
insurance. The benefits arrangements are reviewed 
on an annual basis.
The Committee reserves the right to provide further 
benefits where this is appropriate in the individual’s 
particular circumstances (for example costs 
associated with relocation as a result of the director’s 
role with the Company).
Certain other employees are eligible for the same or 
similar benefits described above depending on their 
role, seniority and geographical location.
None

Pension
To offer market-
competitive 
retirement benefits
For the Chief 
Executive Officer, 
the pension 
contribution is 
21.2% of salary 
over the Lower 
Earnings Limit due 
to legacy pension 
arrangements.
For all other 
executive directors, 
the pension 
contribution is 20% 
of salary over the 
Lower Earnings 
Limit.
The Company operates a Defined Contribution 
Scheme, the Ricardo International Pension Scheme 
(‘RIPS’). The policy for executive directors (save for 
the CEO’s legacy pension arrangements described 
opposite) continues to be a pension contribution 
of 20% of base salary only over the Lower Earnings 
Limit. Contributions are made up to the adjusted 
annual allowance limit and the rest paid as cash in 
lieu of pension.
Executive directors may only choose to opt out of the 
RIPS where they are close to or have exceeded the 
pension lifetime allowance and have applied for fixed 
protection from HMRC. Under such circumstances, 
executive directors will receive a cash payment in lieu 
of pension.
On death in service, all executive directors, subject to 
the medical requirements of the insurance company, 
are entitled to a lump sum of four times annual salary 
at date of death.
Early retirement is available with the consent of the 
Company and the pension scheme trustees if the 
individual is over 55 or retiring due to ill health.
The same policy approach applies to all employees 
although contribution levels vary by seniority.

Pay for 
performance: 
Annual bonus
To reward the annual 
delivery of financial 
and operational 
targets
Maximum 
opportunity of 
125% of base salary 
for the CEO and 
100% of salary for 
other executive 
directors.
Bonuses are awarded by reference to 
performance against specific targets measured 
over a single financial year. 
One half of any bonus paid to an executive director 
will be paid out shortly after the assessment of 
the performance targets has been completed. The 
remainder of the bonus will be compulsorily deferred 
into ordinary shares, the vesting of which is normally 
subject to continued employment for a three-year 
period from the award date. The cash element of the 
bonus is not payable unless the individual remains in 
employment at the payment date.
The principal purpose of this bonus deferral 
mechanism is to:
• provide for further alignment of executives’ and 
shareholders’ interests;
• provide an additional retention element; and
• encourage executive directors to build up a 
shareholding in accordance with our share 
retention policy.
Dividends and dividend equivalents for each deferral 
period may also be paid in respect of shares under 
award to the extent that shares have vested in 
participants.
Bonus arrangements exist for certain other 
employees throughout the Group on terms that are 
applicable to their role, seniority and geographical 
location, although typically at lower levels of 
maximum opportunity to reflect that a greater 
proportion of executive directors’ remuneration is 
performance based. 
Malus / clawback: Annual bonuses (including any 
element deferred into shares) may be subject to 
malus and/or clawback provisions if certain events 
occur in the period of three years from the end of 
the financial year to which they relate. These events 
include the Committee becoming aware of: 
• a material misstatement of the Company’s 
financial results;
• an error in the calculation of performance 
conditions; and/or
• an act committed by the relevant participant 
that could have resulted in summary dismissal by 
reason of gross misconduct or which has caused 
significant reputational damage to the Group.
The mechanism through which malus / clawback 
can be implemented enables the Committee to take 
various actions including:
• reducing outstanding incentive awards; and
• requiring a cash payment to be made by 
participants.
The measures and targets applicable to the annual 
bonus scheme (and the different weightings ascribed 
to them) are set annually by the Committee in order 
to ensure they are relevant to participants and take 
account of the most up-to-date business plan and 
strategy. 
A significant majority (at least 50%) of the bonus 
opportunity will normally be determined by 
reference to performance against Group KPIs such as:
• PBT; and
• cash balance. 
Any remaining part of a director’s bonus will 
normally be based on the achievement of personal 
objectives which relate to delivery of the business 
strategy. Examples include the development and 
efficient execution of the strategic plan, developing 
the business in emerging markets, identifying 
opportunities for inorganic growth and succession 
planning. 
A payment scale for different levels of achievement 
against each performance target is specified by the 
Committee at the outset of each year – this ranges 
from 0% for below-threshold performance up to 
100% for full satisfaction of the relevant target.

Bonus-Linked Shares – performance measured 
over an aggregate four-year period:
Assuming that a satisfactory level of performance is 
achieved over the financial year in which the annual 
bonus is assessed (the first year in the four-year 
aggregate performance period) which results in a 
bonus being paid, executive directors will be granted 
a Bonus-Linked Share award over further shares (up 
to a maximum of 1 for 1) in relation to the deferred 
element of the bonus. Consequently, in a year when 
there is no annual bonus, no Bonus-Linked Share 
award will be made thus providing a well-understood 
and automatic mechanism for reducing the overall 
quantum of awards in the year where performance 
targets have not been met in full.
Bonus-Linked Share awards will be granted pursuant 
to the rules of the Ricardo plc 2011 Deferred Bonus 
Plan (the ‘2011 DBP’), for which shareholder approval 
was given at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
LTIP – performance measured over a three-year 
period:
Performance share awards under the LTIP are made 
on an annual basis to the executive directors and a 
small group of other senior executives. 
Dividends and equivalents
Dividends and dividend equivalents for each 
performance period may also be paid in respect of 
shares under award to the extent that shares have 
vested in participants.
Malus / clawback: Long-term incentive awards may 
be subject to malus and/or clawback provisions if 
certain events occur after their grant but before the 
expiry of the period of two years from the end of the 
relevant performance period. These events include 
the Committee becoming aware of: 
• a material misstatement of the Company’s 
financial results;
• an error in the calculation of performance 
conditions; and/or
• an act committed by the relevant participant 
that could have resulted in summary dismissal by 
reason of gross misconduct or which has caused 
significant reputational damage to the Group.
The mechanism through which malus / clawback 
can be implemented enables the Committee to take 
various actions including:
• reducing outstanding incentive awards; and
• requiring a cash payment to be made by 
participants.
Finally, where the vesting of a deferred bonus share 
award is reduced, the vesting of any associated 
Bonus-Linked Share award will accordingly be 
reduced.
In addition to the initial performance period to 
determine whether Bonus-Linked Share awards 
are made, the vesting of all long-term incentives 
is subject to both continued employment and the 
extent to which performance conditions measured 
over a further specified three-year period are met.
The measures and targets applicable to the long-
term incentive awards will consist of challenging 
shareholder return, financial and/or strategic 
measures.
The particular measures and targets to apply (and 
the different weightings ascribed to them) will be set 
annually by the Committee in order to ensure they 
are relevant to participants, challenging to achieve 
and take account of the most up-to-date business 
plan and strategy. The current weightings between 
the two long-term incentive measures that we use 
are equal; however our policy is simply for financial 
and/or shareholder return targets to make up at least 
50% of awards. 
25% of each element of an award will vest for 
achieving the threshold performance target with 
100% of the awards being earned for maximum 
performance (with straight-line vesting between 
these points). 
Further details of the performance conditions 
applicable to awards to be made in 2017 are set out 
on page 105.

 Directors’ remuneration report satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award 
over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award 
is granted.
5. Ricardo’s variable pay may have any performance conditions applicable 
to the relevant element amended or substituted by the Committee 
if an event occurs which causes the Committee to determine that 
an amended or substituted performance condition would be more 
appropriate and not materially less difficult to satisfy. The Committee may 
make adjustments, where these are fair and reasonable, to measures or 
targets to take account of, for example, the implications of acquisitions 
and disposals of subsidiaries.
6. Long-term incentive awards can be granted in a variety of forms such 
as performance shares, nil-cost options or forfeitable shares and the 
Committee reserves the right to grant long-term incentive awards with 
the same economic effect but in any of these different contractual forms 
(including in cash). Long-term incentive awards can also be adjusted 
in the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital or any 
demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event that may affect the 
Company’s share price. 
7. Under the terms of long-term incentive award performance conditions, 
where any company becomes unsuitable as a member of the 
comparator group as a result of, for example, a change of control or 
delisting, the Committee has the discretion to treat that company in 
such manner as it deems appropriate (including replacing it with another 
organisation).
8. In the event of a change of control, long-term incentive awards will 
normally vest at that time, taking into account the extent to which any 
performance criteria have been met (over the shortened performance 
periods) and the time elapsed since grant.

Group’s affairs.
Non-executive directors receive an annual basic fee 
plus an additional fee for acting as the Chairman of 
the Audit or Remuneration Committee or the Senior 
Independent Director. An additional fee may be 
paid for membership of the Technical Exploitation 
Board (‘TEB’). No non-executive director is currently 
a member of the TEB. The Chairman of the Board 
receives an annual fee payable monthly with no 
additional fees for chairing board committees. They 
also receive reimbursement for travel and incidental 
costs (including any associated personal tax charges) 
incurred in furtherance of company business.

Notes to the policy table:
1. The changes to the 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Policy consist of:
a. ceilings on the elements of our policy which are not yet capped, 
namely base salary and benefits;
b. simplifying our long-term incentive arrangements so that the so-
called deferred bonus matching shares will become the Bonus-Linked 
Shares; and
c. aligning and extending the malus / clawback provisions which already 
apply to certain of our share plans across the LTIP , the annual cash 
bonus, deferred bonus shares and Bonus-Linked Shares. 
2. Where maximum amounts for elements of remuneration have been set 
within the Policy, these will operate simply as caps and are not indicative 
of any aspiration.
3. A description of how the Company intends to implement the Policy 
set out in the above table during the financial year to 30 June 2018 is 
provided on page 105. 
4. The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments 
and/or payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions 
available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding 
that they are not in line with the Policy set out above where the terms 
of the payment were agreed (i) before 29 October 2014 (the date the 
Company’s first shareholder-approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
came into effect); (ii) before the Policy set out above came into effect, 
provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with the 
shareholder-approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy in force at the time 
they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not 
a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the 
payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director 
of the Company. For these purposes ‘payments’ include the Committee 
All-employee share plans
For its UK employees the Company operates from time to time tax-advantaged share plans. These are a Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) 
and Save As You Earn share option (‘SAYE’) scheme and they are intended to encourage share ownership and wider interest in the 
performance of the Company’s shares. Executive directors are eligible to participate in these arrangements up to the applicable 
statutory limits. The SIP provides for partnership, matching, free and dividend shares. Equivalent arrangements operate from time to 
time for non-UK employees.

Illustrative remuneration outcomes at different performance levels
Ricardo’s pay policy seeks to ensure the long-term interests of executive directors are aligned with those of shareholders. The 
remuneration packages for each executive director and their fixed and variable elements are reviewed annually. The scenario chart 
below presents remuneration outcomes for the new Policy under minimum, on-target and maximum scenarios.
The target scenario broadly illustrates the remuneration level when budgeted performance is achieved. The disclosures in the chart 
above reflect the 2016/2017 data on the basis of the assumptions set out below.
• Fixed elements comprise current base salary, pension and other benefits. For example, for the CEO, fixed elements comprise base 
salary of £480,800, pension (pension contribution and cash in lieu) of 21.2% of base salary above the Lower Earnings Limit and 
benefits equal to those received in 2016/2017;
• For minimum performance, executive directors receive only the fixed elements of pay;
• For target performance, an assumption of 55% of bonus payout and threshold vesting (25%) in respect of long-term incentives has 
been applied;
• For maximum performance, an assumption of maximum bonus payout and maximum vesting in respect of long-term incentives has 
been applied; and
• No share price increase has been assumed and this means that the single total figure in any year may be higher than the maximum 
shown above.

 Directors’ remuneration report Recruitment remuneration policy
New executive directors will be appointed on remuneration 
packages with the same structure and elements as described 
in the policy table starting on page 87 . Annual bonus and long-
term incentive awards will be within the limits described in the 
policy table.
For external appointments, although we have no plans to offer 
additional benefits on recruitment (and indeed did not do so 
for our last executive director appointment) the Committee 
reserves the right to offer such benefits when it considers this 
to be in the best interests of the Company and shareholders 
and in order to protect a new director against additional costs. 
The Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain 
relocation expenses as appropriate.
The Company may make an award to compensate a new recruit 
for the value of any remuneration relinquished when leaving 
a former employer. Any such award would reflect the nature, 
timescales and performance requirements attaching to that 
relinquished remuneration. The Listing Rules exemption 9.4.2 
may be used for the purpose of such an award. Shareholders 
will be informed of any such payments as soon as practicable 
following the appointment.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded 
in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according 
to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the 
appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, and will 
be disclosed to shareholders at the earliest opportunity.
On the appointment of a new Chairman or non-executive 
director, fees will be set taking into account the experience 
and calibre of the individual. Where specific cash or share 
arrangements are delivered to non-executive directors, these 
will not include share options or other performance-related 
elements.
The Board’s policy on setting notice periods for directors is that 
these should not exceed one year. It recognises, however, that it 
may be necessary in the case of new executive appointments to 
offer an initial longer notice period, which would subsequently 
reduce to one year after the expiry of that period. All future 
appointments to the Board will comply with this requirement.
Termination remuneration policy
The contractual termination provision is payment in lieu of 
notice equal to one year’s base salary or, if termination is part 
way through the notice period, the amount of base salary 
relating to any unexpired notice to the date of termination.
(1)
 
There is an obligation on directors to mitigate any loss which 
they may suffer if the Company terminates their service contract. 
The Committee will take such mitigation obligation into account 
when determining the amount and timing of any compensation 
payable to any departing director. No compensation is paid for 
summary dismissal, save for any statutory entitlements.
The cash element of the bonus is not payable unless the 
individual remains in employment at the payment date.
Share-based awards will lapse unless the individual concerned 
leaves for one of a number of specified ‘good leaver’ reasons 
which are: death; injury, illness or disability; redundancy; or 
retirement. The Committee retains the discretion to prevent 
awards from lapsing depending on the circumstances of the 
departure and the best interests of the Company. Awards which 
do not lapse on cessation of employment may vest on their 
originally anticipated vesting date (although the Remuneration 
Committee retains the discretion to allow vesting at cessation, 
depending on the circumstances under the applicable rules). 
These awards will also usually be subject to a time pro-rating 
reduction to reflect the unexpired portion of the performance 
or deferral period concerned, although the Committee will 
retain the discretion to disapply this pro-rating. Awards that are 
subject to performance conditions will usually only vest to the 
extent that these conditions are satisfied.
Executive directors will also be entitled to a payment in respect 
of accrued but untaken holiday and any statutory entitlements 
on termination.
In the event that any payment is made in relation to termination 
for an executive director, this will be fully disclosed. 
 
(1)  For Ian Gibson the contractual termination provision is payment in lieu of notice 
equal to one year’s base salary, car allowance and pension allowance, to the extent 
that these benefits are paid in cash.

 Directors’ remuneration report PART 3 – ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
This section of the report explains how Ricardo’s 2014 remuneration policy has been implemented during the financial year. The 
paragraphs in this Annual Report on Remuneration that have been audited are indicated as such below.
The Remuneration Committee
During the year under review the Committee was chaired by Peter Gilchrist. The Committee also comprised Sir Terry Morgan, Ian Lee, 
Laurie Bowen, Malin Persson and Bill Spencer (who joined the Committee on appointment as a non-executive director on 24 April 
2017).
The non-executive directors serving on the Committee have no personal financial interest (other than as shareholders) in matters to 
be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
Biographical details of the members of the Committee are shown on pages 70 and 71; details of attendance at the meetings of the 
Committee during the year ended 30 June 2017 are shown on page 73.
Advisors to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee is supported by the Group HR Director (Timothy Hargreaves), the Group Head of Remuneration and Pensions (Mark Jarvis) 
and the Company Secretary (Patricia Ryan). The Chief Executive Officer (Dave Shemmans) is not a member of the Committee but may 
attend its meetings by invitation and is consulted in respect of certain proposals. Similarly, the Chief Financial Officer (Ian Gibson) is not a 
member of the Committee but may occasionally be invited to attend parts of its meetings to address specific matters. Neither the Chief 
Executive Officer nor the Chief Financial Officer is consulted or involved in any discussions in respect of their own remuneration.
During the year, FIT Remuneration Consultants and Shepherd and Wedderburn (who were originally jointly appointed by the 
Committee following a competitive tender process held in a previous period) provided independent advice on matters under 
consideration by the Committee and updates on good practice, legislative requirements and market practice.
FIT Remuneration Consultants’ fees for this work amounted to £39,152 (calculated based on a mixture of fixed fees and time spent). 
Shepherd and Wedderburn’s fees for advising the Committee amounted to £31,023 (also calculated based on a mixture of fixed fees 
and time spent) – and they also advise Ricardo on the design, implementation and operation of its various share incentive plans.
FIT Remuneration Consultants are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and their work is governed by the Code of 
Conduct. Shepherd and Wedderburn is a law firm and is regulated accordingly. Having carefully considered all relevant factors, the 
Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the advice provided on executive remuneration is objective and independent and that no 
conflict of interest arises as a result of other services.
Voting outcome at AGM
The AGM for the financial year 2015/2016 was held on 3 November 2016 and the Committee is grateful to shareholders for the very 
strong support given at that meeting to Ricardo’s remuneration report. The result of the vote on the remuneration report is set out 
below. The remuneration policy in operation during the year was approved by shareholders at the AGM that was held on 29 October 
2014; details of this approval are also set out below.

Following the year-end, the Committee considered whether there were any circumstances that could or should result in the recovery or withholding of any sums pursuant to the 
Company’s clawback arrangements. The conclusion reached by the Committee was that it was not aware of any such circumstances.

Directors’ remuneration report CEO remuneration compared to employees
The table below compares the percentage change in the CEO’s remuneration and the percentage change in employees’ remuneration 
between 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 . The year-on-year decrease in the CEO’s bonus reflects the fact that he received no annual bonus 
for 2016/2017 . The average bonus paid to all employees across the Group also decreased year-on-year. The change in the employees’ 
annual bonus represents the average percentage change in bonuses for employees across the Group as a whole with individual 
performance against target varying between divisions. 
CEO Employees
Base salary 3% 3%

(2) The year-on-year change in CEO bonus of (100)% reflects the fact that no annual bonus was paid to the CEO in respect of the 2016/2017 financial year. 
Relative importance of pay spend
The following table sets out the total amounts spent on 
remuneration for all employees, the dividends declared and 
other significant distributions to shareholders in 2015/2016 and 
2016/2017 .

details on the key management remuneration can be found on page 132. 
This measure was chosen in order to give greater context for the scale of key 
management remuneration within Ricardo.
(2)  Further details on the R&D expenditure can be found on pages 15 and 28. 
This measure was chosen because of the importance to Ricardo’s business of 
developing its R&D portfolio. 
(3)  The only distributions made by the Company over this period were in the form of 
dividends. 
Detailed breakdown of pay in 2016/2017 
Base salary
Base salaries were reviewed in January 2017 . As described in 
the policy section, a number of factors are taken into account 
when salaries are reviewed: principally, market levels of total pay 
for comparable roles in companies of similar size, complexity 
and sector; the individual director’s experience, scope of 
responsibilities and performance; and the salary increases for 
employees across the Group. The increase for each executive 
director (and the Group-wide average approved in 2016/2017) 
was 3%. 
Current salary levels from 1 January 2017 are:
• Dave Shemmans: £480,800
• Ian Gibson: £309,515
• Mark Garrett: £270,122 
Other benefits (audited)
The Company provides other cash benefits and benefits in kind 
to executive directors. These include a company car or cash 
alternative, private fuel, private medical insurance, life assurance 
and permanent health / disability insurance. The car allowance 
levels remain unchanged and set at £17 ,500 p.a. for Dave 
Shemmans and at £12,000 p.a. for Ian Gibson and Mark Garrett. 
Non-executive directors can recover travel expenses for board 
meetings and do not receive any other benefits. If tax is payable 
by a non-executive director on travel expenses for board 
meetings, these may be paid gross of tax.
Pension (audited)
(a) The Defined Benefit scheme is closed and there are no active 
members. During the year ended 30 June 2017 , the transfer 
value in respect of the Chief Executive Officer has increased. 
The transfer value at 30 June 2017 was £602,000, an increase of 
£99,000 from the prior year.
The CEO’s Normal Retirement Date (‘NRD’) is 16 June 2031 at 
which point he will receive his pension at the date of leaving 
the fund, increased for the period in deferment until his NRD. If 
he decides to retire early, he will receive an immediate pension 
calculated as for retirement at NRD but reduced for early 
payment.

Annual performance-related bonus (audited)
For the year ended 30 June 2017 , the maximum annual 
performance-related bonus opportunity was 125% of salary 
for the Chief Executive Officer and 100% of salary for the other 
executive directors. To determine the amount of bonus payable 
for the period the Remuneration Committee assessed the level 
of achievement against the financial measures and targets set 
98   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
 Directors’ remuneration report in respect of Group profit before tax (60%) and Group cash balance at year-end (15% for CEO / 20% for other executive directors) and 
the achievement of specified individual objectives (25% for CEO / 20% for other executive directors). The choice of these measures, and 
their respective weightings for each individual, reflected the Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation should be tied both 
to the overall performance of the Group and to those areas of the business that the relevant individual can directly influence.
The targets set by the Remuneration Committee take into account several factors such as the business plan, management’s 
expectations and brokers’ forecasts.
 
A sliding scale of targets for each financial measure of the Group was set at the start of the 2016/2017 financial year: 
Performance achieved % of element payable
Threshold 0%
On-target 50%
Maximum 100%
Between any two points Straight line percentage
The personal objectives of the executive directors were different for each individual and were ascribed different weightings. Examples 
of the types of personal objectives that were set include:
• Order book and profitability in key parts of the business;
• Identifying further opportunities for inorganic growth;
• Further developing management succession planning with a focus on Group-wide diversity;
• Integrating acquisitions and delivering synergies in overhead savings and benefits;

(1)  The actual underlying profit before tax of £38.3m was adjusted by £0.2m to £38.1m for acquisition-related expenditure. The actual net debt balance of £(37.9)m was adjusted by 
£3.1m to £(34.8)m for unbudgeted Exnovo net consideration, acquisition-related expenditure and reorganisation costs. The purpose of the adjustments to profit before tax and 
net debt, which were reviewed by the Chairman of the Audit Committee, was to ensure that actual performance and the original targets were compared on a like-for-like basis.
(2)  As the profit performance is just above the threshold, the Remuneration Committee has exercised its discretion such that no bonus is payable.
 
The performance of the Group over the year included a 2% increase in underlying profit before tax to £38.3m (2016: £37 .7m) and a year-
end net debt of £(37 .9)m (2016: £(34.4)m). 
The underlying profit before tax of £38.3m was adjusted by £0.2m for acquisition-related expenditure, to give an adjusted 
underlying profit before tax of £38.1m. The net debt of £(37 .9)m was adjusted by £3.1m for unbudgeted expenditure related to the 
Exnovo acquisition, acquisition-related expenditure and reorganisation costs to give an adjusted net debt of £(34.8)m. As the profit 
performance is just above the threshold, the Remuneration Committee has exercised its discretion such that no bonus is payable. The 
cash performance is below the lower threshold and therefore no bonus is payable. The purpose of the adjustments to profit before tax 
and net debt, which were reviewed by the Chairman of the Audit Committee, was to ensure that actual performance and the original 
targets were compared on a like-for-like basis. The Remuneration Committee reviewed these adjustments and the achievement of the 
cash target was also reviewed by the Audit Committee.

Directors’ remuneration report The Remuneration Committee carried out a detailed and rigorous review of the achievement of personal objectives and determined 
that these had been achieved at a level of 76% for the CEO, 75% for the CFO and 70% for the COO. This reflects the Remuneration 
Committee’s assessment that most, but not all, of the objectives were met in full. However, as personal objectives were subject to the 
profit performance, as set out on the preceding page, the result is that no bonus is payable. Finally, the Remuneration Committee also 
considered whether the outturn from the assessment of the specific bonus targets reflected the overall performance of the Group 
during the year and was satisfied that this was the case. 
Consequently, as no bonuses were payable to the executive directors for 2016/2017 , no deferred bonus awards will be made under 
the 201 1 DBP . This also means that no Bonus-Linked Shares will be awarded in respect of the 2016/2017 bonus year. 
Long-term incentives Awards vesting during the financial year (audited)
Awards under the LTIP made in October 2013 vested in October 2016 on the basis of EPS and TSR performance over performance 
periods, the last of which ended in October 2016. The performance conditions applicable to these awards are summarised below:
Relative TSR portion (50%)    EPS growth portion (50%) 
Relative TSR performance against the FTSE Small 
Cap (excluding financial services companies and 
investment trusts) Vesting level   EPS growth performance Vesting level
Below median Nil   Less than RPI + 4% p.a. Nil
Median 25%   RPI + 4% p.a. 30%
(1) 
Upper quartile (or above) 100%   RPI + 10% p.a. 100%
Between median and upper quartile Straight-line basis   Between RPI + 4% and RPI + 10% p.a. Straight-line basis
(1)  Please note that the threshold vesting level for the EPS growth portion of these awards is different from the Directors’ Remuneration Policy because these awards were granted in 
2013 before the commencement of the 2014 remuneration policy.
Over the three-year performance period, Ricardo was ranked above the upper-quartile of the TSR comparator group, giving a vesting 
level for this portion of 100%. Ricardo’s TSR over the period was 89.2% against an upper quartile of 56.1%. The EPS figure for the year 
resulted from growth of 50.6% in real terms which represented compound growth of RPI + 14.6% p.a., compared to the base year, with 
the result that the EPS target was achieved to a level of 100%. Therefore, the overall vesting level for this award was 100%. The number 
and value of shares which vested in October 2016 in respect of awards granted to each of the executive directors in October 2013 are 
set out on page 102 of this report. The Remuneration Committee also concluded that there had been a sustained improvement in the 
overall performance of the Group over the three years in question. 
Non-executive directors’ fees 
Current non-executive directors’ fees as from 1 January 2017 are as follows:
£’000
Chairman’s total fees 143
Other non-executive director fees:
Basic fee 46
Additional fee for Audit and Remuneration Committee Chairmen 8
Additional fee for the Senior Independent Director 8
The above table reflects a 3% increase in the Chairman’s total fees and the basic fee for non-executive directors relative to 2015/2016, a 
£790 increase in Committee Chair fees and a £1,320 increase in the Senior Independent Director’s fee.

The vesting of these awards will be based on Ricardo’s three-year relative TSR (50%) and EPS growth (50%) performance summarised 
in the table below. The relative TSR measure was chosen by the Committee to link the remuneration of executive directors to the 
performance experienced by shareholders and further align their interests. The EPS measure was chosen to reward sustained profit 
growth in excess of inflation and align with one of our key performance indicators. In addition, no part of an award will vest unless the 
Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the achievement against the TSR and EPS performance condition is a genuine reflection of 
the underlying performance of the Group over the performance period.

Directors’ remuneration report Performance target setting and those applying to outstanding awards
As shown in previous directors’ remuneration reports, the Committee has a track record of setting stretching EPS targets which are 
carefully calibrated to outperform the business plan and market expectations. Similarly the TSR measure only awards full vesting where 
our performance is in the upper quartile of the FTSE Small Cap (excluding financial services companies and investment trusts). 
The performance targets applicable to outstanding LTIP and Bonus-Linked Share awards are as follows. For awards in years ending 
30 June 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 , maximum vesting of the EPS portion required growth of RPI + 10% per annum. The EPS target to 
achieve threshold vesting for awards granted in the year ending 30 June 2014 required performance in excess of RPI + 4% per annum. 
However this target was reduced to RPI + 3% p.a. for awards made in the financial year ended 30 June 2015. This change was the result 
of extensive consideration of the EPS target in particular in light of market expectations and management plans. This reduction was 
also offset by a reduction in the threshold vesting level applicable to these awards. The EPS growth required for threshold vesting 
remained unchanged at RPI + 3% p.a. for awards made in the years ending 30 June 2016 and 2017 .
The performance condition applicable to the TSR portion of awards has remained constant through this period and is the same as 
set out on page 101 for awards granted in the year ending 30 June 2017 . The number and value of shares which were awarded to each 
of the executive directors in the year ended 30 June 2017 are set out on page 101.

(3) Bill Spencer was appointed as a director on 24 April 2017.
Share retention policy
In order to foster greater alignment between our executive 
directors and our shareholders, the Board operates a share 
retention policy for the executive directors with the intention 
that each executive director will own shares in the Company 
with a value at least equal to one times annual base salary. 
Unvested awards granted under the Company’s employee 
share schemes do not count towards this target. As at 30 June 
2017 , Dave Shemmans and Mark Garrett met this shareholding 
requirement. While Ian Gibson has made clear strides towards 
the required minimum shareholding level during the year, 
having joined the Company on 1 July 2013, he has not yet met 
this level and will be expected to retain any vested shares net of 
tax from the LTIP and DBP until the guideline has been achieved.
Dilution limits
 The number of shares that may be issued under all Ricardo 
employee share plans in any ten-year rolling period will be 
restricted to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company and 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company for discretionary employee share plans. At the end of 
the year under review, the Company’s overall dilution was 4.76% 
of which 4.32% related to discretionary employee share plans. 
The Company operates an employee benefit trust (‘EBT’) which 
has principally been used to facilitate the operation of the LTIP 
and DBP arrangements. Any new shares issued to the trust are, 
however, included in the dilution limits noted above. 
Executive director board positions with other 
companies during 2016/2017
Executive directors may, with the prior consent of the Board, 
hold a non-executive directorship with another company.
On 1 September 2014, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer 
was appointed as a non-executive director of Sutton and East 
Surrey Water plc. He is permitted to retain the associated fees 
which, for the year from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017 (inclusive), 
amounted to £34,000.
On 28 November 2016, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer 
was appointed as the non-executive chairman of Secured 
By Design Automotive Limited. He is permitted to retain the 
associated fees which, for the period of 28 November 2016 to 30 
June 2017 (inclusive), amounted to £1 1,667 .
104   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
 Directors’ remuneration report Implementation of remuneration policy in 
following year
The Committee anticipates the implementation of the new 
Policy to be similar to that of the current financial year.
The Committee will:
• Review base salary levels for the executive directors with 
effect from 1 January 2018;
• Set / review the performance targets for the 2017/2018 
annual bonus, the LTIP awards to be made in 2017 to ensure 
continued alignment to strategy;
• Make awards under the 2014 LTIP; and
• Make awards under the 201 1 DBP where necessary.
The Committee has so far considered the targets to apply to 
the EPS portion of performance awards to be made under the 
Company’s long-term incentive arrangements later on in the 
year. In order to ensure that the targets remain challenging in 
light of market expectations of the Company’s EPS performance 
to the year ending June 2020, the Committee has determined 
that:
• No part of the EPS portion of these grants will vest if the 
Company’s EPS for the final year in the performance period is 
lower than 65p;
• 25% of this portion will vest where the final year EPS is 65p;
• 100% of this portion will vest where the final year EPS is greater 
than or equal to 75p; and
• Vesting will take place on a straight-line basis between 65p 
and 75p.
These targets will require EPS growth in the range of 17 .5% to 
35.6% or around 6% to 12% per year, which the Committee 
believes are challenging in the current business climate. This 
change from previously expressing our targets as growth 
percentages in excess of RPI has been made to simplify, to 
enhance the ‘line of sight’ for participants and also to recognise 
the international scope of Ricardo. On a compound annual basis 
the growth rate is slightly lower than the previous range (if RPI of 
3% is assumed) but the target range has been set on the basis 
of Ricardo’s business plan, recognising the international nature 
of the business, and also reflects our long-term strategy and 
consensus forecasts. 
Where the EPS performance period ends before 30 June 
2020 (which is currently expected to be the final year in the 
performance period), the Committee retains the discretion 
to amend these targets and the corresponding vesting levels 
accordingly. 
The targets applicable to the TSR portion of these awards will 
be the same as those which applied to awards granted last year.
Threshold performance (for which 25% of this portion will 
vest) is generally intended to align to the performance of the 
relevant market and/or our competitors’ level. If the maximum 
performance is achieved, we would expect to have significantly 
outperformed the relevant market and/or our competitors.
The Committee believes that TSR and EPS are appropriate 
measures for the LTIP as they are strongly aligned to shareholder 
value creation. In particular, the normalised EPS performance 
targets are considered by the Committee to be suitably 
stretching and will reward the leadership team only if they 
perform very well. When calibrating performance targets 
the Committee takes into account the economic and market 
outlook, the business plan and investor expectations at the 
time of each award. Shareholders should also note that the 
long-term incentive awards to be granted in November 2017 
will be significantly lower than for 2016 because no bonuses are 
being paid to executive directors for 2016/2017 and therefore no 
Bonus-Linked Shares will be awarded.

Directors’ interests in shares
Directors’ interests in shares and share options are contained on 
pages 102 to 104 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has entered into deeds of indemnity in favour of 
each of its Directors under which the Company agrees to indemnify 
each Director against liabilities incurred by that Director in respect 
of acts or omissions arising in the course of their office or otherwise 
by virtue of their office.
Where such deeds are for the benefit of directors they are 
qualifying third party indemnity provisions as defined by s.309B of 
the Companies Act 1985 or s.234 of the Companies Act 2006, as 
applicable. At the date of this report, these indemnities are therefore 
in force for the benefit of all the current Directors of the Company.
On 30 June 2014, Ricardo UK Limited and Ricardo-AEA Limited, 
subsidiaries of the Company, entered into qualifying third party 
indemnity provisions as defined by s.234 of the Companies Act 
2006 in favour of their Directors, under which each Director is 
indemnified against liabilities incurred by that Director in respect of 
acts or omissions arising in the course of their office or otherwise 
by virtue of their office and such provisions remain in force as at the 
date of this report.
Dividends
The Directors recommend the payment of a final ordinary share 
dividend for the year ended 30 June 2017 of 13.88 pence per 
ordinary share on 17 November 2017 to shareholders who are on 
the register of members at the close of business on 27 October 
2017 , which together with the interim dividend paid on 6 April 
2017 makes a total of 19.3 pence per ordinary share for the year 
(2016: 18.1 pence).
Acquisitions and disposals
The acquisition of Motorcycle Engineering Italia s.r.l., which was 
formed from the operating assets and employees of Exnovo s.r.l., 
and subsequently renamed Ricardo Motorcycle Italia s.r.l., was 
completed in the year under review. 
Events after the reporting date
The acquisition of Control Point Corporation was completed 
after the reporting date on 8 September 2017 .
Research and Development
The Group continues to devote effort and resources to research 
and development of new technologies. Costs of £9.5m have 
been incurred, of which £3.1m has been capitalised and £6.4m 
has been charged to the Consolidated Income Statement during 
the year.
Board of Directors
The current Directors of the Company at the date of this report 
appear on pages 70 and 71. Bill Spencer joined the Board on  
24 April 2017 . It is the intention of Ian Lee to resign from the

  Employee information
The Company provides employees with various opportunities 
to obtain information on matters of concern to them and to 
improve awareness of the financial and economic factors that 
affect the performance of the Company. These include bi-annual 
‘Pulse’ presentations to all members of staff, department and 
team briefings and meetings with employee representatives that 
take place throughout the year.
All companies within the Group strive to operate fairly at all 
times and this includes not permitting discrimination against 
any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of 
race, religion or belief, colour, gender, disability, national origin, 
age, military service, veteran status, sexual orientation or marital 
status. This includes giving full and fair consideration to suitable 
applications for employment from disabled persons and making 
appropriate accommodations so that if existing employees 
become disabled they can continue to be employed, wherever 
practicable, in the same job or, if this is not practicable, making 
every effort to find suitable alternative employment and to 
provide relevant training.
Change of control provisions
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company following 
a takeover bid, such as commercial contracts, bank facility 
agreements, property lease arrangements and employees’ share 
plans. None of these are considered to be significant in terms of 
their likely impact on the business of the Group as a whole.
Management report
The management report required by the provisions of the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules is included within the 
Strategic Report and has been prepared in consultation with 
management.
Share capital
As at 28 August 2017 , the Company’s share capital is divided 
solely into 53,163,423 ordinary shares of 25 pence each, all of 
which are fully paid. The ordinary shares are listed on the London 
Stock Exchange.
All ordinary shares rank equally for all dividends and 
distributions that may be declared on such shares. At general 
meetings of the Company, each member who is present (in 
person, by proxy or by representative) is entitled to one vote on 
a show of hands and, on a poll, to one vote per share.
With respect to shares held on behalf of participants in the 
all-employee Share Incentive Plan, the trustees are required to 
vote as the participants direct them to do so in respect of their 
plan shares. There are no restrictions on voting rights and no 
securities carry special voting rights with regard to the control of 
the Company.
Awards granted under the Company’s share plans are satisfied 
either by shares held in the employee benefit trusts or by the 
issue of new shares when awards vest. The Remuneration 
Committee monitors the number of awards made under the 
various share plans and their potential impact on the relevant 
dilution limits recommended by the Association of British 
Insurers. Based on the Company’s issued share capital, as at  
30 June 2017 , these were in respect of the limit of 10% in any 
rolling 10-year period for all plans (4.48%) and in respect of the 
limit of 5% in any rolling 10-year period for discretionary share 
plans (4.04%).
The Company was given authority to purchase up to 15% of 
its existing ordinary share capital at the 2016 AGM. That authority 
will expire at the conclusion of the AGM in 2017 unless renewed. 
Accordingly, a special resolution to renew the authority will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
The existing authority for Directors to allot ordinary shares 
will expire at the conclusion of the 2017 AGM. Accordingly, an 
ordinary resolution to renew this authority will be proposed at 
the forthcoming AGM. In addition, it will be proposed to give 
the Directors further authority for a period of one year to allot 
ordinary shares in connection with a rights issue in favour of 
ordinary shareholders. This is in accordance with guidance issued 
by the Association of British Insurers. If the Directors were to use 
further authority in the year following the 2017 AGM, all Directors 
wishing to remain in office would stand for re-election at the 
2018 AGM.
Details of these resolutions are included with the Notice of 
AGM enclosed with this report.
Resolutions at the Annual General Meeting
The Company’s AGM will be held on 8 November 2017 . 
Accompanying this report is the Notice of AGM which sets out 
the resolutions to be considered and approved at the meeting 
together with some explanatory notes. The resolutions cover 
such routine matters as the renewal of authority to allot shares, 
to disapply pre-emption rights and to purchase own shares.

Directors’ report The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union. Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and 
of the profit or loss of the Group and Parent Company for that 
period. In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the Group and Parent Company 
financial statements, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Parent Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
Parent Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and Parent Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Parent Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and 
financial statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group and Parent Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in 
respect of the Annual Report
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
the Board of Directors section of the Annual Report on pages 70 
and 71, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group and Parent Company financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group and Parent 
Company; and
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group and Parent Company, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 
Disclosure of information to the auditors
In accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, each 
Director in office at the date of approval of the Directors’ Report 
confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group and Parent Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and
• they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as 
a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Group and Parent 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

   Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   111 REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS 
Opinion
In our opinion, Ricardo plc’s Group financial statements and 
Parent Company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2017 and of the Group’s 
profit and the Group’s and the Parent Company’s cash flows 
for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within 
the Annual Report & Accounts (the ‘Annual Report’), which 
comprise: the consolidated and Parent Company statements 
of financial position, the consolidated income statement and 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and Parent Company statements of changes in 
equity, and the consolidated and Parent Company statements 
of cash flows for the year ended 30 June 2017; and the notes 
to the financial statements, which include a description of the 
significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit 
Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the 
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-
audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group or the Parent Company.
Other than those disclosed in Note 6 to the financial 
statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the 
Group or the Parent Company in the period from 1 July 2016 to 
30 June 2017 .
Our audit approach 
Overview
Materiality
• £1,900,000 (2016: £1,570,000) - Group financial 
statements
• Based on 5% of profit before tax and specific 
adjusting items.
• £1,805,000 (2016: £1,402,000) - Parent Company 
financial statements
• Based on 1% of total assets capped at a level 
below the Group financial statement level.
Audit 
scope
• We audited the complete financial information 
at five reporting units (2016: five reporting 
units), with procedures on specific balances at 
six further reporting units.
• As a result audit procedures have been 
conducted at reporting units representing 85% 
of the Group’s profit before tax and specific 
adjusting items and representing 82% of 
revenue.
Key audit 
matters
• Contract accounting in the Technical 
Consulting business (Group).
• Recoverability of capitalised development costs 
(Group).
• Taxation (Group).
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and 
assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in 
all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there 
was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of 
material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit 
of the financial statements of the current period and include the 
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether 
or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those 
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we 
make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of 
all risks identified by our audit.

Contract accounting in the Technical Consulting 
business
Refer to page 78 (‘Contract accounting and performance’ within 
the Audit Committee Report), Notes 1(c) and 1(e) and Note 20 
to the financial statements for the Directors’ disclosures of the 
related accounting policies, judgements and estimates for further 
information.
Contract accounting is used in the Group’s Technical Consulting 
businesses, which contributes the majority of the Group’s 
revenue, at £280.5m (2016: £267 .9m). The contracts are inherently 
complex and may span a number of reporting periods. They 
therefore require estimates and judgements by management 
related to the stage that the contract has reached and the 
costs to complete the work, that could lead to an under or 
overstatement of revenue and profit, either intentionally or in 
error.
In contract accounting the amounts recorded in the 
consolidated statement of financial position depend on the 
relationship between the work done and forecast costs to come, 
the invoicing schedule agreed with the client and the cash 
payments received.
The consolidated statement of financial position at 30 June 
2017 showed amounts recoverable on contracts (‘AROC’) of 
£59.0m and payments received in advance of £24.1m in respect 
of the Technical Consulting business. We carried out procedures 
on each of these balances in the course of the work as described 
opposite.
AROC represents work done that has not yet been invoiced 
and we focused on the risk that it, or the receivables for work 
that had been invoiced prior to the year-end, would not be 
recoverable in full. We also considered whether payments 
received in advance were recognised where the related work had 
not yet been done.
In addition, management assesses the contract related AROC 
and trade receivable balances to ensure sufficient confidence 
over the likely recoverability of these balances.
We tested the key controls over contract accounting in the 
Technical Consulting business, including the controls over 
recording work done, invoicing and cash receipts. We also 
attended the ‘Red CAT4’ (high-risk and underperforming 
contracts) review meetings in January and July 2017 with the 
Group Chief Financial Officer and the divisional Managing 
Directors, at which the performance of these contracts was 
discussed. We were satisfied that a robust process had been 
undertaken in the contract reviews and that the outcomes were 
reflected in the year-end positions in the financial statements.
We also tested a sample of contracts by meeting with the 
relevant project managers and engineers to analyse the contracts 
in detail. These meetings included discussion and evaluation of 
the key estimates used in the long-term contract accounting 
calculations such as costs to complete, key project risks, 
contingencies held and adherence to billing schedules, which 
were all reconciled to the project records.
Where appropriate, we obtained the relevant contracts and 
other supporting information and validated the data included 
in the calculations and management’s assumptions for costs to 
complete based on the contractual requirements. We found that 
management was able to provide reasonable explanations and 
appropriate supporting evidence for the various judgements 
taken.
Where management have made an assessment of anticipated 
recovery of overspends and scope increases within the contract 
accounting, we have considered the appropriateness of this 
judgement, challenging the evidence provided and reading 
correspondence with third parties to support the position taken.
We discussed significant AROC and debtor positions with 
management and performed testing to assess the recoverability 
of these. We were able to confirm that the positions were 
consistent with the relevant invoicing schedules and payment 
plans. We also considered recent communications with customers 
and traced amounts to subsequent cash receipt where possible. 
No material issues were identified in this testing.
We considered the appropriateness and completeness of 
judgemental contract provisions and obtained and challenged 
the evidence provided in support of these, which included 
reading correspondence with third parties. We considered the 
position taken by management to be appropriate.
We also tested manual journals with a material impact on 
revenue and found that all journals tested relating to contract 
accounting were properly supported.

Independent auditors’ report Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Recoverability of capitalised development costs
Refer to page 79 (‘Capitalisation and carrying value of development 
costs’ within the Audit Committee Report), and Notes 1(c), 1(o) and 
14 to the financial statements for the Directors’ disclosures of the 
related accounting policies, judgements and estimates for further 
information.
The Group has continued to focus on research and 
development activities, targeted on areas that can maximise 
future benefit. During the year £3.1m of development spend was 
capitalised in respect of development projects, resulting in a total 
of £8.4m held on the statement of financial position at 30 June 
2017.
The capitalised costs must comply with the criteria set out in 
IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’, and, in particular, there is a risk that such 
projects will not generate sufficient economic benefit in the 
future to support the current carrying value. 
We tested that development costs were capitalised in accordance 
with the requirements of the accounting framework and were 
properly attributable to the relevant projects by obtaining 
supporting documentation such as invoices and time records and 
checking the nature of each cost incurred. 
We found that the costs on these projects had been capitalised 
in accordance with the criteria set out in IAS 38.
We obtained project plans for a sample of the larger projects 
and met with the project directors to understand progress to 
date, the potential opportunity and management’s assessment 
of the future returns that will be generated. We challenged 
management on the specific opportunities tested and found that 
a number of these have started to realise future economic benefit. 
In other cases, we were able to obtain appropriate evidence and 
explanations for the future value.
Taxation
Refer to page 79 (‘Deferred taxation’ within the Audit Committee 
Report), and Notes 1(c), 1(l), 9 and 26 to the financial statements for the 
Directors’ disclosures of the related accounting policies, judgements 
and estimates for further information.
The Group claims significant R&D credits and has potential 
liabilities for permanent establishment risks and transfer pricing 
for which it maintains provisions. 
The German and US entities have £2.4m and £5.9m 
respectively of recognised deferred tax assets, but the 
performance of these businesses in the past few years has been 
variable, leading to doubt over the likely realisation of the assets.
We obtained the tax calculations, including those for R&D credits, 
and the position papers prepared by management to understand 
and test the tax charge and deferred tax position for the Group.
We considered the processes and procedures undertaken by 
management to understand their risks arising from permanent 
establishments and transfer pricing. We formed our own view 
on these judgements and concluded that the judgements taken 
by management in establishing provisions for these risks were 
reasonable.
We evaluated the Group’s forecasts for the German and US 
statutory entities and the process by which they were prepared 
in considering the forecast utilisation of the relevant deferred tax 
assets.
We noted that €1.7m of the German deferred tax asset was 
written off during the current year, reducing the deferred tax 
asset to €2.7m. This was due to further contract losses recognised 
during the year and a forecast reduction in the level of future 
trading through the German business. We found management’s 
assessment for the remaining recoverability to be reasonable.
We noted the US businesses made a loss in the year, however 
note the recent announcement of the acquisition of Control Point 
Corporation and the future prospects for the business supporting 
the forecast utilisation of the deferred tax asset recognised.
 
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the 
Group and the Parent Company, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Group is structured by division, with significant reporting 
units in the UK and Europe, and further smaller reporting units 
in locations across the US, Asia and Europe. The Group financial 
statements are a consolidation of 60 reporting units, comprising 
the Group’s operating businesses and centralised functions. 
For each reporting unit, we determined whether we 
required an audit of the complete financial information or 
whether alternative procedures would be sufficient. Our 
principal measure for these scoping decisions was revenue, 
as in the Ricardo Group this is a reasonable indicator of the 
scale of activities of an individual entity. Based on this measure 
the full scope components were UK Automotive (part of 
the Automotive EMEA Technical Consulting business) and 
Performance Products, as each reporting unit made up more 
than 15% of the Group’s revenue.
We included Ricardo Energy & Environment, Ricardo Rail UK 
and Ricardo Rail Netherlands as full scope for Group reporting 
given the scale of the operations in these reporting units and 
114   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Independent auditors’ report the requirement for UK and Netherlands statutory audits to be 
performed for these entities. Ricardo Inc. and Ricardo Software 
in the US are the other more significant trading businesses 
within the Group. As these have no local statutory requirement, 
we performed specified procedures for Group reporting and 
performed risk focused testing over key contracts and the 
associated balances. In addition, we performed procedures 
over specific balances in Ricardo plc, Ricardo Investments 
Limited, Ricardo Deutschland GmbH and Ricardo China, along 
with higher level risk-focused procedures with respect to the 
remaining entities and procedures over consolidation entries.
The Group audit team was responsible for all the work carried 
out in the UK and the specified procedures work over Ricardo 
Inc. and Ricardo Software in the US. PwC Netherlands performed 
work over the Ricardo Rail entity in the Netherlands under our 
instruction. Discussions were held with the PwC Netherlands 
team at both planning and completion to discuss the scope of 
their procedures and their findings.
Taken together, our audit work in the UK and the US, along 
with work performed by PwC Netherlands, addressed 85% of the 
Group’s profit before tax and specific adjusting items and 82% of 
revenue. This gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion 
on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us 
to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing 
and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial 
statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect 
of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
 
Group financial 
statements
Parent Company 
financial 
statements
Overall 
materiality
£1,900,000  
(2016: £1,570,000).
£1,805,000  
(2016: £1,402,000).
How we 
determined it
5% of profit before 
tax and specific 
adjusting items.
1% of total assets 
capped at a level 
below the Group 
financial statement 
materiality level.
Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied
We chose this 
because we 
consider this to 
be the principal 
measure used 
by shareholders 
to assess the 
Group’s underlying 
performance.
We chose this 
because the entity’s 
primary purpose 
is that of holding 
company for the 
Group.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, 
we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group 
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components 
was between £1,805,000 and £352,000. Certain components 
were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also 
less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them misstatements identified during our audit above £95,000 
(Group audit) (2016: 75,000) and £90,000 (Parent Company audit) 
(2016: £75,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts 
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we 
have anything material to add 
or draw attention to in respect 
of the Directors’ statement 
in the financial statements 
about whether the Directors 
considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements and 
the Directors’ identification 
of any material uncertainties 
to the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern over a 
period of at least twelve 
months from the date of 
approval of the financial 
statements.
We have nothing material 
to add or to draw attention 
to. However, because not all 
future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee 
as to the Group’s and Parent 
Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
We are required to report 
if the Directors’ statement 
relating to going concern 
in accordance with Listing 
Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially 
inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the 
audit.
We have nothing to report.

Independent auditors’ report Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information 
in the Annual Report & Accounts other than the financial 
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The Directors 
are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the 
financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to 
the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of 
assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or 
material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures 
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the 
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing 
to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, 
we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work 
undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless 
otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the year ended 30 June 2017 is consistent 
with the financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in 
the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the 
Group and of the principal risks that would threaten 
the solvency or liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to 
regarding:
• The Directors’ confirmation on page 41 of the Annual 
Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those 
risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The Directors’ explanation on page 41 of the Annual 
Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement 
as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of 
the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and 
statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. 
Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit 
and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the 
Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that 
the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’); and 
considering whether the statements are consistent with the 
knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to 
report when: 
• The statement given by the Directors, on page 109, that 
they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Parent 
Company’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of 
the Group and Parent Company obtained in the course of 
performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 77 to 81 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the 
Audit Committee.
• The Directors’ statement relating to the Parent Company’s 
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, 
under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.

Independent auditors’ report Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial statements and 
the audit 
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial 
statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 109, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
in accordance with the applicable framework and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The Directors are 
also responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate 
the group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 
and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any 
other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands 
it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING 
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we 
were appointed by the members on 24 September 1990 to audit 
the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 1991 and 
subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is 27 years, covering the years ended 30 June 1991

 The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to the years ended 30 June 2016 and 30 June 
2017.        
  
 (a) Basis of preparation
 These financial statements of Ricardo plc have been prepared in

assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) which 
are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
 Having assessed the principal risks and the other matters discussed 
in connection with the Viability Statement on page 41, the Directors 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements.
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS 
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of 
applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher 
degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and 
estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in 
Note 1(c).     
 
 Changes in accounting policies
 There are no new, revised or amended standards and interpretations 
which are mandatory for the first time for the financial year ended 30 
June 2017. New, revised or amended standards and interpretations 
that are not yet effective have not been early adopted and are 
disclosed in Note 1(x).    
 
 (b) Basis of consolidation
 The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries (together the 
‘Group’) prepared to the end of the financial year. Subsidiaries are 
all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has 
control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, 
or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group and are deconsolidated from the 
date that control ceases. Intercompany transactions and balances are 
eliminated on consolidation.
 The Group applies the acquisition method of accounting to 
account for business combinations. The consideration transferred 
for an acquisition is the fair value of the assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed. The consideration transferred includes the 
fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination 
are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. 
Acquisition-related expenditure is expensed as incurred. 
 (c) Management judgements and key accounting estimates
 In preparing the financial statements, the Group is required to 
exercise judgement in making estimates and assumptions that affect 
reported amounts and disclosures. These judgements are continually 
evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from 
those estimates and assumptions. The following accounting policies 
have been identified as being particularly sensitive to complex or 
subjective judgements or estimates:
 Performance and revenue recognition for fixed price contracts
 The Group derives a significant proportion of its revenue from the 
supply of professional services under contracts, most of which are 
normally fixed price contracts that may extend for a significant period 
of time. Where the outcome can be estimated reliably, contract 
revenue is recognised to the extent that the services have been 
performed. Performance is measured based on costs incurred to date 
as a percentage of total expected costs. Management judgement 
and experience is required to determine the completeness of those 
forecasts, the recoverability of the costs incurred and the revenue 
recognised on contracts. Unforeseen future events may adversely 
impact the accuracy of those forecasts and recoverability judgements. 
Further details are given in Note 20.
 
 Retirement benefit obligations
 The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme that provides 
benefits to a number of current and former employees. This scheme 
is closed to new entrants and the accrual of future benefits for active 
members ceased at the end of February 2010. The value of the deficit 
is particularly sensitive to the market value of the scheme’s assets, 
discount rates and actuarial assumptions related to mortality.
 From June 2016, the Company and Trustees decided to introduce a 
‘retirement flexibility’ option to the Fund, which allows members to 
transfer out their benefits at retirement. No allowance continues to 
have been made within the defined benefit obligation as at 30 June 
2017 for members who may elect to transfer out their benefits at 
retirement. This assumption will be reviewed on an ongoing basis 
and may change in future as experience emerges as to the level 
of members who elect to transfer out their benefits at retirement. 
Further details are given in Note 25.
 Current and deferred taxation
 Legislation related to taxation is complex and its impact on the Group 
may be uncertain. In preparing the Group’s financial statements 
management estimates its taxation, having taken appropriate 
professional advice. Determination of an agreed amount of taxation 
payable may take several years, and the final amount paid may differ 
from the liabilities recorded in these financial statements.
 The recognition of assets and liabilities related to deferred taxation 
also requires management to exercise judgement, in particular the 
extent to which assets should be recognised. Further details are given 
in Note 26.
 Development costs
 Certain directly attributable costs which are incurred in the 
development of an intangible asset are capitalised. These costs are 
recognised as an asset once the Group has determined that the 
attributable expenditure can be measured reliably, that it has the 
intention and the necessary resources to complete the relevant 
project and that it is considered probable that the resulting asset 
Notes to the financial statements
 
122   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 will generate future economic benefits for the Group. Determining 
whether it is probable that the resulting asset will generate sufficient 
economic benefits in the future requires management judgement. 
Further details are given in Note 14.
 Provisions
 A provision is required when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past 
event, and it is probable that settlement will be required of an 
amount that can be reliably estimated. Provisions for warranty 
costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products, at 
management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
Group’s liability. These estimates are reviewed each year and updated 
as necessary. Further details are given in Note 27.
 (d) Segmental reporting
 Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with 
the discrete financial information that is internally reported and 
provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible 
for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments.
 (e) Revenue
 The Group principally earns revenue through the supply of 
professional services and products to customers. Revenue is stated 
net of value added and other sales taxes. 
 Technical Consulting
 The majority of the Group’s revenue is earned from Technical 
Consulting contracts for professional services.
 Technical Consulting contracts are typically awarded on a fixed price 
basis. Where the outcome can be estimated reliably, contract revenue 
is recognised to the extent that the services have been performed. 
Performance is measured based on costs incurred to date as a 
percentage of total expected costs.
 Profit is not recognised on a contract, and revenue is not recognised 
in excess of recoverable costs, unless its outcome can be estimated 
reliably. It is deemed possible to reliably estimate the outcome 
of a contract when the Group is in possession of documentation 
from a customer that is on terms and conditions acceptable to the 
Group and, subject to the successful execution of the contract, can 
be invoiced against and paid for. A loss on a fixed price contract is 
recognised immediately when it becomes probable that the contract 
cost will exceed the total contract revenue. Monthly reviews of 
contracts by local management, in conjunction with reviews by senior 
management of contracts deemed to be of higher risk, ensure that 
the Group identifies and recognises expected losses on fixed price 
contracts immediately.
 Revenue from contract variations closely linked to underlying fixed 
price contracts is recognised based on performance under the 
contract as a whole, but only to the extent that it can be reliably 
measured and it is probable that the customer will approve both 
the variation and the amount of additional revenue. Contract 
variations not closely linked to underlying fixed price contracts are 
treated as separate contracts. Groups of separate legal contracts 
or supplementary contracts received in addition to pre-existing 
contracts are combined and accounted for as a single contract to 
the extent that they are negotiated as a single package, performed 
concurrently or in a continuous sequence and are so closely 
interrelated that they are, in substance, part of a single project with an 
overall profit margin.     
Assets arising from the recognition of revenue are recorded in trade 
and other receivables, initially as amounts recoverable on contracts 
and transferred to trade receivables when invoiced. Amounts received 
from customers for services not yet recognised as revenue are initially 
classified as payments received in advance on contracts within trade 
and other payables.
 Certain contracts may be awarded on a time and materials basis. For 
these contracts, revenue recognition is based on the expected sales 
value of the time worked and costs incurred to date.
 Other contracts relate to the supply of annual subscription services, 
for which revenue from renewals is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the period of subscription. Where significant administrative effort 
is required for new and upgrading customers to set up the services 
to be provided, revenue is recognised based on the fair value of the 
initial work performed. The remainder is recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the period of subscription.
 Performance Products
 Within Performance Products, Group revenue is principally derived 
from the sale of high-performance products produced from assembly 
operations.
 Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration and is recognised when the Group has transferred the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods to the buyer, 
when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and when it is 
probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction 
will flow to the Group. This is typically on delivery of goods to the 
customer.
 Bill-and-hold sales occur where all performance obligations have 
been satisfied but the customer requests that the goods are held by 
the Group until such times as delivery or collection of the goods is 
required by the customer. Revenue is recognised and billed under 
usual payment terms when the customer formally agrees to accept 
the risks of legal title and specifically acknowledges their deferred 
delivery instructions, provided that the goods have been identified, 
set aside and made available for delivery to the customer at the time 
the sale is recognised and it is considered probable that delivery will 
be made.
 Performance Products also includes revenues derived from the sale 
of software licences. The Group’s software products are standard 
version controlled products available for general sale. Normally there 
are no substantive obligations to fulfil following sale and revenue is 
recognised on delivery. Revenue derived from the supply of software-
related services is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period 
during which the service is supplied. 
 (f) Research and development expenditure
 Research and development expenditure is recognised as an expense 
in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which it 
is incurred as disclosed in Note 5, other than where the activity is 
performed for customers, in which case it is included within the 
contract accounting, or when development expenditure meets the 
criteria for recognition as an intangible asset as described in Note 1(o), 
and includes all directly attributable costs.

Notes to the financial statements  Fair value is measured by using the Monte Carlo and Black Scholes 
models as explained in Note 30. The expected life used in the models 
are adjusted for the effects of exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations.
 
 (j) Leases
 The costs of operating leases and amortisation of operating lease 
incentives are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
 (k) Foreign currency     
Transactions
 The functional currency of the Company and the presentation 
currency of the Group is Pounds Sterling. The functional currency of 
each subsidiary is the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates. Transactions in currencies other than the 
functional currency are recorded at prevailing exchange rates. At each 
reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting 
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the 
transaction occurred. Gains and losses arising on retranslation and 
settlements are included in the Consolidated Income Statement for 
the year.
 Consolidation
 On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations, 
including goodwill and fair value adjustments are translated into 
the presentation currency at exchange rates prevailing on the 
reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the 
average exchange rates of the year unless exchange rates fluctuate 
significantly. All resulting exchange differences are recognised in 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Exchange 
differences arising from 1 July 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, 
are classified as equity and recognised in the translation reserve. 
Exchange differences arising before that date are not separately 
reported. On disposal of an operation, or part thereof, the related 
cumulative translation differences are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement as a component of the gain or loss arising on 
disposal.
 
 (l) Taxation
 The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. 
Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly in equity. In this 
case, the tax is also recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income or directly in equity, respectively.
 The current tax charge is the expected tax payable on taxable 
income for the year, calculated using the average rate applicable 
for the year on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group 
operates and generates taxable income. The current tax charge also 
includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns 
with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject 
to interpretation and is therefore inherently uncertain. It establishes 
provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be 
paid to the relevant tax authorities.
 On 2 July 2013, legislation was enacted to allow UK companies to 
elect for the Research and Development Expenditure Credit (‘RDEC’) 
on qualifying expenditure incurred since 1 April 2013, instead of the 
‘super-deduction’ rules, which were abolished from 1 April 2016. 
Management elected to adopt the RDEC regime as of 1 July 2015, 
 (g) Government grants
 The Group receives income-related grants from various national and 
supranational government agencies, principally for credits in respect 
of qualifying research and development expenditure, together with 
funding of research and development and capital projects. A grant is 
not recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement until there is 
reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with its conditions 
and that the grant will be received. Grants are presented in the 
Consolidated Income Statement as a deduction from the related 
expenses. Grants contributing to the cost of an asset are deducted 
from the asset’s cost and reflected in the depreciation throughout the 
useful life of the asset.
 Grants are not normally received until after qualification conditions 
have been met and the related expenditure has been incurred. Where 
this is not the case, they are recorded within trade and other payables 
either as a payment received in advance on contracts or as accruals 
and deferred income.
 (h) Retirement benefit costs
 The Group operates one defined benefit and several defined 
contribution retirement benefit schemes. The defined retirement 
benefit scheme is closed to new entrants and the accrual of future 
benefits for active members ceased at the end of February 2010. 
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense 
as they fall due. Differences between contributions payable in the 
year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals 
or prepayments in the Statement of Financial Position. Payments 
to state-managed schemes are dealt with as payments to defined 
contribution schemes as the Group’s obligations under the schemes 
are similar in nature.
 For the defined benefit retirement scheme, the cost of providing 
benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, 
with actuarial valuations being carried out at each reporting date. 
Remeasurements are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income except where they result from settlements 
or curtailments, in which case they are reported in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
 Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the 
benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-
line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the Statement of 
Financial Position represent the present value of the defined benefit 
obligations as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as 
reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from 
this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of 
available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
 The net of the expected return on the scheme’s assets and the 
increase during the year in the present value of the scheme’s liabilities 
arising from the passage of time are included in finance costs.  
 
 (i) Share-based payments
 Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the 
date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The amount expensed 
is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the 
number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting 
from any market-related performance conditions.
 Cash-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the 
date of grant and expensed over the vesting period until the vesting 
date with the recognition of a corresponding liability. The liability is 
remeasured to fair value at each reporting date up to and including 
the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement for the year. The amount expensed 
is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the 
number of shares that will eventually vest.
 1 Accounting policies (continued)
124   Ricardo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Notes to the financial statements goodwill to the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill 
has been allocated. The recoverable amount is the higher of the value 
in use or the fair value less costs of disposal. Estimating the value in 
use requires the Directors to perform an assessment of the discounted 
future cash flows that the CGU is able to generate. An impairment is 
deemed to have occurred where the recoverable amount of a CGU is 
less than the carrying value of the allocated goodwill. Any impairment 
is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement 
and is not subsequently reversed. On disposal of an operation, the 
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of 
the gain or loss on disposal.
 
 (o) Other intangible assets     
Acquisition-related intangible assets
 Acquisition-related intangible assets that are either separable or 
arising from contractual rights are recognised at fair value at the 
date of acquisition, and subsequently at amortised cost. Such 
intangible assets include customer contracts and relationships, 
trademarks, technology and acquired software. The fair value of 
acquired intangible assets is determined by use of appropriate 
valuation techniques, including the excess earnings and royalty relief 
method. 
 Software
 Purchased software is capitalised on the basis of the purchase price 
plus any external and internal costs directly attributable to bring the 
specific software to the condition necessary for it to be capable of 
operating in the manner intended.
 
 Development costs 
 Certain directly attributable costs which are incurred in the 
development of certain products are capitalised. These costs are 
recognised as an asset once the Group has determined that it has 
the intention and the necessary resources to complete the relevant 
project, it is probable that the resulting asset will generate economic 
benefits for the Group and the attributable expenditure can be 
measured reliably. Development costs are capitalised where these 
criteria have been met and amortised over their finite useful lives.
 
 Amortisation
 Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate 
the cost of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, as 
follows:     
- Acquisition-related intangible assets Between 3 and 8 years
- Software Between 2 and 10 years
- Development costs Between 2 and 5 years
     
 (p) Property, plant and equipment
 Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less 
depreciation. The gross cost of an item of property, plant and 
equipment is the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to 
bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be 
capable of operating in the manner intended. Grants contributing to 
the cost of an asset are deducted from the asset’s cost and reflected in 
the depreciation throughout the useful life of the asset.
 Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate 
their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as 
follows:  
- Freehold land Not depreciated
- Freehold buildings including fixed plant Between 25 and 50 years
- Leasehold property including fixed plant Over the term of the lease
- Plant and machinery Between 4 and 10 years
- Fixtures, fittings and equipment Between 2 and 10 years
which also permitted claims to be made on qualifying expenditure 
under RDEC in excess of the tax relief received under the legacy 
scheme since 1 July 2013. Credits relating to the current year are 
included within underlying profit before tax, offset against research 
and development expenditure incurred. The credit in the prior 
year related to claims made for the excess in RDEC over the tax 
relief received under the legacy scheme in the two years between 
enactment and adoption. The credit was recorded as other income 
and classified as a specific adjusting item on the basis that it was non-
recurring and there was no corresponding expenditure against which 
these credits could be offset.
 RDEC claims receivable at the reporting date have been reclassified 
as trade and other receivables in both years presented within the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flow, together with the related notes. RDEC claims 
receivable of £5.4m for the year ended 30 June 2016 were previously 
classified as a reduction in net current tax liabilities within the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. RDEC claims received of 
£1.5m for the year ended 30 June 2016 were previously classified as a 
reduction in tax paid within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow. 
RDEC claims have been represented on this basis as they are settled 
separately from the Group’s current tax liabilities.
 Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. However, 
deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial 
recognition of goodwill; deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises 
from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating 
to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is not probable that 
they will reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred 
tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
 Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available in the foreseeable 
future against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax 
benefit will be realised within the foreseeable future.
 
 (m) Dividends
 Dividends are recognised as a liability in the year in which they are 
fully authorised. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
 
 (n) Goodwill
 Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents 
the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As permitted by 
IFRS, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the date of transition 
to IFRS of 1 July 2004 has not been restated, but is retranslated using 
exchange rates prevailing at each reporting date.
 Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. It is not subject to amortisation, 
but is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events 
or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. For 
the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to each of the cash-generating units (‘CGUs’), 
or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from that business 
combination. Each CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill is 
allocated represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored 
for internal management purposes.
 The Group’s impairment review compares the carrying value of the

 (l) Taxation (continued)
Group overview Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report Case studies
  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   125
Notes to the financial statements  The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted 
if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
 Assets under construction are carried at cost, less any impairment in 
value, and are included in the relevant asset category. Depreciation of 
these assets commences when they are available for their intended 
use.
 (q) Non-current assets held for sale
 Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying 
amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction, 
rather than through continuing use, and a sale is considered highly 
probable. They are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and 
fair value less costs to sell. An impairment loss is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement for any initial or subsequent write-
down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised 
in the Consolidated Income Statement for any subsequent increases 
in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any 
cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. 
 A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of 
the non-current asset is recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement at the date of derecognition. Non-current assets are not 
depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale and 
are presented separately from the other assets in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position.
 
 (r) Investments
 Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any impairment in 
value. 
 (s) Impairment of non-financial assets 
 Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets 
that are not available for use are not subject to amortisation and are 
tested annually for impairment. Other intangible assets and items of 
property, plant and equipment with finite useful lives are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
 An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value 
in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash 
flows have not been adjusted. Where assets do not generate cash 
flows independently from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset 
belongs.
 If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is 
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount 
of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than 
goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting 
date. 
 
 (t) Inventories
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, including attributable 
overheads, and net realisable value. Cost is calculated using the 
weighted average method in Technical Consulting and using the 
first-in, first-out method in Performance Products. Work in progress is 
stated at cost, including attributable overheads, less any foreseeable 
losses and progress payments received and receivable.
 
 (u) Financial instruments
 Non-derivative financial instruments
 The Group’s non-derivative financial instruments comprise 
trade receivables, trade payables, cash and cash equivalents 
and borrowings. In the Statements of Cash Flow, cash and cash 
equivalents comprise cash balances and bank overdrafts repayable 
on demand. In the Statements of Financial Position, bank overdrafts 
are shown within borrowings in current liabilities and bank loans are 
shown within borrowings in non-current liabilities.
 Trade receivables and payables are measured initially at fair value, 
and subsequently at amortised cost. Trade receivables are stated net 
of allowances for irrecoverable amounts. Evidence of impairment of 
trade receivables include indications that customers are experiencing 
significant financial difficulty or have significantly overdue 
balances. 
 Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of direct issue costs 
and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method. Differences between initial value and redemption value are 
recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of 
the loan.
 The fair values of non-derivative financial instruments other than loans 
due for repayment after more than one year are approximately equal 
to their book values. The fair value of loans due for repayment after 
more than one year is estimated by discounting the future contractual 
cash flows at the current market interest rate available to the Group 
for similar financial instruments.
 
 Derivative financial instruments
 Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and 
measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered 
into and subsequently measured at fair value and the gain or loss on 
remeasurement is taken to the Consolidated Income Statement.
 The Group employs derivative financial instruments, including foreign 
exchange contracts, to mitigate currency exposures on trading 
transactions. The Group does not hedge forecast transactions that will 
result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability. Fair values 
of derivative financial instruments are based on the market values of 
similar instruments at the reporting date.
 (v) Provisions
 A provision is required when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event 
and it is probable that settlement will be required of an amount that 
can be reliably estimated. 
 Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale of the 
relevant products, at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the Group’s liability. Provisions for dilapidations 
reflects the Directors’ best estimate of future obligations relating to 
the maintenance of leasehold properties arising from past events 
such as lease renewals or terminations.
 These estimates are reviewed each year and updated as necessary. 
 
 (w) Specific adjusting items
 Specific adjusting items are disclosed separately in the financial 
statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further 
understanding of the financial performance of the Group and due 
to the significance of their nature or amount. These items comprise 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related 
expenditure and reorganisation costs. Acquisition-related expenditure 
is incurred by the Group to effect a business combination, including 
the costs associated with the integration of acquired businesses 
together with dual-running costs incurred during a transitional

Notes to the financial statements services period. In the prior year, non-recurring income for claims 
under the Research & Development Expenditure Credit (‘RDEC’) 
scheme in respect of previous years were also included in specific 
adjusting items.
 
 (x) New standards and interpretations
 At 30 June 2017, the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) 
and IFRS IC had issued the standards and amendments, shown below, 
that subject to adoption by the EU, are effective after the current year-
end and have not been early adopted by the Group.
 It is not expected that the adoption of the standards and 
amendments listed above will have a significant impact on the 
financial statements of the Group in future periods, with the exception 
of IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, 
which may have a significant impact on revenue recognition and 
capitalisation of operating leases, respectively, together with the 
related disclosures. Further detail is set out below:

 IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ establishes principles 
for reporting the nature, amount and timing of revenue arising from 
an entity’s contracts with customers. The standard becomes effective 
for the Group for the financial year ending 30 June 2019 and the 
Group’s current intention is to apply the full retrospective approach 
upon adoption of IFRS 15. This approach requires all open contracts 
with customers that are presented in the financial statements for the 
year ending 30 June 2019 to be transitioned under the new standard. 
Comparative financial information for the financial year ending 30 
June 2018 will be restated, together with a cumulative adjustment 
to equity as at 1 July 2017. The full impact of IFRS 15 on the Group is 
currently being assessed and whilst a detailed exercise is required in 
order to fully identify and quantify the required changes in revenue 
recognition, the principal areas of the Group’s existing accounting 
policies which are presently expected to be affected by the new 
standard are set out below:
 
 Technical Consulting
 •  Revenue from performance of ‘fixed price’ and ‘time and materials’ 
contracts (2017 revenue: £282.4m): it is likely that revenue on the 
majority of contracts under standard terms and conditions for which 
revenue is currently recognised within the Technical Consulting 
segment will continue to be accounted for over time as performance 
occurs, with revenue recognised as a percentage of total contract 
value, calculated as cost incurred to date over total expected costs at 
completion. A small number of contracts may no longer qualify to be 
accounted for over time and revenue will instead be deferred until 
completion of the contract. Contracts in existence on the effective 
date with non-standard or customer-specified terms and conditions 
will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine the 
method of revenue recognition.
 •  Revenue from subscription services (2017 revenue: £5.1m): other 
contracts relate to the supply of annual subscription services, for 
which revenue from renewals is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the period of subscription. For new and upgrading customers 
where significant administrative effort is required to set up the 
services to be provided, revenue is recognised based on the fair 
value of the initial work performed. As a result of the new standard, it 
is likely that the total contract value will be recognised on a straight-
line basis over the period of subscription for all customers. This could 
result in a change in revenue depending upon the timing of signing 
contracts with new and upgrading customers
 
 Performance Products
 •  Revenue from sale of goods excluding perpetual software licences 
(2017 revenue: £56.8m): the timing of revenue recognised on the 
majority of such contracts is not expected to be significantly affected 
by IFRS 15 with revenue continuing to be recognised as control of 
the goods are passed to the customer, which is typically on delivery 
of goods to the customer.
 •  Revenue from software licences: (2017 revenue: £7.8m): revenues are 
also derived from the sale of software licences which can be leased 
by the customer or the customer can purchase a perpetual licence 
for indefinite use. Both types of licence sale can include maintenance 
and support. It is likely that revenue derived from leased software 
licences will continue to be recognised over the period of the lease 
on a straight-line basis. For perpetual licence sales, the fair value and 
purchase price is clearly set out within the contract, and is separable 
from any associated maintenance element, which is a standalone 
product that can be purchased in future years. Revenue recognition 
for perpetual software licence sales is therefore not currently 
expected to change, with the value of the perpetual licence being 
recognised when the software and the associated licence key has 
been delivered to the customer. With both types of licence sale, it 
is likely that any associated maintenance and support will continue 
to be recognised over the term of the maintenance and support 
agreement on a straight-line basis. 
 IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ sets out the requirements for the recognition of 
operating leases on the Statement of Financial Position. This requires 
a ‘right of use’ asset to be recognised as a non-current asset, together 
with the associated liability which represents the present value 
of the financial commitment. As at 30 June 2017, the Group has a 
future commitment in respect of operating leases which expire in 
more than 12 months from the reporting date of £48.8m, primarily 
in respect of property leases, and for which the present value is likely 
to be recognised on the Statement of Financial Position at transition. 
This standard becomes effective to the Group for the financial year 
ending 30 June 2020. This standard is subject to endorsement by the 
European Union.

Notes to the financial statements  The Group's operating segments are being reported based on the financial information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker who is the 
Chief Executive Officer. The reportable segments are Technical Consulting and Performance Products. These were identified by evaluating the Group's 
products and services, processes, types of customers and delivery methods.
 •  Technical Consulting generates income from the delivery of engineering programmes and technology projects, together with environmental and 
management consultancy services. This operating segment also generates income from independent assurance services provided through the 
Group's rail business.
 •  Performance Products generates income from manufacturing, assembly, software sales and related services.
 Inter-segment revenue is eliminated on consolidation. Transactions are entered into on an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions with 
third parties.
 Management monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing 
performance. Segment performance is measured based on operating profit. Included within the Head Office column in the following tables are 
functions managed by a central division, including the costs of running the public limited company, which are recharged to the other operating 
segments.

the integration of the LR Rail businesses subsequent to their acquisition, together with dual-running costs incurred during a transitional services period with Lloyd’s Register. 
In the current year, expenditure has been incurred of £0.5m, offset by £0.4m of fair value provisions recognised on acquisition which have been released within specific 
adjusting items where those risks will not crystallise as originally anticipated.
(2)  Other acquisition-related expenditure primarily comprises costs incurred in the years ended 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016 for services rendered to, and consumed by, 
the Group to effect the Motorcycle Engineering Italia (Exnovo) and Control Point Corporation acquisitions (see Notes 12 and 39, respectively), together with the Cascade 
acquisition in the previous financial year. The expenditure also comprises costs associated with the integration of the Motorcycle Engineering Italia (Exnovo) and Cascade 
businesses subsequent to their acquisition. In addition, the costs of the associated earn-out arrangements of the Motorcycle Engineering Italia (Exnovo) acquisition, 
together with the Cascade, Power Planning Associates and Vepro acquisitions made in prior years are also included.
(3)   Reorganisation costs relate to expenditure incurred as a result of the formation of the new Global Automotive structure from the operations of the Group’s Automotive 
technical centres across Europe, China and North America. The costs incurred in the year comprised initial planning activities undertaken to implement a reorganisation of 
Europe Technical Consulting into Automotive EMEA in order to align with the new Global Automotive structure for which a detailed formal plan has now been announced. 
In addition, activities were also undertaken during the year to prepare the test cell and related assets at the Group’s technical centre in Chicago for disposal (see Note 19).
(4)  On 2 July 2013, legislation was enacted to allow UK companies to elect for the Research and Development Expenditure Credit (‘RDEC’) on qualifying expenditure incurred 
since 1 April 2013, instead of the ‘super-deduction’ rules, which were abolished from 1 April 2016. Management elected to adopt the RDEC regime as of 1 July 2015, which 
also permitted claims to be made on qualifying expenditure under RDEC in excess of the tax relief received under the legacy scheme since 1 July 2013. The credit in the 
prior year related to claims made for the excess in RDEC over the tax relief received under the legacy scheme in the two years between enactment and adoption. The credit 
was recorded as other income and classified as a specific adjusting item on the basis that it was non-recurring and there was no corresponding expenditure against which 
these credits could be offset.

Notes to the financial statements 10 Earnings per share
 Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the year, excluding those held by an employee benefit trust for the Long-Term Incentive Plan ('LTIP') and by the Share Incentive Plan 
('SIP') for the free share scheme which are treated as cancelled for the purposes of the calculation. 
 For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares. These include potential awards of LTIP shares and options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the market price 
of the Company's ordinary shares at year-end.         
 Reconciliations of the earnings and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below. Underlying earnings per share is 
also shown because the Directors consider that this provides a more useful indication of underlying performance and trends over time.

Notes to the financial statements 12 Acquisitions
 On 29 July 2016 the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Motorcycle Engineering Italia s.r.l., which was subsequently renamed Ricardo 
Motorcycle Italia s.r.l., for total cash consideration of £1.9m (€2.2m). This business was formed from the operating assets and employees of Exnovo s.r.l., 
a vehicle design house which creates class-leading aesthetics for global motorcycle and scooter brands.
 The following table sets out the consideration paid for Motorcycle Engineering Italia s.r.l., together with the fair value of the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed:
£m
Cash consideration 1.9 
Fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
Customer contracts and relationships (Note 14) 0.2 
Other intangible assets (Note 14) 0.1 
Trade and other receivables 0.9 
Trade and other payables (2.4)
Provisions (0.1)
Total fair value of identifiable net assets (1.3)
Goodwill 3.2 
Total 1.9 
 All of the cash consideration of £1.9 was paid in the year.
 Adjustments have been made to identifiable assets and liabilities on acquisition to reflect their fair value. These include the recognition of customer-
related intangible assets amounting to £0.2m. The fair values of net assets acquired were identified following a valuation exercise in accordance with 
the requirements of IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'. 
 The goodwill arising on acquisition can be ascribed to the existence of a skilled, active workforce, developed expertise and processes and the 
opportunities to obtain new contracts and develop the business. None of these meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets separable from 
goodwill. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
 The fair value of trade and other receivables of £0.9m includes net trade receivables of £0.4m and amounts recoverable on contracts of £0.2m, all of 
which is expected to be collectible.
 Acquisition-related expenditure of £0.8m has been charged to the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 30 June 2017 and is disclosed as 
a specific adjusting item in Note 4.
 The revenue included in the Consolidated Income Statement in relation to the acquired business was £3.0m. The underlying operating profit over the 
same period was £Nil. This is reported in the Technical Consulting segment.
 Had Motorcycle Engineering Italia s.r.l. been acquired and consolidated from 1 July 2016, revenue and underlying operating profit in the Consolidated 
Income Statement would be £0.3m higher and £0.1m lower, respectively, based on available information for the month from 1 July 2016 to the 
acquisition date.

Notes to the financial statements  The recoverable amount of each CGU is calculated by assessing its value in use, which is determined by performing discounted future pre-tax cash flow 
calculations for a five-year period and projected into perpetuity. The five-year cash flow forecasts are based on the budget for the following year (year 
one), the business plans for years two and three (the three-year plan), and operating profit projections for years four and five, with an 70% operating 
cash flow conversion rate. 
 The three-year plan is prepared by management, reviewed and approved by the Board, and reflects past experience, management’s assessment of the 
current contract portfolio, contract wins, contract retention, price increases, gross margin, as well as future expected market trends. Operating profit 
projections for years four and five, and cash flows beyond year five are projected into perpetuity using a long-term growth rate, which is determined as 
the lower of the planned growth rate in year three and the external forecast of the economic growth rate for the economies in which the CGU primarily 
operates. 
 Apart from operating cash flows and economic growth rates, the other key assumption is the pre-tax discount rate, which is derived from externally 
sourced data and reflects the current market assessment of the Group’s time value of money and risks specific to each CGU.
 The carrying value of goodwill and key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amount of each CGU are as follows:

 The three-year plan and discounted cash flow calculations thereon provide a value in use which supports the carrying value of the goodwill allocated 
to each CGU at 30 June 2017, resulting in no impairment for the year (2016: £Nil). In considering sensitivities, no reasonable change in any of the above 
key assumptions would cause the value in use of the CGUs to fall below the carrying value of the allocated goodwill. The sensitivities assessed include 
a 10% reduction in planned operating profit, a 20% reduction in the planned operating cash flow conversion rate and a 1% increase in the pre-tax 
discount rate, together with a further scenario whereby all sensitivities are combined together.      
   
(1)  The fair value assessment of the Chinese Rail operations that were acquired from Lloyd's Register on 1 March 2016 was completed on 28 February 2017. The completion of 
this exercise resulted in an addition of £0.2m to this CGU. The remaining increase in the value of this CGU is as a result of a retranslation adjustment of £0.8m in respect of 
foreign exchange.         
         
(2)  Subsequent to the acquisition and integration described in footnote (3) which added £3.2m of goodwill to Ricardo Motorcycle, that business was fully integrated and 
subsumed within the European Technical Consulting business. This represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and 
represents the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates independent future cash inflows. Consequently, the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to the 
Ricardo Motorcycle CGU at that point of £4.6m has been reallocated to the Ricardo Europe Technical Consulting CGU. The remaining increase in the value of this CGU is as 
a result of a retranslation adjustment of £0.8m in respect of foreign exchange. As set out in Note 4, the CGU was renamed Ricardo Automotive EMEA in anticipation of a 
planned reorganisation of the Group's Global Automotive business.         
         
(3)  As set out in further detail in Note 12, the Group acquired Motorcycle Engineering Italia (Exnovo) on 29 July 2016 for its class-leading aesthetics for global motorcycle and 
scooter brands which provides Ricardo Motorcycle with additional capability and reach. The identifiable post-acquisition assets and liabilities of Motorcycle Engineering 
Italia (Exnovo), as well as its employees and contracts were subsumed and fully integrated into Ricardo Motorcycle, adding £3.2m of goodwill to the CGU.

 On 23 June 2017, an agreement was reached to sell and lease back a property for £4.0m that had been built on leased premises together with an 
increase in annual rent charges of £0.3m over an extended lease term. The profit on disposal of the property after transaction costs was £1.8m, of which 
£0.7m has been recognised within underlying profit before tax in the Consolidated Income Statement. The remaining £1.1m has been recognised 
in the Statement of Financial Position and will be offset against the increase in annual rent charges over the remaining term of the extended lease 
agreement for the premises on which the property was built. The depreciation charged on the property until the point of sale was included within 
administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
 A contingent liability of up to £2.8m which is associated with a guarantee provided to the Ricardo Group Pension Fund in July 2013 (see Note 36) is 
secured on specific land and buildings.

variable rates of interest which are dependent upon the leverage of the Group and range from 1.6% to 2.35% above LIBOR. Leverage is defined as being 
net debt as a proportion of EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as being operating profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. At the reporting 
date, the Group was paying interest at the 2nd tier rate of LIBOR + 1.85%. The Group’s leverage at the reporting date will qualify to attract the lowest 
rate of interest, being LIBOR + 1.6%.
 The Group has banking facilities for its UK companies which together have a net overdraft limit. The balances are shown gross in the financial 
statements as cash and cash equivalents and borrowings.

 Net derivative financial assets of £0.2m (2016: net derivative financial liabilities of £2.1m) relate to foreign exchange contracts.
 Summary of methods and assumptions
 Short-term borrowings and deposits:
 The fair value of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these 
instruments. 
 Long-term borrowings:
 The fair value of borrowings approximates to the carrying value in the Statement of Financial Position as they are primarily floating rate loans where 
payments are reset to market rates at regular intervals.
 Derivatives:
 Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently 
measured at fair value. Fair value is estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves. Amounts 
denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date (Level 2 under the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy). 
 During the year the following foreign exchange differences were credited/(charged) to the Consolidated Income Statement:

Notes to the financial statements 24 Financial risks
 (a) Objectives, policies and strategies         
 The financial risks faced by the Group and the Company comprise capital risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk (comprising interest rate risk and 
foreign exchange risk). The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks. The Group and the Company have no material exposure 
to commodity price fluctuations and this situation is not expected to change in the foreseeable future.
 The Group's financial instruments comprise floating rate borrowings, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Group's operations and 
foreign exchange contracts used to manage currency risks. The Company's financial instruments comprise floating rate borrowings.
 (b) Capital risk         
 The objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
 Capital is monitored on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as borrowings 
less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the Statement of Financial Position, plus net debt.

Total capital 193.6 173.9 132.1 134.9 
At 30 June 19.6% 19.8% 18.8% 13.3% 
 (c) Liquidity risk         
 The Group and Company policy towards managing their liquidity risks is to maintain a mix of short- and medium-term borrowing facilities with their 
bankers. Short-term flexibility is provided by bank overdraft facilities. In addition, the Group and Company maintain medium-term borrowing facilities 
in order to provide the appropriate level of finance to support the current and future requirements. As the cash profile on large contracts can vary 
significantly, the Group seeks committed facilities that provide substantial headroom against forecast requirements to mitigate its exposure.
 At the year-end, the Group held total facilities of £91.1m (2016: £90.9m). This included committed facilities of £75.0m (2016: £75.0m). £59.7m of 
committed facilities were drawn at 30 June 2017 (2016: £54.5m), net of direct issue costs. Committed facilities were primarily drawn to fund acquisitions. 
Of the committed facilities, a £35.0m facility is available for the period to September 2019 and a £40.0m facility is available until April 2020. In addition, 
the Group has uncommitted facilities including overdrafts of £16.1m at 30 June 2017 (2016: £15.9m), which mature throughout the next financial year 
and are renewable annually.

Notes to the financial statements 24 Financial risks (continued)
 (d) Credit risk         
 The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of its trade receivables, which are stated net of provision for impairment. Exposure to this risk is mitigated 
by careful evaluation of the granting of credit and the use of credit insurance where practicable.
 Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group's customer base being large and unrelated.

At 30 June 58.8 53.0 
 The Group's customers include the world's major transportation original equipment manufacturers and operators, supply chain organisations, energy 
companies, financial institutions and government agencies. Revenue by customer location is disclosed within Note 3(b) and trade receivables are 
derived from these customer groups and locations. 
 Net trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired of £44.0m (2016: £39.7m) consist of £33.7m (2016: £26.6m) relating to the UK business, 
£1.9m (2016: £4.6m) relating to the European business, £4.0m (2016: £4.1m) relating to the US business, £2.9m (2016: £4.3m) relating to the Asian 
business and £1.5m (2016: £0.1m) relating to the business in the Middle East. Net trade receivables that are overdue but not impaired of £14.8m  
(2016: £13.3m) consist of £6.4m (2016: £7.7m) relating to the UK business, £1.1m (2016: £2.6m) relating to the European business, £3.6m (2016: £2.4m) 
relating to the US business, £1.9m (2016: £0.4m) relating to the Asian business and £1.8m (2016: £0.2m) relating to the business in the Middle East.
 We have limited experience of bad debts with any of these customers. £23.1m of the total net trade receivables balance was received in July 2017. Due 
to these factors, the Directors are of the opinion that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of any existing provision for impairment.

(2016: £3.3m) held in the US, £12.9m (2016: £8.1m) held in Asia and £0.5m (2016: £3.2m) held in the Middle East.
 The Group and Company is exposed to bank credit risk in respect of money held on deposit and certain derivative transactions entered into with banks. 
Exposure to this form of risk is mitigated as material transactions are only undertaken with bank counterparties that have high credit ratings assigned 
by international credit-rating agencies. The Group and Company further limits risk in this area by setting an overall credit limit for all transactions with 
each bank counterparty in accordance with the institution's credit standing.
 
 (e) Market risk         
 Interest rate risk         
 The Group and Company borrowings and cash balances held at floating interest rates are exposed to cash flow interest rate risk. As set out in further 
detail in Note 22, the exposure to interest rate movements is not currently hedged as the variable rates of interest are largely dependent upon the 
leverage of the Group, which is currently attracting the lowest possible rate of interest. The effect of any foreseen changes in the LIBOR remain 
unhedged, although the policy is reviewed on an ongoing basis.

 Foreign exchange risk         
 The Group faces currency exposures on trading transactions undertaken by its subsidiaries in foreign currencies and balances arising therefrom, and on 
the translation of profits earned in, and net assets of, overseas subsidiaries, primarily in the US, Netherlands, Germany and China.
 The carrying amounts of the Group's foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are:

Euro 13.2 11.9 (11.6) (5.2)
Chinese Renminbi 13.3 8.7 (0.4) (0.1)
 It is the Group's policy not to undertake any speculative currency transactions.
 The Group hedges transactional exposures relating to its foreign currency exposures on contracts by taking out foreign exchange contracts or other 
derivative financial instruments.
 The Company hedges currency risk on its US Dollar, Euro and Chinese Renminbi denominated receivables from related parties.
 (f) Analysis of sensitivity of financial instruments to market risk
 Exchange rate sensitivity
 The Group has financial instruments in assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, principally in US Dollars, Euros and Chinese Renminbi, where the 
financial instruments are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them. A 20% change in the value of the US Dollar, Euro or Chinese 
Renminbi would have an insignificant impact on the value of financial instruments at the year-end. Given the relative strengthening of the Group's 
principal foreign currencies against the Pound Sterling in the financial year following the result of the UK referendum vote to leave the EU, a 20% 
sensitivity in these exchange rates is deemed to be appropriate.
 
 Interest rate sensitivity
 A 1% change in either the US Dollar, Euro, Chinese Renminbi or Sterling interest rates would have an insignificant impact on the value of the Group's 
floating rate financial instruments at the year-end. A 1% sensitivity is deemed to be appropriate as loans are based on LIBOR and so are unlikely to be 
subjected to significant fluctuations in interest rates in the foreseeable future.
 
 (g) Cash flow hedges
 The Group uses foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the exposure arising from orders in foreign currencies that could 
affect the Consolidated Income Statement. The principal risk being hedged is the Euro/Sterling, US Dollar/Sterling and Chinese Renminbi/Sterling 
spot and interest rate differential exchange rate risk arising from orders in foreign currencies. The spot and interest rate differential component of the 
contracts taken out is designated as a hedge of the change in fair value of the cash flows on the firm orders in foreign currencies that are attributable 
to movements in the Euro/Sterling, US Dollar/Sterling and Chinese Renminbi/Sterling spot and interest rates. Since the Group does not hedge account, 
any change in the fair value of the instrument is recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Notes to the financial statements 25 Retirement benefit obligations
 Group and Company         
 Defined contribution and defined benefit schemes
 The Group operates various defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held in separately administered funds. The Group 
also operates a defined benefit pension scheme, the Ricardo Group Pension Fund ('RGPF'), which closed to future accrual on 28 February 2010. 
Responsibility for the governance of the RGPF lies with the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees must be comprised of representatives of the Group 
and RGPF participants in accordance with the RGPF's regulations. 
 The last triennial valuation of the RGPF was completed with an effective date of 5 April 2014. At that date, the assets of the fund had a market 
value of £96.3m and were sufficient to cover 79% of the benefits that had accrued to members when assessed on the Trustees' prudent funding 
basis. Contributions due to the RGPF during the year ending 30 June 2017 are £4.3m. The Company has agreed with the Trustees that the annual 
contributions of £4.3m will continue until 31 January 2021, in order to eliminate the Trustees' funding deficit revealed at the 5 April 2014 valuation. The 
next triennial valuation was on 5 April 2017, and this process is expected to complete in the year ending 30 June 2018. The results of the 2017 triennial 
valuation will determine whether the Group's current contribution commitment remains appropriate.
 The IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' valuation was completed as at 30 June 2017 and the pension costs relating to the RGPF were assessed using the 
projected unit credit method in accordance with the advice of Mercer, qualified actuaries. The post-retirement mortality assumptions for the current 
year have been reviewed. The use of a standard baseline by SAPS, known as the 'Series 2' tables, with a 98% multiplier for males and 95% multiplier 
for females is consistent with the prior year. The future improvements component has been updated to be in line with the Continuous Mortality 
Investigation ('CMI') 2016 projection model. The use of a 1.25% long-term trend (based upon each member's year of birth) is consistent with the prior 
year. Under these mortality assumptions the expected future lifetime from age 65 is:

 Movements in the fair value of scheme assets and present value of defined benefit obligations were as follows:
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the principal assumptions is:
Change in  
assumption
Impact on defined 
benefit obligation
Decrease in discount rate 0.25% Increase by £7.1m
Increase in inflation rate 0.25% Increase by £4.3m
Increase in life expectancy 1 year Increase by £5.6m
 The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice this is unlikely to occur 
and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial 
assumptions, the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the Statement of Financial Position. The 
methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change when compared to the previous year.
 The Group is exposed to a number of risks from the RGPF, the most significant of which are described below:
Asset volatility: The RGPF liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. If the RGPF assets 
underperform this yield, the deficit will increase. The RGPF holds a significant proportion of equities and diversified growth 
funds, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term. 
The Directors are of the view that due to the long-term nature of the RGPF liabilities and the strength of the supporting Group, 
this is an appropriate strategy to manage the RGPF efficiently.
Changes in corporate 
bond yields:
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase RGPF liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value 
of the RGPF's bond holdings. The UK referendum vote to leave the EU in 2016 has caused volatility in the market which has, and 
may continue to, adversely affect corporate bond yields, with a corresponding impact on discount rates as described above.
Inflation risk: Although there are some caps in place to protect the RGPF against extreme inflation, increases in the level of inflation will lead 
to higher liabilities.
Life expectancy: The RGPF provides benefits for the life of the members, therefore increases in the life expectancy will result in an increase in the 
RGPF's liabilities.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 18.1 years.

(a) Deferred tax analysis by category
(b) Movements in net deferred tax assets and liabilities
 At 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016 there were no temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax 
liabilities have been recognised. No liability would be recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
 A deferred tax asset has not been recognised for the current year tax losses within the consolidated tax group controlled by Ricardo GmbH, within 
which Ricardo Deutschland GmbH is the primary trading entity. The deferred tax asset not recognised in respect of these losses at 30 June 2017 
amounts to £6.0m (2016: £5.1m). This increase is primarily as a result of a reduction in the recognised carrying value at 30 June 2017 of the deferred tax 
asset in the consolidated tax group controlled by Ricardo GmbH, which is currently £2.4m (2016: £3.6m). The Directors have derecognised £1.5m in the 
year to reflect their assessment as to the extent of future taxable profits that will be available within the consolidated tax group controlled by Ricardo 
GmbH against which the carrying value of the recognised deferred tax asset can be utilised in the foreseeable future.
 A deferred tax asset also continues to be recognised within the consolidated tax group controlled by Ricardo, Inc. in respect of historic research and 
development claims that can be utilised against future taxable profits. These claims carry a 20-year statute of limitation and must be utilised within that 
period. The carrying value at 30 June 2017 for the deferred tax asset in the consolidated tax group controlled by Ricardo, Inc. that has been recognised 
is £5.9m (2016: £4.9m). The Directors have performed an assessment and consider that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available within 
the consolidated tax group controlled by Ricardo, Inc. against which the carrying value of the recognised deferred tax asset can be utilised in the 
foreseeable future.

 The warranty provision reflects the Directors' best estimate of the cost needed to fulfil the Group's warranty obligations within a number of contracts. 
Subsequent to their initial recognition, warranty provisions unwind over the periods of the warranty obligations, which are expected to be less than five 
years.
 The dilapidation provision reflects the Directors' best estimate of future obligations relating to the maintenance of leasehold properties arising from 
past events such as lease renewals or terminations. The timing of the cash flows is dependent upon the remaining term of the associated lease.
 Other provisions comprise those for claims, litigation, restructuring costs and statutory provisions for employment-related benefits, including long-
service awards and termination indemnity schemes. The associated cash outflows for claims, litigation and restructuring costs are primarily less than 
one year, whilst the cash outflows associated with statutory employment-related benefits are expected to be more than five years.

Notes to the financial statements 30 Share-based payments
 The Group operates the following share-based payment schemes: 2004 Ricardo plc Executive Share Option Plan (the ‘2004 Plan’); equity-settled and 
cash-settled Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’); Deferred Share Bonus Plan (‘DBP’) and equity-settled all-employee Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’).
 The general terms and conditions, including vesting requirements and performance conditions for the 2004 Plan, equity-settled LTIP , DBP and equity-
settled SIP are described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
 The 2004 Plan, LTIP , DBP and SIP require shareholder approval for the issue of shares. There were no awards outstanding in relation to the SIP at the year-end.
 50% of awards granted under the LTIP and DBP Matching Awards are dependent on a Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance condition. As relative 
TSR is defined as a market condition under IFRS 2, this requires that the valuation model used takes into account the anticipated performance outcome. 
The TSR element of the charge to the Consolidated Income Statement has been calculated using the Monte Carlo model and the earnings per share 
(‘EPS’) element has been calculated using the Black Scholes model. The following assumptions are used for the plan cycles commencing in these years:
2017 2016
Weighted average share price at date of award 929p 920p
Expected volatility 25.4% 23.8%
Expected life 3 yrs 3 yrs
Risk-free rate 0.2% 0.8%
Dividend yield 2.0% 2.0%
Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 10% 10%
Weighted average fair value per LTIP as a percentage of a share at date of award 74.8% 76.6%
 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company's share price over the three financial years preceding the date 
of award.
 The share-based payments charge of £1.6m (2016: £1.5m) disclosed in Note 7 comprised £1.6m (2016: £1.5m) in respect of equity-settled schemes and 
£Nil (2016: £Nil) in respect of cash-settled schemes.

 In the ordinary course of business, the Group has £7.8m (2016: £6.3m) of guarantees and counter-indemnities in respect of bonds relating to 
performance under contracts. The Group is also involved in commercial disputes and litigation with some customers, which is also in the normal course 
of business. Whilst the result of such disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, the Directors of the Company believe that the ultimate resolution of 
these disputes will not have a material effect on the Group's financial position or results.
 In July 2013, a guarantee was provided to the Ricardo Group Pension Fund of £2.8m in respect of certain contingent liabilities that may arise, which 
have been secured on specific land and buildings (see Note 15). In the Directors' opinion, after taking appropriate legal advice, the outcome of this 
matter is not expected to give rise to any material cost to the Group.

Notes to the financial statements 39 Events after the reporting date
 On 8 September 2017 the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Control Point Corporation (‘CPC’) for initial cash consideration of £5.3m 
($7.0m), rising to total cash consideration of £7.8m ($10.2m), subject to any adjustment to reflect normalised levels of working capital, the achievement 
of certain financial performance targets and the retention of specific individuals. CPC is a US-based full-service engineering firm which operates 
principally in the defence sector and has expertise in distributed software-based systems, fleet management technologies and the acquisition expands 
upon the Group’s vehicle engineering capabilities.
 The following table sets out the consideration paid for CPC, together with the provisional assessment of the net assets acquired:
£m
Initial cash consideration 5.3 
Provisional assessment of identifiable net assets acquired 3.3
Provisional goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets 2.0
Total 5.3 
 All of the initial cash consideration of £5.3m ($7.0m) was paid after the year-end in September 2017. The acquisition was completed on a cash-free and 
debt-free basis, subject to normal levels of working capital.        
 Adjustments have not yet been made to identifiable net assets on acquisition to reflect their fair value, including the recognition of customer-related 
intangible assets separable from the goodwill arising on acquisition. It is expected that the remaining value of goodwill will be ascribed to the existence 
of a skilled, active workforce, developed expertise and processes and the opportunities to obtain new contracts and develop the business. The goodwill 
recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
 Given the proximity of the completed acquisition of CPC to the date of approval of these financial statements, the provisional assessment of net assets 
acquired is based upon available financial information.
 The provisional value for initial consideration and provisional assessment of net assets acquired may be adjusted in future in accordance with the 
requirements of IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' and the sale and purchase agreement. 
 The provisional assessment of net assets of £3.3m ($4.3m) includes net trade receivables of £2.4m ($3.1m) and amounts recoverable on contracts of 
£0.4m ($0.6m), all of which is expected to be collectible.
 Acquisition-related expenditure of £0.3m has been charged to the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 30 June 2017 and is disclosed as 
a specific adjusting item in Note 4.
