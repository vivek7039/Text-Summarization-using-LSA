THE RIGHT BUSINESS MODEL  
TO CREATE VALUE
We are proud to be independent. We can open sites where 
we see opportunity, buy the stock that our customers are 
demanding and take pride in developing our people to 
deliver the Motorpoint values.
We aren’t a franchise operation, so are free from the 
influence that the franchised dealers may feel from their 
manufacturer partners. This allows us to take market 
opportunities where available and operate  
without brand restriction.
WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT?
Franchised dealer Motorpoint
New sites and  
growth opportunity
Can only expand with agreement 
of the manufacturer.
Typically has to acquire an existing dealer,  
often paying significant goodwill.
We can open wherever we see a market 
opportunity; speed and scale are in our control.
We can choose to buy an existing dealer,  
or develop a new operation, avoiding the  
need for goodwill payments.
Product  
offer
The only retailer in the local market selling  
brand new cars from that manufacturer.
Supplemented by used cars, parts and servicing.
100% dedicated to nearly-new car sales.
Brand and  
reputation
Customer perception of the dealer’s brand  
is substantially dictated by their  
perception of that manufacturer.
We build our own brand independently;  
our reputation is formed purely by how our team 
and customers feel about us.
Breadth  
of stock
Typically only one or two brands available 
on a single site.
Stock substantially secured from the tied OEM.
On average 33 brands available on site or online, 
spanning all of the leading makes and models, 
sourced from multiple channels.
All stock is available nationally and can be moved  
to a customer’s local site for a maximum of £99.
Operational  
control
Manufacturer prescribes operational and customer 
relations systems, staff recruitment and training 
programmes, specifications for showroom fit-out,  
the geography into which the dealer can advertise, 
the format of customer satisfaction programmes 
and marketing messages.
No external restrictions or controls.
Proprietary systems can be built; bespoke values- 
led development and staff engagement programme; 
marketing can be via any channel or into any 
geography; showroom fit-out costs support 
Motorpoint’s value proposition.
Financing
Typically provided on standard terms 
by the manufacturer.
Free to negotiate for the most competitive terms  
on the external market.

The Company’s dedication  
to offering Choice, Value  
and Service will ensure that 
Motorpoint remains  
the Car Buyer’s Champion.
MARK MORRIS
NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN
Trading and Financial Performance
Following our successful admission to the 
London Stock Exchange in May 2016, our 
trading and financial performance in the 
weeks around the UK Referendum on EU 
membership and in the months that followed 
was undoubtedly disappointing and 
affected the whole year’s performance. 
Whilst there are always lessons to be 
learned, I believe that management made 
appropriate decisions in this period of 
uncertainty and reduced demand. The 
impact of these external factors was also 
exacerbated by our accelerated site 
opening programme, which, although it 
bodes well for long term value creation,  
did stretch management resources,  
an issue which we have addressed.
The second half of the financial year was 
much more promising, and there were  
some notable achievements during the  
year, including the opening of our 10th and 
11th sites, and securing a site for our 12th 
business which opened in Sheffield in late 
April 2017. Our management team has  
been strengthened and broadened.
Our Market
We have seen the market continue  
to grow this year, a demand that we  
are ideally positioned to deliver. The 
franchised dealer groups have stated  
their ambition to grow their used car 
revenue as the outlook for the new car 
market loses momentum. But our business 
model is built on a unique customer 
proposition based on Choice, Value and 
Service, a commitment to getting a highly 
engaged team and the flexibility that 
independence from the manufacturers 
gives. We will continue to prove our ability  
to win the admiration and loyalty of our 
customers and take market share.
Dividend 
I am pleased to announce that the Directors 
have recommended a final dividend of  
2.90 pence per share, which would give  
a total for the year of 4.23 pence per share. 
This represents dividend cover of 3 times  
of adjusted EPS.

Your Board 
I am delighted to be working with our 
independent non-executives with each of 
Mary McNamara, Gordon Hurst and Steve 
Weller joining on our flotation in May 2016. 
They bring a wealth of experience and 
independence, and already the Board is 
working very effectively. I look forward to 
their support over the years ahead.
David Shelton, co-founder of Motorpoint  
and an Executive Director, will be making  
a phased shift from being executive to 
non-executive over the next nine months. 
We are glad to be able to retain David’s 
passion, experience and knowledge of the 
motor industry within Motorpoint.
Reaching our first year end as a public 
company I am proud to have overseen the 
smooth transition from private ownership. 
This year we have invested significant time in 
building our governance structure, including 
developing our risk appetite and setting this 
in context of our long term strategy.
The Year Ahead
Everyone at Motorpoint knows that to stay 
ahead we need deliver better, faster and 
more simply for our customers. There 
remain dampening external factors on 
consumer confidence in the UK, but if we 
pursue with relentless energy our core 
retail proposition of Choice, Value and 
Service we will continue to grow market 
share: through our like for like estate, our 
leading online offer and our new sites as 
they mature.

Q1 Q2
10 Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Overview
I am pleased to report our first full year 
results following our listing on the premium 
segment of the London Stock Exchange in 
May 2016. 
Despite a challenging first half of the year, 
the Group delivered an improved trading 
performance in the second half and Group 
revenue for the year increased by 12.7% to 
£822.0m (FY16: £729.2m).
During the year, we opened two new retail  
sites, Castleford in April 2016 and Oldbury  
in July 2016, increasing our number of sites 
to 11. These sites are trading on plan and 
complement the Group’s existing footprint. 
During Q4, we completed the substantial 
preparation work for our 12th site, in 
Sheffield, which opened in April 2017.
Customer satisfaction remains a key priority 
for the Group and we measure this using 
NPS. I am pleased that this has increased 
during FY17 from 72% to 77%, reflecting the 
continued hard work of our colleagues.
Our Focus on Team
Our passionate focus on developing our 
team is the driving force of our long term 
success with a high proportion of our team 
internally promoted. We are constantly 
developing our talent with several Talent 
Management and Leadership programmes 
running at one time. We listen to our people 
through surveys and forums and we 
communicate openly and honestly with our 
team. Our team is the best source for new 
ideas that lead to new initiatives and fuel 
our future growth.
We are leaders in people development 
and we are convinced this will maintain our 
differentiated style from the rest of the car 
retail industry, and be a major driver of our 
continued success.
Talent Management Programme
Our Talent Management programme is 
available to all of our team who show 
leadership potential and ambition. Now  
in its third year, the programme supports  
our focus on putting the team first by 
developing those high potential employees 
into future Senior Managers. The 
programme is designed to identify and 
develop key talent, who are then able to 
take key roles across the business and 
encourage an ever-rising bar of leadership 
behaviours. Our business relies on having 
the right person in the right role at the  
right time; by building a pool of talented 
employees we are able to offer new 
opportunities and career progression.  
We are also better placed to retain our  
most talented employees and thereby 
reduce staff turnover.
In the three and a half years since the 
programme’s inception, it has seen 38  
of our team attend, with 22 of those  
having been promoted into a new position 
once involved in the programme. We are 
proud of our culture and commitment to 
developing our existing people.
Investing to Support our Growth
To support our strategic vision for growth, 
we are continuing to invest in better use of 
data across the business. We are building 
our capability in stock, marketing and 
customer relationship management, with 
new initiatives underway to prepare for 
the next phase of growth.
We remain objective in our new site 
approach, balancing the growth opportunity 
with the need to ensure that new sites are 
given enough support to build their teams 
and customer offer.
For the year ahead we will continue to 
support the most recent site openings 
in order to build the strong foundation that 
will position us well in the future and at the 
same time ensure that we continue our 
growth from existing sites.
NextGear 
partnership

Our online auction 
platform to dispose of 
non-retail cars is now 
supported by NextGear.

insurance products from  
1 December 2016.
New lower 
finance rate
Our finance offering to our 
customers was made more 
competitive in the period, 
which has increased 
customer take-up.
Q3 Q4
Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 11 In June 2017, our Board of Directors 
recommended Motorpoint Group Plc’s first 
full year dividend, of 2.90 pence per share, 
which would take the total dividend for the 
year to 4.23 pence per share. This level  
of proposed dividend underscores our 
confidence in delivering strong, profitable 
sales and cash ﬂow, and generating 
superior financial returns.
Current Trading and Outlook
Our recent openings have built up a 
considerable growth opportunity for the 
year ahead; by building volumes in this third 
of our estate that is under two years old, we 
will achieve a rapid cash return on these 
investments. Supported by an expanded 
and strengthened management team, we 
are well positioned to deliver the Motorpoint 
model across the estate.  
We are excited by the future potential of 
Motorpoint as our team and customers 
benefit from the time and energy invested 
in recent periods. We are never satisfied 
with the status quo and will always 
challenge it to further the success of 
the Company.
We have many new initiatives underway to 
drive increased levels of customer traffic  
to both our physical sites and online, and 
improved systems and processes in place to 
support our teams in delivering outstanding 
customer satisfaction.
Customers
Our strategy of delivering unrivalled Choice, 
Value and Service to all our customers has 
been our vision since we opened 19 years 
ago and continues to be our core focus.  
We find a strong correlation between our 
team engagement levels and a high level  
of customer service delivery. 
Reflecting changes in customers’  
research and buying journeys, we are 
increasingly recognising the value of peer 
recommendations and customer reviews.  
These reviews are an honest and unbiased 
view of our team, our proposition and our 
company values; I am delighted to see 
that our continued focus and passion on 
championing the customer is recognised 
in these ratings that our customers give us.  
On one of the leading review sites, Google, 
for example, we have seen our rating rise 
to 4.6 stars over the year.
Our NPS, for the year increased from 72% 
to 77%, and increased from 59% in FY14, 
something of which we are very proud.  
Our repeat customers continue to grow, 
allowing our marketing costs to remain  
low in established sites.
Financial Strength
Our balance sheet strength, and the 
ﬂexibility of having no fixed term debt, 
give us great confidence.
Our financial returns and enviable cash 
generation allow us to simultaneously invest 
in the growth of the business and return 
cash to shareholders. We take a disciplined 
approach to capital allocation, which drove 
our strong 112% return on capital employed. 
In FY17, we generated £13.6m in cash from 
operations prior to exceptionals, raised our 
stock levels by £23.5m and invested  
a total of £1.1m in new sites.
Economic and political uncertainty remains 
apparent in the near term, which may 
adversely impact customer confidence.  
We remain confident that our focus on 
Choice, Value and Service remains relevant 
in the face of any fall in customer confidence.
Our key strengths that differentiate us from 
the rest of the market give us confidence 
that our value proposition will continue to 
gather pace in our current footprint and in 
our new site pipeline.
Mark Carpenter
Chief Executive Officer
12 June 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT CONTINUED
12 Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report MARKET REPORT
The UK new car market continued to grow throughout FY17 
and we are well positioned to benefit from it.
New Car Market
The number of new vehicles registered 
remained strong throughout the year with 
FY17 ending with both a record month and  
a record quarter for new registrations. This 
was due in no small part to the VED tax 
changes effect on registrations from 1 April 
2017 onwards which is likely to have pulled 
forward some volume into the first calendar 
quarter of 2017.
One persistent theme through the year has 
been the growing disparity between private 
demand and fleet demand, with the latter 
growing with substantially more vigour. For 
Motorpoint this represents an opportunity  
in the near term, as a significant proportion 
of our supply is sourced from the fleet 
operators and so is likely to form a broad 
and competitive supply environment for us 
over the coming six to 12 months. 
Alongside the growing volumes there has 
been some shift in manufacturer and model 
preferences in the new registrations data.  
In particular there has been impressive 
expansion within the premium market, not 
least from BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, 
Jaguar and Land Rover. Motorpoint’s sales 
and stock mix broadly represents the shape 
of the new car market, albeit with a modest 
delay, so we have seen a gradual movement 
in our sales mix along similar lines.
Used Car Market
Following closely on the trends of the new 
car market, used volumes in 2016 set new 
record highs. The calendar year saw a year 
on year growth in excess of 7%, with the 
final quarter being the strongest on record. 
This encouraging strength has continued 
into the first quarter of calendar year 2017, 
which has seen volumes up again on the 
same period in 2016.
Brexit
The UK voted to leave the EU on 23 June 
2016, six weeks after the IPO of Motorpoint 
Group Plc. Because of the uncertainty 
around the result of the EU referendum, 
management reduced prices in late June 
to protect the Group's good level of stock 
turn, and reduced stockholding levels.  
Accordingly, the volume and margin 
performance in the first half was behind 
management expectations.
Whilst the footfall levels in the period 
around the vote and for a few months 
afterwards were subdued, this has 
not continued as a sustained change in 
customer behaviour in the second half of 
the year. Equally, whilst Sterling remains 
well below the levels seen in early June, 
we have not seen any material changes in 
manufacturer pricing or behaviour to lead us 
to believe that the referendum’s result will 
necessitate a change in our operating model.
The uncertainty around future implications 
of Brexit could lead to some volatility in 
consumer confidence, which could impact 
on footfall levels.
Digital
Online retail sales across the UK continue to 
grow at double-digit rates, representing an 
ever-increasing proportion of total sales, 
and are now estimated to constitute over 
15%. Motorpoint has seen the effects of this 
developing customer preference, with the 
volume of vehicles sold through the Group's 
website increasing to record levels. 
Customers are increasingly comfortable to 
commit to a purchase without having first 
inspected the car, but rather trusting the 
brand and transacting with the dedicated 
contact centre.
We have seen a migration of research 
journeys also move to online channels, with 
customers spending time preparing and 
comparing, and consequently visiting fewer 
dealerships. As such we continue to allocate 
a growing proportion of our marketing 
spend to digital channels, such as paid 
search and the digital classified providers.
Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 13 OUR STRATEGY
New Sites and Growth Opportunity
During the year we continued to deliver on 
our strategy to open at least one new site 
per year, with a medium term target of at 
least 20 sites in the UK. Two new sites 
opened successfully in the year and are 
trading in line with our new site roll-out 
model. The Sheffield site was secured  
and prepared in the year, and launched 
successfully post year end.
Product Offer
Our focus continues to be 100% on nearly-
new cars; we have expanded into new sites, 
and have seen a substantial increase in 
sales via our digital channel. Following 
award of full FCA permissions for regulated 
insurance products we have launched a 
new extended warranty product which is 
fully underwritten by a specialist insurer.  
We have also launched our partnership  
with NextGear, a funding platform for  
our Auction4Cars.com customers.
Brand and Reputation
Through a relentless focus on customer 
satisfaction, we have driven our key 
reporting metric to new record levels, with 
an NPS of 77%, and seen the level of loyal 
customers coming back to us jump to 
represent 25% of our total sales volume.
Breadth of Stock
We have grown our stock levels to new 
highs, reflecting our expanded site footprint 
and increased customer demand. Stock 
available on the website averaged 6,916 
units over the final quarter of the year. We 
continued to work with our long-standing 
and trusted suppliers, as well as expanding 
relationships into new supply channels to 
ensure that we maintained a broad and 
relevant mix.
Operational Control
Our site operations continued to evolve to 
make our processes faster for customers 
and simpler for our teams. We launched  
our “collections hub”, which allows our 
customer services team to deliver a 
seamless, paper-free handover experience 
to customers. 
Team
Our proven talent programmes continue 
to succeed, with ongoing training and 
support growing our next generation  
of Senior Managers.
We have achieved a Sunday Times  
Top 100 Employer recognition for the  
third consecutive year.
Financing
We have lowered our customer finance rate 
to a competitive 12.9%, the same rate across 
both PCP and hire purchase. We have also 
taken the logical step to state each car’s 
monthly finance cost on the windscreen, 
granting customers all the information they 
need to make a purchase decision without 
the pressure of feeling obligated to ask  
a salesperson.
Our Strategy and How This Looks
The retail sites contain showrooms, light 
vehicle preparation, storage and valet 
services, as well as administrative functions 
as appropriate. All sites offer café facilities. 
Locations are generally positioned for ease 
of access and are optimally located within 
a 30 minute drive of an appropriate 
population demographic.
The Group operates a retail website  
(www.motorpoint.co.uk) which is developed 
and maintained by a dedicated in-house IT 
function. The website is a key cornerstone 
of the operations, and is vital to driving 
footfall to the retail sites. 
The website is supported by a dedicated 
national contact centre which handles email, 
phone and web chat enquiries; with sales 
staff who reserve vehicles for collection  
at a convenient retail site, arrange for 
transportation if required, value any 
part-exchange vehicle and offer finance  
and other related products.
For part-exchanges falling outside of the 
Group’s nearly-new criteria, Motorpoint 
operates Auction4Cars.com, a business 
to business online auction platform.
Management is focused on generating 
efficient returns for the business and 
the diligent and efficient employment of 
capital resources. Through a cost-effective 
opening and operating programme and a 
relentless drive on stock turn, management 
has been able to generate strong, recurring 
levels of return on capital employed.

Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 15 FINANCIAL REVIEW
Our unique proposition,  
combined with our unabated  
focus on team and customers,  
have allowed us to deliver  
double-digit sales growth.
JAMES GILMOUR
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
Overview
I am pleased to present our maiden full year 
Financial Review for Motorpoint Group Plc 
which was incorporated in April 2016 ahead 
of the Group’s admission to trading on the 
London Stock Exchange in May 2016. 
Despite a challenging H1, the Group 
achieved double-digit revenue and gross 
profit growth for the year. We have laid 
significant foundations for medium term 
growth through the opening of our 10th  
and 11th sites during the year and 
completing the substantial preparation  
work for our 12th site, in Sheffield, which 
opened on 28 April 2017. 
We remain cautiously optimistic about  
the FY18 trading conditions and expect  
the Group to perform in line with  
market expectations.
Dividend
In June 2017 the Board of Motorpoint Group 
Plc proposed a final dividend of 2.90 pence 
per share in respect of FY17. This will be 
tabled for approval at the forthcoming AGM 
on 26 July 2017, with an anticipated payment 
date during September 2017.

Capital Structure and Basis of Preparation
Motorpoint Group Plc was incorporated on 
12 April 2016, and on 9 May 2016 the 
Company obtained control of the entire 
share capital of Motorpoint Limited via a 
share for share exchange. To ensure that 
the most appropriate view of the Group’s 
results is presented, the current year and 
comparative information disclosed in this 
Financial Review reflects the continuation 
of the pre-existing group headed by 
Motorpoint Limited and has been prepared 
applying the principle of predecessor 
accounting. Further information around the 
basis of preparation is included in note 2a  
to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
and an explanation of the capital structure  
of the Group both pre and post IPO is 
included in note 26 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
Revenue and Gross Margin
Revenue for the year increased by 12.7%  
to £822.0m with revenue from sale of  
motor vehicles growing by 12.4% to £789.0m 
(FY16: £702.0m) and revenue from motor 
related services and commissions growing 
by 21.3% to £33.0m (FY16: £27.2m). 
Gross profit for the year increased by  
11.7% to £62.2m, so the gross margin  
growth narrowly trailed revenue growth.  
The difference substantially reflects 
management’s decision in H1 to take a  
more cautious view on both stock holding 
and stock pricing over the summer months, 
to reduce the level of asset risk in the face  
of anticipated low consumer confidence 
following the EU referendum result. The 
Group’s “metal margin” recovered to 
normalised levels in H2.
To support the maiden Motorpoint Group 
Plc Annual Report, four year trends for both 
revenue and gross profit are shown below, 
all reported under IFRS.
Adjusted Operating Profit
Adjusted operating profit is reported 
excluding costs related to the Motorpoint 
Group Plc IPO but including £0.4m of 
charges incurred in association with Share 
Based Compensation plans which have 
been put in place following IPO.
Adjusted operating profit for the year 
decreased by 9.1% to £16.9m (FY16: £18.6m). 
This was most significantly as a result of the 
increased adjusted operating expenses, 
which rose from £37.1m to £45.3m. 
The adjusted operating costs were most 
substantially increased by the new site 
openings; a total of £5.2m (excluding 
marketing costs) which represents the net 
impact of increased operating expenses for 
Birtley, Castleford, Oldbury and Sheffield, 
the four sites that have opened since 
November 2015.
Marketing spend for the year increased  
by £1.0m, both to maintain support of the 
established sites, and to drive brand 
awareness in the new regions opened 
during the year.
We were also impacted in the year by the 
change in interchange fees pricing, which 
were implemented by Visa and removed the 
erstwhile capping of debit card acquisition 
fees. This led to additional costs of £0.4m 
being incurred during the year.
In addition to the £0.4m of Share Based 
Compensation charges as set out in more 
detail below, the Head Office costs grew as 
we implemented the strong governance 
structure and corresponding senior 
expertise appropriate for our listed status.
The Group’s depreciation charge remained 
relatively stable during the year; the 
business model is such that all retail sites 
are leased, so the growing site estate 
footprint has not led to a significant increase 
in depreciation.

Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 17 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Share Based Compensation
The Share Based Compensation schemes 
are included in arriving at adjusted operating 
profit. There are three schemes which have 
been launched in the year which are the 
Share Incentive Plan (SIP), Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) and Save As You Earn 
(SAYE) scheme.
The SIP constituted an award of £1,000  
for all employees with at least one year  
of continuous service as at the award 
announcement date, 24 May 2016. The SIP 
was made as recognition of our team who 
have been instrumental in building the 
Motorpoint business to be ready for IPO. 
These shares vest after a three year period 
dependent only on remaining in Motorpoint’s 
continued employment. There will be one 
further award made for those employees 
who were not part of the first award, but who 
joined the business on or before 4 October 
2016 and become eligible on providing one 
year of continuous service. This award will 
be made during FY18. 
The PSP is for Executive Directors and 
certain key Senior Managers. Awards 
made under the PSP are nil cost options. 
The extent to which such awards vest will 
depend on the Group’s performance over  
a three year period. It is the intention of  
the Board that a new award will be made 
during each future financial period, again  
for the Executive Directors and key  
Senior Management.
The SAYE scheme was launched by 
Motorpoint in December 2016, and it is 
anticipated that a further scheme will be 
launched in each future year, subject to 
Board approval. The scheme is open to all 
employees, inviting them to save directly 
from their salary for a three year period and 
with the option to purchase shares at a 
discounted price at the end of the three year 
period or take their savings back in a lump 
sum. We were delighted that 49% of our 
employees chose to join the scheme and 
invest personally in Motorpoint.
Further information on Share Based 
Compensation schemes is included  
in note 29 to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements. 
Exceptional Items
The exceptional costs recognised in  
FY17 of £4.0m were solely in relation to  
the Motorpoint Group Plc IPO. The costs 
incurred relate to corporate restructuring, 
legal and professional costs, broker and 
accounting services. 
Operating Profit
The reconciliation from Adjusted Operating 
Profit to Operating Profit is shown below; 
the only reconciling item is the exceptional 
costs during both years.
Net Finance Cost
The net finance cost of £1.2m represents 
the Group’s interest costs, net of interest 
income. The interest income of £0.1m in the 
year and £0.5m in the prior year represents 
interest paid by related parties on amounts 
owed. These balances were settled on IPO 
and so the interest income will not recur.
During the year and ahead of the IPO the 
Group renegotiated its stocking finance 
facility with Black Horse Limited and 
arranged a new £20m credit facility with 
Santander UK Plc.
The stocking finance facility is a £65m 
facility secured against the vehicle against 
which the stocking finance facility is drawn 
down. £1m of cost has been incurred during 
the year under this facility. The Black Horse 
agreement provided a £55m facility at the 
point of IPO and has been increased by  
£5m on two occasions during the year as 
new sites opened. 
The £20m facility with Santander UK Plc  
is split between £6m available as an 
overdraft and £14m available as a revolving 
credit facility. At 31 March 2017 there were 
no drawings under the facility. The facility 
has been partly drawn at points during  
the year and the interest expense of  
£0.1m represents the cost involved in  
this. The facility is available for a fixed term  
of five years from commencement, which  
was 10 May 2016.
The Group was previously incurring interest 
on an amount owed to HMRC for the 
repayment of a legacy EBT scheme. The 
amount outstanding was settled in full 
during the year and there will be no future 
interest expense for this scheme.
Taxation
The tax charge in the period represents the 
amounts assessable for UK corporation tax 
in the year net of prior year adjustments and 
deferred tax credits.
Exceptional items in relation to the IPO of 
Motorpoint Group Plc have been prudently 
treated as non-deductible for tax purposes. 
A deferred tax asset arose on the sale and 
leaseback of the Oldbury site as proceeds 
in excess of the fair value of the assets sold 
are deferred for accounting purposes but 
are taxed during the year they arose.

1   Number of shares in issue for 2016 has been based on the number of shares in issue during 2017. This is only  
for comparative purposes and is not the actual number of shares. Please refer to note 26 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements for share capital details.
The dilutive impact of shares issued in 
relation to Motorpoint shares in issue is 
shown in note 11 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements but given the three 
year vesting period and immaterial nature  
of these the Board believes the adjusted 
Basic Earnings per Share to be the most 
appropriate basis.
Financial Position
The financial position of the Group remains 
strong with the post IPO balance sheet 
reflecting the settlement of all but one 
related party balance. The only amount 
outstanding to related parties which is not in 
the ordinary course of business is a £0.4m 
liability, payment of which is expected to be 
made within FY18.
Property, plant and equipment in both years 
represent leasehold improvements, office 
equipment and fixtures and fittings. In the 
current year this category also includes  
£1.7m of land which was acquired during  
the year in Peterborough near to the  
existing retail site to support storage  
and preparation activities. 
There has been a significant increase in the 
level of inventory held at the end of March 
2017 to £98.4m (FY16: £74.9m) which reflects 
the increased size of the business and 
thereby a deeper stock holding to support 
increased customer demand. Inventory 
provisions total £0.8m (FY16: £0.7m) and 
are calculated on a basis consistent 
with prior years.
Stocking finance facilities drawn at 31 March 
2017 total £64.9m (2016: £51.0m), near full 
utilisation of the £65.0m (2016: £55.0m) 
facility that we have available. 
Trade receivable represents amounts 
due in the short term from vehicle 
finance providers.
Prepayments comprise amounts paid out  
by the business which have future benefits, 
predominantly rent and rates associated 
with retail premises but also include 
deferred costs in relation to extended 
guarantee products.
Accrued income relates to rebates and 
commissions from vehicle suppliers and 
finance houses.
Trade creditors and accruals represent 
amounts owed to suppliers for vehicles  
and goods and services, amounts drawn 
under the stocking finance facility, as well  
as any amounts owed to employees for 
commissions and bonuses. The increase 
from the prior year represents the increased 
size of the business as well as the £1.8m  
of deferred sale proceeds arising from the 
Oldbury sale and leaseback which will be 
released over the period of the lease.
Deferred extended guarantees, both  
less than and over one year, relate to the 
extended guarantee products which were 
sold prior to Motorpoint receiving FCA 
regulated status in December 2016. These 
revenues are recognised over the period to 
which the guarantee relates, together with 
any associated direct costs, with such costs 
being prepaid. From 1 December 2016, 
Motorpoint ceased sale of the extended 
guarantee product as principal, replaced  
by the sale of a new extended warranty 
product which is fully underwritten with  
a third party insurer, with Motorpoint now 
acting as sales agent. As such any product 
net income is commission and so 
recognised at the point of sale.
The recognition of the deferred revenue 
relating to the historical guarantee product, 
sold up to 30 November 2016, will be 
released substantially over the next  
three years.
Cash and cash equivalents of £7.3m  
(FY16: £11.6m) relate to amounts held on 
deposit account.

Cash Flow and Working Capital
Cash flow from operations represents the 
cash generated from operations prior to 
exceptional items and adjusting for non-
cash transactions such as Share Based 
Compensation charges. The slight decrease 
in the year corresponds to the operating 
profit performance.
The net working capital outflow in the year 
represents an increase in inventory paid 
from cash reserves. This £9.6m increase 
in cash funded inventory has been partly 
offset by an increase in the level of stock 
finance, trade creditors and accruals which 
has increased in line with the size of 
the business. 
Payments in respect of exceptional items 
represent the cash outflow of expenditure  
in relation to both the Motorpoint IPO and 
the settlement of the legacy EBT scheme  
as outlined above.
Purchases of property, plant and equipment 
include the purchase of the Oldbury site for 
consideration of £3.9m and the purchase 
of land at Peterborough for £1.7m. The 
remaining expenditure in the year relates 
to acquisition of leasehold improvements, 
office equipment and fixtures and fittings.
The sale of the Oldbury site as part of a sale 
and leaseback agreement generated £5.8m 
of cash in the year. The lease period agreed 
as a result of the transactions is for a period 
of 15 years with an option to extend for a 
further 10 years. 
Cash outflows for pre IPO transactions and 
dividends totalled £5.2m which were all 
concluded prior to the listing of Motorpoint 
Group Plc.
Cash outflows for post IPO dividends were 
the interim dividend announced of 1.33 
pence per share, approved and paid during 
the year.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Approach to Risk Management
The Board is accountable for maintaining  
a policy of continuous identification and 
review of the principal risks facing the 
Company which could threaten its future 
performance or business model. On behalf 
of the Board, the Audit Committee reviews 
the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management processes.
The Compliance Committee is delegated 
responsibility, from the Audit Committee,  
for formally identifying and assessing these 
risks annually, measuring them against a 
defined set of criteria, and considering the 
likelihood of occurrence and potential 
impact to the Group. The Compliance 
Committee is formed of two Executive 
Directors and the Company Secretary.
The most material risks (based on likelihood 
and impact as illustrated below) form our 
Group Risk Profile, which is reported to the 
Executive Board for review and challenge, 
ahead of final review and approval by the 
Board. These principal risks are then subject 
to Board discussion during the course of  
the year, as appropriate. To drive continuous 
improvement across the business, the 
Compliance Committee monitors the 
ongoing status of action plans against  
key risks quarterly.
Key Areas of Focus
This year the Board has placed significant 
focus on defining our risk appetite. At the 
highest level, this is an expression of the 
types and amount of risk we are willing  
to take or accept to achieve our strategic 
and operational objectives. It is a key 
consideration in decision-making across  
the Group and helps us define the mitigating 
activities required to manage our risks. 
During the year, the Directors also assessed 
the long term viability of the Company in the 
context of its principal risks. In accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
our Viability Statement is included on  
page 24 and is designed to strengthen 
stewardship and to encourage Directors  
to focus on the longer term.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
On the following pages are details of our 
principal risks and uncertainties and the key 
mitigating activities in place to address them. 
It is recognised that the Group is exposed  
to risks wider than those listed. We disclose 
those we believe are likely to have the 
greatest impact on our business at this 
moment in time and which have been  
the subjects of debate at recent Board  
or Audit Committee meetings.
From time to time the Group has made 
changes to historical business and 
commercial practices where such activities 
did not meet, or may not have met, 
applicable laws or regulations (whether  
civil, criminal, regulatory or other) or the 
commercial and ethical values of the Group. 
Notwithstanding their discontinuation, 
certain aspects of these historical business 
and commercial practices could result in 
administrative, criminal, financial, regulatory 
or other action or proceedings and such 
actions or proceedings could have an 
adverse effect on the Group’s reputation, 
business, financial condition and  
operating results.
How the Board Manages Risk
The Board and each of its delegated 
Committees operate to a prescribed meeting 
agenda in order to ensure that all relevant 
risks are identified and addressed as 
appropriate. Key management information  
is reviewed in order to prescribe operating 
controls and performance monitoring against 
the Company’s strategy and business plans.
The Non-Executive Directors have 
particular responsibility for monitoring  
the financial and operating performance, 
to ensure that progress is being made 
towards our agreed goals. The Board’s 
responsibilities also include assessing the 
effectiveness of internal controls and the 
management of risk. 
The Board’s Review of Risk and Controls
During the year, the Board considered all 
strategic matters, received key performance 
information on operating, financial and 
compliance matters and reviewed the 
results of corresponding controls and  
risk management. We received from the 
Audit Committee and from the Compliance 
Committee timely information and reports 
on all relevant aspects of risk and 
corresponding controls.
We reviewed all our key Company policies 
and ensured that all that matters of internal 
control received adequate Board scrutiny 
and debate. At Board meetings, and 
informally via the Chairman, all Directors had 
the opportunity to raise matters of particular 
concern to them. There were no unresolved 
concerns in the year.
We concluded that appropriate controls are 
in place and functioning effectively. The 
Board considers that the Group’s systems 
provide information which is adequate to 
permit the identification of key risks to its 
business and the proper assessment and 
mitigation of those risks.
Based on the Audit Committee’s and the 
Compliance Committee’s work, the Board 
has performed a robust assessment, to 
ensure that (i) the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group’s business 
have been identified and assessed, taking 
into account any adaptations made to  
the Group’s business strategies; and  
(ii) appropriate mitigation is in place.

Strategic Report PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
RISK AND IMPACT MITIGATING CONTROLS
Competition
The UK vehicle market is highly competitive and customers have a 
broad choice of retailers, some of which offer comparable products. 
Over the last year the market has seen a period of consolidation 
and innovation, through which our competitors have progressed 
their propositions. 
Concurrently customer expectations and buying patterns are 
evolving, with the traditional research and purchase channels 
becoming ever more influenced by digital media, peer 
recommendations and convenience. 
Failing to stay ahead of the market, or failing to adapt to changing 
customer behaviours faster than the competition, could undermine 
our ability to meet our objectives.
 
We compete via our business model’s consistent focus on  
choice, value and service; each of these cornerstones is built  
into the business operation and reporting. For example, customer 
satisfaction ratings are used in the calculation of all bonuses or 
commissions across the business. 
We identify potential gaps in our proposition using both internal 
and external sources, for example by commissioning market 
research studies or mystery shopping best in class retailers.
Brand and reputation
As a function of being independent of manufacturer support, 
Motorpoint attracts new and repeat customers substantially 
through building a compelling perception of the Company’s  
brand and reputation. 
Failure to maintain these would rapidly result in a loss of  
customer confidence and impact levels of business. 
Unfavourable publicity concerning the Company or the industry  
in which it operates could also have an adverse impact.
 
We have continued to expand awareness and relevance 
of our brand to both new and existing customers, through 
investment in our website and via more personalised 
outbound communications. 
Customer satisfaction, measured using the NPS system, sits  
at the heart of our operations and is subject to regular scrutiny 
across all levels of the business. 
We closely monitor customer perceptions using both qualitative 
and quantitative feedback, and respond quickly where possible.
Availability and terms of customer finance
Vehicle sales volumes rely on our customers being able to  
access affordable credit lines. As such the Company is exposed  
to the risk of lending institutions reducing, terminating or materially 
altering the terms and conditions on which they are willing to offer 
consumer credit to the Company’s customers.
Commission income generated by the Company acting as a 
regulated credit broker could be impacted if either the number  
of such arrangements reduces, or the structure and amount of 
commissions earned is altered. 
 
The risk is spread by way of customer finance being offered 
through a panel of key relationship partners.
We constantly monitor the market and emerging trends, working  
in conjunction with our partners to keep our consumer credit offer 
relevant, competitive and viable.
Where possible we reinvest in the quality of the customer  
offer, preferring to build its appeal rather than maximise our 
commission rates.
Availability of supply
Given the absence of forward-purchase contracts with 
manufacturers or any other suppliers, there is a risk that future 
vehicle supply is insufficient to satisfy customer demand as the 
Company continues to grow.
 
We use a broad spread of supply channels, within each of which 
are long-standing relationships. As we grow we will continue to 
diversify this supply base to minimise reliance on any one source.
We employ an experienced buying team which is responsible for 
maintaining an efficient and effective supply chain.
We are able to flex our buying criteria within the scope of our 
retail proposition (age and mileage of vehicles) to access more 
supply if any one segment contracts.
Regulation
The Company has various FCA permissions to carry on a range  
of regulated insurance and consumer credit activities from which  
it derives income. There is a risk that increased regulation or 
restrictions on the sales process or nature of these products  
would restrict the income available to the Company. 
In addition, whilst the Directors believe that the Company conducts 
its business in accordance with all applicable regulations and will 
endeavour to continue to do so, there remains a risk that the 
regulator will find that the business has not complied fully with such 
regulations. In such circumstances, the impact to the business of 
any regulatory fines and other costs, reputational damage and/or 
loss of FCA authorisation could be material.
 
We have a number of policies and codes across the business 
outlining the mandatory requirements within the business.  
These are communicated to all staff via an employee handbook.
We have a Compliance Committee which conducts regular 
reviews of the key regulatory risk areas, allocating control 
environment improvement objectives to relevant owners.
We also operate a whistle blowing hotline which allows 
colleagues or suppliers to confidentially report any concerns  
or inappropriate behaviour within the business.
Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 23 RISK AND IMPACT MITIGATING CONTROLS
Economic conditions
The Company operates entirely in Great Britain and therefore its 
business is affected by overall economic conditions and the level  
of customer confidence and spending in the country, including 
changes in factors such as unemployment, exchange rates,  
inflation or deflation and the cost of motoring. 
Such factors can be significantly impacted by external factors  
such as the EU referendum.
 
We offer what we believe to be a compelling customer 
proposition, including a core element of Value. This allows 
customers to trade up (from older or higher mileage cars)  
or down (from new cars) as economic conditions fluctuate.
We maintain a low cost business model that allows us to maintain 
our selling prices as low as possible, and we always aim to be 
cheaper than the competition.
We have an extensive forecasting process that enables actions  
to be taken in the medium term in response to evolving 
economic conditions.
Credit, liquidity and financing
The Company uses a selection of finance facilities to fund its 
operations, including a stock financing facility, which is secured 
against its retail vehicle stocks.
A change in the pricing or a reduction in funding parameters and 
facility limits could significantly constrain the Group’s ability to trade 
or the Group could be required to dispose of assets at below their 
market value or at a substantial discount.
 
A treasury policy and set of processes are in place to govern  
and control cash flow activities, including the investment of  
surplus cash.
Forward-looking cash flow forecasts and covenant tests are 
prepared to ensure that sufficient liquidity and covenant 
headroom exists.
We maintain a close relationship with the stock finance facility 
provider, with a minimum period of commitment in place to 
manage the risk of a diminution of lending appetite.
IT systems and business continuity
The Group is reliant on key IT systems, and disruption to these 
would adversely impact business operations. 
Data protection failure may lead to a potential prosecution and 
reputational damage to the brand. 
 
All critical business systems have either third party maintenance 
contracts in place or dedicated internal resource.
We utilise the services of an expert third party IT company 
to ensure that any investments made in technology are fit 
for purpose.
We have a disaster recovery strategy including an approved 
Business Continuity Plan and an ongoing PCI compliance strategy.
Key management reliance
The Group is reliant on the high quality and ethos of the executive 
team as well as strong management and operational teams.
The loss of one or more of these leaders could predicate poor 
implementation of the strategy or loss of operational oversight.
This risk also encompasses the risk of management override  
of controls.
 
The key Senior and Operational Management are appropriately 
incentivised through bonus and share arrangements such that 
talent is retained.
The composition and succession of the executive team is kept 
under constant review to ensure that it is appropriate to delivery 
of the Group’s plans.
Significant decisions for the business are made by the Plc  
Board, or via approved delegation by the Executive Board, with 
segregation of duties enforced on key business processes, such 
as the payables process.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED
VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board has 
assessed the prospects of the Group over 
a period in excess of the 12 months 
required by the ‘Going Concern’ provision, 
selecting instead a period to the end of 
FY21 which takes into account the Group’s 
current position and the potential impact 
of the principal risks and uncertainties as 
set out on pages 23 and 24. 
In making their assessment the Directors 
considered the Group’s current balance 
sheet, its strong track record of 
generating operational cash flows,  
and stress testing of the key trading 
assumptions within the Group’s plan.
Based on this assessment, the Board 
confirms it has a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the period to 31 March 2021.
The Board has determined that the period 
constitutes an appropriate period over 
which to provide its Viability Statement. 
This is the period detailed in our Strategic 
Plan which we approve each year as part 
of the strategic review. Whilst the Board 
has no reason to believe the Group will 
not be viable over a longer period, given 
the inherent uncertainty involved we 
believe this presents users of the Annual 
Report with a reasonable degree of 
confidence while still providing a medium 
term perspective.

People development
Our CEO explains our passionate focus on 
developing our team on page 11. 
Our Talent Management and Leadership 
programmes focus on self awareness and 
emotional intelligence and are set up to:
• develop people ready to take up 
Management and Senior Management 
roles in the future;
• have sufficient trained and talented 
individuals ready to manage new sites;
• provide career paths to motivate and 
develop capable, talented individuals 
who aspire to management roles; and
• retain talent where possible within 
Motorpoint.
We are delighted to offer training 
programmes bespoke to Motorpoint, 
developed specifically for non-management 
and junior management roles. Courses at all 
levels of the business are aimed at helping 
employees to reach their full potential with 
results at home as well as in the workplace.
Our training falls within four main areas:
• Personal Development
• Work Skills
• Talent and Career Development
• Management Development
Six members of our Operational Board have 
been promoted from within, as have eight of 
our twelve General Managers.
A testament to our commitment to growing 
our own talent is the middle management 
population, eight of whom have been with 
us since we opened in 1998 and 47 of whom 
have been internally promoted.
Employee engagement
To recognise the work of our teams in 
building Motorpoint to the size and success 
appropriate for IPO, we announced a free 
share award of £1,000 to employees in  
May 2016. The award was granted to all 
employees who had been with the business 
for at least one year in May – a second and 
final award will be made in FY18 to include 
those remaining eligible employees who 
joined the business before 4 October 2016.
In December 2016 we launched our first 
SAYE Scheme and are encouraged that 
nearly half of the team elected to join.
We are proud that as at 31 March 2017  
over 70% of the Motorpoint team has 
shares or options in the Company and is 
thereby aligned to the long term interests  
of the Company.
More detail on our share schemes is set out

Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 25 Treating Customers Fairly
The Directors are committed to ensuring 
that the FCA principle of treating customers 
fairly (TCF) is applied in all areas of our 
day-to-day business activities. TCF is a  
core foundation of delivering our retail 
proposition of Choice, Value and Service, 
and is thereby fundamental to delivering 
long term business value. To this end the 
Board has adopted in the year a “Treating 
Customers Fairly and Vulnerable 
Customers” policy.
Through concerted focus, TCF has become 
an integral part of the culture and is subject 
to frequent and rigorous scrutiny within all 
forums that consider, inter alia, customer-
facing processes, staff remuneration, and 
product selection. The Board is committed 
to delivering the best possible service to 
our customers, with objectives across 
Motorpoint reflecting this aim.
In particular, the following business areas  
are under constant review in light of changes 
to Motorpoint’s business model, customer 
requirements or the regulatory environment:
• Marketing practices, including 
promotional material
• Sales processes, whether on-site,  
via the contact centre or digital
• Customer communications
• Record keeping 
• Complaints handling
A review and reporting environment has 
been developed to ensure that Motorpoint’s 
high expectations are met, and that all 
systems, people and processes are 
supported to achieve our TCF objectives, 
including via:
• qualitative quality controls, such as post 
sale customer interviews and mystery 
shoppers;
• quantitative quality controls, such as 
cancellation rates for products within 
their cooling-off period; and
• ongoing training and support for our 
team, including personalised and 
scheduled refresher training.
Other
We are committed to the highest levels of 
health and safety for our team and for others 
working on behalf of Motorpoint. To that  
end we use a specialist Health & Safety 
Management System to ensure the 
appropriate levels of training, reporting and 
support. We carry out health and safety risk 
assessments regularly, with the results 
reported to both the Compliance Committee 
and the Board.
We have taken steps to address the risks of 
modern slavery and human trafficking in 
response to the recently introduced Modern 
Slavery Act 2015, including by debating and 
adopting a policy, raising awareness of the 
risks across the business, and working with 
suppliers to protect workers from abuse  
or exploitation.
We operate a confidential whistle blower 
hotline which is available for all of our  
team and our suppliers, to give them the 
opportunity to raise any issues about 
dishonesty or malpractice within Motorpoint, 
the results from which are independently 
collated and submitted to the Compliance 
Committee. We also have an Anti-Corruption 
and Anti-Bribery policy in place which is 
reviewed and recommunicated annually. 
This Strategic Report is set out on pages  
1 to 26 and is approved by the Board of 
Directors and signed on its behalf.

Strategic Report CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO GOVERNANCE
We strive to be a good  
investment, a great employer  
and a valued contributor to our 
communities, year after year. 
MARK MORRIS
NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN
The Board recognises the importance  
of, and is committed to, high standards  
of corporate governance and all Directors 
are fully aware of their duties and 
responsibilities under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules and the Listing Rules. 
I am pleased to confirm that Motorpoint 
complies with the September 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code), 
being the Code applicable for the relevant 
period. The Code is available on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) website  
(www.frc.org.uk). On Admission, Motorpoint 
was compliant with all relevant provisions  
of the Code except the appointment of  
a Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director (SID). As noted in the Prospectus 
this action was deferred until December 
2016 to assess the performance of the  
new Non-Executive Directors. Ahead of this 
deadline in October 2016 Mary McNamara 
was elected as SID by the Board. 
Governance Framework 
In preparation for Admission, we carried  
out a review of the existing governance 
structure in conjunction with our external 
advisers, in order to identify any measures 
that would need to be implemented prior  
to Admission. The review also enabled the 
Directors to provide the confirmation that 
was required on Admission that Motorpoint 
has established procedures in place which 
provide a reasonable basis for the Board  
to make proper judgements on an ongoing 
basis as to the financial position and 
prospects of the Group. This Corporate 
Governance Report discusses the robust 
framework for controlling and managing  
the Group in further detail. 
Directors 
All of our Directors were appointed on or 
around flotation and they are listed along 
with their biographies on pages 28 and 29 
of this Report. 
Annual General Meeting 
This Annual Report remains the principal 
means of reporting to our shareholders  
on the Board’s governance policies and 
therefore I welcome this opportunity to set 
out how the main and supporting principles 
of good corporate governance, as set out  
in the Code, the FRC Listing Rules and 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules, have 
been applied in practice. 
I would like to encourage our shareholders 
to attend our AGM which will be held on 
Wednesday 26 July 2017 at 10.00 am at  
200 Aldersgate, London EC1A 4HD. This  
is a good opportunity for you to meet the 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors,  
and notice of the AGM will be sent 
separately to shareholders along with 
this Report.

Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 29 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Leadership
The role of the Board
The Board has regular scheduled meetings 
most months throughout the year, and 
attendance is tabled in the next column. 
Mark Morris, who was deemed independent 
at the time of appointment, chairs the 
meeting and promotes a culture of 
openness and debate, including inviting  
the Executive Directors and the NEDs to 
debate Motorpoint’s strategic matters which 
are new to the NEDs in their first term with 
the business. Mark sets the agendas for 
meetings in conjunction with the CEO, CFO 
and Company Secretary and ensures that 
Board papers are accurate, informative and 
distributed in good time for meetings.
The Board has a written statement  
of matters which are reserved for its 
decision, which was adopted on flotation. 
This includes:
• Strategy and management 
• Structure and capital
• Financial reporting controls
• Internal controls
• Contracts
• Communication
• Board membership and other 
appointments
• Remuneration
• Delegation of authority
• Corporate governance matters
• Policies
The Board regularly considers Motorpoint’s 
need for a ready supply of strong General 
Managers to support its strategy for growth 
and opening new sites. This includes 
keeping the current management teams  
on sites motivated and incentivised. 
The NEDs have constructively challenged 
and helped develop proposal strategies 
when considering locations for new site  
openings and decisions surrounding the 
General Managers, among other matters.
The Chairman’s primary role is to lead the 
Board and to ensure that it is effective in all 
aspects of its role. The CEO’s primary role  
is to provide the overall management and 
leadership of the Company and to formulate/
propose the Company’s strategy to the 
Board. It is the responsibility of both to 
uphold and promote high standards of 
integrity and probity within the Group. 
In order to ensure the success of the 
Company, it is essential that the Chairman 
and CEO have a close relationship, based 
upon trust, with the Chairman providing 
support and advice while respecting the 
importance of the CEO’s executive 
responsibilities. It is particularly important 
that both promote effective relationships 
and open communication, both inside  
and outside the Boardroom, between 
Non-Executive and Executive Directors.
The roles of Chairman and CEO are clearly 
defined with the division of responsibility 
having been set out in writing and approved 
by the Board on 12 May 2016.

and processes. 
GORDON HURST
AUDIT COMMITTEE CHAIR
Audit Committee Chair’s Statement
The Board has overall responsibility for 
managing the risks facing the business  
to protect as far as possible the long term 
success of Motorpoint. The Audit Committee 
(the Committee) plays a crucial role in 
assisting the Board to discharge that duty  
by monitoring, reviewing and challenging 
the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of 
control and processes concerning ﬁnancial 
reporting; risk management and business 
continuity; and business assurance around 
areas such as fraud, bribery and corruption 
detection, and whistle blowing. The 
Committee also monitors and reviews the 
appointment of the Company’s external 
auditors, including with regard to their 
independence and effectiveness, audit  
fees and the provision of non-audit services.
Audit Committee Composition
The Committee comprises three 
independent NEDs: Gordon Hurst 
(Committee Chair), Mary McNamara and 
Steve Weller. The table on page 30 sets  
out each member’s attendance record  
at Committee meetings during the

the Committee, Gordon Hurst, has recent 
and relevant ﬁnancial experience. He is  
a Chartered Accountant and has held 
executive roles in ﬁnancial positions in  
other companies. The Committee’s other 
members have all played an active role  
in Committee meetings held throughout  
the year.

external advisers to assist it in meeting its 
responsibilities: PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP (PwC) act as external auditors. The 
Company also receives advice as required 
from PwC, Deloitte and Pinsent Masons LLP 
on tax and legal issues relating to  
corporate matters.

Governance Audit Committee Responsibilities
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are:
• monitoring the integrity of the Company’s 
ﬁnancial statements in relation to the 
Company’s ﬁnancial performance;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the 
external audit process;
• assessing the potential requirement to 
build an internal audit function; and
• reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s ﬁnancial and internal controls, 
including the process for the evaluation, 
assessment and management of risk.
The Committee met two times for scheduled 
meetings during the year and once since 
the year end. Its activities included:
• reviewing and approving the Annual 
Report and Accounts to 31 March  
2017 and half year results to  
30 September 2016;
• considering reports from the external 
auditors and identifying any accounting 
or judgemental issues requiring  
its attention;

relationship with the external auditors, 
including an assessment of their 
independence and a review of the policy

requirement to build an internal

of Reference; and
• agreeing an appropriate period for  
a Viability Statement.
Financial Reporting
The Board has discussed areas of risk with 
the external auditors and agree for the 
following areas of heightened risk to be 
reviewed and assessed in the audit of the 
Company’s performance in the ﬁnancial year 
to 31 March 2017:
• Share option schemes: due to the 
complexity of IFRS 2 “Share-based 
Payment”, and the introduction of  
a number of new schemes to Motorpoint 
employees and additional grants under 
the Long Term Incentive Plan in the year, 
there is a heightened risk of error from 
incorrect accounting treatment;
• Exceptional items: due to the complexity 
of the IPO process and its associated 
costs, there is a risk that the exceptional 
items identified as relating to the process 
are not complete or valid.
• Acquisition of Oldbury site: due to  
the accounting judgements required  
in assessing the appropriate accounting 
treatments, there was a heightened risk  
of incorrectly recording the transaction.
During the year the Committee reviewed 
these judgements, which are described 
further in the relevant accounting policies 
and detailed notes to the ﬁnancial statements.
The external auditors reported to the 
Committee any misstatements that they  
had found in the course of their work and  
no material adjustments were required.
After reviewing the presentations and 
reports from management and consulting 
where necessary with the external auditors, 
the Committee was satisﬁed that the 
ﬁnancial statements appropriately 
addressed the critical judgements and  
key estimates in respect of both the 
amounts reported and disclosures.
External Audit
The Committee oversees the Group’s 
relationship with the external auditors.  
In line with its Terms of Reference, the  
Committee undertakes a thorough 
assessment of the quality, effectiveness, 
value and independence of the audit 
provided by PwC each year, seeking the 
views of the Board, together with those of 
relevant members of the Executive Board.
The Board is satisﬁed that the Company has 
adequate policies and safeguards in place 
to ensure that PwC maintain their objectivity 
and independence. The external auditors 
report to the Committee annually on their 
independence from the Company.
To fulﬁl its responsibilities in respect of the 
independence and effectiveness of the 
external auditors, the Committee reviewed:
• the terms, areas of responsibility,  
duties and scope of work of the  
external auditors as set out in the 
engagement letter;
• the audit work plan for the Group;
• the detailed ﬁndings of the audit, 
including a discussion of any major  
issues that arose during the audit;
• conﬁrmation from PwC of their 
independence and objectivity; and
• the audit fee and the extent of non-audit 
services provided during the year.
The external auditors are appointed by 
Shareholders to provide an opinion on  
the ﬁnancial statements and certain other 
disclosures prepared by the Directors. PwC 
acted as the external auditors to Motorpoint 
throughout the year.
The Board has a formal policy on the 
Company’s relationship with PwC in respect 
of non-audit work. Proposals for all non-
audit services above £50,000 must be 
approved by the Committee before any 
such work is carried out, and PwC may  
only provide such services if their advice 
does not conﬂict with their statutory 
responsibilities and ethical guidance.
Following the most recent review, the  
Committee recommended the 
reappointment of PwC as auditors of  
the Company, and PwC expressed their 
willingness to continue in ofﬁce. A resolution 
to reappoint PwC and a resolution to enable 
the Directors to determine their remuneration 
will be proposed at the 2017 AGM.
Review of Anti-bribery Controls 
and Whistle Blowing
The Committee reviewed the Company’s 
anti-bribery processes and controls and 
evaluated and approved these and the 
Company’s bribery risk assessment. On its 
recommendation, the Board readopted the 
Company’s anti-bribery policy statements 
and associated controls. The Committee 
considered reports on known instances of 
alleged wrongdoing and matters reported 
on the Company’s conﬁdential reporting  
line and their investigation, reviewed the 
adequacy of whistle blowing procedures  
and commissioned follow-up action and 
improvements in risk related controls.
Our Priorities for the Year Ahead
During FY18, the Committee will continue  
to focus on the integrity of the ﬁnancial 
controls, risk management systems, 
particularly through the work of the 
Compliance Committee, and the robustness 
of the Company’s IT security arrangements 
to ensure that they reﬂect the changing risks 
of our high growth business.

The Remuneration Committee  
has worked to ensure that,  
during this first challenging year, 
remuneration has appropriately 
reflected business performance. 
The policy supports future  
growth and profitability  
and aligns executive and

MARY MCNAMARA
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIR
I am pleased to present the Company’s  
first Directors’ Remuneration Report for  
the financial year ending 31 March 2017. 
This report is split into two sections: 
• The Directors’ Remuneration Policy, 
which describes the remuneration policy 
that has been applied to the Executive 
Directors and NEDs of the Company from 
Admission. As this is our first financial 
year as a listed company, the policy will 
be put to a binding shareholder vote at 
the 2017 AGM. 
• The Annual Report on Remuneration, 
which sets out in detail how the 
remuneration policy has been applied in 
the year to 31 March 2017, as well as how 
it will be applied in the forthcoming year. 
This section of the report, as well as this 
introductory letter, will be subject to an 
advisory shareholder vote at the 
2017 AGM. 
Remuneration and How it Supports our 
Business Strategy
The Remuneration Committee (the 
Committee) is responsible for setting and 
applying a remuneration policy which 
serves to provide fair and appropriate levels 
of remuneration to the Senior Management. 
The goals of the policy are to ensure the 
retention of key employees; provide 
appropriate reward for strong performance 
and quality leadership; and to allow the 
Company to attract high quality candidates 
where required. The Committee believes 
that the current policy is appropriate, provides 
alignment with the Company’s shareholders, 
and focuses the Executive Directors on the 
delivery of strong financial performance. 
A sizeable portion of each Executive 
Director’s total package is performance 
based, with performance measures linked 
to our key strategic objectives of delivering 
profitable earnings growth, together with 
high levels of customer satisfaction and 
employee engagement. Furthermore, the 
award of share based long term incentives, 
in tandem with the share ownership 
guidelines, serve to directly align the 
interests of our Directors with those of  
our shareholders.

100% of salary.
Remuneration in FY17
Base salaries were set on Admission and will be reviewed annually, normally effective from 1 July of each year. 
Pension and other benefits were provided in line with the remuneration policy. 
Annual bonuses for 2016/17 were based on adjusted operating profit targets, customer satisfaction (Net Promoter Scores and Feefo 
ratings) and employee engagement (measured through participation in The Sunday Times 100 Best Companies to Work For survey).  
Notwithstanding good performance under the customer and employee engagement measures, since adjusted operating profit 
performance did not meet the threshold level of performance required, no bonuses were awarded for performance in the year.  
The first award under the PSP was granted in June 2016, and will be eligible to vest in June 2019, subject to a minimum of 12% p.a.  
EPS growth over the three financial years to 31 March 2019. 
The table below provides a summary of total remuneration for the Executive Directors from 9 May 2016 to the year end.

Mark Carpenter £224 £16 £22 – – £262
James Gilmour £161 £19 £16 – – £196
David Shelton £183 £41 £18 – – £242
Application of the Policy for FY18
The remuneration policy was developed in preparation for the Company’s IPO in May 2016, in line with existing remuneration 
arrangements, market best practice and investor guidelines for the listed-company market. No major changes are proposed for the 
application of the policy in FY18. 
No salary increases are proposed for FY18. However, the Executive Directors’ salaries were deliberately set on IPO at a discount  
to the prevailing market rate for comparable roles in companies of similar size and complexity to Motorpoint. The remuneration policy 
therefore allows us the flexibility to provide larger increases in future years, to bring executive pay closer to market level, should the 
Committee feel that it is appropriate to do so, and supportive of the wider Company strategy, at that point. 
No changes are proposed to the annual bonus and performance share award opportunity. The measures remain linked to the delivery  
of strong financial performance targets, with customer and employee engagement measures also targeted under the annual bonus plan.
The Committee wishes to maintain an open and transparent dialogue with Shareholders, and we will seek to consult with them  
in relation to any major changes to the policy or its implementation in future years. I welcome any comments or questions you may have 
with regards to any part of this report. 
I believe that the remuneration structures in place are appropriate and relevant for the Company, and I hope that you will support the 
relevant remuneration resolutions at our upcoming AGM.

Motorpoint Group Plc. The report is subject 
to approval by shareholders at our 
forthcoming AGM on 26 July 2017 and will 
be effective from that date. The policy is 
consistent with that set out in the Company’s 
Prospectus issued at IPO.
Setting the Remuneration Policy
The Committee sets the remuneration 
policy for Executive Directors and other 
Senior Executives taking into account the 
Company’s strategic objectives, shareholder 
expectations and the principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 
The aim of the remuneration policy is to 
provide an appropriate pay structure  
for the Executive Directors and Senior 
Management to ensure their retention and 
to continue to focus them on delivering 
strong financial performance. 
The Company and the Committee are 
confident that the formal policy set out in 
this report is effective at driving continued 
good performance from the Executive 
Directors without overpaying, and is 
therefore appropriate for the Company. 
Consideration of Pay Conditions Within 
the Wider Team
When making decisions on executive 
remuneration, the Committee takes into 
account pay conditions for the Company as 
a whole, although it does not consult directly 
with employees on this subject. 
The Group has a strong “team culture” and 
accordingly there is consistency in how 
packages are structured across the whole 
Senior Management team, with all Executive 
Directors and Senior Managers participating 
in the same annual incentive plan and LTIP 
from Admission. 
However, there are some differences  
in the structure of the remuneration policy 
for the Executive Directors compared  
with other Senior Managers, which the 
Committee believes are necessary to  
reflect the different levels of responsibility. 
The two main differences are the increased 
emphasis on performance related pay for 
Executive Directors (through a higher 
variable pay opportunity) and a greater 
focus on long term alignment (through 
additional holding periods for the long  
term incentive awards and minimum 
shareholding guidelines).
Shareholder Views
The Remuneration Committee values the 
views of the Company’s shareholders  
and takes into account guidance from 
shareholder representative bodies. 
Shareholder feedback received in relation  
to the AGM, as well as any additional 
feedback received during the year, will  
be considered as part of the Company’s 
annual review. Before any significant 
changes to the policy are proposed,  
the Chair of the Committee will discuss 
these changes with the Company’s major 
shareholders to ensure that the policy 
remains supportive of their interests. 
Remuneration Policy for 
Executive Directors
The table below sets out, for each element 
of pay, a summary of how remuneration is 
structured and how it supports the 
Company’s strategy.
Purpose and link 
to strategy Operation Performance measurement Maximum opportunity
BASE SALARY
To aid the 
recruitment of 
Executive Directors 
of a suitable calibre 
for the role and to 
provide a core level 
of reward to reflect 
the duties required.
Base salaries will normally be reviewed 
annually by the Committee with any 
increases typically taking effect from  
1 July each year.
Base salary levels are set at a 
level to reflect the experience, 
skills and responsibilities of the 
individual as well as the scope 
and scale of their role. 
Increases to base salary will 
reflect the performance of  
the individual and Company 
and external indicators such  
as inflation.
While there is no maximum 
salary, increases will normally 
be in line with the typical level 
of increase awarded to other 
employees of the Group. 
However, since base salaries  
at Admission were set 
significantly below competitive 
market levels, the Committee 
reserves the right to award 
increases above the level set 
out above to ensure that the 
salaries appropriately reflect 
the role, responsibilities, 
performance and experience 
of the Directors. 
For details of the current base 
salary levels for the Executive 
Directors see page 48.

BENEFITS
To provide a 
market-competitive 
benefits package 
for the executives 
to aid recruitment 
and retention. 
The benefits offered to Executive  
Directors comprise family medical 
insurance, company car and  
fuel allowance. 
The Committee may offer an equivalent 
cash allowance instead if it feels it is  
more suitable. 
Other reasonable benefits may be  
offered as appropriate (including, in 
exceptional circumstances, relocation  
and/or disturbance allowances). 
Executive Directors may also be 
reimbursed for any reasonable expenses 
incurred in performing their duties, and  
any income tax payable thereon.
Not applicable. There is no maximum limit  
on the value of the benefits 
provided but the Committee 
monitors of the total cost of  
the benefit provision on a 
regular basis.
PENSION
To provide 
market-competitive 
pension 
arrangements for 
the executives and 
to aid recruitment 
and retention.
Executive Directors are eligible for  
a contribution to the Group personal 
pension plan, or any other nominated 
personal pension fund. 
Where appropriate, Executive Directors 
may instead receive a cash allowance  
in lieu of formal pension contributions,  
or a combination of both.
Not applicable. 10% of base salary.
ANNUAL BONUS
To encourage 
improved financial 
and operational 
performance and 
align the interests 
of Directors with 
the short term 
Company strategy. 
Executive Directors are eligible for 
bonuses, payable in cash, on an  
annual basis. Bonus payments are  
subject to the achievement of annual 
performance targets. 
Annual bonuses are payable at the sole 
discretion of the Committee. 
All bonus payments are subject to 
appropriate recovery and withholding 
arrangements.
Performance will normally be 
based on a mix of financial and 
operational measures aligned 
with the strategic objectives  
of the business. 
Financial performance will 
usually be represented by 
adjusted operating profit 
targets, although the 
Committee reserves the  
right to use other measures  
in support of the Company 
strategy as it sees fit. 
Stretching performance targets 
will be determined taking into 
account internal and external 
forecasts, and will be set out 
on a retrospective basis in  
the Annual Report on 
Remuneration, unless 
considered to still be 
commercially sensitive.
100% of salary.

LONG TERM INCENTIVES
To encourage 
improved financial 
and operational 
performance and 
align the interests 
of Directors with 
the long term 
Company strategy 
and the interests of 
shareholders 
through share 
ownership.
The Company operates a PSP under which 
annual awards of conditional shares or nil 
cost options can be made to Executive 
Directors and selected Senior Managers. 
Awards will normally be granted following 
the publication of the Company’s annual 
results each year. 
Awards made under the PSP will normally 
vest three years from the date of grant, 
subject to continued service and the 
satisfaction of pre-determined 
performance conditions. 
Any shares vesting to Executive Directors, 
other than those sold to settle tax and 
national insurance contributions, will be 
subject to a two year holding period during 
which they may not be sold. Thereafter 
they will be subject to the normal  
share ownership guidelines as 
summarised below. 
The Committee may determine that 
dividend equivalents will accrue over 
the vesting/holding period. 
Vesting of awards is at the sole discretion 
of the Committee. All payments are subject 
to recovery and withholding arrangements.
Stretching performance  
targets will be set for each 
award cycle. 
Vesting will normally be based 
on three year EPS growth 
targets but, for Senior 
Managers, vesting may include 
an element dependent upon 
site performance. The 
Committee reserves the right 
to use other measures in 
support of the Company 
strategy as it sees fit. 
The Committee will seek  
to consult with major 
shareholders should it propose 
to introduce any other measure 
representing more than 25% of 
the total award.
Normally 100% of salary. 
However, an individual 
maximum of 150% of salary 
may apply in exceptional 
circumstances.
ALL EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS
To align the 
interests of 
Directors and other 
employees with 
those of the 
shareholders 
through share 
ownership.
The Company has adopted two all 
employee share plans in which the 
Executive Directors are eligible to 
participate on the same terms as all other 
employees. These are an SAYE Scheme 
and a SIP.
Not applicable. The maximum limits under the 
plans are as set by HMRC.
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES
To align the 
interests of 
Directors with those 
of the shareholders 
through share 
ownership.
All Executive Directors are required  
to build and maintain a shareholding 
equivalent in value to 200% of their  
annual base salary. 
Until this guideline is met, Directors must 
retain all shares vesting under the PSP 
(after payment of tax and national 
insurance contributions).
Not applicable. Not applicable.

Governance Choice of Performance Measures
The Committee retains flexibility as to the choice of performance measures for future annual bonus and PSP award cycles. Measures  
will be selected as appropriate to reflect the business strategy and to ensure the delivery of sound financial performance. The current 
performance measures are as follows:
Performance measure Incentive plan Link to strategy
Profit before tax Annual bonus Reflects the short term operating and financial performance of the Company.
Customer satisfaction Annual bonus Reflects the importance of customers and the customer experience to the 
organisation and its ongoing success.
Employee engagement Annual bonus Reflects the importance of our employees and their contribution to the 
Group’s performance.
Earnings per Share Performance Share Plan Reflects the long term profitability of the Company and alignment 
with shareholders.
Incentive Plan Operation
The Committee will operate the Company’s incentive plans according to their respective rules and consistent with normal market 
practice, the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant, including flexibility in a number of regards. These include timing of awards, 
dealing with leavers and making adjustments to awards following acquisitions, disposals, changes in share capital and other merger  
and acquisition activity.
The Committee also retains the ability to adjust the targets and/or set different measures for the annual bonus plan and outstanding PSP 
awards if events occur which cause it to determine that the conditions are no longer appropriate and the amendment is required so that 
the conditions achieve their original purpose and are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Recovery and withholding provisions may be operated at the discretion of the Committee in respect of awards granted under the annual 
bonus plan arrangements and the PSP in certain circumstances (including where there is a material misstatement or restatement of 
audited accounts, an error in assessing any applicable performance condition or bonus outcome, or in the event of gross misconduct  
on the part of the participant).
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

performing the role of SID, or chairing one of the Board Committees. 
The Non-Executive Chairman receives a fixed fee only, and is not 
eligible for any additional responsibility fees. 
Fee levels are reviewed on an annual basis, and may be increased 
taking into account factors such as the time commitment of the role 
and market levels in companies of comparable size and complexity 
and other broadly comparable companies. 
Each NED will be entitled to be reimbursed for all reasonable 
expenses incurred in the course of their duties to the Company  
and has the benefit of indemnity insurance maintained by the Group 
on their behalf indemnifying them against liabilities he/she may 
potentially incur to third parties as a result of their office as Director.

Approach to Recruitment Remuneration
New Executive Director hires (including those promoted internally) will be offered packages in line with the remuneration policy in place 
at the time, except as noted below:
• If it is considered appropriate to set the salary for a new Executive Director at a level which is below market, his or her salary may be 
increased in future periods to achieve the desired market positioning by way of a series of phased above-inflation increases, subject 
to his or her continued development in the role.
• Any bonus payment for the year of joining will normally be pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the period worked, and the 
Committee may set different performance measures and targets, depending on the timing and nature of the appointment.
• The Remuneration Committee recognises that it may be necessary in some circumstances to provide compensation for amounts 
forfeited from a previous employer (‘‘buy-out awards’’). Any buy-out awards would be limited to what is felt to be a fair estimate of the 
value of remuneration forfeited when leaving the former employer and would be structured so as to be, to the extent possible, no 
more generous in terms of the fair value and other key terms (e.g. time to vesting and performance targets) than the incentive it is 
replacing. Where possible any such payments would be facilitated through the Company’s existing incentive plans, but, if not, the 
awards may be granted outside of these plans, as permitted under the Listing Rules, which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate 
the recruitment of an Executive Director.
• In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role will be allowed to pay out 
according to its original terms or adjusted as considered appropriate to reflect the new role.
External Directorships
Executive Directors are permitted to take on external non-executive directorships at other listed companies, though normally only one 
other appointment, to bring a further external perspective to the Group and help in the development of key individuals’ experience. In 
order to avoid any conflicts of interest, all appointments are subject to the approval of the Nomination Committee. Executive Directors 
are permitted to retain the fees arising from any appointments undertaken.

The remuneration related elements of the current contracts for Executive Directors are as follows.
Provision Treatment
Termination 
payment
The Company may (at its discretion) elect to terminate the employment by making a payment in lieu of notice 
equivalent in value to the base salary which the Executive Director would have received during any unexpired 
period of notice.
Mitigation The payment in lieu of notice will be payable in monthly instalments (subject to mitigation, i.e. reduced on  
a pound for pound basis if alternative employment/engagement is taken up during the payment period). 
Annual bonus There is no contractual right to any bonus payment in the event of termination although in certain circumstances 
the Committee may exercise its discretion to pay a bonus for the period of employment and based on 
performance assessed after the end of the financial year.
Share awards The default treatment, under the PSP rules, is for all unvested awards to lapse in full on cessation. 
However, if the participant ceases to be an employee or a Director within the Group because of his/her death, 
injury, disability, retirement, redundancy, their employing company or the business for which they work being 
sold out of the Group or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, then his/her award will 
normally vest on the original scheduled vesting date (except in the case of death, where the default position  
will be for the award to vest on cessation of employment). 
The default position in this case is that an award will vest subject to: (i) the extent to which the performance 
conditions (if any) have been satisfied over the full performance period; and (ii) the pro-rating of the award  
by reference to the period of time served in employment during the normal vesting period. However, the 
Committee can decide to allow early vesting and/or reduce or eliminate the pro-rating of an award if it regards  
it as appropriate to do so in the particular circumstances.
Change of control In the event of a change of control or winding-up of the Company (otherwise than as part of a Group corporate 
reorganisation), all awards will vest early, subject to: (i) the extent that the performance conditions (if any) have 
been satisfied at that time; and (ii) the pro-rating of the awards to reflect the period of time between their grant 
and early vesting, although the Committee can decide to reduce or eliminate the pro-rating of an award if it 
regards it as appropriate to do so in the particular circumstances. 
In the event of a Group corporate reorganisation, awards will be replaced by equivalent new awards over shares 
in a new holding company unless the Committee decides that awards should vest on the basis which would 
apply in the case of a change of control. 
If a demerger, special dividend or other similar event is proposed which, in the opinion of the Committee,  
would affect the market price of shares to a material extent, then the Committee may decide that awards  
will vest on the basis which would apply in the case of a change of control as described above.
Other Outstanding shares under an all employee share plan will vest in accordance with the terms of the plan and 
HMRC legislation. 
The Committee may pay any statutory entitlements or settle or compromise claims in connection with  
a termination of employment, where considered in the best interest of the Company. 
Outplacement services and reimbursement of legal costs may also be provided.

(a) Performance Share Plan
The first awards under the Company’s PSP were made in June 2016. Awards were made to the value of 100% of base salary for each 
Executive Director (using the offer price on flotation of £2.00). Vesting is contingent on continued employment, and satisfaction of EPS 
growth targets, measured over the three financial years from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2019, as follows:
EPS growth 
(CAGR) Vesting
Threshold 12% 25%
Maximum 20% 100%
These awards will ordinarily vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to achievement of the above performance 
conditions. A two year post vesting holding period will apply thereafter, during which time any vested shares (net of any taxes due) 
may not be sold. 
Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 45 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED
(b) SAYE Scheme
In December 2016, Motorpoint launched an SAYE Scheme for all permanent employees. Eligible employees were invited to subscribe  
for options over the Company’s shares at an exercise price of 112.3875p, representing a 10% discount to the closing mid-market share 
price on 2 December 2016 (the day before the invitation date). A total of 335 out of 680 eligible employees elected to participate.  
The maximum subscription offered was £3,600 (equivalent to £100 per month over the 36 month savings period). Mark Carpenter  
and James Gilmour participated at the maximum limit. The share price on the date of grant was 128.2p.
(c) Dilution limits
The PSP and SAYE Scheme were put in place after Admission. Awards to Executives are subject to a dilution limit for newly-issued and 
treasury shares of 5% of the share capital in any 10 year period. Awards under all share plans operated by the Company are subject to an 
overall dilution limit for newly-issued and treasury shares of 10% of the share capital in any 10 year period. 
Table of Directors’ share interests (audited)
The share interests of each Director as at 31 March 2017 (together with interests held by his or her connected persons) are set out in the 
table below.
Executive Directors are required by the remuneration policy to hold shares to the value of 200% of salary, and must retain any vesting 
PSP award (net of any taxes due) until this guideline is met. Additionally, the NEDs are expected to hold shares to the value of 100% of 
their annual fee. Shareholdings are set out as a percentage of salary or fees in the table below.

Change in remuneration of the CEO
Prior to the IPO the CEO was employed by Motorpoint Limited. From 9 May 2016 the CEO was employed by Motorpoint Group Plc.  
As this is the first period reported since incorporation there has been no change in remuneration of the CEO. It is therefore not  
possible to provide meaningful comparative data. However, full disclosure of the year on year movement will be provided in future 
remuneration reports.

A summary of how the remuneration policy will be applied during the forthcoming financial year is set out below.
Base salaries
The Committee reviews the Executive Directors’ base salaries on an annual basis, with any increases taking effect from 1 July each year. 
Salaries were set at IPO and no increase was made in July 2016. No increase is proposed for FY18. Base salaries effective from 1 July 
2017 are set out below.

David Shelton £210,000 £126,000

1 FY17 salary pro-rated to reflect reduced time commitment as part of David Shelton’s phased transition to Non-Executive Director.
Benefits and pension
No changes are proposed to the provision of pension and benefits for FY18. Executive Directors will continue to receive family private 
medical insurance and a company car and fuel allowance. Pension contributions will amount to 10% of salary in line with the remuneration 
policy, and are payable into their nominated personal pension plans.
Annual bonus
There are no significant changes to the structure of the annual bonus plan proposed for the forthcoming year. Executive Directors will  
be eligible for an annual bonus payment up to a maximum of 100% of salary. Bonuses will be based on profit before tax, customer and 
employee engagement measures. No bonus will become payable under the customer and employee measures unless the threshold 
level of profit is achieved. The Committee considers the forward-looking targets to be commercially sensitive as they relate to the current 
financial year, but disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year’s Annual Report.
Long term incentives
There are no changes to the structure of the long term incentive arrangements proposed for the forthcoming year. Executive Directors 
will receive an award of nil cost options under the Company’s PSP following the announcement of annual results. 
These awards will have a face value of 100% of salary, with the exact number of shares to be granted to be determined with reference  
to the prevailing share price around the date of grant. 
Vesting of the FY18 awards is contingent on the Group’s EPS growth performance, measured as the three year from FY17 to FY20.  
The required growth rates for the FY18 award have been set at a higher level than for the FY17 scheme, reflecting that the financial 
performance for the FY18 base calculation year was lower. For future schemes the Committee will review the required growth rates  
and may reduce these to the previous target rates if again considered appropriately challenging yet achievable.
EPS growth 
(CAGR) Vesting
Threshold 18% 25%
Maximum 35% 100%
These awards will ordinarily vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to achievement of the above performance 
conditions. A two year post vesting holding period will apply thereafter, during which time any vested shares (net of any taxes due)  
may not be sold. 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The fees payable to the NEDs of the Company remain unchanged for FY18, and are as follows:
Non-Executive Chairman £100,000
Other NEDs £40,000
Additional responsibility fees:
 Chair of the Remuneration Committee £7,500
 Chair of the Audit Committee £7,500
 SID £5,000

which 33,398,000 shares (representing approximately one third of

Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulation. Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 
102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland”, and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and 
Company for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the Group financial statements  
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS  
102, have been followed for the Company financial statements, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and  
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy  
at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and  
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies  
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article  
4 of the IAS Regulation. The Directors are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence  
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for Shareholders to assess the Group and 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 28 and 29, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
•  the Company financial statements, which have been prepared  
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”, and applicable law), 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and loss of the Company;
•  the Group financial statements, which have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial  
position and profit of the Group; and
•  the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
and Company, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces. 
In the case of each Director in office at the date the Directors’ 
Report is approved:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group and Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
• they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken  
as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any  
relevant audit information and to establish that the Group  
and Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
The Report of the Directors has been approved by and is signed  
on behalf of the Board of Directors.

REPORT ON THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Our Opinion
In our opinion, Motorpoint Group Plc’s Group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What We Have Audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, comprise:
• the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2017;
• the consolidated income statement for the year then ended;
• the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
• the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, and applicable law.
Our Audit Approach
Audit scope
Areas of
focus
Materiality
Overview
• Overall Group materiality: £4.1 million which represents 0.5% of revenue.
• We conducted audit work over Motorpoint Limited (the Group’s trading company) and Motorpoint 
Group Plc (the Parent Company) which together accounted for 100% of the Group’s revenue and  
profit before tax.
• Acquisition of Oldbury site land and buildings.
• Share-based compensation expense.
• Classification of exceptional costs.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). 
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.  
In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed 
the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that 
represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order 
to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be 
read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF MOTORPOINT GROUP PLC 52 Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Acquisition of Oldbury site land and buildings
Refer to page 35 (Audit Committee Report) and page 69  
(note 16: Property, Plant and Equipment) for further information.
During the year, the Group acquired the land and buildings of  
the Lex Autolease site in Oldbury, together with other liabilities. 
This transaction has been treated as the acquisition of assets 
under IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment” rather than a 
business combination under IFRS 3 “Business combinations”. 
Other liabilities of £0.5m were included as part of the £3.9m  
fair value of the net assets acquired. The Group also used an 
independent valuation expert to confirm the fair value of the  
land and buildings at the acquisition date.
We have focused on this area as there is judgement surrounding 
whether the initial acquisition meets the definition of a business 
combination and the determination of the fair value of the  
assets acquired.
We have examined the sale and purchase agreement in order to 
determine the substance of the acquisition. We also verified land 
registry documentation for title transfer.
We have obtained the Directors’ calculation of the fair value of the 
acquisition and agreed the value of various components to cash 
payments, the sale and purchase agreement and other 
supporting documentation.
We have reviewed the valuation report produced by the valuation 
expert and considered their competence.
We found the accounting treatment of the acquisition supported 
by the evidence we obtained.
Share Based Compensation expense
Refer to page 35 (Audit Committee Report), page 64 (note 4: 
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements), page 75  
(note 29: Share Based Compensation).
The Group has introduced three share based payment schemes 
during the year which have been accounted for under IFRS 2 
“Share-based Payment”. A share based payment compensation 
charge of £0.4m has been recognised in the year.
We have focused on this area as share based payments  
involve complex calculations with multiple assumptions relating 
to volatility, risk free rate, dividend yield and non-vesting rate.  
In addition, given this is the first year of the arrangements, any 
incorrect assumptions adopted in this period may result in errors 
in future periods.
We have agreed the factual inputs to the share based payment 
calculations to scheme rules and other supporting documentation. 
We have understood the assumptions adopted by the Directors 
related to volatility, risk free rate, dividend yield and non-vesting 
rate, compared them to independent sources of information 
where appropriate and carried out a sensitivity analysis.
We found that the assumptions and methodology used in the 
calculation of share based compensation expense were 
supported by audit evidence we have obtained.
Classification of exceptional costs
Refer to page 35 (Audit Committee Report), page 64  
(note 4: Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements)  
and page 65 (note 8: Exceptional Items) for further information.
The Group incurred £4.0m of costs in relation to the initial public 
offering which have been classified as exceptional items.
We have focused on this area due to the inherent judgement 
involved in the classification of costs as exceptional and the 
impact on adjusted EBITDA.
We have agreed a sample of exceptional costs back to  
supporting documentation, including invoices, bank statements 
and settlement agreements and considered whether the sampled 
costs had appropriately been classified as exceptional.
No material errors were noted from this testing.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the 
Group operates. 
The Group and all its entities are based in the UK. There is one trading entity, Motorpoint Limited, which has 11 retail sites spread  
across the UK.
Motorpoint Limited and Motorpoint Group Plc, the Parent Company, were considered to be significant components, due to their 
contribution to the Group financial statements. Full scope audits were carried out on both of these components.
The audit work performed over Motorpoint Limited and Motorpoint Group Plc gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion  
on the Group financial statements as a whole. These two statutory entities cover 100% of the Group’s revenue and profit before tax.
All audit work, including work on significant components, was completed by the Group audit team.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT CONTINUED Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 53
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group 
materiality
£4.1m.
How we  
determined it
0.5% of revenue.
Rationale for 
benchmark  
applied
In an industry that operates on low profit margins, volume and revenue are the key drivers for the business 
performance.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £100,000 as well  
as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 49, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that  
the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have 
concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can  
be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 22 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1  
of the Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to.
• the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are  
being managed or mitigated.
We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to.
• the Directors’ explanation on page 24 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2  
of the Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they  
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to  
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation  
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group and the Directors’ statement in relation to the longer term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less 
in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; 
checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are 
consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed  
our review.
Adequacy of Information and Explanations Received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ Remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, a Corporate Governance Statement has not been 
prepared by the Parent Company. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further provisions  
of the Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review.

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT 
Our Responsibilities and Those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 50, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an Audit of Financial Statements Involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and  
adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide  
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements  
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
OTHER MATTER

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT

Financial Statements
1. General Information 
Motorpoint Group Plc (‘the Company’) is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The 
Company is a public company limited by shares and is listed on the London Stock Exchange; the address of the registered office  
is Chartwell Drive, West Meadows Industrial Estate, Derby, DE21 6BZ. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company  
as at and for the year ended 31 March 2017 comprise the Company and all of its subsidiaries, together referred to as the “Group”.  
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment  
in which the Group operates.
The principal activities of the Group and the nature of the Group’s operations are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 26.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. The policies 
have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
(a) Basis of preparation 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and 
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union (“adopted IFRS”), and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under adopted IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention.
On 9 May 2016, the Company obtained control of the entire share capital of Motorpoint Limited via a share for share exchange. There 
were no changes in rights or proportion of control exercised as a result of the transaction. Although the share for share exchange 
resulted in a change of legal ownership this was a common control transaction and therefore outside the scope of IFRS 3. The current 
period and comparative information disclosed in these Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the continuation of the pre-existing 
Group headed by Motorpoint Limited and have been prepared applying the principle of predecessor accounting ownership. The 
consolidated balance sheet as at all periods presents the legal change in ownership of the Group, including the share capital of 
Motorpoint Group Plc and the capital reorganisation reserve arising as a result of the share for share exchange transaction.
(b) Going concern
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. The Group regularly reviews market and financial forecasts, and has 
reviewed its trading prospects in its key markets. As a result it believes its trading performance will demonstrate continued improvement 
in the coming periods, and that liquidity will remain strong.
The Board has reviewed the latest forecasts of the Group and considered the obligations of the financing arrangements. Given the 
continued strong liquidity of the Group the Board has concluded that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Consolidated  
Financial Statements.
(c) New standards, amendments and interpretations
In the current year the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period beginning on or after 1 April 2016. Their adoption has not had any material 
impact on the disclosures or the amounts reported in these Financial Statements.
The Group has not early adopted the following new standards, amendments or interpretations that have been issued but are not yet 
effective, based on European Union endorsement, for periods commencing after 31 March 2017. The Group has commenced its 
assessment of the impact of these standards. It is considered that none of these, with the exception of those noted below, would have  
a significant impact on its results of operations and financial position.
• IFRS 9 Financial instruments, (effective date 1 January 2018), addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial 
assets and financial liabilities. This standard addresses impairments and also considers hedge accounting. The Group does not 
believe that there will be any impact from this standard.
• IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, (effective date 1 January 2018), deals with revenue recognition and establishes 
principles for reporting such information. The standard considers revenue recognition when there are multiple elements to the 
transaction. The Group is assessing the impact of the standard. The Group does not believe that there will be any material impact 
from this standard.
• IFRS 16 Leases, (effective date 1 January 2019 or when apply IFRS 15), deals with the accounting for leases. This standard requires  
a lessee to recognise almost all lease contracts on the balance sheet with lease rental costs being replaced by depreciation and 
interest in the income statement. The Group is assessing the impact of the standard, but also refers to note 27 which discloses  
current operating lease obligations. 
(d) Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the financial statements of the Group and entities controlled by the Group  
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 March each year. 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has  
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date  
that control ceases. Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 61
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
(e) Segmental reporting
The Group has prepared segmental reporting in accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”, which requires segments to be 
presented on the same basis as the management reporting. An operating segment is a component of the business where discrete 
financial information is available and the operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision maker to make 
decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. 
Operating segments are aggregated into reporting segments to combine those with similar characteristics. The Group’s reportable 
operating segment is considered to be the United Kingdom operations. The Group’s chief operating decision maker is considered to be 
the Board of Directors.
The Group operates through a branch network and separate financial information is prepared for these individual branch operations. 
These branches are considered separate ‘cash-generating units’ for impairment purposes. However it is considered that the nature of 
the operations and products is similar and they all have similar long-term economic characteristics, as they are all based within the UK. 
Accordingly the Group has applied the aggregation criteria of IFRS 8 and thus considers it has one reportable segment. Accordingly no 
additional segmental information is required. 
(f) Revenue Recognition
Revenue represents amounts chargeable, net of value added tax, in respect of the sale of goods and services to customers. Revenue is 
measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable, when it can be reliably measured, and the specified recognition criteria for the 
sales type have been met.
(i) Sales of motor vehicles
Revenue from sales of motor vehicles is recognised when the vehicle has been collected by the customer and the risks and rewards  
of ownership have passed.
(ii) Sales of motor related services and commissions
Motor related services sales include extended guarantees, paint protection and vehicle asset protection (gap insurance). Sales of related 
services excluding vehicle asset protection (gap insurance) and vehicle extended guarantees are recognised when the product is 
supplied to the customer. 
Vehicle extended guarantees where the Group is contractually responsible for future claims are accounted for by deferring the 
guarantee income received along with direct selling costs and then releasing the income on a straight line basis over the remaining life 
of the guarantee. Costs in relation to servicing the extended guarantee income are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
Vehicle extended guarantees and asset protection (gap insurance) where the Group is not contractually responsible for future claims,  
are accounted for by recognising the commissions attributable to Motorpoint at the point of sale to the customer. 
Where the Group receives commission income, primarily arising when the customer uses third-party finance to purchase the vehicle,  
the Group recognises such income on an ‘as earned’ basis.
(g) Dividend Distribution
Dividend distribution to the Group’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period which the 
dividends are approved by the Group’s shareholders.
(h) Exceptional Items
Material non-recurring items of income and expense are disclosed as ‘exceptional items’. Examples of items that may give rise to 
disclosure as exceptional items include costs of major restructuring and reorganisation of the business, corporate refinancing and 
restructuring costs. A full analysis of exceptional items is provided in note 8.
(i) Foreign currency
The Group’s functional and presentation currency is the pound sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  
are recognised in the income statement.
(j) Property, plant & equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at the cost less depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly 
attributable costs. 
Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets so as to write off the cost or valuation, less any estimated residual value, over their 
expected useful economic life as follows: 
Asset class Depreciation method and rate
Land Nil
Short term leasehold improvements Lower of 20% straight line or remaining lease term
Plant and machinery 20% straight line
Fixtures and fittings 20% straight line
Motor vehicles 20% straight line
Office equipment 20% – 33.3% straight line 62 Motorpoint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
(j) Property, plant & equipment continued
Assets in the course of construction are recorded separately within property, plant and equipment and are transferred to the appropriate 
classification when complete and depreciated from the date they are bought into use. 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. The carrying value of 
assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets 
will be written down to their recoverable amount if lower than the carrying value, and any impairment is charged to the income statement. 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income 
statement within “administrative expenses”.
(k) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as financial assets, financial liabilities or equity 
instruments according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.  
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(l) Financial assets
Financial assets are classified on initial recognition in the following categories: loans and receivables; held at fair value through profit  
and loss and available for sale. The classification depends upon the nature and purpose for which the assets were acquired.
Financial assets at fair value through the profit and loss include derivatives classified as held for trading. Derivatives, which can be  
a financial asset or financial liability are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. The method  
of recognising the gain or loss depends upon whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and the nature of the  
hedge arrangement. The Group currently has no hedge arrangements and the gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss in  
administrative expenses. 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed and determinable payments. The Group’s loans and receivables 
comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’ in the balance sheet.
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other 
categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 
12 months of the end of the reporting period.
(m) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified on initial recognition as either other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost or at fair value 
through profit or loss.
(n) Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in 
the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparty.
(o) Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after due regard for slow moving vehicles. Cost includes the original 
purchase cost of vehicles and the specifically identified costs incurred in bringing each vehicle to its current location and condition. 
Net realisable value is based on selling price less anticipated costs to completion and selling costs. When calculating an inventory 
provision management considers the nature and condition of the inventory as well as applying assumptions around expected saleability, 
determined on historic trading patterns.
(p) Trade receivables
Trade receivables represent the principal amounts outstanding from finance companies in respect of the financed element of sales to 
customers for motor vehicle and related products. Trade receivables are recognised net of any provision for impairment. 
(q) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and at bank and deposits held at call with banks. Where applicable, bank overdrafts are 
shown within borrowings in current liabilities. Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 63
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
(r) Current and Deferred tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that 
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In these cases it is recognised in other comprehensive 
income or equity respectively.
The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all temporary differences arising between the treatment of certain items for 
taxation and accounting purposes, which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured at the rates, 
based on the tax rates and law enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, that are expected to apply in the periods 
when the timing differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the  
same taxable entity or different taxable entities and there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
(s) Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from  
suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented  
as non-current liabilities. 
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
unless the effect is immaterial.
(t) Stocking finance facilities
Stocking finance facilities, included within trade payables, are borrowings secured against the vehicle against which the facility is drawn 
down. These are short term liabilities which are settled on the sale of a vehicle or a fixed maturity not greater than 150 days and as a 
result form part of the normal business operating cycle. They are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, unless the effect is immaterial.
(u) Operating Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Lease incentives are recognised over the period of the lease.
(v) Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Costs incurred in issuing equity are deducted from the equity instrument.
(w) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost and allocating the interest cost over the relevant 
period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the  
financial instrument. 
(x) Employee benefits
(i) Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those 
of the Group. The annual contributions are charged in the profit and loss account in the period in which they become payable in 
accordance with the rules of the scheme. 
(ii) Other employee benefits
The Group recognises an expense for other short-term employee benefits, primarily holiday pay and employee commissions and 
bonuses on an accruals basis. 
(iii) Share Based Compensation
Equity-settled Share Based Compensation to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the 
equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. Details regarding the 
determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transaction are set out in note 29.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled Share Based Compensation is expensed on a straight-line basis over  
the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimates of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group 
revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting 
conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expenses 
reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
SAYE share options granted to employees are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme. This results  
in accelerated recognition of the expenses that would have arisen over the remainder of the original vesting period.
Equity-settled Share Based Compensation transactions with parties other than employees are measured at the fair value of the goods  
or services received, except where that fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods  
or the counterparty renders the service. 64 Motorpoint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
(y) Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit 
attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. For diluted EPS, 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
As explained in the basis of preparation accounting policy, the Group’s financial statements reflect the continuation of the pre existing 
Group headed by Motorpoint Limited. The 2016 weighted average number of shares has been stated as the weighted average number 
of shares in the period from the date of the Group capital reorganisation to the balance sheet date. A reconciliation of the adjusted and 
alternative measures to the statutory measure required by IFRS is given in note 11.
3. Underlying Profit Measures
The Group’s chief operating decision maker is considered to be the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors measure the overall 
performance of the Group by reference to the following non-GAAP measures:
• operating profit before exceptional items (adjusted operating profit)
• profit before tax before exceptional items (adjusted profit before tax)
The adjusted measures are applied by the Board of Directors to understand the earning trends of the Group and are considered the 
most meaningful measures by which to assess the true operating performance of the Group.
4. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in the application  
of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. Further information about these areas of 
judgement is contained below. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other 
factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
(i) Significant judgements
Accounting for Oldbury Acquisition
The Group acquired the land and buildings of its Oldbury site from Lex Autolease during the year. As part of the acquisition other 
liabilities were also acquired. This significant judgement was whether this transaction should be treated as an acquisition of assets under 
IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’ or a business combination under IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’. Following review of both 
standards the judgement was made that the IAS 16 ‘Property. Plant and equipment’ is the appropriate standard. As such total acquisition 
costs of the property have been included as additions to property, plant and equipment during the year.
Classification of Exceptional items
Non-recurring income and expenses are disclosed as exceptional items. These items derive from events or transactions that are outside 
the normal course of business, and do not directly relate to the on-going operations, therefore have been separately disclosed in order 
for the financial statements to present a true and fair view. There is judgement involved in determining whether items of income and 
expense should be classified as exceptional items.
(ii) Accounting estimates
Share Based Compensation 
The Group’s share based compensation schemes have been valued based on application of IFRS2 and using the Black Scholes model 
where appropriate. The key estimates used in calculating the fair value of the options are the fair value of the Company’s shares at the 
grant date, the expected share price volatility, the risk-free interest rate, the expected life of the instrument and the number of shares 
expected to vest.

Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares at the end of the current year. Adjusted earnings per share are calculated on the same basis but adjusting 
earnings attributable to equity shareholders for exceptional items.

shares. Please refer to note 26 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for share capital details.
The difference between the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares represents the dilutive effect of the SAYE scheme. 
This is shown in the reconciliation below.
The shares for the SIP scheme were purchased ahead of issue and the PSP has performance criteria which have not been met so the 
options are not yet dilutive.

The depreciation expense of £1.0m (FY16: £1.0m) has been recorded in operating expenses.
During the year the Group acquired certain freehold land and buildings of the Oldbury site for consideration of £3.9m which has been 
shown within additions. These assets were then the subject of a sale and leaseback transaction with the net proceeds of the sale 
amounting to £5.8m. The disposal of these assets has been accounted for at their net book value, which is deemed to be the fair value  
of the assets, at the date of the transaction with the sales proceeds in excess of the fair value being deferred over the life of the lease. 
The fair value of the property was determined by Colliers International Specialist and Consulting UK LLP, property advisers, in May 2016.  70 Motorpoint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The Group’s potential borrowings consist of an unsecured £20m facility provided by Santander UK Plc which was undrawn as at the 
reporting date. The facility was negotiated in May 2016 ahead of the Motorpoint Group IPO listing. The facility is currently provided as 
£6m available as an overdraft and £14m available as a revolving credit facility. 
The finance charged for utilising the facility is dependent on the Group’s borrowing ratios as well as the base rate of interest in effect. 
During the year ended 31 March 2017 interest was charged at 1.4% per annum. The interest charged for the year of £0.1m has been 
expensed as a finance cost. There was no facility available in the prior year.

£64.9m (FY16: £51.0m) was drawn. 
 Since the stocking finance facility was renegotiated in May 2017 all borrowings are secured against the vehicle which the stocking finance facility is drawn down against. 
The finance is repayable on the earlier of the sale of the respective vehicle or a latest date of between 90 and 150 days from date of drawdown of the facility amount. 
Since renegotiation the facility bears interest at the rate of 1% over Finance House Base Rate. Prior to that and for the duration of 2016 the facility in place was at an 
interest rate 2% above the Finance House Base Rate. An interest expense in the year of £1.0m (FY16: £0.8m) has been recognised as a Finance cost. 
(ii) Amounts due to related parties are repayable on demand, unsecured and non-interest bearing.
(iii) Included in ‘Other creditors’ in 2016 was £1.7m that represented the amounts due in the current year in respect of the settlement with HMRC relating to employee benefit 
trusts. The amount was bearing interest at 4% per annum. In 2016 the amounts due over one year of £0.9m shown within other creditors over 1 year. This liability was 
settled early during the year, full payment is presented as part of the exceptional cash flow items.
Due to their short maturities, the fair value of current liabilities approximates to their book value.

24. Financial Instruments and Risk Management
The principal financial liabilities comprise inventory finance facilities and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial 
liabilities is to provide working capital funding for the Group. The main risks arising from financial liabilities are discussed further below. 
The principal financial assets comprise trade and other receivables and cash at bank and in hand. The maximum exposure at the balance 
sheet date is the carrying value of the financial assets as disclosed in this note.
(a) Credit risk
The Group trades predominantly with retail customers. Sales to such customers are for cash and/or part exchange, often with finance 
provided by a selected panel of financial institutions. The majority of the Group’s sales are thus for cash or the remittances of funds from 
financial institutions, which is achieved in a short period after the sale. As such the Group does not consider that it is exposed to credit 
risk from retail customers. Receivable balances are monitored on an on-going basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad 
debts is not considered to be significant. The maximum exposure is the carrying value amount as disclosed below. There is no significant 
concentration of credit risk within the Group. As a consequence, the Directors are satisfied that the Group’s exposure to credit risk is 
acceptable.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and loans to 
related parties, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from the default of counterparties, with a maximum exposure equal to the 
carrying amount of these instruments. Counterparty credit risk is managed through the monitoring and active management of 
counterparty balances.
(b) Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk on the purchase of inventory from various European countries. In the 2017 financial year 
the Group managed the foreign exchange risk by hedging certain anticipated foreign cash flows by the use of forward exchange 
contracts. The Group did not apply hedge accounting to these transactions in either 2016 or 2017.
At 31 March 2017 if sterling had weakened/strengthened by 10% against the Euro, with all other variables held constant, the recalculated 
post-tax profit for the year would have been £Nil (FY16: £Nil) lower/higher as a result of foreign exchange losses/gains on the translation 
of euro-denominated trade payables. 
(c) Funding and liquidity risk
The current funding arrangements of the Group consist primarily of the stocking finance facilities, trade and other payables as well  
as a £20m revolving credit facility which includes £6m of the facility available as an overdraft. Further information regarding these 
arrangements is included in note 21 and note 22. 
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a long term business plan that considers the maturity of all of its financial 
liabilities and the projected cash flows from operations. The Group aims to have sufficient committed borrowing facilities and operating 
cash flows to cover the core long term requirements of the Group.
The maturity table below details the contractual, undiscounted cash flows (both principal and interest) for the Group’s non-derivative 
financial liabilities into relevant maturity Groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity 
date. Interest payments have been calculated using the LIBOR rates at the period end, except where rates had already been contracted.

At 31 March 2016 the Group’s fixed rate financial liabilities comprised amounts payable in respect of the Employee Benefit Trust 
settlement. This was repaid during 2017. 
At 31 March 2017 and 2016 the floating rate financial liabilities comprise stocking finance facilities that bear interest at rates based on 
Finance House Base Rate (FHBR). The Group also has a revolving credit facility which bears interest based on the LIBOR rate, this facility 
was undrawn at 31 March 2017.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant,

(e) Capital Management
The Group’s objective when managing capital is to ensure adequate working capital for operating needs and an efficient capital 
structure to achieve the business plan and returns for shareholders. For these purposes the Group considers that shareholders’ equity 
comprises capital.
The Group funds its inventory and other working capital through trade creditors, stocking finance facilities and a £20m revolving credit 
facility. There are certain covenants relating to a maximum debt to equity and interest rate cover in respect of the Group Consolidated 
Financial Statements. The Group reviews covenant compliance on a monthly basis, both retrospectively and prospectively.
At 31 March 2017 the Group had undrawn stocking finance facilities of approximately £0.1m (FY16: £4.0m) and undrawn revolving credit 
facilities of £20m (FY16: £Nil). 
(f) Fair Value Estimation
With the exception of forward foreign exchange contracts, the Group has no financial assets or liabilities carried at fair value.
At 31 March 2017 the notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts was £Nil (FY16: £3.9m).  
The fair values are determined using valuation techniques based on observable market data, such as forward exchange rates  
and are considered Level 2 transactions. All gains and losses are included in the income statement in cost of goods sold.
(g) Financial instruments by category

Motorpoint Group Plc was incorporated with the name Motorpoint Group Limited on 12th April 2016 with one ordinary share of £1.
On 9th May 2016 all the shares of Motorpoint Limited were acquired by Motorpoint Group Limited by way of a share for share exchange. 
This resulted in the issuing of 99,999,999 shares of £1.
On 10th May 2016 Motorpoint Group Limited undertook a capital reduction via the Directors solvency statement process which resulted 
in a reduction in the nominal value of shares from £1 to 1p and as a result a £99 million increase in the retained earnings of Motorpoint 
Group Limited was recognised.
On 10th May 2016 Motorpoint Group Limited was re-registered as a Plc and changed its name to Motorpoint Group Plc.
On the 4th July 2016 the Company issued and allotted 194,023 shares of 0.01p each in connection with the Motorpoint Group Plc Share

Share options are granted to Senior Executives and other individuals throughout the organisation. The Group currently operates three 
share schemes and these are the Performance Share Plan, Share Incentive Plan and the Sharesave scheme. The total charge in the year 
relating to the three schemes including associated national insurance (NI) charges was £0.4m (FY16: £Nil).
All share-based incentives are subject to service conditions. Such conditions are not taken into account in the fair value of the service 
received. The fair value of services received in return for share based incentives is measured by reference to the fair value of share 
based incentives granted. The estimate of the fair value of the share based incentives is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing 
model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
NI is being accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8% which management expects to be the prevailing rate when the awards are 
exercised, based on the share price at the reporting date. NI for the year ended 31 March 2017 relating to all awards was a charge of 
£0.1m (FY16: £Nil). 76 Motorpoint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Share Incentive Plan
The Group operates a Share Incentive Plan scheme that was made available to all eligible employees following admission to the London 
Stock Exchange in May 2016. There will be two tranches of awards made under this scheme. The first of these was made on the 4th July 
2016 and the second will be made in December 2017. 
On 4 July 2016, all eligible employees were awarded free shares valued at £1,000 each based on a share price of £1.877. A total of 
194,023 shares were awarded under the scheme, subject to a three year service period (Vesting Period).
As the SIP awards will be equity settled they have been valued based on the grant price at the date of issue with an appropriate 
adjustment for expected leavers. The resulting share-based payments charge is spread evenly over the Vesting Period. The SIP 
shareholders are entitled to dividends over the Vesting Period. No performance criteria are applied to the vesting of the SIP shares.  
Fair value at the grant date was measured at £1.877.

The total charge in the year, included in administration expenses, in relation to these awards was £0.1m (FY16: £Nil). 
Performance Share Plan
The Group operates a Performance Share Plan for Executive Directors and certain key senior executives. On 23rd June 2016 the Group 
awarded 569,659 nil cost options under the PSP scheme. The extent to which such awards vest will depend upon the Group’s 
performance over a three-year period following the award date. The vesting in April 2019 (Vesting Date) will be dependent on whether 
relevant performance criteria have been met. Performance criteria is based on both individual unit performances where relevant and 
overall Earnings Per Share performance. 
As the PSP awards will be equity settled they have been valued based on the grant price at the date of issue with an appropriate 
adjustment for expected leavers and expected performance against the relevant criteria. The resulting share-based payments charge 
has been spread evenly over the Vesting Period. The PSP shareholders are entitled to dividends over the Vesting Period. Fair value at 
the grant date was measured at £2.30.

Save as You Earn Share Scheme
The Group operates a Save as you Earn share Scheme (SAYE) for all employees under which employees are granted an option to 
purchase ordinary shares in the Group at 10% less than the market price at invitation, in three years’ time, dependent on their entering 
into a contract to make monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period. Options are granted and are linked to  
a savings contract with a term of three years. These funds are used to fund the option exercise. No performance criteria are applied  
to the exercise of Sharesave options. The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the sharesave plan  
are as follows.

Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility at the grant date. As there was not significant  
history of Motorpoint Group Plc share price at the point of issue volatility based on the historic share price movement of a selection of 
comparative companies was used. The requirement that an employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the SAYE is a non 
vesting condition. This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained 
from the Black-Scholes pricing model. Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 77

REPORT ON THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

• the company statement of cashflows for the year then ended;
• the company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”, and applicable law 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING 
Consistency of Other Information and Compliance with Applicable Requirements 
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are 
required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. We have nothing  
to report in this respect.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the company acquired in the course  
of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT 
Our Responsibilities and Those of the Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 50, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing.
What an Audit of Financial Statements Involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and  
adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide  
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements  
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.

COMPANY STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2017 Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 83
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Motorpoint Group Plc is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is domiciled and incorporated in the 
United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The Company was incorporated on 12 April 2016 and adopted Financial Reporting 
Standard 102 (FRS 102) from that date.
(a) Basis of preparation 
These Company financial statements for the period ended 31 March 2017 have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
accounting standards including FRS 102 and the Companies Act 2006. These financial statements are prepared on a going concern 
basis, under the historical cost convention.
No comparative information has been included in these accounts as the Company was incorporated in April 2016. Further information  
is respect of the incorporation and ownership of the Company is outlined in note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Directors have used the going concern principle on the basis that the current profitable financial projections and facilities of the 
consolidated Group will continue in operation for a period not less than 12 months from the date of this report. The Company is in a net 
liability position, however this wholly as a result of amounts owed to Motorpoint Limited, a subsidiary company. As such the Directors  
do not see the net liability position as a risk when considering the going concern of the Company.
The Company financial statements have been prepared in sterling which is the functional and presentational currency of the Company 
and have been presented in round £m.
As permitted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 an entity profit and loss is not included as part of the published 
consolidated financial statements of Motorpoint Group Plc. The Company proposes to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure 
framework of FRS 102 in its next financial statements.
(b) Critical Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to 
exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group and Company accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 4 to 
the Consolidated accounts. The judgement around Classification of Exceptional items and the estimates involved in accounting for share 
based compensation are relevant for the Company accounts.
(c) Investment in Subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost, less any provision for impairment. Annually, the Directors consider whether any events or 
circumstances have occurred that could indicate that the carrying amount of fixed asset investments may not be recoverable. If such 
circumstances do exist, a full impairment review is undertaken to establish whether the carrying amounts exceed the higher of net 
realisable value or value in use. If this is the case, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the related investment. 
Where equity-settled Share Based Compensation is granted to the employees of subsidiary companies, the fair value of the award is 
treated as a capital contribution by the Company and investments in subsidiaries are adjusted to reflect this capital contribution.
(d) Dividend Distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period 
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
(e) Foreign currency
The Company’s functional and presentation currency is the pound sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  
are recognised in the income statement.
(f) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
The Company classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as financial assets, financial liabilities  
or equity instruments according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
(g) Financial equity
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(h) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified on initial recognition as either other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost or at fair value 
through profit or loss.
(i) Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Costs incurred in issuing equity are deducted from the equity instrument.
(j) Employee benefits
(a) Other employee benefits
The Company recognises an expense for other short-term employee benefits, primarily holiday pay and employee commissions and 
bonuses on an accruals basis. 
(b) Share Based Compensation
Equity-settled Share Based Compensation payments to employees and other providing similar services are measured at the fair  
value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. 
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 84 Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based compensation is expensed on a straight-line basis over  
the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimates of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the  
Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting 
conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expenses 
reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
SAYE share options granted to employees are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme. This results in 
accelerated recognition of the expenses that would have arisen over the remainder of the original vesting period.
Equity-settled Share Based Compensation transactions with parties other than employees are measured at the fair value of the goods or 
services received, except where that fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or 
the counterparty renders the service.
(k) Exemptions for qualifying entities under FRS 102
FRS 102 allows certain disclosure exemptions. The Company has taken the exemptions under FRS 102 paragraphs 1.12 (d) and (e) from 
including disclosure in relation to Share Based Compensation and key management compensation, since equivalent disclosures are 
included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group headed by Motorpoint Group Plc.
