FINANCIAL & NON-FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Throughout the Strategic Report, and consistent with prior years, underlying and other alternative performance measures are used to describe the Group’s performance. 
These are not recognised under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Executive Board of the Group manages and assesses the performance 
of the business on these measures and believes they are more representative of ongoing trading, facilitate meaningful year on year comparisons and hence provide more 
useful information to shareholders. 
All underlying measures are defined in the glossary of terms on page 196. A summary of the adjustments from statutory to underlying results is shown on page 161 and 
further detailed in the consolidated income statement (page 107), reconciliation of free cash flow (page 112), note 1, segmental reporting (pages 120 to 123) and note 5,  
tax (pages 127 and 128).

STRATEGIC REPORT Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 4 The global leader
We estimate that the addressable global food 
services market is currently worth around 
£200 billion. We have around a 10% share  
of that market by sales which makes us 
the leading global provider. Given that 
approximately 75% of the market is serviced 
by regional players or in-house providers, 
we believe that there is a significant structural 
growth opportunity for us.

Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 6 Significant structural growth 
opportunity across our sectors  
and markets
The market for food and support services continues to offer 
significant growth potential as we drive outsourcing and deliver 
a strong proposition across our sectors and regions.
Compass provides outsourced food and support services in around  
50 countries in a market worth over £400 billion (comprising 
approximately £200 billion food service and £200 billion support 
services). The five sectors in which Compass operates are: Business 
& Industry; Healthcare & Seniors; Education; Sports & Leisure and 
Defence, Offshore & Remote. All five sectors continue to offer 
significant opportunities for growth.
Food service remains at the core of the Compass offer. Business & 
Industry accounts for around 40% of this value, and this important 
sector continues to offer attractive growth opportunities. In more 
developed markets where outsourcing rates are routinely in excess 
of 60%, our combination of scale, efficiencies and first class service 
delivery supports continued revenue growth. In more emerging 
markets, outsourcing rates are still only around 10%, providing  
an enormous opportunity for future growth in our core sector.
The Healthcare & Seniors and Education sectors also continue to 
grow, with less than half of the addressable global market currently 
outsourced. We are developing operational excellence in areas such 
as our proposition for hospital visitors and nutritional meal planning 
in schools and, by sharing this expertise, we can better serve our 
clients and consumers across multiple markets.
Sports & Leisure is a highly outsourced sector with a global outlook 
in which we benefit from our strong reputation across key markets.
The Defence, Offshore & Remote sector offers significant 
opportunities to build lasting strategic relationships with large local 
and international operators. Creating strong client relationships 
allows us to respond positively to tougher market conditions. For 
example, in the basic commodities sector where we have leveraged 
our cost base and changed our offer to meet our clients’ needs  
and have retained business in the face of real budgetary pressure.
Support services remains an important market for Compass, 
particularly in Healthcare & Seniors and Defence, Offshore & 
Remote. In these sectors, we are recognised for fulfilling  
the needs of clients who require excellent services with 
uncompromising quality.
In all the markets and regions in which Compass operates,  
we continue to build our business and our reputation based on  
our ongoing focus on health and safety, the environment and  
our firm commitment to responsible corporate practices.

bespoke offers that meet their specific requirements and, in doing so, truly 
differentiate ourselves.

STRATEGIC REPORT Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 10 We act responsibly
We seek to achieve our strategic goals in a  
sustainable way with emphasis on where we  
believe we can make the most positive social  
impact, whilst consistently delivering value  
for all our stakeholders in the long term.
11 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
2017 was another excellent year for Compass. We continue to 
pursue our clear and focused strategy, which has again delivered 
sustainable organic growth and returns for shareholders. North 
America performed strongly, and revenues in both Europe and  
Rest of World accelerated in the second half of the year as expected.  
We improved margins by driving further efficiencies through the 
business, aided by the end of the restructuring plan in Offshore & 
Remote. Details of our operational and financial performance  
can be found on pages 14 to 33. This performance reaffirms the 
Board’s confidence in the effectiveness of our business model and 
strategy, both of which have been central to our long term success 
(see pages 14 to 17).
SHAREHOLDER RETURNS
As a result of our strong performance, the Board is recommending  
a 5.7% increase in the final dividend for the year of 22.3 pence per 
share (2016: 21.1 pence per share). This gives a total dividend for 
the year of 33.5 pence per share (2016: 31.7 pence per share), 
an increase of 5.7%. The final dividend will be paid on 26 February 
2018 to shareholders on the register on 19 January 2018.
In addition to the ordinary dividend, and as a result of the Group’s 
robust cash generation, we paid a £1 billion special dividend in July 
and bought back £19 million in shares during the year. We remain 
committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings and 
will continue to return surplus cash to shareholders and to target net 
debt/EBITDA of around 1.5x.
OUR PEOPLE
At Compass, we owe our success to our 550,000+ employees all 
over the world. I would like to thank them for their commitment and 
hard work during the year. When I visit the business, I am always 
impressed by their vast experience and unrelenting focus on our 
clients and consumers. It is then easier to understand why we’ve 
been so successful and, as importantly, why we expect the success 
to continue.
This was very much in evidence when, as a Board, we visited our 
award-winning US subsidiary Bon Appétit, in Silicon Valley. It 
services the premium and high end of the market and is regarded 
by independent experts as one of the foremost ground-breaking 
companies in the food service industry. Bon Appétit works with 
some of the most demanding and innovative clients in the world and 
their success is an inspiration to all of us to keep raising our game 
across all our sectors and sub-sectors.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Our people are also central to our ability to achieve our goals in a 
responsible and sustainable manner. Two years ago, we sharpened 
our approach to Corporate Responsibility to support the longer term 
ambition of our business and stakeholders. As part of this strategic 
review, we agreed to proactively support the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) and selected the goals where we believe 
that we can make the most positive social impact. There is still much 
more to do but I am pleased with the progress that we have made 
so far. See pages 37 to 41 and www.compass-group.com for more 
about our activities.
Consistent performance
I’m delighted to report another excellent 
year for Compass. We continue to pursue 
our clear and focused strategy, which 
has again delivered a strong performance 
for shareholders, and we remain positive 
about the future opportunities we see.
I’d like to take this opportunity to thank 
everyone who works for Compass for  
their hard work and dedication, which  
are fundamental to our ongoing success.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 12 GOVERNANCE AND THE BOARD
Integrity and trust are more important than ever in today’s business 
world. One of my key responsibilities as Chairman is to set the 
tone for the company and ensure good governance (see pages  
42 to 46). In this I have been extremely well supported by the 
members of the Board. They bring balance and a wealth of skills 
and experience to our organisation which complement the talents 
of our executive team. I thank them all for their valuable contribution 
as we continue to uphold the high standards expected of us, to 
maintain oversight of the strategic, operational and compliance 
risks across the Group and to define our path to success.
APPOINTMENT OF NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE
In September, we announced a significant change in the Group’s 
Board. Richard Cousins, who has been an outstanding Chief 
Executive for the past 11 years, will step down from his role on  
31 March 2018 and retire from the Group on 30 September 2018.  
It has been a huge pleasure to work with Richard, and on behalf of 
the Board I want to thank him for his extraordinary contribution to 
the Group. Richard has transformed Compass into a sustainable, 
industry-leading organisation that delivers excellent food services 
to our customers, attracts and develops great people and generates 
significant returns for shareholders.
I am delighted that Richard will be succeeded by Dominic 
Blakemore, our former Chief Operating Officer, Europe. Dominic 
became Deputy Chief Executive Officer on 1 October 2017, and 
will take over as Group Chief Executive Officer on 1 April 2018. 
In the ensuing period, he and Richard will work closely to ensure  
a smooth transition.
Dominic’s appointment was the result of a rigorous succession 
process. He is exceptionally well qualified to lead the business, and 
has already contributed significantly to the Group, for four years as 
Group Finance Director and, for the past two years, managing our 
business in Europe. Dominic has the leadership skills combined 
with the industry and operational experience to lead Compass to 
continued future success. He also benefits from the support of a 
very strong senior management team and together they will continue 
to build on the Group’s strong track record under Richard’s tenure. 
The Board looks forward to working with Dominic in his new role.
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Compass had another strong year. North America continues to 
deliver excellent growth, we are continuing to make progress in 
Europe and in Rest of World, with trends in our commodity related 
business improving.
We continue to drive operating efficiencies around the business 
which, combined with the end of the restructuring in our Offshore  
& Remote business, resulted in margin improvement of 20 basis 
points in the period.
Given our excellent cash generation and the strength of the 
business, this year we returned £1.6 billion to shareholders via 
ordinary and special dividends and share buybacks. This reflects 
our commitment to return surplus cash to shareholders whilst 
maintaining an efficient balance sheet.

STRATEGIC REPORT HOW WE CREATE VALUE
Our business model begins with organic growth, 
which we drive by sectorising and sub-sectorising 
our business. This approach differentiates us, and 
allows us to get close to our customers and create 
bespoke and innovative solutions. Organic growth 
is occasionally supplemented by small and medium 
sized acquisitions that add capability or scale in  
our existing markets.
We focus on operational execution and generate 
efficiencies by optimising our supply chain and 
diligently managing our food and labour costs. 
These efficiencies enable us to reinvest in the 
significant growth opportunities around the Group 
and to improve margins.
Our organic revenue growth, the scale it creates  
and our focus on cost and efficiencies give us a 
competitive advantage. We can provide our clients 
and consumers the best value in terms of quality 
and cost and this, combined with sectorisation, 
helps drive long term sustainable organic 
revenue growth.
At the core lie our people. Our aim is to nurture  
an engaged and highly capable workforce to win 
new business, manage our units efficiently and 
effectively, and deliver the healthiest, most 
innovative food solutions in a way that provides  
an exceptional experience to our clients  
and consumers.
OPENNESS, TRUST 
AND INTEGRITY
We set the highest ethical  
and professional standards  
at all times. We want all our 
relationships to be based on 
honesty, respect, fairness  
and a commitment to open 
dialogue and transparency.

individuality and contribution 
of all colleagues, working in 
support of each other and 
readily sharing good practice, 
in pursuit of shared goals.

15 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT HOW WE CREATE VALUE CONTINUED
Our model for creating value has remained 
unchanged for years. Its longevity is down  
to its simplicity and proven success.
We prioritise organic growth and concentrate resources on driving new 
business and retention (see MAP 1 below) and consumer sales (MAP 2). 
We focus relentlessly on costs: this includes managing the cost of food 
(MAP 3), in unit labour costs and overheads (MAP 4) and what we term 
above unit overheads (MAP 5). In large markets our size and scale enable 
us to have a lower food cost structure and to make better use of overheads. 
Efficiency and effectiveness are key to improving margins.
This focus on organic revenue growth and margins helps grow our earnings 
and cash flow. Our priorities for cash are clear and simple. We invest to 
support organic revenue growth of 4-6% and to generate further efficiencies 
to modestly improve margins. Capital expenditure tends to be 2.5-3% of 
sales. We invest in bolt-on acquisitions that add capability or scale in an 
existing market and whose returns exceed the cost of capital by year two.
Having invested to support and maintain the long term growth prospects  
of the business, we reward our shareholders with a dividend which grows 
in line with constant currency earnings. Any surplus capital that is not 
reinvested in the business we return to shareholders via share buybacks 
or special dividends to maintain net debt/EBITDA at 1.5x.
We have a community of stakeholders that includes clients, consumers, 
employees and shareholders as well as NGOs and government agencies.  
All have an interest in our success. And because their opinions and actions 
can impact our ability to execute our strategy and conduct our business, 
we engage with them, taking into account their feedback and incorporating 
it, to the extent we can, into what we do.
We use the Management and Performance (MAP) framework across the business.
MAP 1: CLIENT SALES AND MARKETING
MAP 1 is about winning new business and retaining our existing clients. We invest in sales 
and retention and are increasingly sectorising and sub-sectorising the business around the 
world to allow us to get closer to our customers. This approach allows us to develop 
bespoke offers that best meet our clients’ needs.
MAP 2: CONSUMER SALES AND MARKETING
Like for like revenue consists of both volume and price. It is heavily influenced both by the 
number of people at a client’s site and by macroeconomic conditions. We are making good 
progress with intelligent marketing programmes and training schemes as we work hard to 
attract and satisfy our customer base with strong consumer propositions.
MAP 3: COST OF FOOD
Food makes up around one third of our costs. In addition to the benefits of our scale in 
food procurement, we are able to manage food costs through careful menu planning and 
by rationalising the number of products we buy and the suppliers we buy them from.
MAP 4: IN UNIT COSTS
In unit costs are made up predominantly of labour. We focus on getting the right people 
in the right place at the right time. By using labour scheduling techniques and improving 
productivity, we are able to deliver the optimum level of service in the most efficient way.
MAP 5: ABOVE UNIT OVERHEADS
Having reduced costs considerably when MAP was first introduced in 2006 by creating 
a simpler organisational model with fewer layers of management and less bureaucracy, 
we now strive to leverage those gains by maintaining overheads low whilst we continue  
to grow revenue.

As a global business, 
we recognise the critical 
importance of engaging with 
our clients, suppliers and 
other stakeholders such as 
NGOs, to improve the positive 
contribution that we can 
make through global 
partnerships and initiatives 
that help bring about change, 
more sustainable business 
practices and scale.
We have adopted the 
United Nations SDGs as 
a helpful framework to 
encourage such multi-
stakeholder partnerships 
(SDG17) and developed 
a number of mutually 
beneficial collaborations. 
These include our 
partnership with Compassion 
in World Farming and other 
farm animal welfare bodies, 
which has brought about 
third party insights and 
expertise that have helped 
us to develop a policy and 
framework designed to 
deliver enhanced farm 
animal welfare standards 
throughout our global supply 
chain. Working together, we 
have identified opportunities 
to engage with our suppliers, 
be more ambitious in our 
sourcing commitments 
and achieve continuous 
improvement. One

our engagement with these 
partners has been a global 
commitment to source only 
cage free eggs by 2025; 
this includes shell eggs 
and liquid egg.
WHO WE CREATE VALUE FOR
INVESTORS
Open and proactive engagement is our way of 
building and maintaining relationships with the 
investment community. We aim to provide fair, 
balanced and understandable information about 
our strategy, operations, risks and opportunities. 
Within this framework we promote the links 
between sustainable operations and long term 
financial success. We engage with the investment 
community in various ways including 
presentations, one-to-one and group meetings, 
as well as site visits.
CLIENTS AND CONSUMERS
We are a B2B (business-to-business) organisation 
and our clients range from large corporations and 
hospitals to schools, universities and sports 
arenas. However, our food is consumed by the 
employees, students, patients and sports fans that 
come to our restaurants and cafés, so there is also 
a B2C (business-to-consumer) aspect to our 
business. Across this extraordinarily diverse base, 
we are conscious of the need to offer all of our 
clients ‘value’ in terms of cost, quality, health and 
wellness and innovation.
We work closely with clients and consumers  
to promote and drive a nutritional health and 
wellness agenda that suits the needs of their 
specific organisation and paves the way for 
healthier, more balanced lifestyles. We are also 
working towards the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG) 3: to ensure healthy 
lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages.
In 2010 our target was that, by 2016, 100% of 
our units would provide Balanced Choices or 
similar healthy eating programmes. We did not 
fully achieve that target, but we see year-on-year 
improvement in our performance (69% in 2017 
vs 67% in 2016) and will continue to work 
towards achieving this through 2018.
EMPLOYEES
Compass is a people-powered business. 
Our 550,000+ employees are fundamental 
to delivering high quality food and service and 
maintaining our reputation and we are proud to 
have been included in the Forbes Global 2000 
– World’s Best Employer list for 2017. 
We are committed to ensuring their safety as well 
as promoting diversity and inclusion and 
respecting human rights. We support the United 
Nations SDG Goal 5, to achieve gender equality 
and empower all women and girls, and SDG Goal 
8, to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth, full and productive employment 
and decent work for all.
All our sites work with local communities to offer 
fair employment and ensure that opportunities for 
internal promotion are open to all. We conduct 
regular employee engagement surveys that follow 
a similar format to allow comparison between 
different markets. They also include specific 
questions to allow for local and cultural priorities. 
The results of these surveys form the basis of 
tailored action plans to address the issues raised.
Women make up 55% of our global workforce 
and 28% of our global leadership team. We are 
resolved to empower all our female employees 
as we know this leads to increased productivity, 
better organisational effectiveness and high levels 
of customer satisfaction.
SUPPLIERS
Each year we spend around £6 billion on food. 
We collaborate with our partners throughout the 
entire supply chain to deliver sustainable, scalable 
and secure solutions for food and its production. 
We interact with our suppliers through one-on-one 
meetings, field and factory visits, and third party 
supplier audits, to ensure that we source our food 
and non-food products in a transparent and 
sustainable manner. 
17 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
2017 PERFORMANCE
Revenue for the Group grew by 4.0% on an organic basis. New 
business wins were 8.7% driven by strong MAP 1 (client sales and 
marketing) performance in all regions, our retention rate was 94.3% 
as a result of our ongoing focus and investment, and like for like 
revenue grew by 1.0% reflecting sensible price increases partially 
offset by weak volumes in our commodity related business. On a 
statutory basis, revenue grew by 15.1%, of which 11.3% was the 
benefit of currency translation.
Underlying operating profit increased by 5.6% on a constant 
currency basis. Operating profit margin increased by 20 basis points 
as we continue to drive efficiencies across the business using our 
Management and Performance (MAP) framework and foreign 
exchange. We also benefitted from the end of the restructuring plan 
in the Emerging Markets and Offshore & Remote last year and the 
absence of these costs this year. We have maintained our focus on 
MAP 3 (cost of food) with initiatives such as menu planning and 
supplier rationalisation, as well as continually optimising MAP 4 
(labour and in unit costs) and MAP 5 (above unit overheads). 
These efficiencies combined with modest pricing increases enabled 
us to offset inflation pressures and reinvest to support the exciting 
growth opportunities we see around the world. On a statutory basis, 
operating profit grew by 18.2%, of which 11.3% was the benefit 
of currency translation.
RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS
Returns to shareholders continue to be an integral part of our 
business model. As a result of continued strong cash flow 
generation, and limited M&A this year, we paid a special dividend  
of £1 billion (61.0 pence per share) in July and declared an annual 
dividend of 33.5 pence per share (up 5.7%). We have also bought 
back £19 million of shares. Our leverage policy remains unchanged: 
to maintain strong investment grade credit ratings, returning any 
surplus cash to shareholders to target net debt to EBITDA of 
around 1.5x.
GROUP STRATEGY
Food is our focus and our core competence. The food service 
market is estimated to be more than £200 billion; with only around 
50% of the market currently outsourced, it represents a significant 
structural growth opportunity. We believe the benefits of outsourcing 
become further apparent as economic conditions and regulatory 
changes put further pressure on organisations’ budgets. As one of 
the largest providers in all of our sectors, we are well placed to 
benefit from these trends.
Our approach to support services is low risk and incremental, 
with strategies developed on a country by country basis. Our largest 
sector in this market is Defence, Offshore & Remote, where the 
model is almost universally multi service. In addition, we have an 
excellent support services business in North America and some 
operations in other parts of the world. This is a complex segment 
and there are significant differences in client buying behaviour 
across countries, sectors and sub-sectors.
Delivering continued growth
Compass had another strong year.  
North America continues to deliver 
excellent growth, we are continuing to 
make progress in Europe and in Rest 
of World, with trends in our commodity 
related business improving.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 18 GROUP’S GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD
We have a truly international business, with operations in around 
50 countries.
North America (58% of Group revenue) is likely to remain the 
principal growth engine for the Group. We have a market leading 
business, which delivers high levels of growth by combining the cost 
advantage of our scale with a segmented client facing sector 
approach. The outsourcing culture is vibrant and the addressable 
market is significant.
The fundamentals of our businesses in Europe (26% of Group 
revenue) are good. Our investment in MAP 1 sales and retention has 
returned the region to growth and with the creation of sub-regional 
business units, we continue to see opportunities to deliver 
efficiencies and make our operations more competitive.
Rest of World (16% of Group revenue) offers excellent long term 
growth potential. Our largest markets are Australia, Japan and Brazil, 
whilst India and China have strong long term growth potential. 
Lower commodity prices and a weak macroeconomic backdrop 
have impacted our Offshore & Remote business and some of our 
emerging markets, but trends are beginning to improve. We have 
concluded a restructuring of our business to adapt to the changing 
market environment and remain excited about the attractive long 
term growth prospects of the region.
COMPASS’ COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
SECTORISED APPROACH
The global food services market is very large and disparate and we 
find that segmenting the market into various sectors and sub-sectors 
using our portfolio of B2B brands allows us to operate more 
effectively. It allows us to be closer to our clients and consumers and 
better understand their different needs. In this way, we can create 
innovative, bespoke offers that meet their requirements, and in 
doing so truly differentiate ourselves.
SCALE
As we continue to grow, our scale enables us to achieve our goal  
of being the lowest cost, most efficient provider of food and  
support services. Scale is a benefit in terms of food procurement, 
labour management and back office costs. It underpins our 
competitiveness and enables us to deliver sustainable growth  
over time.
MAP CULTURE
We use the Management and Performance (MAP) framework across 
the business. All our employees use this simple framework to drive 
performance across the Group. It helps us focus on a common set 
of business drivers, whether it is winning new business in the right 
sector on the right terms (MAP 1), increasing our consumer 
participation and spend (MAP 2), reducing our food costs (MAP 3), 
our labour costs (MAP 4) or our overhead (MAP 5).
USES OF CASH AND BALANCE SHEET PRIORITIES
The Group’s cash flow generation remains excellent and it will 
continue to be a key part of the business model. Our priorities for 
how we use our cash remain unchanged. We will continue to: 
(i) invest in the business to support organic growth where we see 
opportunities with good returns; (ii) pursue M&A opportunities; our 
preference is for small to medium sized infill acquisitions, where we 
look for returns greater than our cost of capital by the end of year 
two; (iii) grow the dividend in line with underlying constant currency 
earnings per share; and (iv) maintain strong investment grade credit 
ratings returning any surplus cash to shareholders to target net debt 
to EBITDA of around 1.5x.
2017 SUMMARY
Compass had another strong year. North America continues to 
deliver excellent growth, we are continuing to make progress in 
Europe and in Rest of World, with trends in our commodity related 
business improving.
We continue to drive operating efficiencies around the business 
which, combined with the end of the restructuring in our Offshore  
& Remote business, resulted in margin improvement of 20 basis 
points in the period.
Given our excellent cash generation and the strength of the 
business, this year we returned £1.6 billion to shareholders via 
ordinary and special dividends and share buybacks. This reflects 
our commitment to return surplus cash to shareholders whilst 
maintaining an efficient balance sheet.
2018 OUTLOOK
Our expectations for FY2018 are positive, with growth and margin 
improvement weighted to the second half. The pipeline of new 
contracts is encouraging and our focus on organic growth, 
efficiencies and cash gives us confidence in achieving another  
year of progress.
In the longer term, we remain excited about the significant  
structural growth opportunities globally and the potential for further 
revenue growth, margin improvement, as well as continued returns 
to shareholders.
Finally, I’d like to thank all my colleagues within Compass. The last 
11 years have been very rewarding. Together, we have built the 
foundations of a truly great company, and I am confident that 
Dominic will take Compass onto continued future success.

STRATEGIC REPORT North America
REGIONAL REVIEW
We have had another strong performance from our North American 
business with organic revenue growth of 7.1%. This was driven 
by good new business wins and an excellent retention rate at 96%. 
Like for like revenues were positive across the business reflecting 
modest pricing and flat volumes – with the exception of the Offshore 
& Remote sector which remains challenging. 
Solid organic growth in our Business & Industry sector was driven 
by strong new business and excellent retention. New contract wins 
include Costco as well as additional business with Qualcomm Inc. 
In the Healthcare & Seniors sector, organic revenue growth was 
driven by double digit new business and some like for like growth. 
New contract wins include Mayo Foundation, University of Cincinnati 
Health System, Cleveland Clinic and Arkansas Children’s Hospital.
Excellent retention in our Education sector has contributed to the 
delivery of solid organic revenue growth along with contract wins 
including the University of Houston and Vassar College. 
Our Sports & Leisure business had excellent retention of nearly 
100%. Increased participation at some sporting events, with the 
benefit of additional playoffs, contributed to strong organic revenue 
growth. Contract wins include the George R. Brown Convention 
Center, Vivint Smart Home Arena, home of the Utah Jazz, and 
Smith’s Ballpark, home of the Salt Lake Bees.
Offshore & Remote is small at circa 2% of revenues. It continued 
to decline in the year, with the second half of the year worsening 
due to client site closures, the impact of which will continue in 2018. 
Volume and pricing pressures also remain. However, some new 
contracts continue to be won including additional projects for Noble 
Drilling and Forbes Bros. Ltd.
Underlying operating profit of £1,082 million increased by 6.9% 
(£70 million) on a constant currency basis. The benefits generated 
by ongoing efficiency initiatives across MAPs 3 and 4, along with 
sensible price increases and leverage of the overhead base, were 
largely offset by the continued weakness in our Offshore & Remote 
business and above average labour inflation. As a result, the 
underlying operating margin for the year was unchanged.

REDUCING FOOD WASTE 
Since 2014, the Imperfectly Delicious 
Produce programme run by our US 
business has used over 4.5 million lbs 
of imperfect fruit and vegetables that 
would otherwise have rotted in fields or 
been sent to composting or landfill for 
simply not meeting an artificial standard 
of attractiveness.
21 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 Europe
REGIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Organic revenue growth for the region was 1.6% with growth 
improving as the year progressed. The performance was driven 
by good levels of new business in the UK and Turkey, partly offset 
by dull trading on the Continent, principally in France and Germany. 
Like for like revenues benefitted from some pricing but continued 
to be impacted by poor trading conditions in our North Sea oil & 
gas business.
Our improving new business performance reflects good levels of 
wins in the UK, Turkey and Iberia. New contracts include Colegios 
Mayores UCM in Spain and Oxford University in the UK. Contract 
extensions include Peugeot in France and Slovakia, Rabobank in 
the Netherlands, Premier Inn and Wimbledon both in the UK and 
Mercedes in Turkey.
Underlying operating profit grew by 1.2% (£5 million) on a constant 
currency basis. The ongoing focus on driving operational efficiencies 
and sensible pricing allowed us to support the higher levels of 
growth, and associated mobilisation costs. This was offset by lower 
volumes in the oil & gas business, and inflationary pressures, 
particularly unrecovered labour cost inflation in our UK support 
services business. As a result of our actions, we have maintained 
the underlying operating margin at 7.2%.

23 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 Rest of World
REGIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Organic revenue in our Rest of World region declined by 2.5%. 
Excluding the Offshore & Remote business, organic revenue grew 
by 3.0%. Offshore & Remote contracted by 14%, reflecting the 
continuing impact of the transition of construction contracts to 
production in Australia and continued weakness in our commodity 
related business around the region. However, the rate of decline 
has slowed in recent months and we expect this trend to continue 
into 2018. 
As expected, our Australian Offshore & Remote business saw a 
slowdown in the rate of organic revenue decline to 14% in the 
second half of the year. Contracts continue to move from their 
construction to production phase and the ongoing pressures from 
lower volumes remain, however the number of site closures have 
reduced. Similar challenges continue to be seen in our non-
Australian Offshore & Remote business, although trends are starting 
to improve. We continue to win and retain contracts at the RAPID 
site in Malaysia and Centinela in Chile. 
The non-Offshore & Remote business continues to perform 
reasonably well across the region with several countries enjoying 
double digit growth, including India, China and some of our Spanish 
speaking Latin American businesses. Although the rate of decline 
has marginally slowed, Brazil remains challenging. New business 
wins include the Calvary Bruce Public Hospital in Australia, Fiat in 
Brazil, Apple Shenzhen in China, J-Village in Japan and Mercedes 
Benz in India. We continue to retain contracts, including the 
Kagoshima University Hospital in Japan, New York University 
Abu Dhabi, Roche in China and Prodeco Food in Colombia.
Overall, underlying operating profit declined by 2.0% (£5 million) 
on a constant currency basis. The underlying margin benefitted 
more than expected from last year’s restructuring allowing for 
10 basis points of margin improvement to 6.9%.

25 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Measuring progress
We track our performance against a mix of financial and non-financial measures, 
which we believe best reflect our strategic priorities of growth, efficiency and 
shareholder returns underpinned by safe and responsible working practices.
KPI METRICS
Our strategic priorities are driven by our goal to deliver shareholder value and we use a number of financial KPIs to measure our progress. 
Growing the business and driving ongoing efficiencies are integral to our strategy. The importance of safety in everything we do is demonstrated 
by three non-financial performance indicators that we use across our global business.
STRATEGIC FINANCIAL FINANCIAL
NON-FINANCIAL
UNDERLYING 
OPERATING MARGIN
Underlying operating margin 
divides the underlying 
operating profit before share 
of profit of associates by 
the underlying revenue.
WHY WE MEASURE
The operating profit margin 
is an important measure  
of the efficiency of our 
operations in delivering 
great food and support 
services to our clients  
and consumers.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
LOST TIME INCIDENT 
FREQUENCY RATE 
Cases where one of our 
colleagues is away from 
work for one or more shifts 
as a result of a work related 
injury or illness.
WHY WE MEASURE
A reduction in lost time 
incidents is an important 
measure of the effectiveness 
of our Safety First culture.  
It also lowers rates of 
absenteeism and costs 
associated with work related 
injuries and illnesses.
ORGANIC REVENUE  
GROWTH
Organic revenue growth 
compares the underlying 
revenue delivered from 
continuing operations in the 
current year with that from 
the prior year, adjusting for 
the impact of acquisitions, 
disposals and exchange 
rate movements.
WHY WE MEASURE
Our organic revenue 
performance embodies  
our success in growing and 
retaining our customer 
base, as well as our ability to 
drive volumes in our existing 
business and maintain 
appropriate pricing levels in 
light of input cost inflation.
RETURN ON CAPITAL 
EMPLOYED (ROCE)
ROCE divides the net 
operating profit after tax 
(NOPAT) by the 12 month 
average capital employed. 
NOPAT is calculated as 
underlying operating profit 
less operating profit of 
non-controlling interests,  
net of income tax at the 
underlying rate of the year.
WHY WE MEASURE
ROCE demonstrates how  
we have delivered against 
the various investments we 
make in the business, be  
it operational expenditure, 
capital expenditure  
or infill acquisitions.

STRATEGIC REPORT BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
STATUTORY RESULTS
On a statutory basis, revenue was £22,568 million (2016: £19,605 
million), growth of 15.1%, which included 11.3% of foreign currency 
translation benefit. 
Operating profit was £1,665 million (2016: £1,409 million), an 
increase of 18.2% over the prior year, which included 11.3% of 
foreign currency translation benefit. 
Operating margin was 7.4% (2016: 7.2%).
Net finance costs were £105 million (2016: £89 million).
Profit before tax was £1,560 million (2016: £1,321 million) giving 
rise to an income tax expense of £389 million (2016: £319 million), 
equivalent to an effective tax rate of 24.9% (2016: 24.1%). 
Basic earnings per share were 71.3 pence (2016: 60.4 pence), 
an increase of 18.0%, of which 11.3% relates to foreign  
currency translation.
UNDERLYING RESULTS
Throughout this Annual Report, and consistent with prior years, 
underlying and other alternative performance measures are used to 
describe the Group’s performance. These are not recognised under 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or other generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
The Executive Board of the Group manages and assesses the 
performance of the business on these measures and believes they 
are more representative of ongoing trading, facilitate meaningful year 
on year comparisons, and hence provide more useful information to 
shareholders. All underlying measures are defined in the glossary of 
terms on page 196.
A summary of the adjustments from statutory results to underlying 
results is shown in note 32 on page 161 and further detailed in the 
consolidated income statement page 107, reconciliation of free cash 
flow page 112, note 1 segmental reporting pages 120 to 123 and 
note 33 organic revenue and organic profit page 162.
UNDERLYING REVENUE
On an organic basis, revenue increased by 4.0%. New business 
wins were 8.7% driven by a strong performance in most countries. 
Our retention rate was 94.3% as a result of our ongoing focus and 
investment. Like for like revenue growth was 1.0%, reflecting 
sensible price increases partly offset by weak volumes in our 
commodity related business.
UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT
Underlying operating profit was £1,705 million (2016: £1,445 
million), an increase of 18.0%. If we restate 2016’s profit at the 
2017 average exchange rates, it would have increased by £169 
million to £1,614 million. On a constant currency basis, underlying 
operating profit has therefore increased by £91 million, or 5.6%.
UNDERLYING OPERATING MARGIN
The underlying operating margin increased by 20 basis points as 
we continue to drive efficiencies across the business, benefitted 
from the end of the Emerging Markets and Offshore & Remote 
restructuring and foreign exchange. These efficiencies, combined 
with modest pricing increases, enabled us to offset inflation 
pressures and reinvest to support the exciting growth opportunities 
we see around the world.
UNDERLYING FINANCE COSTS
The underlying net finance cost increased to £114 million (2016: 
£101 million) as a result of sterling weakness and the additional 
interest on debt to fund the £1 billion special dividend. This equates 
to an effective interest rate of just under 3% on gross debt. For 2018, 
we expect an underlying net finance cost of around £120 million.
UNDERLYING TAX CHARGE
On an underlying basis, the tax charge was £404 million  
(2016: £330 million), equivalent to an effective tax rate of 25.4% 
(2016: 24.5%). This increase is a consequence of both the 
changing regulatory environment affecting all multinational groups 
specifically the enactment into law in the UK of the OECD BEPS 
legislation, and the impact of exchange rate movements. Our current 
expectations for the 2018 tax rate are to be around 1.0% higher 
than 2017. As previously noted, we are likely to see a continuing 
period of significant uncertainty in the international corporate 
tax environment.
UNDERLYING BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE
On a constant currency basis, the underlying basic earnings per 
share were 72.3 pence (2016: 68.4 pence), an increase of 5.7%.
DIVIDENDS
Our dividend policy is to grow the dividend in line with growth in 
underlying constant currency earnings per share.
In determining the level of dividend in any year in accordance 
with the policy, the Board also considers a number of other factors 
that influence the proposed dividend, which include but are not 
limited to:
• the level of available distributable reserves in the Parent Company;
• future cash commitments and investment needs to sustain the 
long-term growth prospects of the business;
• potential strategic opportunities; and
• the level of dividend cover.
Further surpluses, after considering the matters set out above, are 
distributed to shareholders over time by way of special dividend 
payments, share repurchases or a combination of both.
Compass Group PLC, the Parent Company of the Group, is a 
non-trading investment holding company which derives its 
distributable reserves from dividends paid by subsidiary companies. 
The level of distributable reserves in the Parent Company is reviewed 
annually and the Group aims to maintain distributable reserves that 
provide adequate cover for dividend payments. The distributable 
reserves of the Parent Company include the balance on the profit 
and loss account reserve, which at 30 September 2017 amounted 
to £1,127 million.
The Group is currently in a strong position to continue to fund its 
dividend which continues to be well covered by cash generated by 
the business. Details on the Group’s continuing viability and going 
concern can be found on page 33.
The ability of the Board to maintain its future dividend policy will 
be influenced by a number of the principal risks identified on pages 
34 to 36 that could adversely impact the performance of the Group 
although we believe we have the ability to mitigate those risks as 
outlined on pages 34 to 36. It is proposed that a final dividend of 
22.3 pence per share be paid on 26 February 2018 to shareholders 
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 30 on the register on 19 January 2018. This will result in a total 
dividend for the year of 33.5 pence per share (2016: 31.7 pence  
per share), a year on year increase of 5.7%. The dividend is 
covered 2.2 times on an underlying earnings basis and 1.8 times 
on a cash basis.
SPECIAL DIVIDEND
On 7 June 2017, shareholder approval was given at a General 
Meeting for a return of 61.0 pence per share to shareholders, which 
was equivalent to £1 billion in aggregate and was accompanied by  
a Share Capital Consolidation. The special dividend was paid on 
17 July 2017 to shareholders on the register on 26 June 2017.
PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES
During the year, the Group purchased shares for a consideration  
of £19 million (2016: £100 million).
SHAREHOLDER RETURN
The market price of the Group’s ordinary shares at the close of the 
financial year was 1,583.00 pence per share (2016: 1,495.00 
pence per share).
FREE CASH FLOW
Free cash flow totalled £974 million (2016: £899 million). In 2016, 
we made cash payments of £9 million related to the European 
exceptional programme. Adjusting for this, free cash flow on an 
underlying basis would have grown by £66 million or 7.3%. Free 
cash flow conversion was 57% (2016: 63%). Gross capital 
expenditure of £717 million (2016: £580 million), including assets 
purchased under finance leases of £2 million (2016: £2 million),  
is equivalent to 3.1% of underlying revenues (2016: 2.9% of 
underlying revenues). We continue to deliver strong returns on our 
capital expenditure across all regions. In 2018 we expect capital 
expenditure to be just over 3% of revenue, which includes an 
investment in a long term partnership with the LA Dodgers in the US.
The working capital outflow, excluding provisions and pensions, was 
£62 million (2016: £12 million inflow). In 2018 we expect a small 
underlying outflow which will be offset by a positive inflow of around 
£70 million due to the timing of our payroll run in September. This 
payroll inflow is a reversal of the outflow which occurred in 2016.
The £14 million outflow (2016: £39 million) in respect of post 
employment benefit obligations reflects the reduction in regular 
payments agreed with trustees of the UK defined benefit pension 
scheme as a result of the funding surplus following the triennial 
valuation in April 2016. We now continue to expect a total outflow 
for the Group of around £20 million per annum.
The net interest outflow was £97 million (2016: £94 million).
The underlying cash tax rate was in line with expectations at 
21% (2016: 18%).
ACQUISITION PAYMENTS
The total cash spent on acquisitions in the year, net of cash acquired, 
was £96 million (2016: £180 million), comprising £72 million of infill 
acquisitions, £1 million of acquisition transaction costs net of cash 
acquired and £23 million of contingent consideration relating to prior 
years’ acquisitions.

STRATEGIC REPORT BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
DISPOSALS
The Group received £19 million (2016: £2 million) in respect of the 
disposal of some non core businesses.
POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
The Group has continued to review and monitor its pension 
obligations throughout the period working closely with the trustees 
and members of all schemes around the Group to ensure proper 
and prudent assumptions are used and adequate provision and 
contributions are made.
The Group’s net pension surplus, calculated in accordance with  
IAS 19, for all Group defined benefit schemes was £28 million 
(2016: £21 million deficit).
The total pensions charge for defined benefit contribution schemes 
in the year was £123 million (2016: £100 million) and £20 million 
(2016: £17 million) for defined benefit schemes.
RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED
Return on capital employed was 20.3% (2016: 19.4%) based  
on net operating profit after tax at the underlying effective tax rate  
of 25.4% (2016: 24.5%). The average capital employed was  
£6,218 million (2016: £5,565 million).
On a constant currency basis, the increase in return on capital 
employed was 10 basis points.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Details of transactions with related parties are set out in note 29 of 
the consolidated financial statements. These transactions have not 
had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on the financial 
performance or position of the Group.
FINANCIAL POSITION
The ratio of net debt to market capitalisation of £25,035 million as  
at 30 September 2017 was 13.8% (2016: 12%).
Net debt increased to £3,446 million (2016: £2,874 million). 
The ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA was 1.6x, slightly above 
the target ratio due to the funding of the £1 billion special dividend. 
Our leverage policy is to maintain strong investment grade credit 
ratings, returning any surplus cash to shareholders to target net 
debt to underlying EBITDA of around 1.5x.
The Group generated £974 million of free cash flow (2016: £899 
million), including investing £683 million in net capital expenditure, 
and spent £77 million on acquisitions net of disposal proceeds. 
£347 million was paid in respect of the final dividend for the 
financial year 2016, £184 million was paid for the interim 2017 
dividend, £1,003 million in relation to the special dividend and  
£19 million returned to shareholders through share buybacks.
The remaining £84 million movement in net debt related 
predominantly to foreign currency translation.
LIQUIDITY RISK
The Group finances its borrowings from a number of sources 
including the bank, the public and the private placement markets. 
The Group has developed long term relationships with a number of 
financial counterparties with the balance sheet strength and credit 
quality to provide credit facilities as required. The Group seeks to 
avoid a concentration of debt maturities in any one period to spread 
its refinancing risk.
The maturity profile of the Group’s principal borrowings at  
30 September 2017 shows that the average period to maturity is  
5.6 years (2016: 5.0 years).
The Group’s undrawn committed bank facilities at 30 September 
2017 were £1,387 million (2016: £1,000 million).
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
The Group continues to manage its interest rate and foreign 
currency exposure in accordance with the policies set out below.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings, 
receivables and payables that are used to finance the Group’s 
operations. The Group also uses derivatives, principally interest rate 
swaps, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to 
manage interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s 
operations. The Group does not trade in financial instruments. 
The Group’s treasury policies are designed to mitigate the impact 
of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates and to manage 
the Group’s financial risks. The Board approves any changes to the 
policies. These policies have not changed in the year.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Group’s policy is to match as far as possible its principal 
projected cash flows by currency to actual or effective borrowings 
in the same currency. As currency cash flows are generated, they 
are used to service and repay debt in the same currency. Where 
necessary, to implement this policy, forward currency contracts and 
cross currency swaps are taken out which, when applied to the 
actual currency borrowings, convert these to the required currency.
The borrowings in each currency can give rise to foreign exchange 
differences on translation into sterling. Where the borrowings either 
are less than, or equate to, the net investment in overseas 
operations, these exchange rate movements are treated as 
movements on reserves and recorded in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income rather than in the income statement.
Non-sterling earnings streams are translated at the average rate  
of exchange for the year. Fluctuations in exchange rates have given, 
and will continue to give, rise to translation differences. The Group  
is only partially protected from the impact of such differences 
through the matching of cash flows to currency borrowings.
INTEREST RATE RISK
As set out above, the Group has effective borrowings in a number  
of currencies and its policy is to ensure that, in the short term, it is 
not materially exposed to fluctuations in interest rates in its principal 
currencies. The Group implements this policy either by borrowing 
fixed rate debt or by using interest rate swaps so that the interest 
rates on at least 80% of the Group’s projected debt are fixed for  
one year, reducing to 60% fixed for the second year and 40%  
fixed for the third year.
GROUP TAX POLICY
As a Group, we are committed to creating long term shareholder 
value through the responsible, sustainable and efficient delivery of 
our key business objectives. This will enable us to grow the business 
and make significant investments into the Group and its operations.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 32 We therefore adopt an approach to tax that supports this strategy 
and also balances the various interests of our stakeholders including 
shareholders, governments, employees and the communities in 
which we operate. Our aim is to pursue a principled and sustainable 
tax strategy that has strong commercial merit and is aligned with our 
business strategy. We believe this will enhance shareholder value 
whilst protecting Compass’ reputation.
In doing so, we act in compliance with the relevant local and 
international laws and disclosure requirements, and we conduct an 
open and transparent relationship with the relevant tax authorities 
that fully complies with the Group’s Code of Business Conduct and 
Code of Ethics.
In an increasingly complex international environment, a degree 
of tax risk and uncertainty is, however, inevitable. We manage and 
control these risks in a proactive manner and in doing so, exercise 
our judgement and seek appropriate advice from relevant 
professional firms. Tax risks are assessed as part of the Group’s 
formal governance process and are reviewed by the Board and 
the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Board takes a proactive approach to risk management with 
the aim of protecting its employees and customers and safeguarding 
the interests of the Group, its shareholders, employees, clients, 
consumers and all other stakeholders.
The principal risks and uncertainties that face the business and 
the activities the Group undertakes to mitigate these are set out on 
pages 34 to 36.
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Business Review, as is the financial position of the Group, 
its cash flows, liquidity position, and borrowing facilities. In addition, 
note 17 includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, 
details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with 
longer term contracts with a number of clients and suppliers across 
different geographic areas and industries. As a consequence, 
the directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the 12 months from the date of approval of this Annual 
Report. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2016, the directors have assessed the viability of the Group 
over a three year period, taking into account the Group’s current 
position and the potential impact of the principal risks documented 
on pages 34 to 36 of the Annual Report. Based on this assessment, 
the directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period to 30 September 2020.
The directors have determined that a three year period to  
30 September 2020 is an appropriate period over which to provide 
its viability statement. This is the period reviewed by the Group 
Board in our strategic planning process and is also aligned to our 
typical contract length (three to five years). We believe that this 
presents the Board and readers of the Annual Report with a 
reasonable degree of confidence over this longer term outlook.
In making this statement, the Board carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
The Board considers annually and on a rolling basis a three year, 
bottom up strategic plan. The output of this plan is used to perform 
central debt and headroom profile analysis, which includes a review 
of sensitivity to ‘business as usual’ risks, such as profit growth and 
working capital variances and severe but plausible events. It also 
considers the ability of the Group to raise finance and deploy capital. 
The results take into account the availability and likely effectiveness 
of the mitigating actions that could be taken to avoid or reduce the 
impact or occurrence of the identified underlying risks.
While the review has considered all the principal risks identified by 
the Group, the following were focused on for enhanced stress 
testing: health and safety, economic and political environment, and 
clients and consumers. The geographical and sector diversification 
of the Group’s operations helps minimise the risk of serious business 
interruption or catastrophic damage to our reputation. Furthermore, 
our business model is structured so that the Group is not reliant on 
one particular group of clients or sector. Our largest client constitutes 
only 2% of Group revenue and our top 10 clients account for less 
than 9% of Group revenue. Also, our ability to flex our cost base 
protects our viability in the face of adverse economic conditions and/
or political uncertainty.
While this review does not consider all of the risks that the Group may 
face, the directors consider that this stress testing based assessment 
of the Group’s prospects is reasonable in the circumstances of the 
inherent uncertainty involved.

STRATEGIC REPORT Identifying and managing risk
RISK MANAGEMENT
As set out in the Corporate Governance section within the Annual 
Report, the Group has policies and procedures in place to ensure 
that risks are properly identified, evaluated and managed at the 
appropriate level within the business.
The identification of risks and opportunities, the development of 
action plans to manage the risks and maximise the opportunities, 
and the continual monitoring of progress against agreed key 
performance indicators (KPIs) are integral parts of the business 
process and core activities throughout the Group.
The table on pages 35 and 36 sets out the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the business at the date of this Report. These 
have been subject to robust assessment and review. They do not 
comprise all of the risks that the Group may face and are not listed 
in any order of priority. Additional risks and uncertainties not 
presently known to management, or deemed to be less material at 
the date of this Report, may also have an adverse effect on the 
Group. These include risks resulting from the UK’s decision to leave 
the EU and the potential for US political reform which could 
adversely affect the risks noted under the ‘economic and political 
environment’ section of the table on the following pages as well as 
affecting financial risks such as liquidity and credit. The Board views 
the potential impact of Brexit as an integral part of its principal risks 
rather than a stand-alone risk. However, there is still significant 
uncertainty about the withdrawal process, its timeframe, and the 
outcome of negotiations about future arrangements between the UK 
and the EU, and the period for which existing EU laws for member 
states will continue to apply to the UK. Therefore, although the risks 
related to Brexit have been discussed by the Board, it remains too 
early to properly understand the impact on the business whilst 
negotiations continue to take place. The Board will continue to 
assess the risk to the business as the Brexit process evolves.
The Group has significant operations and a substantial employee 
base in the USA where the new administration has signalled broad 
policy changes. Some of these potential changes in policy are in 
respect of trade and tax, none of which are clear at this stage. We 
are closely monitoring developments from the new administration 
and will continue to assess the impact of any changes and the 
extent to which they will be enacted.
In accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Board has taken into consideration the principal risks 
in the context of determining whether to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting and when assessing the prospects of the 
Company for the purpose of preparing the Viability Statement. 
The Going Concern and Viability Statement can be found on 
page 33 of the Strategic Report.
The Group faces a number of operational risks on an ongoing basis 
such as litigation and financial (including liquidity and credit) risk 
and some wider risks, for example, environmental and reputational. 
Additionally, there are risks (such as those relating to the eurozone 
economy, pensions, and acquisitions and investments) which vary 
in importance depending on changing conditions. All risks disclosed 
in previous years can be found in the annual reports available on our 
website at www.compass-group.com. We recognise that these risks 
remain important to the business and they are kept under review. 
However, we have focused the disclosures on pages 35 and 36 on 
those risks that are currently considered to be more significant to 
the Group.
The Board continues to take a proactive approach to 
recognising, assessing and mitigating risk with the aim of 
protecting its employees and consumers and safeguarding 
the interests of the Company and its shareholders in the 
constantly changing environment in which it operates.
Risk Management should be read in conjunction with the 
Strategy and KPI sections.

Client and consumer sales 
and retention
2017
2016 
Our business relies on securing and retaining a 
diverse range of clients.
We have strategies which strengthen our long term 
relationships with our clients and consumers 
based on quality, value and innovation.
Our business model is structured so that we are 
not reliant on one particular sector, geography or 
group of clients.
Bidding
2017
2016 
Each year, the Group could bid for a large number 
of opportunities.
A rigorous tender review process is in place, which 
includes a critical assessment of contracts to 
identify potential risks (including social and ethical 
risks) and rewards, prior to approval at an 
appropriate level in the organisation.
Service delivery and 
contractual compliance
2017
2016 
The Group’s operating companies contract with a 
large number of clients. Failure to comply with the 
terms of these contracts, including proper delivery 
of services, could lead to loss of business.
Processes are in place to ensure that the services 
delivered to clients are of an appropriate standard 
and comply with the required contract terms and 
conditions.
Competition
2017
2016 
We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. 
The levels of concentration and outsource 
penetration vary by country and by sector. Some 
markets are relatively concentrated with two or three 
key players. Others are highly fragmented and offer 
significant opportunities for consolidation and 
penetration of the self-operated market. Aggressive 
pricing from our competitors could cause a 
reduction in our revenues and margins.
We aim to minimise this by continuing to promote 
our differentiated propositions and by focusing on 
our points of strength, such as flexibility in our cost 
base, quality and value of service and innovation.
PEOPLE
Recruitment
2017
2016 
Failure to attract and recruit people with the right 
skills at all levels could limit the success of the 
Group. The Group faces resourcing challenges in 
some of its businesses due to a lack of industry 
experience amongst candidates and appropriately 
qualified people, and the seasonal nature of some 
of our business.
The Group aims to mitigate this risk by  
efficient, time critical resource management, 
mobilisation of existing, experienced employees 
within the organisation, improved use of 
technology and through offering training  
and development programmes.
Retention and motivation
2017
2016 
Retaining and motivating the best people with the 
right skills, at all levels of the organisation, is key to 
the long term success of the Group.
The Group has established training, development, 
performance management and reward 
programmes to retain, develop and motivate  
our best people.
The Group has a well established employee 
engagement initiative, Your Voice, which helps  
us to monitor, understand and respond to our 
employees’ needs.

Increased risk Consistent risk
RISKS DESCRIPTION EXAMPLES OF MITIGATION
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT
Economy
2017
2016 
Some sectors of our business could be susceptible 
to adverse changes in economic conditions and 
employment levels.
With the variable and flexible nature of our cost 
base, it is generally possible to contain the impact 
of these adverse conditions.
Cost inflation
2017
2016 
Our objective is always to deliver the right level of 
service in the most efficient way. An increase in 
the cost of labour, for example, minimum wages in 
the USA and UK, or food, especially in countries 
such as Brazil, could constitute a risk to our ability 
to do this.
As part of our MAP framework, we seek to 
manage inflation by continuing to drive greater 
efficiencies through menu management, supplier 
rationalisation, labour scheduling and productivity. 
Cost indexation in our contracts also gives us the 
contractual right to review pricing with our clients.
Political stability
2017
2016 
We are a global business operating in countries 
and regions with diverse economic and political 
conditions. Our operations and earnings may be 
adversely affected by political or economic instability 
caused, for example, by the UK’s decision to leave 
the EU.
The Group remains vigilant to future changes 
presented by emerging markets or fledgling 
administrations and we try to anticipate and 
contribute to important changes in public policy.
COMPLIANCE AND FRAUD
Compliance and fraud
2017
2016 
Ineffective compliance management with 
increasingly complex laws and regulations, or 
evidence of fraud, could have an adverse effect  
on the Group’s reputation and could result in an 
adverse impact on the Group’s performance if 
significant financial penalties are levied or a 
criminal action is brought against the Company  
or its directors.
The Group’s zero tolerance based Codes of 
Business Conduct and Ethics continue to govern 
all aspects of our relationships with our 
stakeholders. All alleged breaches of the Codes, 
including any allegations of fraud, are investigated.
The Group’s procedures include regular operating 
reviews, underpinned by a continual focus on 
ensuring the effectiveness of internal controls.
Regulation and compliance risk is also considered 
as part of our annual business planning process.
Tax compliance
2017
2016 
As a Group, we seek to plan and manage our tax 
affairs efficiently in the jurisdictions in which we 
operate. In doing so, we act in compliance with  
the relevant laws and disclosure requirements. 
However, in an increasingly complex international 
corporate tax environment, a degree of uncertainty 
is inevitable and we note in particular the policy 
efforts being led by the EU and the OECD which 
may have a material impact on the taxation of all 
international businesses.
We manage and control these risks in a proactive 
manner and in doing so exercise our judgement 
and seek appropriate advice from reputable 
professional firms. Tax risks are assessed as part  
of the Group’s formal governance process and are 
reviewed by the Board and the Audit Committee  
on a regular basis.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
Information systems and 
technology
2017
2016 
The digital world creates many risks for a global 
business including technology failures, loss of 
confidential data and damage to brand reputation, 
through, for example, the use of social media.
We seek to assess and manage the maturity of  
our enterprise risk and security infrastructure  
and our ability to effectively defend against current 
and future cyber risks by using analysis tools and 
experienced professionals to evaluate and mitigate 
potential impacts.
The Group relies on a variety of IT systems in 
order to manage and deliver services and 
communicate with our clients, consumers, 
suppliers and employees.
We are focused on the need to maximise the 
effectiveness of our information systems and 
technology as a business enabler and to reduce 
both cost and exposure as a result.

Making a positive impact
ENGAGING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS
We continually listen to our stakeholders and regularly review our 
approach to CR to keep pace with change and maintain our position 
as a responsible business partner. We consider the issues that 
matter most to our business and stakeholders to help us inform 
our business strategy. Through this process we have identified 
key issues we believe materially impact our business and our 
relationships with stakeholders (see matrix below for highlights) 
in our journey to becoming a more sustainable business.
On pages 38 and 39 we explain how our four CR pillars address  
the most material business issues, why they matter to us and how 
they will inform our priorities and activities moving forward.
PROGRESS THIS YEAR
Each year, we participate in the key sustainability indices that focus 
on economic, environmental and social factors that are relevant to 
a company’s success. We use our participation in such indices to 
benchmark our performance within our sector and identify where 
we have an opportunity to improve our approach towards more 
sustainable business practices. Increasingly, our stakeholders, 
including clients, investors and NGOs, proactively assess the scores 
that we achieve and the progress we are making. We have 
performed well this year, including our achievement in the Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP) of a ‘Leadership’ score of A- in the Climate 
Change module.
In DJSI RobecoSAM, we scored 70% across all three dimensions 
(economic, environmental and social) which is well above the 
industry average of 39%. This now places us in both their World  
and Europe ratings. 
The Group’s strategy and approach to corporate responsibility (CR) are well 
aligned as we improve the business model to reflect more sustainable practices. 
CR is a keystone of our commitment to provide the highest quality service to 
our customers. Across the business, the safety and wellbeing of our colleagues 
and consumers is our number one operational priority and supports our growth 
strategy, increases trust and helps us attract the best talent.

REDUCING RISKS IN OUR GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN
We spend around £6 billion on our global food supply chain and 
reducing risk is important to us to ensure food security for future 
generations. This year, we have continued to develop the way in 
which we measure our impacts and assess the risk for our business 
that deforestation presents. Our progress has resulted in a marked 
performance improvement in the CDP Forests module against peer 
companies in our sector. We are therefore delighted to have been 
recognised as the ‘most improved’ business in the Forests module 
for soy. We will continue to set ourselves more ambitious targets 
and actively support the sustainable production of forest risk 
commodities through supplier engagement.
Our Company performance 
benchmarked against peer 
companies in the Hotels, 
Restaurants and Leisure 
and Tourism Services

to deforestation and are

OUR PROGRESS
• We employ 550,000+ colleagues worldwide and protecting their wellbeing is very important to us.  
Since 2014, we have achieved a 26% reduction in our Lost Time Incident Frequency Rate 
performance. This year, with a continued focus on embedding a strong safety leadership culture, 
we have achieved an improvement in our performance compared to last year, resulting in 15% 
less lost time incidents across our global business.
• Sadly, we had two work-related fatalities in our Europe business as the result of vehicle accidents.  
We conduct root cause investigations of all fatalities to identify opportunities to strengthen our 
policies and controls. The lessons learned are shared to ensure that other parts of our business 
can learn from serious events. All work-related fatalities are reported to the Executive Board and 
Group Board.

• We have extended our third party audit programme to validate that all our markets are complying 
with the requirements of our Global Food Safety Standards.
• This year, audit results identified that some of our developing markets, including South East Asia 
and Latin America, required further support to implement effective controls. We have responded 
by investing in upskilling our teams and securing additional resource to help them embed the 
required operational standards.
• Many of our businesses have implemented wellbeing programmes to encourage healthy 
behaviours amongst colleagues and consumers. These include healthy lifestyle campaigns, 
raising workplace awareness of mental health and employee assistance programmes.
• For example, we recognise that developing good eating habits in childhood sets people up for a 
lifetime of better diet. To encourage the right behaviours and habits in the younger generation, 
our Chartwells team in the UK business developed a Putting the Fun Back into Food programme. 
Since 2006, the programme has reached over half a million students. The aim is to excite 
children of all backgrounds about food and cooking to help them lead healthy lives.

UNITED NATIONS’ SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE OUR ROLE FOR EXAMPLE
 
END HUNGER, ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY 
AND IMPROVED NUTRITION AND 
PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
By 2050, the world’s population is 
expected to increase by two billion. At 
present almost 800 million of the world’s 
population are malnourished and 
starving. This means that the need to 
improve sustainable agriculture will 
become increasingly critical as the 
demand on natural resources intensifies.
 Every year, we spend around £6 billion 
on food. Collaborating with our global 
supply chain to design and deliver 
scalable and practical solutions for food 
security and sustainable agriculture is 
therefore vitally important to safeguard 
the future of our business.
 Since 2014, our Imperfectly Delicious Produce 
programme run by our US business has used over  
4.5 million lbs of imperfect fruit and vegetables that  
would otherwise have rotted in fields or been sent to 
composting or landfill for simply not meeting an artificial 
standard of attractiveness.
 
ENSURE HEALTHY LIVES AND PROMOTE 
WELLBEING FOR ALL AT ALL AGES
Nutrition is essential for sustainable 
development. Every year, poor nutrition 
kills over three million children under five, 
whilst world wide over two billion people 
are overweight or obese.
 Each year, we serve over five and a half 
billion meals. By pursuing our passion for 
wellbeing and nutrition, we are committed 
to helping our consumers and employees 
adopt a more balanced lifestyle.
 Since 2010, we have worked towards a target that 100% 
of our units will provide Balanced Choices or similar 
healthy eating programmes by 2016. This year, we have 
seen a further improvement in our performance (69% vs 
67% in 2016). Whilst we have not achieved our target this 
year, we expect to continue to make good progress during 
the coming year.
 
ACHIEVE GENDER EQUALITY AND 
EMPOWER ALL WOMEN AND GIRLS 
Women and girls around the world 
struggle to exercise their rights, face 
discrimination, legal barriers and violence 
and receive unequal pay for equal work.
 Women make up 55% of our global 
workforce and 28% of our global 
leadership team. We are resolved to 
empower all our female employees as 
we know this leads to increases in 
productivity, organisational effectiveness 
and consumer satisfaction.
 Since 2016, our UK business has run the Women in 
Food programme to tackle the shortage of female chefs. 
By 2020, we expect that 50% of the chefs in our UK 
workplace will be female. This year, 35% of the chef 
population was made up of women and we will continue 
to focus our activities to achieve our 2020 target.
 
PROMOTE SUSTAINED, INCLUSIVE AND 
SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH, 
FULL AND PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT 
AND DECENT WORK FOR ALL
The availability of decent work is a must 
for lasting, inclusive and economic 
growth, yet while the global labour force 
continues to grow, there are not enough 
jobs available, particularly amongst young 
people and indigenous communities.
 Our 550,000+ employees are 
fundamental to our great service 
and reputation. Around the world 
we are working with local communities 
to offer fair employment and great 
career opportunities.
 In Australia, we run a programme called Project 1050 to 
support the recruitment of an additional 1,050 indigenous 
jobseekers into the Compass workforce by 2019. In 2017, 
we achieved a further 339 jobseekers versus our annual 
target of 244, towards our 2019 goal.

 Globally, we are an active member of the Roundtables

18 of our top 20 countries have already established 
sustainable and ethical sourcing programmes.
 
STRENGTHEN AND REVITALISE  
THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
The SDGs set out a vision for ending 
poverty, hunger and inequality and 
protecting natural resources by 2030. 
Realising this ambition will require a step 
change in the way that the private sector, 
governments and civil society work 
together in partnership.
 As a global business, we recognise the 
critical importance of working in 
partnership with our clients, suppliers and 
other stakeholders to improve the positive 
contribution that we can make to help 
address some of the biggest issues that 
we all face in the 21
st
 century.
 We have been assessed annually by the Business 
Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare since the 
publication of its first report in 2012. We remain 
committed to continuously improving our performance  
by embedding a common framework designed to deliver 
enhanced and harmonised farm animal welfare 
standards throughout our global supply chain. We 
achieved a benchmark score of Tier 4 in 2016 and  
await results of the 2017 assessment.
WORKING TOWARDS THE SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT GOALS
In 2016, we identified through our strategic review that 
stakeholders and international clients had a growing 
interest in supporting the United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) agreed by world leaders 
in September 2015. In response to this feedback, we 
continue to consider how our business activities can help 
us to deliver our contribution towards the SDGs at a global 
and local level.
The SDGs provide a useful platform and common 
language upon which we can build new, and strengthen 
existing, global and local partnerships to progress our 
sustainability activities.
Of the 17 goals designed to help deliver the 2030 vision 
for a more sustainable planet, we have identified six where 
we believe we can make the most positive social impact. 
In addition to these issue specific goals, we recognise the 
critical importance of working in partnership, supported 
by SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).
LOOKING AHEAD TO 2018+
We will continue to engage our teams and stakeholders 
around the world to understand the issues which  
matter most and to identify opportunities to build  
stronger partnerships which address global and local 
sustainability priorities.

STRATEGIC REPORT Creating and

As a Board, we have an established 
commitment to maintain a well defined 
and effective system of governance which 
supports our corporate strategy to deliver 
sustainable organic growth.
GOVERNANCE AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Compass Group 
PLC’s annual Corporate Governance Report for the financial year 
ended 30 September 2017.
It has been another year of progress and development in the 
Company’s governance agenda. Throughout this and other parts of 
the Annual Report, we aim to provide investors and other stakeholders 
with an insight into the governance activities and ethical practices 
which have supported our corporate performance during the year.
BOARD COMPOSITION AND CHANGES
As announced on 21 September 2017, Dominic Blakemore was 
appointed Deputy Group Chief Executive from 1 October 2017. 
Following a period of transition, Dominic will succeed Richard 
Cousins as Group Chief Executive on 1 April 2018 and Richard 
will retire from the Group on 30 September 2018.
The decision to appoint Dominic as Richard’s successor was taken 
after a rigorous selection process, more detail of which can be  
found in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 65 to 67.
In February 2017, Susan Murray stepped down from the Board 
and its committees, having completed her nine year tenure as a 
non-executive director, and was succeeded by Nelson Silva as 
Chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee.
In the run up to the Company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) in 
February, votes were lodged against Mrs Vittal’s reappointment as 
a director based on concerns expressed by some shareholders that 
she was overboarding. Mrs Vittal has reviewed her portfolio and 
more details of the action she has taken to address these concerns 
can be found in the Nomination Committee Report on page 66.
SUCCESSION PLANNING AND TALENT PIPELINE
Succession planning continues to be an area of focus for the Board 
and the Nomination Committee. In the next three years, in line with 
best practice, two of our longer serving non-executive directors are 
expected to retire, each having completed their nine year tenure.  
In the coming year, we plan to undertake further work specifically 
around succession planning, to ensure we are well placed to 
maintain the extensive listed company experience brought to the 
Board by those succession directors. We will endeavour to meet 
Lord Davies’ target of having 33% female representation on the 
Board by 2020, which has been eroded by the retirement of 
Susan Murray, and will also consider Sir John Parker’s initial 
recommendations on diversity. However, we remain focused  
on ensuring that the Board comprises a majority of independent 
non-executive directors who have the capability, skills and 
experience necessary to objectively challenge executive 
management, offset by the need to ensure continuity on the  
Board. In this regard, we continue to strengthen our approach  
to talent management and succession planning at senior level, 
a subject which continues to command the Board’s full attention.
Integrity and trust in our Company’s behaviour are more 
important than ever in today’s business world. One of my 
key responsibilities as Chairman is to set the tone for the 
Company and ensure good governance and in this, I have 
been extremely well supported by the members of the 
Board. They bring balance and a wealth of skills and 
experience to our organisation which complement the 
talents of our executive team. I thank them all for their 
valuable contribution as we continue to uphold the high 
standards expected of us, to maintain oversight of the 
strategic, operational and compliance risks across the 
Group and to define our path to success.

REMUNERATION POLICY
Our current Remuneration Policy will expire next year and the 
proposed policy, which is intended to apply for the coming three 
years, will be put to shareholders for their approval at the AGM on 
8 February 2018. The proposed policy has been designed so that 
there is close alignment between executive reward and the delivery 
of our business strategy. Details of the proposed policy, the outcome 
of the shareholder consultation process that was undertaken prior 
to the proposed policy being developed and the implementation of 
the current policy during the year can be found in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 68 to 94.
CULTURE AND GOVERNANCE
Our corporate culture defines who we are, what we stand for and 
how we do business and it is integral to the success of Compass. 
Our good reputation has been built on the solid foundation of an 
ethical culture, underpinned by a well defined and effective system 
of governance. It has assisted in the creation and protection of the 
long term value of the Company and supported our ongoing 
corporate strategy to deliver sustainable organic growth.
The Board defines the purpose of the Company and identifies the 
values that guide it. We remain committed to upholding the highest 
ethical standards, operating on the principle that the tone at the top 
sets the standard for the rest of the business.
Over the years, we have carefully developed a common set of 
expected behaviours based on our corporate values and an effective 
system of governance, both of which have been influential in 
shaping and embedding a strong ethical and governance culture 
across the Group.
The Board is responsible for changes to corporate governance 
and culture. However, from a practical perspective, the executive 
directors and senior managers are responsible for implementing 
behavioural and governance changes and for clearly articulating to 
colleagues in the wider business the reasons for change, its benefits 
or the consequences of not changing.
We continuously strive to create an environment where our 
corporate values are not just words, but are put into practice, 
promoting positive and productive behaviour every day. The Group 
Chief Executive and other members of the executive management 
team take an active lead, providing encouragement and support to 
colleagues to ensure that ethical standards are maintained and good 
governance is put into practice. Key functions such as legal, finance, 
human resources and internal audit have also been empowered to 
promote, embed and integrate good standards of ethical behaviour 
and corporate governance across the Group.
The success of our business is dependent upon a strategy which 
benefits our investors, employees, clients, suppliers and the wider 
stakeholder community. We have invested time and resources in 
communicating with employees and designed training and 
development programmes to educate and encourage the high 
standards of conduct that reflect our vision to be a world-class 
provider of contract food and support services, renowned for our 
great people, great service, and great results. These efforts are 
underpinned by our Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics.
THE YEAR AHEAD
We are committed to doing things in the right way and will continue 
to strengthen our governance processes to ensure that we are 
aligned with best practice and that our approach to disclosure 
remains understandable and transparent.

INTRODUCTION TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
HOW WE GOVERN THE COMPANY
The Board leads the Group’s governance framework. It is 
responsible for setting the strategic targets for the Group, monitoring 
progress made, approving proposed actions and for ensuring that 
the appropriate internal controls are in place and that they are 
operating effectively.
The Board is assisted by four principal committees (Audit, Corporate 
Responsibility, Nomination and Remuneration), each of which is 
responsible for reviewing and dealing with matters within its own 
terms of reference.
At scheduled Board meetings, the minutes of all committee 
meetings are circulated and a summary of committee meetings 
discussed (as appropriate).
All of the non-executive directors are members of all  
principal committees.
Individual reports from each principal committee chairman  
can be found on pages 54 to 94.
The Company also has a number of executive management 
committees (Disclosure, Executive Board and General Business). 
These have been established in order to consider various issues  
and matters for recommendation to the Board and its principal 
committees or to deal with day to day matters within the authority 
granted by the Board.
This Directors’ Report also contains information required to be 
disclosed under the UKLA’s Rules and under the Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules (DGTR). To the extent necessary, 
certain information is incorporated into this Report by reference.

controls, which are described in more detail over the following pages.

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE
* As at 30 September 2017.
45 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
GOVERNANCE The Board manages the business of the Company and may, 
subject to the Articles of Association and applicable legislation, 
borrow money, guarantee, indemnify, mortgage or charge the 
business, property and assets (present and future), issue 
debentures and other securities and give security, whether 
outright or as a collateral security, for any debt, liability or 
obligation of the Company or of any third party.
The Board sets the Group’s values and standards and ensures 
that it acts ethically and that its obligations to its shareholders 
are understood and met.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision as follows:
• strategy and management
• Board membership and other appointments
• financial reporting and controls
• internal controls
• contracts
• capital structure
• communication
• remuneration 
• delegation of authority
• corporate governance matters
• other matters
For example, the Board must approve any changes to the Group’s 
capital structure, operating and expenditure budgets, significant 
capital investment or any new significant client contract.
However, the Board’s primary role remains to provide 
entrepreneurial leadership and to review the overall strategic 
development of the Group as a whole.
The Board has delegated day to day operational decisions to the 
Executive Board. The Executive Board is supported by country and 
regional management teams who are responsible for achieving 
agreed targets, maintaining budgetary controls and implementing 
policies and controls at country and business unit level.
The work of the Board and its committees is described in the 
following pages. In this section of the Governance Report, we  
have also set out our governance structures and processes, how  
we have applied the main principles and complied with the relevant 
provisions of the Code. Activities which provide a flavour of the work 
undertaken by the Board and its committees during the year have 
been highlighted.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
As at 30 September 2017, and as at the date of this Report,  
the Board of Directors was made up of 11 members, comprising  
the non-executive Chairman, four executive directors and six 
non-executive directors.
The roles of Chairman and Group Chief Executive are separate and 
clearly defined, with the division of responsibilities set out in writing 
and agreed by the Board.
All of the non-executive directors are considered by the Board  
(and by the definition contained in the Code) to be independent 
of management and free of any relationship which could materially 
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. The 
Board considers that each of the non-executive directors brings  
their own senior level of experience, gained in each of their own 
fields, predominantly in international operations.
The Company’s policy relating to the terms of appointment and  
the remuneration of both executive and non-executive directors 
is detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, which is on 
pages 68 to 94.

to attend.
2. Stepped down from the Board and its committees at the conclusion of the 
Company’s AGM on 2 February 2017.
If a director is unable to attend a Board or committee meeting, the 
Chairman of the Board and/or committee chairman are informed 
and the absent director is encouraged to communicate comments 
and opinions on the matters to be considered. Each director also 
attends the AGM to answer shareholder questions.
Board activities are structured to help the Board achieve its goals and 
to provide support and advice to the executive management team on 
the delivery of Group strategy within a robust governance framework.
Throughout the year, the Board received presentations from 
colleagues from across the Group and regularly reviewed the 
periodic financial results, market consensus, competitor updates, 
merger and acquisition opportunities, capital expenditure and other 
matters. We have set out some highlights from the Board’s calendar 
during 2016-2017 below.
Meetings between the non-executive directors, both with and without 
the presence of the Group Chief Executive, are scheduled  
in the Board’s annual programme. During the year, non-executive 
directors met on several occasions without the presence of executives. 
These meetings were encouraged by the Chairman and provide the 
non-executive directors with a forum in which to share experiences 
and to discuss wider business topics, fostering debate in Board and 
committee meetings and strengthening working relationships.

In addition to routine financial and operating reports and updates 
(including health and safety) the Board spends time debating and 
formulating Group strategy, its performance and review.
Each year, the Board aims to hold two meetings at Group locations. 
By going out into the business, the directors are able to meet with a 
diverse group of colleagues on a more informal basis which greatly 
assists in the succession planning process. These visits provide an 
opportunity to assess local management performance and potential, 
to gain further insight into how the business works on a day to day 
basis and to speak first hand to local management and listen to 
their views.
The format of visits often comprises a macroeconomic overview  
of the country; its social and political systems; challenges and 
opportunities; a review of the competitive landscape; and a detailed 
review of the relevant business sectors in which the business 
operates, its people, as well as the three year plan.
The Board has established a procedure for directors, if deemed 
necessary, to take independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense in the furtherance of their duties. Every director 
also has access to the Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, who is charged with ensuring that Board procedures are 
followed and that good corporate governance and compliance are 
implemented throughout the Group. Together with the Group Chief 
Executive and the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, 
the Chairman ensures that the Board is kept properly informed 
and is consulted on all issues reserved to it. Board papers and other 
information are distributed in a timely fashion to allow directors to 
be properly briefed in advance of meetings. In accordance with the 
Company’s Articles of Association, directors have been granted an 
indemnity issued by the Company to the extent permitted by law in 
respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office. The indemnity 
would not provide any coverage where a director is proved to have 
acted fraudulently or dishonestly. The Company has also arranged 
appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal action against its 
directors and officers.
In accordance with best practice, the Chairman addresses the 
developmental needs of the Board as a whole, with a view to further 
developing its effectiveness as a team, and ensures that each 
director refreshes and updates his or her individual skills, knowledge 
and expertise.
A formal, comprehensive and tailored induction is given to all 
non-executive directors following their appointment, including 
access to external training courses, visits to key locations within 
the Group and meetings with members of the Executive Board and 
other key senior executives. The induction also covers a review of 
the Group’s governance policies, structures and business, including 
details of the risks and operating issues facing the Group.
51 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
GOVERNANCE The Board would like to thank all those shareholders who took time 
to attend shareholder meetings during the year. The Notice of 
Meeting for the 2018 AGM, which is due to be held on Thursday 
8 February 2018 at Twickenham Stadium, can be found on pages 
185 to 194. We look forward to seeing you there.
BOARD EFFECTIVENESS
The Chairman is responsible, with assistance from the Nomination 
Committee, for ensuring that the Company has an effective Board 
with a suitable range of skills, expertise and experience. Every year, 
a performance evaluation of the Board and its committees is carried 
out to ensure that they continue to be effective, that each of the 
directors demonstrates commitment to his or her respective role and 
has sufficient time to meet his or her commitment to the Company.
An independent external evaluation was conducted by 
EquityCommunications Limited (ECL) in May 2016 in line with  
the mandated triennial external requirement set out in the Code. 
This was the second occasion on which ECL had conducted an 
independent, externally facilitated Board evaluation.
The 2016 evaluation undertaken by ECL took the form of one-on-one 
interviews with all members of the Board and the Group General 
Counsel and Company Secretary. It covered questions about Board 
administration, strategy and operations, Board composition, 
committee structure and succession planning. ECL’s report on 
the outcome of the evaluation was presented to the Board at its 
September 2016 meeting and was summarised in the 2016 Annual 
Report and Accounts.
This year, an internal performance evaluation was conducted by the 
Chairman and the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary,  
taking into account the principal themes which had emerged  
from the preceding external evaluation, notably, the increasing 
contribution of the newer non-executive directors to utilise their  
skill sets for the greater benefit of the Group.
Succession planning is a matter for the whole Board, rather than for 
a committee. The Company’s Articles of Association provide that one 
third of the directors retire by rotation each year and that each 
director will seek re-election at the AGM every three years. However, 
in accordance with the Code, all directors submit themselves for 
annual re-election by shareholders. New directors may be appointed 
by the Board, but are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
opportunity after their appointment. The Articles of Association limit 
the number of directors to not less than two and not more than 20, 
save where shareholders decide otherwise. Non-executive directors 
are normally appointed for an initial term of three years, which is 
reviewed and may be extended by two further three year terms. It is 
Board policy that non-executive director appointments should last 
for no more than nine years.
Don Robert acts as the SID. His role includes providing a sounding 
board for the Chairman and acting as an intermediary for the 
non-executive directors, where necessary. The Board believes that 
Don has the appropriate experience, knowledge and independence 
to continue in this role.
There were a number of changes made to the composition of the 
Board during the year. On 21 September 2017, we announced that 
Dominic Blakemore would become Deputy Group Chief Executive 
with effect from 1 October 2017. Dominic will succeed Richard 
Cousins as Group Chief Executive on 1 April 2018 and Richard will 
retire from the Group on 30 September of the same year.
On 2 February 2017, Susan Murray retired from the Board having 
completed her nine year tenure as a non-executive director and was 
succeeded as Chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee 
by Nelson Silva.
MAINTAINING A DIALOGUE WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Chairman ensures that the Board maintains an appropriate 
dialogue with shareholders. The Group Chief Executive, Group 
Finance Director and the Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs 
Director regularly meet with institutional investors to discuss strategic 
issues and to make presentations on the Company’s results.
As well as full and half year results and quarterly trading updates, 
the Company publishes Regulatory News Service announcements 
through the London Stock Exchange and runs an active investor 
relations engagement programme.
The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary also acts as an 
important focal point for communications on corporate governance 
matters throughout the year, but with a particular intensity leading 
up to, during and after shareholder meetings.
The Company’s website provides an excellent means of 
communicating with and receiving communications from 
shareholders, potential investors and the wider stakeholder 
community. The website contains an archive of information on  
the Company’s history, leadership, governance, policies, financial 
results, dividend history and up to date share price information.
Although the non-executive directors are not formally required  
to meet the shareholders of the Company, their attendance at 
presentations of the interim and annual results is encouraged.
GOVERNANCE AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
All of our shareholders are invited to attend our AGM which provides 
a forum in which shareholders can put questions to the Board and 
the committee chairmen. It also provides shareholders with an 
opportunity to meet with directors on a more informal basis after  
the meeting.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 52 COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD
As noted on page 44, the Board has established a number of 
committees to assist in the discharge of its duties.
The formal terms of reference for the principal committees, 
approved by the Board and complying with the Code, are available 
from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary and can 
also be found at www.compass-group.com. Terms of reference are 
reviewed annually by their respective committees and updated when 
necessary to reflect changes in legislation or best practice.
Directors who are not members of individual Board committees may 
be invited to attend one or more meetings of those committees 
during the year.
The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary acts as 
Secretary to all Board committees. The chairmen of each of the 
principal committees attend the AGM to respond to any shareholder 
questions that might be raised on a committee’s activities.
In addition to the principal committees, the Board has established 
the following committees:
DISCLOSURE COMMITTEE
The Disclosure Committee ensures the accuracy and timeliness 
of public announcements of the Company and monitors the 
Company’s obligations under the UKLA Rules and the DGTR.
Meetings are held as required. At the date of this Report, the 
Disclosure Committee comprises Johnny Thomson, Group Finance 
Director; Mark White, Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary; the Group Financial Controller; the Director of Group 
Internal Audit; the Group Director of Strategy and the Investor 
Relations and Corporate Affairs Director.
EXECUTIVE BOARD
The Executive Board is the key management committee for the 
Group and, at the date of this Report, comprises the executive 
directors of the Company and Robin Mills (Group HR Director); 
Sandra Moura (Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs Director); 
Alfredo Ruiz Plaza (Regional Managing Director, Latin America); 
Mark van Dyck (Regional Managing Director, Asia Pacific); and 
Mark White (Group General Counsel and Company Secretary).
The Executive Board meets regularly and is responsible for 
developing the Group’s strategy, capital expenditure and investment 
budgets. It reports on these areas to the Board for approval, 
implementing Group policy, monitoring health and safety, financial, 
operational and customer quality of service performance, 
purchasing and supply chain issues, succession planning  
and day to day management of the Group.
GENERAL BUSINESS COMMITTEE
The General Business Committee comprises all of the executive 
directors and meets as required to conduct the Company’s 
business within clearly defined limits delegated by the Board 
and subject to those matters reserved to the Board.
AUDIT COMMITTEE PAGE 54
 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY COMMITTEE PAGE 62
 
NOMINATION COMMITTEE PAGE 65
 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE PAGE 68
The recruitment of future non-executive directors and their need for 
PLC experience was also considered to be important with a view to 
replenishing the extensive PLC experience that will be lost in the 
medium term as non-executive directors reach their nine year 
maximum tenures. The 2016 Report noted that the then prospective 
retirement of Susan Murray would present a challenge as it would 
mean that the Company was some way short of achieving the latest 
voluntary target set by Lord Davies to have 33% female 
representation on the Board by 2020 and this would need to be 
given close consideration when recruiting a new director. Prior to 
making an appointment, the Nomination Committee evaluates the 
balance of skills, knowledge, independence, experience and 
diversity on the Board and, in light of this evaluation, will prepare a 
description of the role and capabilities required, with a view to 
making a recommendation to the Board of the best placed individual 
for the role. However, the Board and the Nomination Committee will 
take the 2020 target set by Lord Davies, as well as Sir John Parker’s 
initial recommendations on diversity, into consideration when 
recruiting future directors.
It is the view of the Board that each of the non-executive directors 
brings considerable management expertise and an independent 
perspective to the Board’s deliberations and that they are considered 
to be independent of management and free from any relationship  
or circumstance that could affect, or appear to affect, the exercise  
of their independent judgement. Overall, the Board considered the 
performance of each director to be effective and concluded that 
both the Board and its committees continue to provide effective 
leadership and exert the required levels of governance and control. 
The Board will continue to review its procedures, effectiveness and 
development in the year ahead.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
As part of their ongoing development, the executive directors may seek 
one external non-executive role on a non-competitor board, for which 
they may retain the remuneration in respect of the appointment. In 
order to avoid any conflict of interest, all appointments are subject to 
Board approval and the Board monitors the extent of directors’ other 
interests and the time commitment required to fulfil those interests to 
ensure that its effectiveness is not compromised.
Each director has a duty under the CA 2006 to avoid a situation in 
which he or she has or can have a direct or indirect interest that 
conflicts or possibly may conflict with the interests of the Company. 
This duty is in addition to the obligation that he or she owes to the 
Company to disclose to the Board an interest in any transaction or 
arrangement under consideration by the Company. The Company’s 
Articles of Association authorise the directors to approve such 
situations and to include other provisions to allow conflicts of interest 
to be dealt with. The Board follows an established procedure when 
deciding whether to authorise an actual or potential conflict of 
interest. Only independent directors (i.e. those who have no interest 
in the matter under consideration) will be able to make the relevant 
decision and, in making the decision, the directors must act in good 
faith and in a way they consider will be most likely to promote the 
Company’s success. Furthermore, the directors may, if appropriate, 
impose limits or conditions when granting authorisation.
Any authorities are reviewed at least every 15 months. The Board 
considered and authorised each director’s reported actual and 
potential conflicts of interest at its July 2017 Board meeting and 
considers any changes on an ad hoc basis throughout the year.
53 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
GOVERNANCE DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Audit Committee’s 
Report for the financial year ended 30 September 2017. In the 
pages which follow we give an insight into the activities and workings 
of the Committee during the year.
AREAS OF FOCUS
As in previous years, our primary focus has been centred on key 
issues related to the Group’s financial reporting, such as accounting 
judgements, internal control activities, compliance matters and the 
ongoing quality of related disclosures. We have also covered other 
important areas, such as a review of the Company’s Viability and 
Going Concern Statements, and performed the related financial 
stress testing in order to meet the requirements of the Code.
NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING INFORMATION
Earlier this year, the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive was 
implemented into English law as the Companies, Partnerships and 
Groups (Accounts and Non-Financial Reporting) Regulations 2016. 
The Directive requires companies with financial years beginning  
on or after 1 January 2017 to disclose non-financial information 
necessary to provide investors and other stakeholders with a better 
understanding of a company’s development, performance and 
position and impact of its activity. The Committee was able to offer 
advice to the Board on the reporting requirements of the Directive 
and will ensure that the Company is compliant with the Directive  
and includes the necessary disclosures in the 2018 Annual Report.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
Mr Sykes has been the key senior audit engagement partner since 
KPMG LLP (KPMG) was appointed as the Company’s external 
auditor in 2014 and will therefore rotate off the Company’s audit 
after the completion of the external audit of the Company’s financial 
statements for the year ending 30 September 2018. To ensure  
a seamless transition, the Committee will oversee the succession 
from Mr Sykes as part of the audit process for the year ending 
30 September 2018.
The external auditor timeline can be found on page 59.
Overseeing 
rigorous  
and effective 
controls
The Board recognises that a prudent 
and robust approach to risk mitigation 
must be carefully balanced with a degree 
of flexibility so that the entrepreneurial 
spirit which has greatly contributed to the 
success of your Company is not inhibited.
GOVERNANCE AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
As part of our internal audit process, we continue to 
increase the use of technology to perform analysis in large 
populations of data and embed analytics in every phase  
of the audit process.
We are using analytics to select samples, ask the right 
questions, identify exceptions and share with management 
those analyses that can help them to monitor and provide 
insights to our business.
During the year, audits were conducted by the external 
auditor covering businesses which generated 96% of the 
Group’s annual revenue for 2016-2017.
As Chairman of the Audit Committee and as a fellow 
shareholder, I am pleased to report that the external 
auditor has issued an unmodified audit opinion.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 54 RISK APPETITE, PRINCIPAL OPERATIONAL RISKS  
AND RISK ASSURANCE
The Board’s attitude to and appetite for risk are communicated to 
the Group’s businesses through the strategy planning process. In 
determining its risk appetite, the Board recognises that a prudent 
and robust approach to risk mitigation must be carefully balanced 
with a degree of flexibility so that the entrepreneurial spirit which has 
greatly contributed to the success of the Company is not inhibited. 
The Committee and the Board remain satisfied that the Company’s 
internal risk control framework continues to provide the necessary 
element of flexibility without compromising the integrity of risk 
management and internal control systems.
We continue to develop and grow our business but, of course, in 
some of the territories where we operate, the concept of corporate 
governance is still underdeveloped. In these regions in particular,  
it is important to have a clear, well-established system of risk 
management and internal control to ensure that growth is 
underpinned by solid business practice. In this regard, we have 
continued to strengthen our Regional Governance Committees 
(RGCs) with the aim of further embedding the Group’s risk 
management culture within the business.
In 2016, the Board established a Group Risk Management 
Committee (RMC) to assist the Audit Committee with its work.  
RMC membership comprises a multi-disciplinary team of key 
individuals who are involved with the day to day governance of  
the Group. The Chairman of the Committee is the Group Finance 
Director and the membership comprises the Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, the Director of Group Internal Audit, the 
Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs Director, the Group HR 
Director and the Group Director of Strategy. The Committee is 
satisfied that the work being performed by the RMC, in conjunction 
with the efforts of their colleagues in the Group’s RGCs, further 
embeds the Group’s risk management culture within the business. 
It also provides an additional layer of oversight to help underpin the 
assurances given by the Committee to the Board in connection with 
the appropriateness of the Group’s financial reporting; the 
effectiveness of the internal and external audit functions; the 
management of the Group’s systems of internal control and business 
risks; and related compliance activities.
The Committee had oversight of a robust annual review and 
assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties of the Group. 
The review was conducted internally by a multi-disciplinary team. 
The purpose of the review was to determine in the context of the 
macroenvironment and Group strategy: (i) if the principal risks and 
uncertainties disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report applied to the 
current financial year; (ii) if yes, whether there had been any year 
on year variance to the status of each risk; (iii) if no, what should 
be taken out/included?
As set out in the Principal Risks section on pages 34 to 36, last 
year’s risks continue to be pertinent, albeit that our perception of 
how these risks have, as appropriate, remained static, increased 
or diminished may have changed.
The Committee continues to monitor the potential impact of the 
UK’s decision to leave the EU. However, while there is still significant 
uncertainty about the withdrawal process, its timeframe and the 
outcome of negotiations about future arrangements between the UK 
and the EU, it is still too early to properly understand the impact on 
the business. We are also closely monitoring the political landscape 
in the USA where the Group has a significant operational presence. 
The new administration has signalled its intention to make broad 
policy changes, some of which are in respect of trade and tax, and 
we will continue to assess the impact of any changes and the extent 
to which they are passed.
FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE
The Code provides that through its financial reporting, the Board 
should provide a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of 
the Company’s prospects. At the Board’s request, the Committee has 
reviewed the 2017 Annual Report to determine whether it considered 
that the document, taken as a whole, meets this standard and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy. 
The Committee has concluded that this requirement has been met.
On pages 26 and 27 and throughout this Report, we track our 
performance against a mix of financial and non-financial KPIs, which 
the Board and executive management consider best reflect our 
strategic priorities. The Committee has considered these KPIs and 
is satisfied that the information that has been selected by the Board 
and the executive management will help to convey an understanding 
of the culture of the business and the drivers which contribute to its 
ongoing success and will be of interest to stakeholders.
THE YEAR AHEAD
The Committee continues to play a key role within the governance 
framework and, in the year ahead, the Committee will continue  
to monitor the ongoing status and progress of action plans against 
key risks on a regular basis; review its activities in the light of 
regulatory and best practice developments; and report its  
findings to the Board.

was eligible to attend.
2. Stepped down from the Board and its committees at the conclusion of the 
Company’s AGM on 2 February 2017.
The Audit Committee invites Paul Walsh, Chairman; Richard 
Cousins, Group Chief Executive; Johnny Thomson, Group Finance 
Director; the Group Financial Controller; and the Director of Group 
Internal Audit, together with senior representatives of the external 
auditor, to attend each meeting although, periodically, it reserves 
time for discussions without invitees being present. Other senior 
management are invited to present such reports as are required 
for the Audit Committee to discharge its duties.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee keeps in touch with key 
individuals involved with the Company’s governance, including the 
Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, the Group General 
Counsel and Company Secretary, the Director of Group Internal Audit 
and the external auditor’s lead engagement partner, and attends the 
AGM to respond to any shareholder questions that might be raised 
concerning its activities. The remuneration of the members of the 
Audit Committee and the policy with regard to the remuneration 
of the non-executive directors are set out on pages 83 and 93.
OBJECTIVES
The Audit Committee’s key objectives are the provision of effective 
governance over the appropriateness of the Group’s financial 
reporting, including the adequacy of related disclosures, the 
performance of both the internal and external audit functions,  
and the management of the Group’s systems of internal control, 
business risks and related compliance activities.
ACTIVITY DURING THE YEAR
The key matters reviewed and evaluated by the Audit Committee 
during the year are set out below:
Financial reporting
• the appropriateness of the interim and annual financial 
statements (including the announcements thereof to the London 
Stock Exchange) with both management and the external auditor, 
including:
 – at the Board’s request, whether the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy
 – the clarity of disclosures and compliance with financial 
reporting standards and relevant financial and governance 
reporting requirements and guidelines, including the European 
Securities and Markets Authority Guidelines on Alternative 
Performance Measures which have applied to all publications 
of regulated information since 3 July 2016
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
COMPOSITION
The Audit Committee comprises John Bason, Chairman, and all  
of the non-executive directors in office at the date of this Report. 
Members of the Audit Committee are appointed by the Board 
following recommendation by the Nomination Committee. The Audit 
Committee’s membership is reviewed by the Nomination Committee 
and is assessed in the context of the range of skills, knowledge and 
experience required by the Code and also as part of the annual 
Board performance evaluation.
The members of the Audit Committee have been chosen to provide 
the wide range of financial and commercial experience needed to 
undertake its duties and each member of the Audit Committee 
brings an appropriate balance of senior level financial and 
commercial experience in multinational and/or complex 
organisations, combined with a sound understanding of the 
Company’s business, and is therefore considered by the Board 
to be  competent in the Company’s sector. The expertise and 
experience of the members of the Audit Committee are summarised 
on pages 48 and 49. The Board considers that each member of the 
Audit Committee is independent within the definition set out in the  
Code and is capable of assessing the work of management and the 
assurances provided by the internal and external audit functions. 
The Audit Committee’s Chairman, John Bason, is the Finance 
Director of Associated British Foods plc and is therefore considered 
by the Board to have significant, recent and relevant financial 
experience and to be competent in auditing and accounting.
All members of the Audit Committee receive an appropriate 
induction, covering the role and remit of the Committee and an 
overview of the business, its financial dynamics and its risks and, 
where appropriate, meetings with key individuals. Audit Committee 
members are expected to have an understanding of the principles 
of, and recent developments in, financial reporting, including the 
applicable accounting standards and statements of recommended 
practice, key aspects of the Company’s policies, financing, internal 
control mechanisms, and matters that require the use of judgement 
in the presentation of accounts and key figures as well as the role of 
internal and external auditors. Members of the Audit Committee 
undertake ongoing training as required.
The Audit Committee meets throughout the year and its agenda is 
linked to events in the Company’s financial calendar. Each member 
of the Audit Committee may require reports on matters of interest in 
addition to the regular items. The Audit Committee met three times 
during the year with an appropriate interval between each of the 
meetings to ensure that work arising from Committee meetings 
could be carried out and reported back to the Board, as appropriate. 
Members’ attendance at the meetings is set out in the table.
GOVERNANCE AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 56  – discussing the critical accounting policies and use of 
assumptions and estimates, as noted in section B of the 
accounting policies on pages 113 and 114 of this Annual 
Report, and concluding that the estimates, judgements and 
assumptions used were reasonable based on the information 
available and had been used appropriately in applying the 
Company’s accounting policies. This included, for example, 
the consideration of any goodwill impairment assessments 
and how these were addressed
• the material areas in which significant judgements have been 
applied, namely:
 – considering the nature and quantum of the purchasing income 
earned by the Group during the financial year. It also assessed 
the extent to which the amounts recognised required estimation 
and reviewed the recoverability of amounts accrued at the year 
end with reference to aged analyses and subsequent cash 
receipts. Nothing arose during the course of this review to 
indicate that anything but limited judgement was required,  
or that purchasing income had not been accounted for in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policies
 – the level of provisioning for liabilities (including tax) where 
management, accounting and legal judgements are important. 
The Committee discussed with management the key 
judgements made, in particular, the policy efforts being led by 
the EU and OECD which may have a material impact on the 
taxation of all international businesses, including relevant legal 
advice. The external auditor also reports on all material 
provisions to the Committee

GOVERNANCE EXTERNAL AUDIT
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Company’s policy on external 
audit. The Committee reserves oversight responsibility for monitoring 
the auditor’s independence, objectivity and compliance with ethical, 
professional and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee is 
responsible for the retendering selection process and recommends 
the appointment, reappointment and removal of the Company’s 
external auditor, and considers the risks associated with its 
withdrawal from the market in its risk evaluation and planning. 
The Audit Committee also reviews and sets the terms, areas of 
responsibility and scope of the audit as set out in the external 
auditor’s engagement letter; the overall work plan for the 
forthcoming year, together with the associated fee proposal and cost 
effectiveness of the audit; the external auditor’s independence; any 
major issues which arise during the course of the audit and their 
resolution; key accounting and audit judgements; the level of errors 
identified during the audit; the recommendations made to 
management by the auditor and management’s response; and the 
auditor’s overall performance.
The Company operates a policy on non-audit fees which it reviews 
annually and discloses the ratio of audit to non-audit fees paid in 
each financial year.
The Audit Committee monitors the extent of non-audit work which 
the external auditor can perform, to ensure that the provision of 
those non-audit services that can be undertaken by the external 
auditor falls within the agreed policy and does not impair its 
objectivity or independence. Following the change of external auditor 
in 2014, the Committee agreed that Deloitte LLP should continue to 
provide tax services to the Group and has amended its policy on the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditor accordingly, 
to exclude such services. Therefore, the external auditor should be 
excluded from providing the Company with general consultancy and 
all other non-audit services, unless there is no other competent and 
available provider. Engagements for non-audit services that are not 
prohibited are subject to formal approval by the Audit Committee 
based on the level of fees involved. Non-audit services that are 
pre-approved are either routine in nature with a fee that is not 
significant in the context of the audit or are audit related services.
Within the constraints of applicable UK rules, the external auditor 
has traditionally undertaken some due diligence reviews and other 
pieces of non-audit work. The provision of non-audit services within 
such constraints and the agreed policy is assessed on a case by 
case basis so that the best placed advisor is retained. Principal 
non-audit services provided by KPMG and approved by the Audit 
Committee during the year ended 30 September 2017 primarily 
comprised assistance on audit related services.
GOVERNANCE AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
FRC REVIEW OF THE ANNUAL REPORT 
AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 
30 SEPTEMBER 2016
During the year, the Group received a letter from the FRC 
confirming that the Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 
2016 had been subject to review by its Conduct Committee, which 
is responsible for reviewing and investigating the annual accounts, 
directors’ and strategic reports of UK public companies. The only 
substantive question included in this enquiry was a request for the 
Company to provide further details supporting the recognition of the 
accounting surplus of the UK defined benefit pension scheme (see 
note 20). As a result of the FRC’s enquiry, we committed to 
providing additional disclosures on the nature of the UK defined 
benefit pension scheme's accounting surplus and the rationale for 
its recognition (see page 118). The FRC’s enquiry closed with no 
further questions. 
The FRC noted that its role was not to verify information, but to 
consider compliance with reporting requirements, and it did not 
take responsibility for reliance on its letter by any party.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
KPMG has been the Company’s auditor since 2014. In line with 
applicable legislation and best practice, no one can act as an 
engagement partner for a listed company for more than five years 
and, thereafter, there has to be a five year gap before the same 
individual can undertake that role in the Company. As noted on 
page 54, Mr Sykes will cease to be the senior audit engagement 
partner on completion of the audit of the Company’s financial 
statements for the year ending 30 September 2018 and the 
Committee will oversee the transition to Mr Sykes’ successor.
To ensure objectivity, key members of the audit team rotate off the 
Company’s audit. To safeguard the independence of the Company’s 
external auditor and the integrity of the audit process, the recruitment 
of senior employees from the Company’s auditor is not permitted for 
a period of at least two years after they cease to be involved in the 
provision of services to the Company.
The Company is required to tender its auditors every 10 years and 
the Committee currently intends to tender its auditors sometime in 
2023-2024 with a view to the chosen firm being appointed in 2024.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 58 During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed KPMG’s fees for 
its services performed to 30 September 2017, its effectiveness and 
whether the agreed audit plan had been fulfilled and the reasons for 
any variation from the plan. The review included a formal evaluation 
process involving the use of questionnaires completed by finance 
teams around the Group.
The Audit Committee also considered the robustness of the 2017 
audit, the degree to which KPMG was able to assess key accounting, 
and audit judgements and the content of the management letter 
issued by the external auditor. The Audit Committee concluded that 
both the audit and the audit process were effective.
The total fees paid to KPMG in the year ended 30 September 2017 
were £5.2 million of which £0.3 million related to non-audit work 
(2016: £5.1 million of which £0.7 million related to non-audit work). 
Further disclosure of the non-audit fees paid during the year can be 
found in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements on page 124.
FRC AUDIT QUALITY REVIEW
During the year, the 2016 external audit of the Group by KPMG was 
reviewed by the FRC’s Audit Quality Review team (AQR). The AQR 
routinely monitors the quality of audit work of certain UK audit firms 
through inspections of sample audits and related procedures at 
individual audit firms. The Committee and KPMG have discussed 
the review findings, which were incorporated into the 2017 audit 
work. The Committee does not consider any of the findings to have 
had a significant impact on KPMG’s audit approach.
REAPPOINTMENT OF AUDITOR
There are no contractual restrictions on the Company’s choice of 
external auditor and in making its recommendation to shareholders 
on the reappointment of KPMG, the Committee took into account, 
amongst other matters, the tenure, objectivity and independence  
of KPMG and its continuing effectiveness and cost as well as the 
availability of firms within the wider audit market. KPMG has 
expressed its willingness to continue as auditor of the Company. 
Separate resolutions proposing KPMG’s reappointment and 
determination of its remuneration by the Audit Committee will 
be proposed at the 2018 AGM.

EXTERNAL AUDITOR TIMELINE
59 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
GOVERNANCE This is underpinned by the annual evaluation of the Board and  
its committees. More details of this year’s review can be found  
on pages 52 and 53.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal audit function and its relationship with the external auditor, 
including internal audit resources, plans and performance as well as 
the degree to which the function is free of management restrictions. 
Throughout the year, the Audit Committee reviewed the internal 
audit function’s plans and its achievements against those plans.  
The Audit Committee considered the results of the audits undertaken 
by the internal audit function and the adequacy of management’s 
response to matters raised, including the time taken to resolve any 
such matters.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Audit Committee also reviews the integrity of any material 
financial statements made by the Company. It monitors and 
conducts a robust review of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control systems, accounting policies and practices and compliance 
controls (including key financial controls) as well as the Company’s 
statements on internal control before they are agreed by the Board 
for each year’s Annual Report. The Board retains overall 
responsibility for internal control and the identification and 
management of business risk and is assisted in this regard by a top 
down and bottom up process of risk identification and management 
which is the subject of regular interim review by RGCs. The key 
features of the Group’s internal control and risk management 
systems that ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting 
include clearly defined lines of accountability and delegation of 
authority, policies and procedures that cover financial planning and 
reporting, preparing consolidated accounts, capital expenditure, 
project governance and information security and the Group’s CBC. 
The internal audit function is involved in the assessment of the 
quality of risk management and internal control and helps to 
promote and further develop effective risk management within 
the business. Certain internal audit assignments (such as those 
requiring specialist expertise) continue to be outsourced by the 
Director of Group Internal Audit as appropriate. The Audit 
Committee reviews internal audit reports and considers the 
effectiveness of the function.
In a Group where local management have considerable autonomy to 
run and develop their businesses, a well designed system of internal 
control is necessary to safeguard shareholders’ investments and the 
Company’s assets. The directors acknowledge that they have overall 
responsibility for risk management, the Group’s systems of internal 
control, for reviewing the effectiveness of those controls and for 
ensuring that an appropriate culture has been embedded 
throughout the organisation. In accordance with the guidance set 
out in the FRC’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control 
and Related Financial Business Reporting 2014, and in the Code 
itself, an ongoing process has been established for identifying, 
managing and evaluating the risks faced by the Group. This process 
has been in place for the full financial year and up to the date on 
which the financial statements were approved.
DISCLOSURE OF RELEVANT AUDIT INFORMATION
The directors confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which KPMG is unaware and each 
director has taken all the steps that ought to have been taken as 
a director to be aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that KPMG is aware of that information.
OUR STANDARDS
The Company remains committed to the highest standards 
of business conduct and expects all of its employees to act 
accordingly. The Group’s Speak Up policy (an extension of the Code 
of Ethics incorporated within the Group’s Code of Business Conduct 
(CBC) which is available in 40 languages) sets out arrangements for 
the receipt, in confidence, of complaints on accounting, risk issues, 
internal controls, auditing issues and related matters which would, 
as appropriate, be reported to the Audit Committee. Speak Up is a 
standard review item on all internal audit work programmes. The 
CBC and Code of Ethics are available on the Company’s website at  
www.compass-group.com. The Corporate Responsibility Committee 
retains overall responsibility for the Group’s CBC programme, the 
training of employees and the way in which management obtain 
assurance in this area, including the annual self certification process 
which saw more than 3,500 employees confirm their continued 
compliance with the CBC and the Code of Ethics in the year ended 
30 September 2017.
The Audit Committee also receives updates on any allegations 
of bribery and fraud in the business at every meeting, with individual 
updates being given to the Audit Committee, as needed, in more 
serious cases of alleged bribery, fraud or related activities. The 
Group’s theft and anti-fraud policies are a subset of the CBC, which 
does not tolerate any activity involving fraud, dishonesty or 
deception. These policies, for which the Audit Committee retains 
overall responsibility, set out how allegations of fraud or bribery are 
dealt with, such as by the local human resources or finance team, 
and the frequency of local reporting that feeds into the regular 
updates, which are presented to the Audit Committee. Reporting of 
these matters to the Audit Committee is managed and overseen by 
the internal audit function. The Speak Up policy operates when the 
complaint is received through the whistleblowing channel and that 
policy will redirect the alleged fraud or bribery for investigation at the 
most appropriate level of the organisation which may, for example, 
be by a member of the local human resources team or, on occasion, 
the Audit Committee itself.
Each year, the Audit Committee critically reviews its own 
performance and considers where improvements can be made and 
in so doing it considers, amongst other things, those matters 
discussed by the Audit Committee, such as:
• whether the membership of the Committee meets the 
requirements of the Code
• whether the Committee’s terms of reference are appropriate for 
the particular circumstances of the Company and comply with 
prevailing legislation and best practice
• whether the number and length of time of Committee meetings 
are sufficient to meet the role and responsibilities of the 
Committee and coincide with key dates within the financial 
reporting and audit cycle
GOVERNANCE AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 60 The systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve the Group’s strategic objectives, safeguard the 
Group’s assets against material loss, fairly report the Group’s 
performance and position, and to ensure compliance with relevant 
legislation, regulation and best practice including that related to 
social, environmental and ethical matters. The systems provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. Such systems are reviewed by the Board 
to deal with changing circumstances.
A summary of the key financial risks inherent in the Group’s 
business is given on pages 34 to 36. Risk assessment and 
evaluation are an integral part of the annual planning cycle. Each 
business documents the strategic objectives and the effectiveness  
of the Group’s systems of internal control. As part of the review, each 
significant business and function has been required to identify and 
document each substantial risk, together with the mitigating actions 
implemented to manage, monitor and report to management on the 
effectiveness of these controls. Senior managers are also required to 
sign biannual confirmations of compliance with key procedures and 
to report any breakdowns in, or exceptions to, these procedures. 
Summarised results are presented to senior management (including 
to the RGCs) and to the Board.
These processes have been in place throughout the financial year 
ended 30 September 2017 and have continued to the date of this 
Report. Taken together, these processes and the reports they 
generate, which are considered by the Audit Committee, constitute 
a robust assessment of key risks and the internal controls that exist, 
and are designed to mitigate these risks. The Board has reviewed 
the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control for the 
year under review and a summary of the principal control structures 
and processes in place across the Group is set out in this Report.
CONTROL ENVIRONMENT
Whilst the Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, it has delegated 
responsibility for the operation of the internal control and risk 
management programme to the Executive Board. The detailed 
review of internal control has been delegated to the Audit 
Committee. The management of each business is responsible for 
internal control and risk management within its own business and 
for ensuring compliance with the Group’s policies and procedures. 
Each business has appointed a risk champion whose primary role in 
such capacity is to ensure compliance by local management with 
the Group’s risk management and internal control programme. The 
internal and external independent auditors have reviewed the overall 
approach adopted by the Group towards its risk management 
activities so as to reinforce these internal control requirements.
CONTROL PROCEDURES
The Board reviews its strategic plans and objectives on an annual 
basis and approves Group budgets and strategies in light of these. 
Control is exercised at Group, regional and business level through 
the Group’s MAP framework (as well as through the RGCs), monthly 
monitoring of performance by comparison with budgets, forecasts 
and cash targets, and by regular visits to Group businesses by the 
Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Group Chief 
Operating Officers.
This is underpinned by a formal major risk assessment process, 
which is an integral part of the annual business cycle and is also a 
robust process adopted to support the Viability Statement. Each of 
the Group’s businesses is required to identify and document major 
risks facing their business and appropriate mitigating activities and 
controls, and to monitor and report to management on the 
effectiveness of these controls on a biannual basis. These reports, 
together with reports on internal control and departures, if any, from 
established Group procedures prepared by both the internal and 
external auditors, are reviewed by the Group Finance Director and 
the Audit Committee. Group companies also submit biannual risk 
and internal control assurance letters to the Group Finance Director 
on internal control and risk management issues, with comments on 
the control environment within their operations. The Group Finance 
Director summarises these submissions for the Audit Committee, 
and the Chairman of the Audit Committee reports to the Board on 
any matters that have arisen from the Audit Committee’s review of 
the way in which risk management and internal control processes 
have been applied.
The Board has formal procedures in place for the approval of client 
contracts, capital investment and acquisition projects, with clearly 
designated levels of authority, supported by post investment review 
processes for selected acquisitions, client contracts and major 
capital expenditure. The Board considers social, environmental and 
ethical matters in relation to the Group’s business and assesses 
these when reviewing the risks faced by the Group; further 
information regarding environmental and ethical matters is available 
on pages 37 to 41. The Board is conscious of the effect such 
matters may have on the short and long term value of the Company.
The external auditor of the Company and the Director of Group 
Internal Audit attend Audit Committee meetings and receive its 
papers. Committee members meet regularly with the external auditor 
and with the Director of Group Internal Audit, without the presence 
of executive management.
There were no changes to the Company’s internal control 
over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended 
30 September 2017 that have affected materially, or are reasonably 
likely to affect materially, the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting.
61 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
GOVERNANCE DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Corporate 
Responsibility (CR) Committee’s Report for the financial year ended 
30 September 2017.
This is my first statement as Chairman of the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee and, in the short time since I succeeded 
Susan Murray, I have been inspired by the hard work and 
enthusiasm of my colleagues. With their help, I look forward  
to building on the progress we have made to date.
ACTIVITY DURING THE YEAR
SAFETY PERFORMANCE
Notwithstanding our focused efforts on building a positive 
safety culture which is supporting a year on year reduction in our lost 
time incident frequency rate, sadly, we had two work related fatalities 
in our Europe business as a result of vehicle accidents. So that we 
continue to make what we do safer, we have shared lessons learned 
from these serious events with our colleagues around the globe to try 
to prevent similar events from happening again.
During the year, we have been working with the British Safety 
Council and exploring best practice within our own business  
related to transport safety. We have introduced improved  
global policy standards and colleague engagement materials 
designed to boost employee awareness of the potential risks 
resulting from unsafe driving behaviour. You can view our  
policy and see examples of our engaging employee awareness 
campaign at www.compass-group.com.
GOVERNANCE
The Committee also addressed a number of governance matters 
and received updates from the Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary on new developments in corporate governance 
and reporting, and considered recommendations to the Board 
concerning these matters.
SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRITY
We continue to make steady progress in advancing our sustainable 
business practices, including supply chain integrity. Maintaining a 
visible and transparent supply chain is important for us, our clients 
and the millions of consumers that we serve every day. People 
expect our sourcing practices to be aligned to those of a responsible 
business partner. We want to do the right thing and to demonstrate 
progress against the public commitments we’ve made to be an 
ethical and sustainable organisation.
We moved forward with the roll out of our Global Supply Chain 
Integrity Standards which we hope, in time, will be the industry 
leading standards that set the benchmark for our sector.
I am particularly proud of the progress being made related to farm 
animal welfare in our supply chain. This year, we appointed an 
executive sponsor to help shape our farm animal welfare policy. 
This policy and its supporting standards are part of a clear road  
map to help drive continuous improvement in our sourcing 
practices. We have more to do, but it is pleasing to see that our 
efforts have been acknowledged by Compassion in World Farming 
and the Business Benchmark on Animal Welfare, where we 
achieved a benchmark score of Tier 4 for 2016. We await results of 
the 2017 assessment and hope to improve upon last year’s 
performance.
Building on our 
commitments
Part of our ethos is being a responsible 
partner and this year we have continued 
to make progress in our efforts to create  
a more sustainable business.
GOVERNANCE AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY COMMITTEE REPORT
The wellbeing of our colleagues around the world is 
important to us. We have long been building on our 
Safety First programme and awareness campaigns 
which continue to focus both management and frontline 
colleagues’ attention on reducing risk and injury at work. 
A positive safety culture has been further reinforced by 
linking key metrics to the bonus outcomes of our global 
leadership team. We are actively piloting innovative 
programmes to encourage more inspirational safety 
leadership from our management teams, as well 
as exploring ways in which we can use technology 
to improve visibility of risks and hazards within 
our business.

UNITED NATIONS’ (UN) SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
During the year, we reassessed our suite of metrics for our 
sustainable business activities which included further refining our 
alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
Trends towards globalisation mean that it is increasingly common 
for businesses to source their goods and services from different 
countries. This increases the task we have of maintaining 
transparency and makes the identification of unethical or inhumane 
practices in our supply chain more challenging.
Those that profit from such practices go to great lengths to ensure 
that their criminal activities remain hidden and, consequently, it can 
be extremely difficult to identify such activities. This means that no 
business, including our own, can have absolute certainty that such 
activities do not exist within its business or supply chain. Despite 
such challenges, our position is clear: our people are the key to our 
continued success and we will not tolerate unethical behaviour in 
our own operations or within our supply chains.
This year, we have extended our membership of The Supplier 
Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX), a not for profit organisation 
dedicated to driving improvements in responsible and ethical 
business practices across global supply chains. It enables sharing  
of ethical supply chain data which allows members to access 
information about their suppliers in four key areas – health and 
safety, labour standards, the environment and business ethics.
We recognise that certain categories of procured products and 
services potentially carry a higher risk of child or slave labour being 
used in the supply chain. This is why we use the SEDEX data in 
addition to conducting independent audits, to verify labour 
standards and identify any poor practices within our supply base. 
Any supplier breaches that are uncovered via audit or any other 
means will be fully investigated and, where possible, remedied. 
Repeat breaches or those that cannot be remedied will result in 
the immediate termination of the relevant supplier relationship.
To help us improve visibility of any potential wrongdoing, we operate 
a free, independent and confidential helpline called Speak Up.  
This enables colleagues and suppliers to raise in confidence any 
concerns about slavery and human trafficking, any wrongdoing or 
other breaches of our Code of Business Conduct. Performance data 
and trends from Speak Up, as well as other compliance data, are 
reviewed as part of our Committee meetings and those of the Audit 
Committee and remedial actions taken as appropriate.
The Committee is comforted, but not complacent, that there have 
been no reports made to the helpline regarding slavery and human 
trafficking in the past 12 months.
As signatories to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights, one of the ways in which we have sought to build on the 
awareness of our colleagues is to introduce an elearning programme 
for our strategic procurement teams, highlighting the potential risks of 
human slavery and trafficking within supply chains. To date, we have 
trained 200 colleagues from our strategic procurement teams who 
account for 70% of the Group’s annual global procurement spend. 
We will continue with this programme throughout 2018 and we are 
committed to extending our elearning programme to our top 20 
countries, which account for the majority of our global procurement 
spend each year, by 2020.
The review helped to shape our thinking on how we challenge  
our own business policies, commitments and activities; measure  
our performance against the goals to be achieved by 2030; and 
address any material impacts to our business. You can find out 
more about our global commitments towards the 2030 goals on 
pages 38 to 41.

each director/member was eligible to attend.
2. Stepped down from the Board and its committees at the conclusion of 
the Company’s AGM on 2 February 2017.
OBJECTIVES
The objective of the CR Committee is to assist the Board and 
the Company in fulfilling its corporate responsibility in line with 
the Company's strategy, policies, processes and standards. 
RESPONSIBILITIES
The Committee’s primary responsibilities include health, safety 
and environmental practices, ethical business conduct, the 
promotion of employee engagement and diversity as well as 
community investment.
The Committee has a rolling agenda and receives reports from the 
Director of Health, Safety and Environment and other senior 
managers to ensure that progress is being made towards meeting 
the Group’s specific corporate responsibility KPIs and in our ongoing 
corporate responsibility commitments.
We are dedicated to maintaining the highest standards of corporate 
governance and throughout the Annual Report there are examples 
of how we are endeavouring to achieve our strategic goals whilst 
underpinning our core values.
In October 2017, we published our second Modern Slavery Act 
statement (MSA statement). This year, our MSA statement sets out 
the steps that we are taking to reduce the risk of slavery and human 
trafficking in our business and supply chain. The Committee 
recognises that this is an ongoing process and has selected five key 
performance indicators with the aim of demonstrating our year on 
year progress in this area. Our current MSA statement can be found 
at www.compass-group.com.
THE YEAR AHEAD
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of my Compass 
colleagues for their continued commitment and enthusiasm and  
I look forward to reporting on our progress next year. It’s important 
that we continue to listen to the views of our stakeholders and use 
their insights to help shape our strategy and build on our 
achievements to date.

Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 64 DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Nomination 
Committee’s Report for the financial year ended 30 September 2017.
Last year, I shared my thoughts with you on the resilience of the 
Board and its committees to respond and adapt to the changing 
needs of the business. Whilst succession planning is a matter for 
the whole Board, the Nomination Committee has an important role 
to play in ensuring that there is an appropriate balance of diversity, 
skills and experience so that the Board makes an effective 
contribution to the success of the Company.
CEO SUCCESSION
Succession planning at Board level has, and continues to be, a key 
area of focus for Committee discussions and activities.
On 21 September 2017, we announced a significant change in the 
Group’s Board. Richard Cousins, who has been an outstanding 
Chief Executive for the past 11 years, will step down from his role on 
31 March 2018 and retire from the Group on 30 September 2018.  
It has been a huge pleasure to work with Richard and, on behalf of 
the Board, I want to thank him for his extraordinary contribution to 
the Group. Richard has transformed Compass into a sustainable, 
industry-leading organisation that delivers excellent food services to 
our customers, attracts and develops great people and generates 
significant returns for shareholders.
The Board employs the services of executive search firms as part 
of the external search process to identify potential Board and senior 
management candidates. In preparation for the Group Chief 
Executive succession, the Committee considered the credentials of 
a number of providers before recommending the appointment of the 
international recruitment firm considered best placed to meet the 
brief. The recruitment firm chosen, Korn Ferry, was considered to 
be independent of, and had no other links with, the Company or 
its directors in connection with the brief.
The candidate assessment process included the development 
of a success profile, an assessment of senior Compass executives 
and a parallel mapping of external candidates. The Committee 
and I managed the assessment process.
The initial key element of the process was to build consensus and 
clarity on the major challenges and opportunities to face the next 
Group Chief Executive and to translate this into a profile of the ideal 
candidate. Internal potential successors were assessed against this 
profile which was also used as a yardstick against which to measure 
and compare possible external nominees. The profile covered 
four important elements of leadership: past experience, leadership 
competences, personality traits and individual motivations 
and drivers.
Each of the non-executive directors, including myself, as well as 
Mr Cousins, completed a survey in which we selected key past 
experiences and leadership competencies that we all felt were 
important to see in the next Group Chief Executive. Interviews were 
also conducted with each of the contributors to gain their views on 
the future challenges and opportunities facing the next Group Chief 
Executive and, in light of that, to review their selection of experiences 
and competences. Directors were also asked to provide their views 
as to the nature of the role and culture of the Group.
GOVERNANCE AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Maintaining 
continuity  
and building 
diversity of 
skills and 
experience
Richard Cousins will retire from the Board on 31 March 
2018 after nearly 12 years as Group Chief Executive.
I am delighted that Richard will be succeeded by Dominic 
Blakemore, our former Chief Operating Officer, Europe.
Dominic became Deputy Group Chief Executive Officer 
on 1 October 2017, and will take over as Group Chief 
Executive Officer on 1 April 2018. In the ensuing period, he 
and Richard will work closely to ensure a smooth transition.
Dominic’s appointment was the result of a rigorous 
succession process. He is exceptionally well qualified 
to lead the business, and has already contributed 
significantly to the Group, for four years as Group Finance 
Director and, for the past two years, managing our 
business in Europe. Dominic has the leadership skills 
combined with the industry and operational experience 
to lead Compass to continued future success. He also 
benefits from the support of a very strong senior 
management team and together they will continue to build 
on the Group’s strong track record under Richard’s tenure.
The Board looks forward to working with Dominic in his 
new role. 
65 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
GOVERNANCE A detailed success profile was then developed which was discussed 
and agreed by the Committee.
Senior executives identified by the Board as possible successors 
were individually assessed. The assessment comprised the 
following elements:
• a benchmark interview of past experiences and career conducted 
by two executive search experts
• a behavioural interview of leadership competences conducted 
by an advisory/coaching expert
• completion of multiple online personality, aptitude and 
preference assessments
• an assessment of leadership potential
• 360 degree feedback
• a two day simulation exercise using a detailed case study
In parallel with the assessment of the internal candidates, a detailed 
global scan was conducted to identify possible external nominees. 
Over 500 possible companies that met scale and sector criteria were 
identified and from that an initial set of over 100 possible nominees 
was created. This was refined down to a target group of 35 which 
was further reduced to a shortlist of 10 external potential nominees.
After detailed discussions and careful debate, the Committee 
concluded, having taken all of the feedback into consideration, 
that none of the external potential nominees was sufficiently 
stronger than the internal senior executives.
When Mr Cousins notified me of his intention to retire from the 
Company, the Committee was, therefore, in a position to be able 
to make a recommendation to the Board for his succession. The 
recommendation, which the Board approved, was that Dominic 
Blakemore should be appointed as Deputy Group Chief Executive 
from 1 October 2017 and that he should succeed Mr Cousins from 
1 April 2018 to enable a smooth transition.
OTHER CHANGES TO THE BOARD
In the run up to the Company’s 2017 AGM, votes were lodged by 
shareholders against Mrs Vittal’s reappointment as a director based 
on concerns that she held too many other directorships such that 
she could not devote sufficient time to her duties at Compass. The 
Company sought through positive dialogue to engage and address 
shareholder concerns, but, unfortunately, Mrs Vittal received only 
63.45% of the votes cast in favour of her re-election.
On 3 February 2017, the Company issued a statement confirming 
that Mrs Vittal would review her portfolio and seek to reduce her 
number of directorships, notwithstanding that Mrs Vittal’s time 
commitment and contribution to Compass had not been adversely 
affected by her other roles.
Mrs Vittal has now concluded the review of her non-executive 
portfolio which she had agreed to undertake after the 2017 AGM. 
Mrs Vittal has stepped down from one of the private Indian 
companies of which she was a director and is in the process of 
relinquishing her directorships of two further public Indian 
companies. These will become effective by 30 June 2018, by which 
time she will remain a director of five Indian companies. I very much 
welcome Mrs Vittal’s proactive review of her portfolio which I trust 
will address shareholders’ concerns about potential overboarding. 
Accordingly, Mrs Vittal will seek re-election as a director of the 
Company at the 2018 AGM.
In May 2017, Stefan Bomhard completed his first full year as a 
non-executive director and, having completed her nine year tenure, 
Susan Murray stepped down from the Board at the conclusion of the 
Company’s 2017 AGM. Mrs Murray was succeeded by Nelson Silva 
as Chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee. Mrs Murray’s 
retirement from the Board means that we are currently falling short 
of the voluntary target set by Lord Davies to have 33% female 
representation on the Board by 2020, but this will be taken into 
consideration (as will the voluntary target set by Sir John Parker on 
diversity) by the Committee when next recruiting a director.
However, our primary consideration is to have the right blend 
of skills, knowledge, experience and independence and for that 
reason, recommendations for any future appointments will continue 
to be made on merit.
ACTIVITY DURING THE YEAR
The markets in which the Company operates are intrinsically 
dynamic. The Board and its committees must therefore adapt and 
evolve to ensure that they have the optimum composition to make 
the most effective contribution to help the Company achieve its 
strategic goals.
During the year, the Committee (together with the Board itself) 
continued to focus on succession planning for both executive and 
non-executive directors. In doing so, it considered the tenure, mix 
and diversity of skills and experience of existing Board members and 
those required of prospective Board members in the context of the 
Group’s medium and long term strategy.
THE YEAR AHEAD
Compass has a strong Board of Directors with a broad range of 
experience which has driven the Company’s success.
The Committee and the Board believe that our directors are well 
qualified to further advance the interests of the Company’s 
shareholders, as well as its employees, customers, partners and 
communities and that Dominic Blakemore, as Richard Cousins’ 
successor, has the leadership skills, combined with the industry and 
operational experience, to build on the Group’s strong track record.
In the year ahead we will continue to keep succession planning 
under review to ensure that we can retain and attract the best  
talent to support our corporate strategy to deliver sustainable  
organic growth.

OBJECTIVES
The Nomination Committee’s key objective is to review and monitor 
the Board’s composition and to ensure that the Board comprises 
individuals with the right blend of skills, knowledge and experience 
to maintain a high degree of effectiveness in discharging its 
responsibilities.
RESPONSIBILITIES
The Nomination Committee reviews the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and its committees and makes 
recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes 
considered necessary in the identification and nomination of new 
directors, the reappointment of existing directors and appointment 
of members to the Board’s committees. It also assesses the roles 
of the existing directors in office to ensure that there continues to 
be a balanced board in terms of skills, knowledge, experience and 
diversity. The Committee reviews the senior leadership needs of 
the Group to enable it to compete effectively in the marketplace 
and advises the Board on succession planning for executive 
director appointments, although the Board itself is responsible 
for succession generally.
The Nomination Committee has standing items that it considers 
regularly under its terms of reference; for example, the Committee 
reviews its own terms of reference annually, or as required, to 
reflect changes to the Code or as a result of changes in regulations 
or best practice.
SUCCESSION PLANNING AND DIVERSITY
The Company adopts a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure 
for the appointment of new directors and senior executives with due 
regard to diversity and gender. Prior to making an appointment, the 
Nomination Committee will evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge, 
independence, experience and diversity on the Board and, in light of 
this evaluation, will prepare a description of the role and capabilities 
required, with a view to ensuring that the best placed individual for 
the role is recommended to the Board for appointment. In identifying 
suitable candidates, the Nomination Committee normally:
• uses open advertising or the services of external advisors to 
facilitate the search
• considers candidates from different genders and a wide range  
of backgrounds
• considers candidates on merit and against objective criteria, 
ensuring that appointees have sufficient time to devote to the 
position, in light of other potentially significant commitments
The Board continues to believe that gender based or other types of 
targets are inappropriate and that the blend of skills, knowledge and 
experience is of paramount importance.

ANNUAL STATEMENT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration 
Committee’s Report for the financial year ended 30 September 2017 
which is split into:
(i) this Annual Statement, incorporating an ‘at a glance’ summary 
setting out the remuneration decisions made this year as well as 
highlighting key elements of our proposals for the new Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy
(ii) the Governance Summary
(iii) the proposed Remuneration Policy
(iv) the Annual Remuneration Report on the implementation of  
the current Policy in the year ended 30 September 2017 and 
proposed implementation for next year
This has been a busy and challenging year for the Committee.  
We began the year preparing for our three year policy review, 
recognising there has been significant change in the market and 
best practice has been evolving. We conducted our review and 
consulted widely, we have managed ‘business as usual’ and then in 
the latter part of the year, we considered the terms for the retirement 
of our long-serving Group Chief Executive Officer (Group CEO) 
Richard Cousins and the succession of Dominic Blakemore as 
Group CEO on 1 April 2018. I wish to thank my Committee 
colleagues for their full support over the year.
REMUNERATION POLICY REVIEW
We began the policy review by examining our remuneration 
framework to ensure that it remains appropriate for our current 
business model, and that it supports our future ambitions by 
rewarding management to deliver our strategy of sustainable  
growth and returns. The Committee reviewed various emerging 
remuneration structures with the assistance of external advisors. 
After having discussions with management and seeking input from 
key shareholders at the very early stages of our review, the 
Committee concluded that the existing model (base salary, an 
annual cash bonus and a three year LTIP with a two year post 
vesting holding period linked to the KPIs by which we measure 
delivery of the business) is well understood by the business, 
supports our culture and is fundamental to maintaining the superior 
returns to shareholders which Compass has delivered over time.
Consequently, we focused on:
• incentive measures (do they sufficiently support our strategy?)
• market effectiveness (does our remuneration enable us to pay 
appropriately for successful leadership?)
• emerging practice (does remuneration align to shareholder 
expectations and take account of new trends?)
• resilience (is remuneration capable of supporting talented leaders 
and their future successors?)
We believe that having a remuneration framework clearly 
linked to the KPIs by which we measure the delivery of  
our business strategy has supported Compass’ sustained 
success. As we reviewed our proposed Policy we sought  
to retain that link whilst ensuring that any future policy 
reflects the evolving external landscape.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 68 STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT OF INCENTIVES
We estimate that approximately 75% of the £200 billion
1
 global  
food services market is currently serviced by regional or in-house 
providers and there is a significant structural growth opportunity. 
Compass generates sustainable organic growth by winning new 
contracts, retaining existing business and generating like for like 
revenue growth. We are highly focused on our operating margin  
and the delivery of efficiencies to ensure profitable growth. Looking 
ahead, we recognise that growth is central to our strategy. Our 
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) is, however, at a high level and 
so we believe that to place too much emphasis on further improving 
this rate of return on our capital risks having the unintended result  
of discouraging investments in profitable opportunities at attractive 
margins if it is dilutive to Group ROCE in the short term. We do not 
believe this to be in the interests of shareholders.
Our proposal
Our current long term arrangement incentivises growth in the rate 
of ROCE, cumulative Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF) and relative 
total return to shareholders (TSR). We propose to refine the measure 
based on growth in ROCE to one based on ROCE targets taking into 
account our strategy on the use of capital, and to place greater 
emphasis on both ROCE and AFCF. We are therefore proposing 
to rebalance our measures to 40% ROCE, 40% cumulative AFCF 
and 20% relative TSR (previously each measure was equivalent 
to one third).
THE REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK
Market effectiveness and emerging practice: We have operated  
a remuneration policy which positioned total remuneration towards 
the lower end of our peer group (based on the FTSE 50 excluding 
the financial service sector). We wish to retain this philosophy and 
recognise the need to guard against the inflationary effect of using 
market data. The Committee believes it has a duty to investors to 
ensure that remuneration arrangements for senior executives are 
sufficiently attractive to retain the talented individuals that run the 
business. As part of our review, we noted specifically that when we 
looked at total remuneration the overall value was below market. 
However, when we examined individual elements the picture was 
more varied. Salaries were positioned to reflect tenure and 
experience; pension at 35% of salary was more generous than 
typically paid to both Compass UK management and in the external 
market to new executive appointees; the annual bonus opportunity 
was appropriately positioned but the LTIP opportunity was materially 
behind the market. We noted that our share ownership guidelines 
for executive directors (below Group CEO) at 150% base salary were 
below the level now expected by shareholders.
Resilience: Compass’ success can be attributed to a strong 
leadership team with most of the Executive Board having held 
senior leadership roles for many years. We have a proven track 
record in successful succession planning, having maintained a 
focus on developing talent internally and carefully managing our 
talent pipeline. To ensure that we can appoint and retain talented 
executives, we identified the elements of remuneration which we 
wished to change to provide a rebalanced overall remuneration 
package, offering a lower proportion of fixed pay and more 
emphasis on long term, performance based incentives.
This results in an overall package with a larger proportion  
of remuneration at risk and improved alignment to the  
shareholder experience.
Our proposal
When developing the Policy and consulting shareholders, our intent 
was to change to our proposed framework (as set out below and  
in the following pages) after any change in leadership. Given 
Dominic Blakemore’s transition to Group CEO on 1 April 2018,  
our Policy, if approved by shareholders, will be implemented for 
executive directors from that date.
Salary: We remain committed to an approach to salary which 
reflects the experience and contribution of the individual. This 
means that salary levels for new appointments may be set below the 
market, and if so, they may subsequently receive increases which 
exceed those of the wider workforce for high performance and 
growth in experience over a phased period.
Pension: We will make an adjustment to the balance of the current 
package by reducing UK pension cash allowances (or contributions, 
if appropriate) from 35% of salary to 20% of salary in line with the 
level for Compass UK management. This reduction will apply to both 
new appointees and current executive directors. For new appointees 
(such as Mr Blakemore) following the approval of the Policy, this will 
commence with immediate effect and for incumbent executives,  
it will be on a phased basis starting in January 2019 over three years 
in increments of -5% per annum. To reflect US market pressures, 
we believe it is in shareholders’ interests that Gary Green remains  
on a pension cash allowance of 35% of salary.
Bonus deferral: Our existing executive directors have significant 
levels of share ownership (already above 200% of salary) and are 
subject to a robust malus and clawback policy. For newer 
appointees we will support them to build up their shareholding by 
modifying the annual bonus plan to require the deferral of one third 
of the bonus award into Deferred Bonus Shares until the (newly 
increased) share ownership guideline is met. Deferred Bonus Shares 
would vest after a three year period and be subject to malus and 
clawback provisions.
Long Term Incentive Plan awards: We will increase our long term 
incentive awards from 250% of salary to 300% of salary for the 
Group CEO and for all other directors from 200% to 250% of salary. 
This level is substantially below wider market practice for companies 
of our size and complexity but we believe this approach is 
appropriate for Compass.
Share ownership: We increased the minimum guidelines for  
all executive directors to 200% of base salary with effect from 
September 2017. We will further increase our share ownership 
guidelines materially to a rate of ownership which is equal to the 
value of the long term incentive award i.e. 300% of salary for the 
Group CEO and 250% of salary for other executive directors.  
We will extend the period by which executive directors are expected 
to achieve this revised level from four years to five years and will 
measure achievement pro rata over the five year period.
The charts overleaf demonstrate how our proposal seeks to 
rebalance overall remuneration for the Group CEO. The impact is  
an increase in on-target opportunity for the new Group CEO of less 
than 2% of target total pay.

69 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
GOVERNANCE SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
In May 2017, we started our review process by inviting key investors 
to share their views on the existing remuneration arrangements at 
Compass as part of an initial assessment process.
We reflected on their insight and then returned to them and a wider 
group of major shareholders and their representative bodies in July 
and August. We consulted extensively on a proposed draft Policy.
Shareholders generally welcomed the rebalanced package which 
would decrease fixed pay by reducing pension cash allowances or 
contributions and increase the value that could be earned in the form 
of shares through the LTIP opportunity. They also supported 
proposed increases to the share ownership guidelines.
We discussed in detail ways of ensuring that profitable growth is 
effectively incorporated in our incentives. We considered alternative 
methods such as the inclusion of EPS when combined with a floor 
(underpin) based on ROCE and some shareholders also suggested 
alternatives such as the introduction of an economic profit measure 
or the replacement of the LTIP with a restricted share plan. We 
considered the various alternatives and all the feedback from our 
major shareholders, some of which was inconsistent, but, ultimately, 
we concluded that the broad measures we use today (ROCE, AFCF 
and TSR) were appropriate for our strategy as these are measures 
by which we currently manage the business, and they have been 
key to supporting our success.
We welcomed the open dialogue and constructive feedback 
provided. We returned to our major shareholders in October to 
explain how we had taken full account of it in our final proposals. 
This included for example, the introduction of a deferred element 
to the annual bonus plan as detailed in the ‘at a glance’ summary 
on page 73 and in the Policy.
We have been pleased with the high levels of engagement from 
our major shareholders and the new Policy has been shaped by 
their views. 
GOVERNANCE AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
The proposed Policy will mean:
• overall increase in Target Total Pay of less than 2% by moving Mr Blakemore from the current to the proposed Policy
• overall decrease in Target Total Pay of more than 14% for Mr Blakemore under the proposed Policy compared to Mr Cousins under 
the current Policy
• reduction in the proportion of pay which is received in year with a greater proportion received after five years (three years performance 
period plus two years post vest holding)
• reduction in pension provision from 35% to 20% of base salary
• increase to the LTIP opportunity of 26.25% of base salary at target and 50% of base salary at maximum
• increase in share ownership guidelines from 200% to 300% of salary for the Group CEO
• maintenance of pay positioning at the lower end of the market (FTSE 50 excluding the financial service sector)

DIRECTOR CHANGES
Details of the remuneration terms for Mr Blakemore, our incoming 
Group CEO, are set out on page 81 and these are completely aligned 
to our proposed Policy as described above. Mr Blakemore’s current 
annual salary as Deputy CEO of £750,000 will be increased to a 
starting annual salary of £900,000 as Group CEO with effect from  
1 April 2018, which is well below that of our outgoing Group CEO 
Richard Cousins and that of a fully experienced Group CEO leading a 
company of the scale and complexity of Compass. As a result, higher 
than average increases may apply in future to Mr Blakemore’s salary. 
Upon becoming Group CEO under the new Policy, Mr Blakemore 
would see an immediate reduction to his pension cash allowance 
from his current 35% to 20% per annum (which would not be 
subject to phasing), will have a bonus opportunity of 200% and an 
LTIP opportunity of 300% of base salary.
The details of remuneration for Richard Cousins were disclosed  
on 21 September 2017 and are also set out on page 92 and these 
are also in line with our existing Policy.
REWARDING PERFORMANCE IN 2016-2017
Compass has delivered another year of excellent performance  
with organic revenue growth of 4% with strong net new business  
in North America and a challenging but improving environment in 
Europe and Rest of World. Our ongoing commitment to generating 
efficiencies continues to be supported by our Management and 
Performance (MAP) framework. We are using these efficiencies to 
invest in exciting opportunities for growth around the Group. For the 
annual bonus, we measure Group, and where relevant, regional 
performance. This led to a range of bonus outcomes as set out in 
the Annual Remuneration Report.
For the Long Term Incentive Plan, the TSR element was earned in 
full because Compass ranked 13
th
 against other FTSE 100 
companies (excluding financial service sector) over the performance 
period. The targets we set based on growth in ROCE and cumulative 
AFCF were demanding and were satisfied with 23.5% and 100% 
vesting respectively. The Committee considers this outcome to be 
a fair and balanced result.
Salary adjustments for executive directors are aligned with increases 
paid for other senior executives within the Group and specifically  
to employees within their region. For Gary Green a salary increase  
of 4% is awarded with effect from January 2018. As previously 
indicated, Johnny Thomson was appointed to the role of Group 
Finance Director below the market rate to reflect that this was his 
first PLC director role. After another year of strong performance, 
Mr Thomson has been awarded an increase of 6% and this is the 
final stage of a phased set of increases to reach a competitive pay 
level. No increase is proposed for Mr Cousins in his final year 
with Compass.
CONCLUSION
The Committee believes that the new Policy proposed will ensure 
that Compass has a remuneration framework which is fit for the 
foreseeable future. Having engaged extensively with shareholders 
over the course of this review at critical points, we have taken a fully 
considered approach to devising these proposals. Our proposed 
Policy will ensure that executive directors’ remuneration aligns with 
our strategic priorities of growing profitably in all of our businesses, 
thus supporting the delivery of continued superior returns.
Shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on both the Annual 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2017 and 
this new Remuneration Policy at our AGM to be held on 8 February 
2018. If the Policy is approved at the 2018 AGM, it is intended that 
it will remain in place until the 2021 AGM, when it will be again 
submitted to shareholders for approval. 
The voting outcome at the 2017 AGM in respect of the Annual 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2016 is  
set out on page 94.
We were pleased to receive good shareholder support at our 2017 
AGM and I look forward to welcoming you and receiving your 
support once more.

Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 72 REMUNERATION POLICY PROPOSAL 2018-2021
IMPLEMENTING THE PROPOSAL
Our proposed Policy is designed to ensure remuneration arrangements are sufficiently attractive to retain the talented individuals who 
run the business and to rebalance remuneration to decrease fixed pay and increase the value that could be earned in the form of shares 
which has better alignment with shareholders’ interests.
We believe that the best timing to change to our proposed rebalanced framework would be following Dominic Blakemore’s transition 
to Group CEO on 1 April 2018. Our Policy, if approved by shareholders, will be implemented for all executive directors from that date.
The chart below shows how the current structure operates for our Group CEO Richard Cousins based on his existing base salary and 
compares to the proposed structure which would operate for the new Group CEO Dominic Blakemore. In the chart the proportion of 
each remuneration element is shown as a percentage of the total to highlight how the rebalanced remuneration would work in practice 
and is based on total reward at maximum.

provide better alignment to the Group strategy.

Governance Summary
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Board sets the Company’s Remuneration Policy and the 
Committee is responsible, within the authority delegated by the 
Board, for determining specific remuneration packages and the 
terms and conditions of employment for the members of the 
Executive Board, which comprises the executive directors and other 
senior executives. The Committee ensures that the members of the 
Executive Board are provided with the appropriate incentives to 
enhance the Group’s performance and to reward them for their 
personal contribution to the success of the business. The Committee 
reviews the remuneration arrangements for Group employees whose 
salaries exceed a specified level and administers the Company’s 
share incentive plans. The Committee has regard for the wider 
remuneration philosophy of the organisation when considering 
executives’ packages. The Committee also determines the 
Chairman’s remuneration, although the Board itself determines the 
level of fees paid to the non-executive directors. No directors are 
involved in determining their own remuneration. The Committee 
maintains an active dialogue with shareholder representatives and 
its full terms of reference are set out on the Company’s website at 
www.compass-group.com.
The Committee consists entirely of independent non-executive 
directors, as defined in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
COMMITTEE COMPOSITION
The Committee comprises Carol Arrowsmith, Chairman, and all the 
other non-executive directors in office at the date of this Report. 
The Remuneration Committee met six times during the year and 
directors’ attendance can be found in the table below.

Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 74 STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE DRR
As for last year, this Directors’ Remuneration Report (DRR) has 
been prepared on behalf of the Board by the Committee in 
accordance with the requirements of the CA 2006 and the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the 2013 Regulations). The policy 
on remuneration of directors (the Policy) is set out in pages 77 to 83. 
A separate resolution (Resolution 2) will be put to shareholders at 
the forthcoming AGM in accordance with the CA 2006 and the 2013 
Regulations to approve the Policy. If approved, the Policy is 
expected to take effect from the date on which the Resolution is 
passed and remain in force for a minimum of three years.
The next two sections of the DRR cover the following matters:
• the Company’s proposed remuneration policy from  
8 February 2018 for the three years thereafter, including  
each of the components of directors’ remuneration (the Policy 
Report) including:
 – how decisions on directors’ remuneration will be made and the 
philosophy and strategy behind those decisions
 – the structure of remuneration packages for existing, departing 
and new directors
 – the impact of key performance measures on the potential value 
of remuneration
 – key contractual terms of existing and new directors
 – how the Company engaged with major shareholders during 
the development of the new Policy
• how the Policy approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM was 
implemented in the year ended 30 September 2017 (the Annual 
Remuneration Report) and how the proposed Policy will be 
implemented in the next financial year
Auditable disclosures are the directors single total figure of 
remuneration (page 85), long term incentive awards (page 88), 
extant equity incentive awards held by executive directors (page 91), 
exit payments (page 92), non-executive directors’ remuneration 
(page 93) and directors’ interests (page 93).
The key changes to the content of this Policy, compared to the 
existing version which has been in place since it was approved by 
shareholders in February 2015, are set out in the table on page 76. 
The table summarises how the proposed Policy has been updated 
against each element of pay.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
The table below provides a summary of the key changes proposed to the Policy as detailed in the tables on pages 78 and 79 for ease  
of reference.
REMUNERATION COMPONENT DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE
BENEFITS AND PENSION
Proposed reduction to pension
• future or newly promoted executive directors will be provided with a pension cash allowance  
(or pension contribution as appropriate) of 20% of base salary
• for incumbent UK executive directors the pension cash allowance will phase down from 35%  
to 20% in line with the level for Compass UK management. The reduction will take place in 
increments of -5% per annum with effect from January 2019
• the existing Group COO, North America will retain a pension cash allowance of 35% of base salary 
to ensure competitiveness
ANNUAL BONUS
Proposed introduction of bonus
deferral in specific 
circumstances
• bonus is typically paid in cash. However, where executive directors have not achieved the pro rata 
minimum of the revised share ownership guidelines, one third of the bonus will be deferred into 
shares which typically vest three years after grant (Deferred Bonus Shares)
• cash and Deferred Bonus Shares will be subject to malus and clawback
• a financial underpin may be operated
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
Proposed increase to maximum
opportunity and reweighting 
of measures
• as part of a rebalanced package, the maximum share opportunity will be 300% of base salary for 
the Group CEO and 250% for other executive directors
• 40% of the shares vest based on performance against ROCE, 40% of the shares vest based on 
performance against an AFCF range and 20% of the shares vest on the performance of relative 
TSR against a peer group. Performance is usually assessed over a three year performance period
SHARE OWNERSHIP 
GUIDELINES
Proposed increase for 
executive directors
• under the current Policy the Group CEO is required to hold a personal shareholding equal to 200%  
of base salary and other executive directors are required to hold 150% of base salary. Non-
executive directors are required to hold a personal shareholding equal to the value of base fees
• as a result of the 2017 review, to bring the guidelines into line with prevailing best practice, the 
Committee determined that, with effect from 10 September 2017, all executive directors would  
be required to hold a personal shareholding equal to the value of 200% of base salary
• as part of a rebalanced overall remuneration package, with effect from 1 April 2018, the share 
ownership guidelines will be further increased to align to the new LTIP opportunity of 300% for the 
Group CEO and 250% for other executive directors. No changes are proposed to be made to the 
level of shareholding required for non-executive directors
• the required level of shareholding is expected to be achieved within a five year period, commencing 
from the date of appointment or date of change of LTIP opportunity, whichever is the later
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 76 Remuneration Policy
This Report sets out our new Remuneration Policy. We consulted 
shareholders extensively during 2017 when the Policy was being 
formulated for shareholders’ approval. If this Policy is approved  
by shareholders, it will apply from 8 February 2018.
The previous remuneration policy for executive directors applied 
from the date of the 2015 AGM and will continue to apply until the 
2018 AGM. For unvested share awards only, the provisions of the 
Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders in 2015 will 
continue to apply until all long term incentive awards granted under 
that Policy have vested or lapsed.
The Committee reviewed the Company’s remuneration philosophy 
and structure to ensure that remuneration supports the Company’s 
strategic objectives, is in line with best practice and can fairly reward 
individuals for the contribution that they make to the business.  
In doing this, we have regard to the size and complexity of the 
Group’s operations and the need to motivate and attract employees 
of the highest calibre.
Our new Policy is designed to maintain stability in the executive 
team and to ensure appropriate positioning against our comparator 
groups. We believe our approach to be balanced and that it will 
stand the test of time.
The Committee considers general pay and employment conditions  
of all employees within the Group and is sensitive to these, to 
prevailing market and economic conditions and to governance trends 
when assessing the level of salaries and remuneration packages 
of executive directors and other members of the Executive Board.
Remuneration links corporate and individual performance with an 
appropriate balance between short and long term elements, and 
fixed and variable components. The Policy is designed to incentivise 
executives to meet the Company’s key objectives. A significant 
portion of total remuneration is performance related, based on a 
mixture of internal targets linked to the Company’s key business 
drivers which can be measured, understood and accepted by both 
executives and shareholders.
The Committee considers that the targets set for the different 
components of performance related remuneration are both 
appropriate and sufficiently demanding in the context of the business 
environment and the challenges which the Group faces as well as 
complying with the provisions of the Code.
The Committee has the discretion to amend certain aspects of the 
Policy in exceptional circumstances when considered to be in the 
best interests of shareholders. Should such discretion be used,  
this will be explained and reported in the DRR for the following year.

COMPONENT PARTS OF THE REMUNERATION PACKAGE
The key components of executive directors’ remuneration for the period from 8 February 2018 and beyond (the Policy Period) subject to 
shareholder approval are summarised below:
COMPONENT AND LINK  
TO STRATEGY
OPERATION OF COMPONENT MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY PERFORMANCE MEASURES
BASE SALARY
Reflects the individual’s role, 
experience and contribution.  
Set at levels to attract and 
retain individuals of the calibre 
required to lead the business.
Base salaries are reviewed annually with 
any increases normally taking effect on 
1 January of each year. Salaries are 
appropriately benchmarked and reflect 
the role, job size and responsibility  
as well as the performance and 
effectiveness of the individual.
Whilst there is no prescribed formulaic 
maximum, any increases will take into 
account prevailing market and 
economic conditions as well as 
increases for the wider workforce.
Increases may be above this when an 
executive director progresses in the 
role; gains substantially in experience; 
there is a significant increase in the 
scale of the role; or was appointed on 
a salary below the market median. 
These will be appropriately explained 
in the relevant year’s annual report.
None.
BENEFITS  
AND PENSION
To provide a competitive level 
of benefits.
Benefits include, but are not limited  
to, healthcare insurance for executive 
directors and their dependants, limited 
financial advice, life assurance and  
car benefit.
These are offered to executive  
directors as part of a competitive 
remuneration package.
Executive directors are invited to 
participate in the Company’s defined 
contribution pension scheme or to  
take a cash allowance in lieu of  
pension entitlement.
The cost of providing these benefits 
can vary in accordance with market 
conditions, which will, therefore, 
determine the maximum value.
For the Company’s pension cash 
allowance (or pension contribution as 
appropriate), from 1 April 2018 the 
annual maximum will be 20% of base 
salary for new UK appointees and 
35% phasing down to 20% of base 
salary for current UK based executive 
directors. The reduction will take place 
over a three year period commencing 
in January 2019. The annual 
maximum cash allowance for Gary 
Green remains at 35% of base salary.
None.
ANNUAL BONUS
Incentivise and reward the 
achievement of stretching one 
year key performance targets 
set by the Committee at the 
start of each financial year.
The annual bonus is earned by the 
achievement of one year performance 
targets set by the Committee at the start 
of each financial year and is delivered  
in cash or a combination of cash and 
Deferred Bonus Shares.
The Committee retains the discretion  
to adjust the bonus outcomes to  
ensure that they reflect underlying 
business performance.
The annual bonus is subject to malus 
and/or clawback in the event of 
discovery of a material misstatement in 
the accounts or in the assessment of a 
relevant performance condition or where 
the action or conduct of a participant 
amounts to fraud or serious misconduct 
or has a detrimental impact on the 
reputation of the Group. 
The target award for the Group CEO is 
100% of base salary, with a further 
maximum of 100% for enhanced 
performance. No bonus is payable for 
below threshold performance but 
increases on a straight line basis to 
target payout and from target to 
maximum.
The target award for other executive 
directors is 75% of base salary, with  
a further maximum of 75% of base 
salary available for enhanced 
performance. No bonus is payable  
for below threshold performance  
but increases on a straight line  
basis to target payout and from  
target to maximum.
Performance is measured over the financial year. 
Performance measures are determined by the 
Committee each year and may vary to ensure that 
they promote the Company’s business strategy and 
shareholder value.
The performance measures and their percentage 
weightings may vary, depending upon a director’s 
area of responsibility.
Performance measures may include, but are not 
limited to, profit, revenue, margin and cash flow. 
Strategic KPIs may also be chosen. However, the 
overall metrics would always be substantially 
weighted to financial measures.
Annual bonus targets are set with reference to 
internal budgets and analyst consensus forecasts, 
with maximum payout requiring performance well 
ahead of budget.
A bonus underpin may be operated so that the 
bonus outcome is reduced if underpin performance 
is not met.
Bonus will be deferred when share ownership 
guidelines have not been met usually with a 
minimum level of deferral of one third of the  
bonus earned and typically deferred for a period  
of three years.
Dividend equivalents may be accrued on Deferred 
Bonus Shares.
Details of the specific measures and targets applying 
to each element of the bonus for the year being 
reported on are shown in the Annual Remuneration 
Report on page 87.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 78 COMPONENT AND LINK  
TO STRATEGY
OPERATION OF COMPONENT MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY PERFORMANCE MEASURES
LONG TERM 
INCENTIVE  
PLAN (LTIP)
Incentivise and reward 
executive directors for the 
delivery of longer term 
financial performance and 
shareholder value.
Share-based to provide 
alignment with shareholder 
interests.
Return on Capital 
Employed (ROCE)
ROCE supports the strategic 
focus on growth and margin 
through ensuring that cash is 
reinvested to generate strong 
returns with capital discipline.
Adjusted Free Cash  
Flow (AFCF)
The generation of cash is 
fundamental to the ongoing 
success of the Group and the 
use of AFCF as an LTIP 
performance measure directly 
aligns to this.
Relative Total 
Shareholder  
Return (TSR)
The third performance 
measure of TSR provides 
direct alignment between the 
interests of executive directors 
and shareholders.
An annual conditional award of ordinary 
shares which may be earned after a 
single three year performance period, 
based on the achievement of stretching 
performance conditions. Executive 
directors normally hold vested LTIP 
shares (net of any shares sold to meet 
tax and social security liabilities) for a 
period of two years’ post vesting.
Calculations of the achievement of the 
targets are independently performed 
and are approved by the Committee.  
To ensure continued alignment between 
executive directors’ and shareholders’ 
interests, the Committee also reviews 
the underlying financial performance  
of the Group and retains its discretion  
to adjust vesting if it considers that 
performance is unsatisfactory.
Dividend equivalents may be accrued 
on the shares earned from LTIP awards.
Malus and clawback rules operate in 
respect of the LTIP. The Committee may 
decide at any time before an award 
vests, or for a period of three years after 
an award vests, that any participant will 
be subject to malus and/or clawback in 
the event of discovery of a material 
misstatement in the accounts or in the 
assessment of a relevant performance 
condition, or where the action or 
conduct of a participant amounts to 
fraud or serious misconduct or has a 
detrimental impact on the reputation  
of the Group.
Awards are delivered in shares. 
However, the rules contain excepted 
provisions to deliver value in cash if 
necessary (for example, due to 
securities laws), subject to the discretion 
of the Committee, determined at any 
time up to their release.
In the event of a change of control, any 
unvested awards will vest immediately, 
subject to satisfaction of performance 
conditions and reduction on a time 
apportioned basis. 
Awards may be made at the  
following levels of salary:
• Group Chief Executive: 300%
• Other executive directors: 250%
In exceptional circumstances, such  
as the appointment of a new executive 
director, this could be increased to 
400% of base salary. Any use of this 
exceptional limit would be 
appropriately explained.
For performance measures, other than 
TSR, 0% of the award vests for below 
threshold performance, increasing to 
50% vesting on a straight line basis for 
achievement of on target performance, 
increasing to maximum vesting on a 
straight line basis for achievement of 
maximum performance.
The element of an award based on 
relative TSR will vest in full for top 
quartile performance achievement 
and 25% of that element of the award 
will vest if performance is at the 
median. Awards will vest on a straight 
line basis between median and top 
quartile performance achievement. No 
shares will be released for this element 
of an award if the Company’s TSR 
performance is below the median.
Performance is measured over three financial years.
Performance measures are AFCF, ROCE and TSR, 
with each applying 40%, 40% and 20% 
respectively.
Relative TSR is measured relative to the companies 
comprising the TSR comparator group at the start  
of the period.
LTIP targets are set with reference to internal 
budgets and analysts’ consensus forecasts, with 
maximum payment requiring performance well 
ahead of budget.
Details of the targets for LTIP awards vesting and 
granted are set out as required in the Annual 
Remuneration Report on pages 89 and 90.
For awards made prior to 8 February 2018, the 
award was based on AFCF over the three year 
performance period, growth in ROCE and the 
Company’s TSR over the performance period 
relative to the companies comprising the TSR 
comparator group at the start of the relevant period. 
Each measure being equivalent to one third of the 
total award.
NOTES TO THE REMUNERATION POLICY TABLE
The rationale for the changes in the remuneration Policy table is detailed in the introduction from the Chairman of the Committee on  
pages 68 and 69 and in the remuneration Policy review section on page 76.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy (for example for tax, exchange control, regulatory or administrative purposes) 
without obtaining shareholder approval.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy differs from that of other members of the Executive Board solely in respect of quantum of the various 
components and remuneration. Executive directors have a greater proportion of their total remuneration package at risk than other employees; 
however, the structure and principles of incentives are broadly consistent. The wider employee population of the Group will receive 
remuneration that is considered to be appropriate in relation to their geographic location, level of responsibility and performance.
79 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
GOVERNANCE CLOSED INCENTIVE PLANS
It is proposed that the LTIP described in the table on page 79 (to be 
known as The Compass Group PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2018) 
will, subject to shareholder approval, be the primary form of equity 
incentive for executive directors in future years. At the date of this 
Report, there are outstanding awards covering 1,625,718 shares 
which have been made to executive directors under the current long 
term incentive plan, being The Compass Group PLC Long Term 
Incentive Plan 2010.
DILUTION LIMITS
All of the Company’s equity based incentive plans incorporate the 
current Investment Association Share Capital Management 
Guidelines (IA Guidelines) on headroom which provide that overall 
dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a 10 year 
period in relation to the Company’s issued share capital (or reissue 
of treasury shares), with a further limitation of 5% in any 10 year 
period for executive plans.
The Committee monitors the position regularly, and prior to the 
making of any award, to ensure that the Company remains within 
these limits. Any awards which are required to be satisfied by 
market purchased shares are excluded from such calculations. On 
30 September 2017, the Company held 8,228,176 treasury shares. 
During the financial year ended 30 September 2017, 3,013,283 
treasury shares were utilised for satisfying the Company’s obligations 
under the Group’s employee equity incentive schemes. As at 30 
September 2017, the Company’s headroom position, which remains 
within the current IA Guidelines, was as shown in the charts below:
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
In order that their interests are linked with those of shareholders, 
directors are expected to build up and maintain a personal 
shareholding in the Company.
As a result of the Remuneration Policy review, and to bring the 
share ownership guidelines (the guidelines) into line with prevailing 
best practice, the Committee determined that, with effect from 
10 September 2017, all executive directors will be required to hold 
a personal shareholding equal to the value of 200% of their annual 
base salary in shares. All of the executive directors in office at the 
date of this change met this requirement.
As part of a rebalanced overall remuneration package, and subject to 
shareholder approval of the new Policy, with effect from 1 April 2018, 
the requirement for the Group CEO will increase to a personal 
shareholding of 300% of base salary and 250% for all other 
executive directors. No changes are proposed to be made to the level 
of shareholding required for non-executive directors which remains 
as a personal shareholding equal to the value of their base fee.
The guideline shareholding may be achieved by executive directors 
retaining shares received as a result of participating in the 
Company’s share plans. The guideline specifically excludes the need 
to make a personal investment should awards not vest. Non-
executive directors are generally expected to purchase shares 
equating to a minimum value of one third of their net of tax fee each 
year until the guideline is met. The required level of executive 
shareholding is expected to be achieved within a five year period, 
commencing from the date of appointment or date of change of 
LTIP opportunity, whichever is the later.
Directors’ shareholdings are reviewed annually by the Committee  
to ensure that directors are on course to achieve their guideline 
shareholding within the period required. However, if it becomes 
apparent to the Committee that the guideline is unlikely to be met 
within the timeframe, then the Committee will discuss with the 
director a plan to ensure that the guideline is met over an acceptable 
timeframe. The granting of future LTIP awards to an executive 
director will be conditional upon reaching the appropriate threshold 
in the required timeframe. Where executive directors have not 
achieved the minimum guideline effective for the period, one third 
of their cash bonus will be deferred into shares for three years.
Details of the interests of directors in shares and equity incentives 
are set out on page 93, together with the extent to which each of 
the directors has complied with the current guidelines as at 
30 September 2017.

Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 80 ILLUSTRATIONS OF APPLICATION OF THE NEW REMUNERATION POLICY
The graphs below show an estimate of the remuneration that could be received by executive directors in office at 1 April 2018 under the 
Policy set out in this Report for 2017-2018. Each bar gives an indication of the minimum amount of remuneration payable, remuneration 
payable at target and at maximum performance to each director under the Policy. As the proposed Policy provides for a rebalanced overall 
remuneration package which would be implemented following a change in executive leadership, the graphs below illustrate the elements 
of the Policy which would be applicable following its approval at the 2018 AGM.
Each of the bars is broken down to show how the total under each scenario is made up of fixed elements of remuneration, the annual bonus 
and the LTIP.
The scenarios in the above graphs are defined as follows:
FIXED ELEMENTS OF REMUNERATION • fixed pay includes annual base salary, pension and benefits
• annual base salary as at 1 April 2018
• value of benefits as noted in the single figure table on page 85
• pension cash allowance as at 1 April 2018 at the proposed Policy level

GOVERNANCE APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION
The Committee will apply the same remuneration policy during the 
Policy Period as that which applies to existing executive directors 
when considering the recruitment of a new executive director in 
respect of most elements of remuneration, that is: base salary, 
pension and benefits, and short and long term incentives. New UK 
executive directors will, however, be provided with a pension cash 
allowance (or contribution) of 20% of base salary in line with the 
level of pension provided to Compass UK management. It is 
envisaged that the maximum level of variable remuneration which 
may be granted to a new executive director would be within plan 
rules and identical to the Policy maximum opportunity for existing 
executive directors and the Group CEO. However, in exceptional 
circumstances such as the recruitment of a new executive director, 
a maximum LTIP award of up to 400% of base salary may be 
awarded. Additionally, to support the successful building up of 
a shareholding in compliance with the revised share ownership 
guidelines, executives will also be required to have one third of 
their annual bonus deferred into shares when the share ownership 
guideline is not achieved. The required level of shareholding is 
expected to be achieved within a five year period, commencing 
from the date of appointment or date of change of LTIP opportunity, 
whichever is the later.
Other arrangements may be established specifically to facilitate 
recruitment of a particular individual, albeit that any such 
arrangement would be made within the context of minimising the 
cost to the Company. The policy for the recruitment of executive 
directors during the Policy Period includes the facility to provide 
a level of compensation for forfeiture of bonus entitlements and/or 
unvested long term incentive awards from an existing employer,  
if any, and the additional provision of benefits in kind, pensions and 
other allowances, such as relocation, education and tax equalisation, 
as may be required in order to achieve a successful recruitment. 
Any arrangement established specifically to facilitate the recruitment 
of a particular individual would be intended to be of comparable 
form, timing, commercial value and capped as appropriate. The 
quantum, form and structure of any buyout arrangement will be 
determined by the Committee taking into account the terms of the 
previous arrangement being forfeited. The buyout may be structured 
as an award of cash or shares. However, the Committee will 
normally have a preference for replacement awards to be made in 
the form of shares, deliverable no earlier than the previous awards. 
Where an executive director is appointed from either within the 
Company or following corporate activity/reorganisation, the normal 
policy would be to honour any legacy incentive arrangements to run 
off in line with the original terms and conditions.
The policy on the recruitment of new non-executive directors during 
the Policy Period would be to apply the same remuneration elements 
as for the existing non-executive directors. It is not intended that 
variable pay, cash supplements, day rates or benefits in kind be 
offered, although in exceptional circumstances such remuneration 
may be required in currently unforeseen circumstances.
The Committee will include in annual reports details of the 
implementation of the Policy as utilised during the Policy Period  
in respect of any such recruitment to the Board.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ SERVICE AGREEMENTS
It is the Company’s policy that executive directors have rolling 
service contracts.
The current executive directors’ service contracts contain the key 
terms shown in the table below:
SERVICE CONTRACT KEY TERMS BY PROVISION
PROVISION DETAILED TERMS
REMUNERATION • base salary, pension and benefits
• company car or cash allowance
• family private health insurance 
• life assurance
• financial planning advice
• 25 days’ paid annual leave
• participation in the annual bonus plan, 
subject to plan rules
• participation in the LTIP, subject to  
plan rules
CHANGE OF 
CONTROL
• no special contractual provisions apply  
in the event of a change of control
NOTICE PERIOD • 12 months’ notice from the Company
• 6 months’ notice from the director 
(12 months from Richard Cousins and 
Dominic Blakemore)
TERMINATION 
PAYMENT
Payment in lieu of notice equal to:
• 12 months’ base salary
• pension supplement
• 10% of base salary in respect of benefits
All of the above would be paid in monthly 
instalments, subject to an obligation on the 
part of the director to mitigate his loss such 
that payments will either reduce, or cease 
completely, in the event that the director 
gains new employment/remuneration 
RESTRICTIVE 
COVENANTS
• during employment and for 12 months 
after leaving
The historic policy on the payment of bonus on termination, which 
was in place prior to June 2008, was the provision of a payment,  
at par or target, of bonus in respect of the notice period, where the 
Company exercised its right to make a payment in lieu of notice. 
Messrs Cousins and Green’s service contracts are based on this 
historic policy. When introducing the revised policy in June 2008 
and after careful consideration, the Committee concluded that it 
was not in shareholders’ interests to migrate such contracts onto the 
amended policy. Dominic Blakemore and Johnny Thomson’s service 
contracts fully comply with the policy in effect from June 2008. All 
executive directors’ service contracts impose a clear obligation to 
mitigate such payment should a departing executive director take on 
new employment or receive alternative remuneration.
All of the executive directors’ service contracts, with the exception 
of that of Johnny Thomson who was appointed to the Board on 
1 December 2015, and Dominic Blakemore whose service contract 
was restated with effect from 1 October 2017, were entered into 
GOVERNANCE AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Remuneration Policy continued
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 82 before 27 June 2012 and have not been modified or renewed on  
or after that date. As such, remuneration payments or payments  
for loss of office that are required to be made under them are not 
required to be (but are) consistent with the current and proposed 
Policy. Johnny Thomson and Dominic Blakemore’s service contracts 
fully comply with the current and, subject to its adoption, the 
proposed Policy.
Whilst unvested awards will normally lapse, the Committee may in  
its absolute discretion allow for awards to continue until the normal 
vesting date and be satisfied or to be accelerated (for example 
on death), subject to achievement of the attendant performance 
conditions. In such circumstances, awards vesting will normally  
be prorated on a time apportioned basis, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise.
Any such discretion in respect of leavers would only be applied by 
the Committee to ‘good leavers’ where it considers that continued 
participation is justified, for example, by reference to performance 
prior to the date of leaving. The malus and clawback provisions would 
continue to apply in the event that any such discretion was exercised.
Service contracts outline the components of remuneration paid to 
the individual but do not prescribe how remuneration levels may be 
adjusted from year to year.
The senior executives who are members of the Executive Board, and 
who are referred to in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 
on page 125, have similar service contracts.
The executive directors in office at the date of this Report have 
served on the Board for the periods shown below and have service 
agreements dated as follows:

* Appointment was formally revised from 1 October 2017.
CHAIRMAN
The fee for the Chairman is reviewed annually by the Committee 
with any increase taking effect on 1 October. In addition to his 
annual fee, the Chairman is paid a cash sum in lieu of provision by 
the Company of a car and chauffeur for use on Company business. 
The Chairman is not entitled to any benefits in kind and is not 
eligible for pension scheme membership, bonus or incentive 
arrangements. The Chairman’s appointment is terminable without 
compensation on six months’ notice from either side. Following 
consideration by the Committee, the Chairman’s fee of £510,000 
per annum was increased to £540,000 per annum from 
1 October 2017. The £50,000 cash sum in lieu of the provision of a 
car and chauffeur was removed from such date and costs in relation 
to business and commuting will be reimbursed.
The Chairman has a letter of engagement dated 19 June 2013 in 
respect of his original appointment as a non-executive director for  
a period of three years from 1 January 2014. Mr Walsh became 
Chairman at the conclusion of the Company’s AGM on 6 February 
2014. Mr Walsh completed his first three year term as Chairman on 
6 February 2017. This was extended on 21 September 2016 for a 
further three year term.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
The fees for the non-executive directors are reviewed and 
determined by the Board each year to reflect appropriate market 
conditions and may be increased if considered appropriate.
No increase was effected during the year under review. The fees for 
the year ended 30 September 2017 comprised a base fee of £84,000 
per annum, which includes membership of the Audit, Corporate 
Responsibility, Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
Subject to a cap on the maximum amount of fees payable to any 
non-executive director of £125,000 per annum, an additional fee  
of £27,000, £25,000 and £15,000 per annum is payable where a 
non-executive director acts as Chairman of the Audit, Remuneration 
or Corporate Responsibility Committee respectively. An additional 
fee of £27,000 per annum is also payable to the director nominated 
as Senior Independent Director (SID). Non-executive directors are 
not eligible for pension scheme membership, bonus, incentive 
arrangements or other benefits, save reimbursement of travel costs. 
Following a market review, with effect from 1 October 2017, the 
annual fees payable for chairing the Audit, Remuneration and 
Corporate Responsibility Committees were increased to £30,000, 
£30,000 and £20,000 per annum respectively and to £30,000 per 
annum for the director nominated as the SID.
Non-executive directors have letters of engagement setting out their 
duties and the time commitment expected. They are appointed for 
an initial period of three years, after which the appointment is 
renewable at three year intervals by mutual consent. In accordance 
with the Code, all directors offer themselves for annual re-election by 
shareholders. Details of non-executive directors’ (in office at the date 
of this Report) appointments, which are terminable without 
compensation, are set out in the table below, together with the dates

PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION OF  
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
In the year ended 30 September 2017, Mr Cousins received 2.6% 
salary more and 17.8% bonus less than the equivalent amounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016. He received 7.7% more 
in taxable benefits in 2016-2017 than in the previous year. The 
percentage changes for all full-time equivalent employees based 
in the UK were nil, (2.3)% and 1.9% respectively. The UK employee 
workforce was chosen as the most suitable comparator group as 
Mr Cousins is based in the UK and pay changes across the Group 
vary widely depending on local market conditions. However, 
the nature of Mr Cousins’ global role and responsibilities makes 
meaningful comparisons with any group of employees difficult 
and due caution should be exercised in this regard. We 
acknowledge a growing desire for companies to disclose pay  
ratios. We are committed to such a disclosure, albeit creating 
a meaningful disclosure with more than 550,000 employees 
in around 50 countries is complex.

subsequently cancelled 1,340,344 ordinary shares of 10
5
⁄8 pence for a 
consideration of £19 million (including expenses). On 14 June 2017, a further 
35 ordinary shares of 10

of 11
1
⁄20 pence in issue and 8,182,749 ordinary shares of 11
1

in treasury for the purpose of satisfying the Company’s obligations under 
employee equity incentive schemes. Shares held in treasury are not eligible 
to participate in dividends and do not carry any voting rights.
2. The total dividend paid during the year ended 30 September 2016 was  
£496 million and share capital in issue on that date was 1,654 million ordinary 
shares of 10
5
⁄8 pence each. The total dividend paid during the year ended 
30 September 2017 (excluding the Shareholder Return) was £531 million 
and the share capital in issue on that date was 1,589 million ordinary shares 
of 11
1
⁄20 pence. The full year dividend per ordinary share for the year ended 
30 September 2017 increased by 5.7%.
3. The Company returned approximately £1 billion to shareholders in July 2017 
by way of a special dividend. This was accompanied by the Share Capital 
Consolidation referred to in note 1 above.
4. Total employee costs includes wages and salaries, social security costs, 
share-based payments and pension costs for all employees, including 
directors. The average number of employees, including directors and part-time 
employees in operations during 2017 was 588,112 (2016: 527,180).

7. LTIP 2017: the amount shown is the indicative value based on the average market price of Compass Group PLC shares over the three month period from 1 July to  
30 September 2017 (1,615 pence) of LTIPs that have become receivable as a result of the achievement of conditions relating to the performance in the three years 
ended 30 September 2017.
8. LTIP award vested in 2016: the amount shown is the indicative value based on the average market price of Compass Group PLC shares over the three month period 
from 1 July to 30 September 2016. The actual value subsequently received by Messrs Blakemore, Cousins and Green based on a sales price of £13.530862 on  
23 November 2016 was £892,482, £2,393,637 and £1,389,985 respectively. Mr Thomson disposed of 5,796 shares on the same day at a sales price of £13.530862  
for which he received £78,425 to settle tax and social security obligations. Theoretically, if Mr Thomson had chosen to sell all of the resulting shares, he would have 
received the notional value of £516,351. Theoretically, if all of the directors had chosen to dispose of their LTIP awards which vested in 2016 in full, this would have 
equated to a combined total of £5,192,455 which is approximately £427,000 less than the indicative value reported.
9. Mr Thomson had an interest in 10,622 shares that were awarded conditionally in connection with a ‘below board’ plan prior to his appointment as a director of the 
Company. These vested on 29 November 2016. Mr Thomson elected to keep these shares (net of those sold to settle resulting tax and social security obligations). 
Had Mr Thomson sold his shares, he would have received a notional gain of £146,584 which is based on the closing share price of 1,380.00 pence per share at the 
date prior to the release of his award.

1. Johnny Thomson was appointed to the Board on 1 December 2015. Prior to the appointment being made, the Committee asked PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to 
perform a benchmarking review of salaries for peer roles in FTSE 50 companies (excluding the financial service sector). In line with the Policy in operation at that time, 
the Committee adopted a balanced approach when determining the level of remuneration to be paid, having regard to the findings of the benchmarking report and 
bearing in mind that it was Mr Thomson’s first role as a Group Finance Director of a listed company. His base salary on appointment was set at £575,000 per annum, 
below the median for comparable FTSE 50 roles, with the aim of making incremental increases if considered appropriate to reflect experience and progression in the 
role and to bring Mr Thomson’s base salary in line with that of his FTSE peers. 
The proposed annual rate of base salaries of the executive directors in office as at the effective dates set out below are:

2016-2017 BONUS
The financial targets for the bonus for the year ended 30 September 2017, and the extent to which they were achieved, were as set out on 
page 87. It is intended to continue to disclose Group and regional targets, as set out below, on a retrospective basis. The achievement of 
targets is calculated on a straight line basis between Minimum and Target (par) and between Target (par) and Maximum.
As was the case for previous years, the measurement of the achievement of the AFCF and PBIT results is based on the underlying outcome 
achieved in the financial year, with gains/losses attributable to currency movements, charges and the impacts of restructuring and/or 
acquisitions/disposals usually being excluded.

Notes to tables
1. Financial measures for 2016-2017 bonus purposes are all set at 2017 foreign exchange budget rates, not actuals.
2. PBIT is underlying Profit Before Interest and Tax (Group).
3. AFCF is Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Group).
4. ORG is Organic Revenue Growth (Group).
5. RPBIT is underlying Profit Before Interest and Tax for Region of responsibility.
6. MAWC is 10 months/12 months Average Working Capital Balance for region of responsibility for Mr Green and Mr Blakemore respectively. The 2016-2017 target for 
Mr Green for MAWC is based on an improvement in the value of MAWC over the period of 10 months.
7. RORG is Organic Revenue Growth for Region of responsibility.
8. Messrs Blakemore, Cousins, Green and Thomson’s entitlements to any bonus related to the achievement of AFCF and PBIT were adjusted, in accordance with the 
established framework to exclude all unbudgeted M&A spend together with routine restructuring costs.
9. HSE for the North American business is measured through North American underlying PBIT.
10. Messrs Blakemore, Cousins and Thomson’s entitlements to bonus related to the achievement of LTIFR related targets were reduced to zero to recognise that the Group 
had suffered two fatalities during the year in its Europe business which had occurred whilst each employee had been at work, albeit that management were not 
considered to be culpable. This recognises the seriousness with which the Company takes HSE outcomes.
11. Mr Blakemore’s bonus in respect of MAWC and Group PBIT was reduced to par, owing to the RPBIT measure not being achieved at minimum.
87 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
GOVERNANCE 2016-2017 BONUS PAYOUT
The outcome of the annual bonus for the year ended 30 September 2017 was due to the continued strong underlying financial performance 
aligned with the delivery of the Group’s long term strategy. The table below shows the resulting payout to each executive director in office 
during the year in such capacity:

The Committee has set the targets for the annual bonus plan for the year ending 30 September 2018 but has chosen not to disclose the 
details in this Report, as it is the opinion of the Committee that it may be seriously prejudicial to the interests of the Company to do so, and 
our major competitors do not disclose their targets or projected forecasts. However, the specific targets and the extent to which the targets 
have been met (both at Group and Regional levels) will be disclosed in next year’s Report.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS
During the year ended 30 September 2017, executive directors received a conditional award of shares which may vest after a three year 
performance period which will end on 30 September 2019, based on the achievement of stretching performance conditions.  
The maximum levels achievable under these awards are set out in the table below:
DIRECTOR
LTIP AWARD  
(AS A % OF BASE SALARY)
FACE VALUE OF AWARD
1
£000
Dominic Blakemore 200% 1,280
Richard Cousins 250% 2,612
Gary Green 200% 1,820
Johnny Thomson 200% 1,150
    6,862
1. Face value of award as at the date of grant on 23 November 2016 is based on the closing market price of 1,326.00 pence per share on 22 November 2016.
Executive directors are required to hold vested awards for a period of two years following vesting so as to further strengthen the long term 
alignment of executives’ remuneration packages with shareholders’ interests and, if required, to facilitate the implementation of provisions 
related to malus and clawback.
GOVERNANCE AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Annual Remuneration Report continued
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 88 The table below sets out the performance measures for the awards under the Policy in operation during the financial year under review:
DEFINITION OF MEASURE
ROCE The definition aims to measure the underlying economic performance of the Company. ROCE is calculated at the end of the three 
year performance period as net underlying operating profit after tax (NOPAT) divided by 12 month average capital employed (see page 195 
for full definitions).
Adjusted FCF The definition aims to measure the cash generation of the Company and is calculated as the three year cumulative underlying 
FCF (see page 195 for full definition) adjusted for constant currency.
TSR Performance is compared to that of constituent members of the FTSE 100 (excluding the financial service sector). TSR is the aggregate 
of share price growth and dividends paid (assuming reinvestment of those dividends in the Company’s shares during the three year 
performance period).
In setting the performance targets, the Committee considers internal budgets and the Group’s strategic plan, market expectations and general 
economic conditions. The table below shows the targets against which performance has been measured to determine the vesting of the grant 
of awards for the year ended 30 September 2017 and forms part of the Policy detailed in the Policy Report on pages 62 to 68 of the 2016 
Annual Report and Accounts.

LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN PERFORMANCE
23.5% of the ROCE, 100% of the AFCF and 100% of the TSR performance measures were achieved at the end of the three year performance 
period, such that 74.5% of the LTIP awards made during the 2014-2015 financial year vested. Shares will be delivered to individuals following 
the release of the preliminary results for the year ended 30 September 2017. The Committee applied the established framework to deal with 
items that were unforeseen at the time the targets were set in 2014-2015 and which were in the long term interests of shareholders. AFCF was 
adjusted to exclude a payroll timing distortion, a one-off supplementary contribution to the US pension plan and restructuring in the Defence, 
Offshore & Remote business. AFCF was also adjusted to reflect the reduction in pension deficit contributions to the UK pension scheme to 
ensure management did not benefit from this reduction. Both the ROCE and AFCF measures were adjusted to exclude a one-off capital 
investment in the Defence, Offshore & Remote business and restructuring in Europe to reflect trading conditions.

The table below shows the targets against which performance will be measured to determine the vesting of the grant of awards to be made  
in the year ending 30 September 2018 and forms part of the Policy detailed in the Policy Report on pages 77 to 79 which is intended to be

The vesting of the shares under each performance condition is independent. Therefore, the total vesting amount is based on the relevant 
percentage achievement for each performance measure. Awards vest on a straight line basis between Threshold and Par and between Par 
and Maximum. If performance under a component does not exceed the Threshold level, vesting for that component will be nil. At the end of 
the performance period, the Committee will review the underlying financial performance of the Company and retains its discretion to adjust 
vesting if it considers that financial performance is unsatisfactory.
The Committee considers the measures and targets set in respect of 2017-2018 to be appropriate and challenging. Calculations of the 
achievement of the targets will be independently performed and approved by the Committee. The Committee retains discretion to adjust  
for material events which occur during the performance period and the nature of any such adjustments will be disclosed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, together with details of the achieved ROCE, AFCF and TSR performance, as determined by the above definitions,

1. One third of each award granted is based on a three year performance period, one third on a ROCE target, one third on AFCF and one third on growth in the 
Company’s TSR relative to the FTSE 100, excluding the financial service sector. The performance period of the award granted on 29 November 2013 came to an 
end on 30 September 2016. This award vested in part at 84.5% of the maximum award. The shares disclosed as lapsed during the year represent the proration of 
the original award.
2. The aggregate gross gain realised by Messrs Blakemore, Cousins and Green in the year ended 30 September 2017 was £4,676,104 (2015-2016: £4,233,227) based 
on a sale price of 1,353.0862 pence per share on 23 November 2016. So as to continue to build up his holding in accordance with the Company’s share ownership 
guidelines, Mr Thomson elected to sell only sufficient shares released to him under the 2013-2014 LTIP to meet tax and social security obligations arising on vesting 
of his awards for which he made £78,425 (based on a sale price of 1,353.0862 pence per share on 23 November 2016). Had he elected to sell all his vested shares, 
he would have made a notional gross gain of £516,351. The closing share price on the day preceding the release of their awards was 1,326.00 pence per share.
3. The performance period of the award granted on 6 February 2015, came to an end on 30 September 2017. The award vested in part at 74.5% of maximum award.
4. All awards were granted for nil consideration.
5. The highest mid-market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year ended 30 September 2017 was 1,690 pence per share and the lowest was 1,318 pence 
per share. The year end price was 1,583 pence per share.
6. As detailed in note 9 on page 85, Mr Thomson had an interest in 10,622 shares which were awarded in connection with a ‘below board’ plan prior to his appointment as a 
director of the Company. These shares vested on 29 November 2016. Mr Thomson elected to keep all of these shares. Had Mr Thomson sold his 10,622 shares he would 
have made the notional gross gain of £146,584 based on a closing price of 1,380.00 per pence on 28 November 2016 the date preceding the release of his award.

GOVERNANCE PENSIONS
At 30 September 2017, there were no executive directors actively participating in any Compass Group defined benefit pension arrangements 
and none of the executive directors were accruing additional entitlement to benefit under any arrangements that existed prior to their 
appointment as executive directors.
Since their appointment, and for the year under review, Dominic Blakemore, Richard Cousins, Gary Green and Johnny Thomson each 
received a pension cash allowance equal to 35% of their base salaries in lieu of pension.
EXIT PAYMENTS
As announced on 21 September 2017, Richard Cousins will step down from the Board and his role as Group CEO on 31 March 2018 and  
will retire from the Group on 30 September 2018. Mr Cousins will be entitled to the payments detailed below under his service contract.  
No payment for compensation for loss of office is to be paid.
RICHARD COUSINS
Mr Cousins will continue to receive salary, pension cash allowance and benefits in respect of the period up to and including 30 September 
2018, which comprises his notice period. Mr Cousins will also receive payment in respect of any accrued but untaken holiday as at  
30 September 2018, calculated in accordance with his service contract. Mr Cousins’ base salary for the year ending 30 September 2018 will 
remain at £1,070,000. His benefits for the year ended 30 September 2017 were £42,000. It is expected that his benefits in kind for the year 
ending 30 September 2018 will be of a similar amount to the year ended 30 September 2017.
Mr Cousins will remain eligible for a bonus in respect of the financial year ending 30 September 2018, to be paid at the same time as other 
participants in the Executive Bonus Scheme, and subject to the same financial and business performance conditions being met. Mr Cousins’ 
bonus payment for the year ended 30 September 2017 was £1,474,032. The amount for bonus in respect of the year ending 30 September 
2018 will depend on corporate results for the year and cannot be estimated at the date of this Report.
Existing awards under The Compass Group PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2010 will be allowed to remain outstanding until their normal 
vesting dates in accordance with the plan rules. The extent of vesting of each award will be assessed on the normal vesting date, based on 
existing performance conditions and subject to time prorating based on the period to 30 September 2018 (the date on which his employment 
ends). Thus, the awards made in respect of the performance period October 2014 to September 2017 (over 221,475 shares) will vest subject 
to achievement of the original performance conditions. Mr Cousins will be entitled to retain the award (over 234,804 shares) made in respect 
of the performance period October 2015 to September 2018 which will vest subject to achievement of the original performance conditions.  
He will be entitled to retain a reduced award (over 131,320 shares) in respect of the performance period October 2016 to September 2019, 
prorated to 30 September 2018 and which will vest subject to achievement of the original performance conditions. The two year post vesting 
holding period for all outstanding awards will continue to apply. No further awards of any long term incentives will be received by Mr Cousins.
ANDREW MARTIN
As set out on page 77 of the 2016 Annual Report, in accordance with the provisions of his service contract (which was entered into in 2007 
before the Company’s policy with regard to the inclusion of bonus in termination payments was changed in 2008 so as to exclude them) 
Andrew Martin, who stepped down from the Board on 1 December 2015, continued to be employed by the Company until 31 December 
2016. Mr Martin was entitled to receive a maximum of £1,472,900 as set out in the 2016 Annual Report, of which £583,628 was paid in the 
three months ended 31 December 2016.
SUSAN MURRAY
Susan Murray stepped down from the Board and its committees at the conclusion of the 2017 AGM. Other than the fees payable to  
Mrs Murray for the period up to 2 February 2017, no remuneration or payment was made to her in connection with her ceasing to be a 
director of the Company. 
No other payments were made during the year ended 30 September 2017 to any past director of the Company. On the relevant dates 
statements prepared pursuant to section 430(2B) of the CA 2006 are posted on the Company’s website at www.compass-group.com.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
Executive directors may take up one non-executive directorship outside of the Group subject to the Board’s approval, provided that such 
appointment is not likely to lead to a conflict of interest. It is recognised that non-executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge 
which can benefit the Company. Richard Cousins stepped down as a non-executive director of Tesco PLC on 3 January 2017. His fees  
of £31,319 reflect his time in office during the year in respect of his directorship of that company, which he was permitted to retain.  
Mr Blakemore received fees of €169,843 in respect of his directorship of Shire plc. At the date of this Report, neither Gary Green nor  
Johnny Thomson hold any external appointments.

GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION OF OTHER SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND MANAGEMENT
A number of senior executives and the executive directors comprise the Executive Board. These key management roles influence the ability  
of the Group to meet its strategic targets. The Committee has regard to the remuneration level and structure of this group. Total remuneration 
including base salary and other short term benefits, target (or par) bonus and the expected value of long term incentives is summarised in 
note 3 to the consolidated financial statements on page 125.
REMUNERATION ADVICE
The Chairman and the Group Chief Executive, together with Robin Mills (Group HR Director) and Lorna Benton (Group Reward Director) 
are normally invited to attend each Committee meeting and provide advice and guidance to the Committee (other than in respect of their 
own remuneration) for which they are not paid a fee in addition to their remuneration from the Company under their service contracts. 
Details of the members of the Committee who served during the year ended 30 September 2017 are set out on pages 48 and 49.
The Committee also has access to detailed external information and research on market data and trends from independent consultants. 
During the year and after a competitive tender process, the Committee retained WillisTowersWatson LLP (WTW) to advise on remuneration 
related matters, including the Remuneration Policy review, as well as undertaking a benchmarking exercise in respect of the remuneration  
of the Chairman and executive directors for which it received total fees (based on hours spent) of £167,000. WTW provided services globally 
which comprised remuneration benchmarking, insurance brokerage and other consultancy advice.
Alithos Limited (Alithos) was appointed by the Company in 2002. Alithos provided information for the testing of the TSR performance 
conditions for the Company’s LTIP awards, for which it received fixed fees of £24,000 (2016: £24,000). It also provided the TSR performance 
graph for the Directors’ Remuneration Report, for which it received a fixed fee of £500 (2016: £500). Alithos did not provide any other advice 
or services to the Company during the year.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice it received during the year was objective and independent, based on the experience of its members 
generally, including Carol Arrowsmith, Chairman of the Committee, who was formerly a remuneration consultant with Deloitte LLP.

reinvestment plan (DRIP) is available. The latest date for receipt of elections 
for the DRIP is 5 February 2018.
On 10 May 2017, the Company announced that it proposed to 
return approximately £1 billion to shareholders by way of a special 
dividend of 61.0 pence per then existing ordinary share of 10
5
⁄8 
pence each in the capital of the Company (existing ordinary shares) 
(the Shareholder Return) which would be accompanied by the 
consolidation of every 26 then existing ordinary shares into 25 new 
ordinary shares of 11
1
⁄20 pence each (new ordinary shares) (the 
Share Capital Consolidation). At a general meeting of shareholders 
held on 7 June 2017 (2017 GM), shareholders voted by a majority 
of 99.99% in favour of the resolution to approve the Shareholder 
Return and the Share Capital Consolidation.
The Share Capital Consolidation took place on 26 June 2017 and 
the new ordinary shares were subsequently admitted to the Official 
List of the UK Listing Authority and commenced trading on the 
London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities after 
8.00 am on 27 June 2017.
The 2017 interim dividend of 11.2 pence per existing ordinary share 
(2016: 10.6 pence) was paid to shareholders on 19 June 2017.
The special dividend of 61.0 pence per share was paid on 17 July 
2017 to shareholders in connection with the Shareholder Return.
Payment of the recommended final dividend for the year ended 
30 September 2017, if approved at the 2018 AGM, will be made 
on 26 February 2018 to shareholders registered at the close 
of business on 19 January 2018. The shares will be quoted 
ex-dividend from 18 January 2018.
During the year, the trustees of each of the employee benefit trusts 
which operate in connection with the Company’s share plans waived 
their rights to receive dividends on any shares held by them. Details 
of the trusts can be found on page 97 of this Report. The amount of 
dividends waived during the year ended 30 September 2017 in 
relation to the trusts was £15,113 (2016: £7,725).

11
1
⁄20 pence shares held in treasury for the purpose of satisfying the 
Company’s obligations under the Company’s employee equity 
incentive schemes. Shares held in treasury are not entitled to receive 
dividends. Therefore, £8,262,774 (2016: £3,737,324) worth of 
dividends were not paid during the financial year in relation to 
treasury shares. A dividend reinvestment plan is available to eligible 
shareholders. Details can be found on page 182.

shares have been used to satisfy awards under these schemes since 
the end of the financial year to the date of this Report.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the 
capital of the Company other than certain restrictions which may 
from time to time be imposed by law, for example, insider trading 
law. In accordance with the EU Market Abuse Regulation, certain 
employees are required to seek the approval of the Company to deal 
in its shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders 
that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/or 
voting rights.
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended by 
special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders.
The Company is not aware of any significant agreements to which 
it is party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control 
of the Company following a takeover.
More detailed information relating to the rights and obligations 
attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, in addition to those 
conferred by law, are set out in the Company’s Articles of 
Association, which are available on the Company’s website as well

REPURCHASE OF SHARES
From 1 October 2016 to 21 April 2017, the Company repurchased 
and subsequently cancelled 1,340,344 ordinary shares of 10
5
⁄8 
pence for a consideration of £19 million (including expenses).
On 14 June 2017, 35 ordinary shares of 10
5
⁄8 pence were 
repurchased for a consideration of £582 (including expenses) 
in relation to the Shareholder Return and associated Share Capital 
Consolidation. Of the 35 shares repurchased, 10 were placed into 
treasury and the remaining 25 shares were subsequently cancelled.
No shares were repurchased between 15 June 2017 and  
30 September 2017. No further shares have been repurchased  
in the period from 1 October to the date of this Report.
As at the date of this Report there are 1,589,736,625 ordinary 
shares of 11
1
⁄20 pence in issue and 8,182,749 ordinary shares 
of 11
1
⁄20 pence held in treasury for the purpose of satisfying the 
Company’s obligations under employee equity incentive schemes. 
Shares held in treasury are not eligible to participate in dividends 
and do not carry any voting rights.
Returns to shareholders continue to be an integral part of our 
business model and it is the Board’s intention to continue to 
maintain strong investment grade credit ratings by returning any 
surplus cash.
At the 2018 AGM, a special resolution will be proposed to renew 
the directors’ limited authority to repurchase ordinary shares in 
the market, last granted at the 2017 GM. The directors consider 
it desirable for this general authorisation to be available in order 
to maintain an efficient capital structure whilst at the same time 
retaining the flexibility to fund any infill acquisitions.
The authority sets the minimum and maximum prices which may be 
paid and it will be limited to a maximum of 10% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital calculated at the latest practicable date 
prior to the publication of the Notice of AGM. Any purchases of 
ordinary shares will be by means of market purchases through the 
London Stock Exchange and any shares purchased may be 
cancelled or placed into treasury in accordance with the Companies 
(Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares) Regulations 2003.
GOVERNANCE AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
OTHER STATUTORY DISCLOSURES CONTINUED
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 96 ISSUE OF SHARES
At the 2018 AGM, the directors will ask shareholders to renew the 
authority last granted to them at the 2017 GM to allot equity shares 
representing approximately one third of the issued ordinary shares 
calculated at the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the 
Notice of AGM (the section 551 authority) and, in accordance with 
the Investment Association Share Capital Management Guidelines, 
the directors again propose to extend this by a further one third of 
the Company’s issued ordinary share capital, provided that such 
amount shall only be used in connection with a rights issue. If 
approved, the authority will expire no later than 15 months from the 
date on which the resolution is passed, or at the conclusion of the 
AGM to be held in 2019, whichever is the sooner.
The limited power granted to the directors at the 2017 GM to allot 
equity shares for cash other than pro rata to existing shareholders 
expires no later than 6 September 2018. Subject to the terms of the 
section 551 authority, this authority is in line with the Statement of 
Principles on Pre-emption Rights issued by the Pre-Emption Group 
and supported by the Investment Association and the Pensions and 
Lifetime Savings Association (the Principles). If granted, this 
authority will give the directors the ability (until the AGM to be held 
in 2019) to issue ordinary shares for cash, other than pro rata to 
existing shareholders, in connection with a rights issue or up to a 
limit of 5% of the issued ordinary share capital (whether or not in 
connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment) 
calculated at the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the 
Notice of AGM. In accordance with the Principles, the directors 
propose to extend this by an additional 5% of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital calculated at the latest practicable date prior 
to the publication of the Notice of AGM, provided that the additional 
authority would only be used for the purpose of an acquisition or a 
specified capital investment which is announced contemporaneously 
with the issue or which has taken place in the preceding six month 
period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue. In line 
with recommended best practice, the Company has split the 
disapplication of pre-emption rights authority into two separate 
resolutions. The first resolution seeks authorisation for 5% of the 
issued ordinary share capital to be issued on an unrestricted basis, 
whilst the second resolution seeks authority for an additional 5% 
of the issued ordinary share capital to be used for an acquisition 
or a specified capital investment.
Also, in line with best practice, the Company has not issued more 
than 7.5% of its issued ordinary share capital on a non-prorated 
basis over the last three years. The directors have no present 
intention to issue ordinary shares, other than pursuant to the 
Company’s employee equity incentive share schemes, and this 
authority will maintain the Company’s flexibility in relation to future 
share issues, including any issues to finance business opportunities, 
should appropriate circumstances arise.
Details of repurchases into treasury shares and the reissue of treasury 
shares made during the year, together with details of options granted 
over unissued capital, are set out in note 21 to the consolidated 
financial statements on pages 153 and 154.

GOVERNANCE EMPLOYEE POLICIES AND INVOLVEMENT
The Group places particular importance on the involvement of its 
employees, keeping them regularly informed through informal 
bulletins and other in-house publications, meetings and the 
Company’s internal websites, on matters affecting them as 
employees and on the issues affecting their performance. Since 
1996, those Group businesses in the European Economic Area (EEA) 
have been represented on the Compass European Council (CEC), 
which provides a forum for exchanging information and engaging in 
consultation on the Group’s performance and plans, and relevant 
transnational issues affecting those countries in the EEA.
Permanent UK employees are normally invited to join the Company’s 
defined contribution pension scheme, Compass Retirement Income 
Savings Plan (CRISP), on the completion of two years’ service (this 
includes any service that may have transferred across under the 
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 
2006 (TUPE)). CRISP has a corporate trustee. Nigel Palmer, a 
former employee of the Group, is chairman of the trustees. The 
other five trustee directors are UK based employees of the Group, 
two of whom have been nominated by CRISP members.
Those UK employees who transferred from the public sector under 
TUPE have been eligible to join the Compass Group Pension Plan 
(the Plan), a defined benefit pension arrangement which is 
otherwise closed to new entrants. However, under the Government’s 
revised guidance for ‘Fair Deal for staff pensions’, the expectation is 
that the Group will in future participate in the relevant public sector 
pension scheme and close the Plan to future new entrants. The Plan 
also has a corporate trustee. Phillip Whittome is the independent 
chairman. There are a further five trustee directors, four of whom 
are either UK based employees or former employees of the Group 
(three of whom have been nominated by Plan members), and the 
fifth is an independent trustee director.
The Company became subject to the automatic enrolment 
regulations for its workforce in the UK on 1 November 2012,  
but deferred its staging date for automatic enrolment of eligible 
employees to 2 January 2013 as permitted by the regulations.  
Both the Plan and CRISP are compliant arrangements under  
these regulations and have been registered as such. All new UK 
employees who meet the statutory requirements, and who are not 
immediately entered into the Plan or CRISP, are automatically 
enrolled into the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST). The 
Group’s compliance with the auto-enrolment regulations, and the 
performance of NEST, are kept under regular review by the Group’s 
Pensions Department.
Permanent employees outside the UK are usually offered membership 
of local pension arrangements if and where they exist and where it is 
appropriate to have Company sponsored arrangements.
Employees are offered a range of benefits, such as private medical 
cover, depending on the local environment. Priority is given to the 
training of employees and the development of their skills. 
Employment of disabled people is considered on merit with regard 
only to the ability of any applicant to carry out the role. Arrangements 
to enable disabled people to carry out the duties required will be 
made if it is reasonable to do so. An employee becoming disabled 
would, where appropriate, be offered retraining.
The Group continues to operate on a decentralised basis. This provides 
the maximum encouragement for the development of entrepreneurial 
flair, balanced by a rigorous control framework exercised by a small 
head office team. Local management teams are responsible for 
maintaining high standards of health and safety and for ensuring that 
there is appropriate employee involvement in decision making.
NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING DIRECTIVE
The EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive was implemented into 
English law as the Companies, Partnerships and Groups (Accounts 
and Non-Financial Reporting) Regulations 2016 earlier this year and 
requires companies with financial years beginning on or after 
1 January 2017 to disclose non-financial information necessary to 
provide investors and other stakeholders with a better understanding 
of a company’s development, performance, position and impact of 
its activity. The Audit Committee which advises the Board on such 
matters, will ensure that the Company is compliant with the Directive 
and includes the necessary disclosures in the 2018 Annual Report.
Throughout this Annual Report the directors have disclosed a mix 
of financial and non-financial KPIs which they believe best reflect 
the Group's strategic priorities; and which will help to convey an 
understanding of the culture of the business and the drivers which 
contribute to the ongoing success of the Company. 
EMPLOYEE DIVERSITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS
Our Code of Ethics was developed in consultation with the CEC 
and the Institute of Business Ethics and sets out clear standards 
of behaviour that we expect all of our people to demonstrate and 
adhere to. The Code of Ethics, which is part of our CBC, underpins 
our social, ethical and environmental commitments and sends a 
clear message to our stakeholders of our commitment to responsible 
business practice. The 10 principles of the United Nations (UN) 
Global Compact, to which we are a signatory, underpin our  
own Code of Ethics. This UN initiative encourages companies  
to make human rights, labour standards, environmental 
responsibility and anti-corruption part of their business agenda.

OTHER STATUTORY DISCLOSURES CONTINUED
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 98 Our people are instrumental in our success; we respect and value 
the individuality and diversity that every employee brings to the 
Group. We base our relationship with our employees on respect 
for the dignity of the individual and fair treatment for all. In October 
2017, the Company published its second statement in accordance 
with the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, details of 
which can be found on the website at www.compass-group.com.
As at 30 September 2017, there were 588,112 (2016: 527,180) 
people employed by the Group (average number of employees 
including directors and part-time employees) of whom 323,462 
were female (2016: 300,493) and 264,650 were male  
(2016: 226,687). 794 were senior managers, 602 male, 192  
female (2016: 646 male, 198 female) which includes members 
of our global leadership team and statutory directors of corporate 
entities whose financial information is consolidated in the Group’s 
accounts in this Annual Report. As at 30 September 2017 there 
were 11 directors, nine of whom were male and two were female  
on the Board of Directors of Compass Group PLC. Prior to any 
appointment to the Board, the Nomination Committee gives due 
regard to diversity and gender with a view to recommending the 
appointment of the most suitable candidate for the role.
We seek to create a positive, open working environment wherever 
we operate. Our employee policies are set locally to comply with 
local law within an overall Group framework and we monitor our 
employee satisfaction and engagement through a number of key 
performance indicators.
We also consider the concerns of wider communities where we 
operate, including national and local interests, utilising our relevant 
expertise to help contribute to the wellbeing of communities which 
are appropriate to our business objectives. Furthermore, the Group 
supports the rights of all people as set out in the UN Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights (UN Declaration) and considers 
carefully before doing any business in countries that do not adhere 
to the UN Declaration.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REPORTING
The Company is required to state the annual quantity of emissions 
in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from activities for which the 
Group is responsible, including the combustion of fuel and the 
operation of any facility. Details of our emissions during the year 
ended 30 September 2017 are set out within the Corporate 
Responsibility section of the Strategic Report on pages 38 and 39 
and form part of the Directors’ Report disclosures. Further details  
of the actions which the Group is taking to reduce emissions can 
also be found at www.compass-group.com. This Annual Report is 
certified carbon neutral by sponsoring a carbon neutral cause to 
offset against the emissions arising from the production, printing 
and delivery of this Report. This year, the Company has participated 
in a project in Brazil which aims to prevent deforestation and protect 
one of the world’s most biodiverse habitats.
DONATIONS AND POLITICAL EXPENDITURE
Charitable objectives support the Company’s CR strategy and have 
primarily focused on improving the environment, education, health 
and wellbeing, community engagement and responsible business 
practice. Donations have included employee involvement through 
fundraising and financial support.
GROUP CHARITABLE DONATIONS £M
2017 8.3
2016 8.5
Since 2004, shareholders have passed an annual resolution,  
on a precautionary basis, to approve donations to EU political 
organisations and to incur EU political expenditure (as such terms 
were defined under the then relevant legislation) not exceeding 
a monetary limit approved by shareholders. The Board has 
consistently confirmed that it operates a policy of not giving any 
cash contribution to any political party in the ordinary meaning of 
those words and that it has no intention of changing that policy.
No material amount of corporate funds or paid employee time  
has been utilised during the year for political activities and, in 
accordance with the Company’s CBC, employees must not engage 
in any form of lobbying or have contact with political representatives, 
government employees or public interest groups unless they are 
doing so legitimately and adhering to internal control processes. 
Further information regarding the CBC can be found on page 60 
of this Annual Report and on the Company’s website at  
www.compass-group.com.
The directors propose to renew the authority granted at the 2017 
AGM for the Group to make political donations and incur political 
expenditure (as such terms are defined in sections 362 to 365 of  
the CA 2006) until the Company’s next AGM, which they might 
otherwise be prohibited from making or incurring under the terms  
of the CA 2006 and which would not amount to ‘donations’ in the 
ordinary sense of the word. It is proposed to maintain the limit of 
such authority at £100,000.

GOVERNANCE COMMUNICATING WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company places considerable importance on communication 
with its shareholders, including its private shareholders. The Group 
Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director are closely involved 
in investor relations and a senior executive has day to day 
responsibility for such matters. The views of the Company’s major 
shareholders are reported to the Board by the Group Chief Executive 
and the Group Finance Director as well as by the Chairman (who 
remains in contact with our largest shareholders) and are discussed 
at its meetings.
There is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders, and 
private shareholders through the AGM. Contact with institutional 
shareholders (and with financial analysts, brokers and the media) 
is controlled by written guidelines in the Company’s Corporate 
Communications Code and Market Soundings Policy, in compliance 
with EU Market Abuse Regulation requirements, to ensure the 
continued protection of share price sensitive information that has 
not already been made generally available to the Company’s 
shareholders. Contact is also maintained, when appropriate, with 
shareholders to discuss overall remuneration plans and policies.
The primary method of communicating with shareholders  
is by electronic means, helping to make the Company more 
environmentally friendly by reducing waste and pollution associated 
with the production and posting of its Annual Report. The Annual 
Report and Accounts is available to all shareholders and can be 
accessed via the Company’s website at www.compass-group.com. 
The Group’s annual and interim results are also published on  
the Company’s website, together with all other announcements  
and documents issued to the market, such as statements,  
interviews and presentations by the Group Chief Executive and 
Group Finance Director.
The Notice of Annual General Meeting is circulated to all 
shareholders at least 20 working days prior to such meeting and  
it is Company policy not to combine resolutions to be proposed at 
general meetings. All shareholders are invited to the Company’s 
AGM at which they have the opportunity to put questions to the 
Board and it is standard practice to have the chairmen of the Audit, 
Corporate Responsibility, Nomination and Remuneration committees 
available to answer questions. The results of proxy voting for and 
against each resolution, as well as abstentions, are announced to 
the London Stock Exchange and are published on the Company’s 
website as soon as practicable after the meeting. Further 
shareholder information is available on pages 182 to 184.

records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable 
them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 OUR OPINION IS UNMODIFIED
We have audited the financial statements of Compass Group PLC 
(the Company) for the year ended 30 September 2017 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Parent Company Balance 
Sheet and the Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity, and 
the related notes, including the accounting policies in notes A to T of 
the Group financial statements and A to K of the Parent Company 
financial statements.
IN OUR OPINION:
• The financial statements give a true and fair view of the  
state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as  
at 30 September 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year  
then ended;
• The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union;
• The Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and
• The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our 
audit opinion is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.
We were appointed as auditor by the directors on 14 March 2014.
The period of total uninterrupted engagement is the four years ended 
30 September 2017. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities 
under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance 
with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard  
as applied to listed public interest entities. No non-audit services 
prohibited by that standard were provided.

2 KEY AUDIT MATTERS: OUR ASSESSMENT OF 
RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit 
strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team.
We summarise below the key audit matters (unchanged from 2016), 
in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit 
opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address 
those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results 
from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our 
results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and 
solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as 
a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are 
incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.

Taxation – uncertain 
direct tax provisions
Refer to page 57 
(Governance and 
Directors’ Report), 
pages 114 and 116 
(accounting policy) 
and pages 127  
and 128 (financial 
disclosures).
Uncertain outcome:
The Group has extensive international 
operations and is subject to complex local 
and international tax legislation in the 
normal course of business. 
As a result of the complexities of tax rules 
on transfer pricing and other tax 
legislation the provisioning for uncertain 
direct tax positions is judgemental and 
requires the directors to make estimates 
in relation to these uncertainties. 
Our procedures included: 
• Control design: Evaluating the design of the controls that the Group 
has in place to identify and quantify its uncertain direct tax 
exposures;
• Our taxation expertise: Using our tax specialists to analyse and 
challenge the assumptions used to determine provisions using our 
knowledge and experience of the application of international and 
local legislation by the relevant authorities and courts, and 
assessing whether the approach applied by the Group is supported 
by custom and practice in the industry;
• Test of detail: Examining the calculations prepared by the directors 
and agreeing assumptions used to underlying data where possible;
• With the help of our tax specialists, considering the judgements 
applied to each significant provision including the maximum 
potential exposure and the likelihood of a payment being required; 
• Inspecting correspondence with relevant tax authorities and 
assessing third party tax advice received to evaluate the 
conclusions drawn in the advice where relevant to the significant 
exposures faced by the Group; and
• Assessing transparency: Assessing the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of tax and uncertain direct tax positions.
Our results
• From the evidence we obtained we found the level of provisioning 
in respect of uncertain direct tax positions to be acceptable.
Supplier rebates and 
discounts
Refer to page 57 
(Governance and 
Directors’ Report) 
and page 115 
(accounting policy).
Rebates and discounts processing error:
The Group has a variety of agreements 
with suppliers whereby rebates and 
discounts are earned based on the 
quantity of goods bought. 
The majority of the rebates and discounts 
due to the Group are reflected in the net 
price charged by its suppliers or are 
based on fixed percentages linked to the 
quantity of goods bought. There is little 
estimation or judgement involved in 
determining the timing and amount to be 
recognised. However, due to the large 
number of agreements in place across 
numerous jurisdictions within the Group, 
the complexity of transaction processing 
as well as supplier rebate periods 
frequently not being coterminous with the 
year end date, we consider that there is a 
risk of error.
Our procedures included:
• Control design: Evaluating the design of the controls that the Group 
has in place over the accounting for supplier rebates and 
discounts;
• Accounting application: Inspecting underlying contractual terms 
and supplier correspondence for a selection of arrangements in 
place and considering whether the accounting policy had been 
applied appropriately to the terms of the rebate and/or discount; 
• Test of details: Performing detailed testing on a sample basis of 
the largest rebates and discounts recognised in the period, with 
particular attention to whether the rebates and discounts were 
recognised in the correct period and the appropriateness of any 
rebates and discounts accrued at the period end.
• In addition we selected a sample of amounts invoiced as at the 
balance sheet date and agreed the underlying calculation to 
contractual terms and supplier correspondence; and
• Assessing transparency: Assessing the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of supplier rebates and discounts.
Our results
• The results of our testing were satisfactory and we found the amount 
of supplier rebates and discounts recognised to be acceptable.

million (2016: 
£1,003 million) 
Intercompany 
receivables £9,909 
million (2016:

Low risk, high value
The carrying amount of the Company’s 
investments in subsidiaries held at cost 
less impairment and intercompany 
receivables represent 99% of the 
Company’s total assets. 
We do not consider the valuation of these 
investments and recovery of 
intercompany receivables to be at a high 
risk of significant misstatement, or to be 
subject to a significant level of judgement. 
However, due to their materiality in the 
context of the Company financial 
statements as a whole, this is considered 
to be the area which had the greatest 
effect on our overall audit strategy and 
allocation of resources in planning and 
completing our Company audit.
Our procedures included:
• Test of details: Comparing a sample of the investment and 
intercompany receivables carrying value to the net assets of the 
investment to identify whether the net asset values of the 
subsidiaries, being an approximation of their minimum recoverable 
amount, were in excess of their carrying amount;
• Our sector experience: Evaluating assumptions used in the 
applicable impairment model for the investment, in particular those 
relating to forecast profit growth for the investment using our 
knowledge and historic experience of the profitability of the 
underlying trading Group and assessing the directors’ assumptions 
over the recoverability of intercompany receivables against our own 
knowledge of the trading performance and net assets of the relevant 
counterparty; and
• Benchmarking assumptions: Comparing the assumptions in the 
applicable impairment model for the investment to externally derived 
data in relation to projected economic growth and discount rates.
Our results
• We found the assessment of the carrying value of investments and 
the recoverability of intercompany receivables to be acceptable.
3 OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND  
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at 
£65.0 million (2016: £60.7 million), determined with reference to  
a benchmark of Group profit before tax of £1.6 billion 
(2016: £1.3 billion), of which it represents 4.2% (2016: 4.6%).
Materiality for the parent company financial statements was set at 
£52.3 million (2016: £52.3 million), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of total assets of which it represents 0.5% (2016: 0.4%). 
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £3.3 million 
(2016: £3.0 million), in addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 54 (2016: 49) reporting components, we subjected 
28 (2016: 25) to full scope audits for Group purposes. 
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the 
percentages illustrated on the next page.
The remaining 4% (2016: 4%) of total Group revenue, 3% 
(2016: 3%) of Group profit before tax and 3% (2016: 3%) of total 
Group assets is represented by 26 reporting components (2016: 24 
components), none of which individually represented more than 
0.5% (2016: 0.5%) of any of total Group revenue, Group profit 
before tax or total Group assets. For these residual components, we 
performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our 
assessment that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement within these.
The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant 
areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and 
the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the 
component materialities, which ranged from £0.7 million to 
£52.3 million (2016: £0.2 million to £52.3 million), having regard to 
the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. 
The work on 25 of the 28 components was performed by 
component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the parent 
company, was performed by the Group team. 
The Group team visited 13 (2016: 8) component locations in 
Australia, Brazil, China, Chile, France, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, 
Portugal, South Africa, UAE, US and the UK (2016: Australia, 
Canada, France, India, Japan, South Africa, US and UK) to assess 
the audit risk and strategy. 
Video and telephone conference meetings were also held with these 
component auditors and all others that were not physically visited. 
At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to the Group 
team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required 
by the Group team was then performed by the component auditor.

Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 104 4 WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT ON  
GOING CONCERN
We are required to report to you if:
• We have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation 
to the directors’ statement in note A to the financial statements on 
the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material 
uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and 
Company’s use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements; or
• If the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 33 
is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
5 WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT ON THE OTHER 
INFORMATION IN THE ANNUAL REPORT
The directors are responsible for the other information presented in 
the Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our 
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, 
except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the 
information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that 
work we have not identified material misstatements in the 
other information.
STRATEGIC REPORT AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Based solely on our work on the other information:
• We have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report;
• In our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and
• In our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
DISCLOSURES OF PRINCIPAL RISKS AND LONGER  
TERM VIABILITY
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention 
to in relation to:
• The directors’ confirmation within the viability statement on 
page 33 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
and liquidity;

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • The Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and 
explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and
• The directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how 
they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they considered that period 
to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the viability 
statement. We have nothing to report in this respect.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DISCLOSURES
We are required to report to you if:
• We have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit and 
the directors’ statement that they consider that the Annual Report 
and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy; or
• The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Compliance Statement does 
not properly disclose a departure from the eleven provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for 
our review.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
6 WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT ON THE OTHER 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT 
BY EXCEPTION
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• The Parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• Certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
• We have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7 RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 101,  
the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view; assessing the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent 
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but 
to do so. In addition the directors are responsible for such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation  
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud, other irregularities, or error, and to issue our 
opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, 
other irregularities or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
the financial statements.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud or other irregularities is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as they may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control and may 
involve any area of law and regulation not just those directly affecting 
the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
8 THE PURPOSE OF OUR AUDIT WORK AND  
TO WHOM WE OWE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.

Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 112 GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
For the year ended 30 September 2017
INTRODUCTION
The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the 
Group’s financial statements are set out below:
A ACCOUNTING CONVENTION AND BASIS OF 
PREPARATION
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance  
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 
interpretations as adopted by the European Union that are effective 
for the year ended 30 September 2017. They have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation 
of certain financial instruments.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis. This is discussed in the Business Review on page 33.
In the current financial year, the Group has adopted:
Amendments to IAS 1 – Disclosure initiative
Amendments to IAS 16 and 38 – Clarification of acceptable 
methods of depreciation and amortisation
Amendments to IAS 27 – Equity method in separate financial 
statements
Amendments to IFRS 11 – Accounting for acquisitions of interests  
of joint operations
Annual improvements to IFRS Standards – 2012–2014 Cycle
In addition, there have been other minor improvements to existing 
IFRS and interpretations that are effective for the first time in the 
current financial year which have been adopted by the Group with 
no impact on its consolidated results or financial position.
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS  
AND INTERPRETATIONS TO EXISTING STANDARDS  
THAT ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE
The following accounting standards, interpretations and 
amendments that are applicable to the Group have been issued by 
the IASB but had either not been adopted by the European Union or 
were not yet effective in the European Union at 30 September 2017. 
The Group is currently analysing the impact these standards would 
have on its consolidated results and financial position.
IFRS 9 – Financial instruments
IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers
IFRS 16 – Leases
Amendments to IAS 7 – Disclosure initiative
Amendments to IAS 12 – Recognition of deferred tax assets 
for unrealised losses
Amendments to IFRS 2 – Classification and measurement  
of share-based payment transactions
IFRIC 22 – Foreign currency transactions and advance 
consideration
IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over income tax treatments
Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2014–2016 Cycle
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations of existing 
standards have been published that, once they have been endorsed 
by the European Union, will be mandatory for the Group’s 
accounting period beginning on 1 October 2017 or for later periods. 
The Group has not yet adopted these pronouncements and does not 
currently believe that the adoption of these standards, amendments 
or interpretations would have a material effect on the consolidated 
results or financial position of the Group unless stated otherwise.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ removes the multiple classification 
and measurement models for financial assets required by IAS 39 
and introduces a model that has only two classification categories: 
amortised cost and fair value. Classification is driven by the business 
model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash 
flow characteristics of those assets. The accounting and presentation 
for financial liabilities and for derecognising financial instruments is 
relocated from IAS 39 without any significant changes. The Group 
plans to apply IFRS 9 for the year ended 30 September 2019.
IFRS 9 will impact the classification and measurement of the 
Group’s financial instruments and will require certain additional 
disclosures. The primary change relates to provisioning for potential 
future credit losses on financial assets. The Group does not consider 
it likely that the impact of these changes will have any major impact 
on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ (which has been 
endorsed by the European Union) and subsequent amendments 
‘Clarifications to IFRS 15’ (which have not yet been endorsed by the 
European Union) set out the requirements for recognising revenue 
and costs from contracts with customers. The Group has made good 
progress in training staff and identifying areas of divergence with 
current practice and, based on this assessment, believes that IFRS 
15 will not have a significant impact on the timing and recognition of 
revenue, operating profit margin or net assets. It is anticipated that 
there will be some impact on the Group as a result of changes in the 
disclosure of some client contract intangibles, variable payments to, 
and variable receipts from clients and the accounting for sales 
commissions. The Group plans to apply IFRS 15 for the year ended 
30 September 2019 with a retrospective approach to the 
restatement of comparatives.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (not yet endorsed by the European Union) will 
primarily change lease accounting for lessees. A single model will be 
applied by lessees to all leases with the option not to recognise 
leases of small value or with terms less than 12 months. It is 
expected that, as a result of this standard, most operating leases will 
be included on the balance sheet as an asset, together with the 
corresponding lease liability. A Group-wide project team has been 
established and is currently assessing the application of this 
new standard.
B CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, 
ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires 
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates, judgements and 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors 
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual 
113 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
CONSOLIDATED  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS results may differ from these estimates. The estimates, judgements 
and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next 
financial year are discussed below.
TAXES
The Group has operations in around 50 countries that are subject to 
direct and indirect taxes. The tax position is often not agreed with tax 
authorities until sometime after the relevant period end and, if 
subject to a tax audit, may be open for an extended period. In these 
circumstances, the recognition of tax liabilities and assets requires 
management estimates and judgement to reflect a variety of factors; 
these include the status of any ongoing tax audits, historical 
experience, interpretations of tax law and the likelihood 
of settlement.
The changing regulatory environment affecting all multinationals 
increases the estimation uncertainty associated with calculating the 
Group’s tax position. This is as a result of amendments to tax law at 
the national level, increased co-operation between tax authorities 
and greater cross border transparency.
The Group estimates and recognises liabilities of whether additional 
taxes will be due based on management’s interpretation of country 
specific tax law, external advice and the likelihood of settlement. 
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the 
amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the 
results in the year in which such determination is made.
In addition, calculation and recognition of temporary differences 
giving rise to deferred tax assets requires estimates and judgements 
to be made on the extent to which future taxable profits are available 
against which these temporary differences can be utilised.
GOODWILL
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment in accordance with the accounting policy set out in 
section M on page 116. The recoverable amounts of cash-
generating units (CGU) have been determined based on value in 
use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates 
and assumptions consistent with the most up to date budgets and 
plans that have been formally approved by management. The key 
assumptions used for the value in use calculations are set out in 
note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
Defined benefit schemes are reappraised annually by independent 
actuaries based on actuarial assumptions. Judgement is required in 
determining these actuarial assumptions. The principal assumptions 
used are described in note 20 to the financial statements.
C BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements consist of the financial 
statements of the Company, entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) and the Group’s share of interests in joint 
arrangements and associates made up to 30 September each year.
D SUBSIDIARIES, ASSOCIATES AND JOINT 
ARRANGEMENTS
SUBSIDIARIES
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has control. 
Control exists when the Company has power over an entity, exposure 
to variable returns from its involvement with an entity and the ability 
to use its power over the entity to affect its returns. The existence 
and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or 
convertible are also considered when assessing control.
ASSOCIATES
Associates are undertakings that are not subsidiaries or joint 
arrangements over which the Group has significant influence and 
can participate in financial and operating policy decisions. 
Investments in associated undertakings are accounted for using the 
equity method. The consolidated income statement includes the 
Group’s share of the profit after tax of the associated undertakings. 
Investments in associates include goodwill identified on acquisition 
and are carried in the Group balance sheet at cost plus post-
acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the 
associate, less any impairment in value.
JOINT ARRANGEMENTS
Joint arrangements are entities in which the Group holds an interest 
on a long term basis and which are jointly controlled by the Group 
and other entities under a contractual agreement. The Group 
accounts for its own share of assets, liabilities, revenues and 
expenses measured according to the terms of the agreements 
covering the joint operations. Joint ventures are accounted for using 
the equity method.
ADJUSTMENTS
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with 
those used by the Group.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
The results of subsidiaries, associates or joint arrangements 
acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the 
consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition 
or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
INTRA-GROUP TRANSACTIONS
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation. Where a Group subsidiary transacts 
with a joint operation of the Group, profits or losses are eliminated to 
the extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant joint operation.
E ACQUISITIONS
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase 
method. The cost of acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the 
fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities 
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed are recognised at the fair values at the acquisition date, 
except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified 
as held for sale which are recognised and measured at fair value 
less costs to sell.
GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
For the year ended 30 September 2017
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 114 The cost of the acquisition in excess of the Group’s interest in the 
net fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as 
goodwill. If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the 
net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised 
directly in the consolidated income statement.
F FOREIGN CURRENCY
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in sterling, 
which is the functional currency of the Company.
In preparing the financial statements of individual companies within 
the Group, transactions in currencies other than the companies’ 
functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange on the 
dates of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary 
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rates on the balance sheet date. Gains and losses 
arising on retranslation are included in the consolidated income 
statement for the period, except for where they arise on items taken 
directly to other comprehensive income, in which case they are also 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks the 
Group enters into forward currency contracts (see section Q for the 
Group’s accounting policies in respect of derivative financial 
instruments).
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas 
operations (expressed in their functional currencies, being the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity 
operates) are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, 
are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation 
reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or 
expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate.
G REVENUE AND CONTRACT COSTS
Revenue is recognised in the period in which food and support 
services are provided in accordance with the terms of the 
contractual relationships with third parties. Revenue represents the 
fair value of the consideration received or receivable for food and 
support services provided in the normal course of business, 
excluding trade discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes.
Where the consideration receivable under client contracts is 
variable, for example where performance bonuses exist, revenue is 
recognised when it is virtually certain that applicable thresholds will 
be met.
Clients engage us to provide our food and support services at their 
locations. Depending on the type of client and service, we are paid 
either by our client and/or directly by the consumer to whom we 
have been provided access by our client. In certain cases, clients 
engage us to provide food and support services in a single multi 
service contract. We recognise revenue for each separate 
performance obligation in respect of food and support services as 
these are provided. We typically use three types of client contracts.
MANAGEMENT FEE CONTRACTS
Revenue from management fee contracts is based on cost incurred 
and invoiced to the client together with the agreed management fee. 
Revenue from management fee contracts is recognised when food 
and support services are provided.
FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS
Fixed price contracts include both contracts where: a) the client 
pays a fixed amount for an agreed range of services provided over 
a fixed period; and b) contracts where revenue is a fixed price per 
meal but varies depending on volume. Revenue from fixed price 
contracts is recognised as services are provided.
PROFIT AND LOSS CONTRACTS
Revenue from profit and loss contracts comprises the total of sales 
made to consumers, typically with little or no subsidy charged to 
clients. Under these contracts, the Group has significant discretion 
to manage pricing and costs. Revenue is recognised when food and 
support services are provided to consumers.
CONTRACT COSTS
Costs incurred during the bidding period, prior to a contract being 
awarded, are expensed to the income statement. Costs incurred in 
securing the contract after preferred bidder status has been 
obtained are generally expensed as incurred, unless they fulfil the 
conditions for capitalisation as an asset.
Commissions paid to the sales force on winning or retaining client 
contracts are charged to the income statement as incurred.
As part of client contracts, the Group sometimes makes payments to 
clients, such as concession rentals, vending commissions and profit 
share. These payments are accounted for as operating costs 
when incurred.
H REBATES AND OTHER AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM 
SUPPLIERS
Rebates and other amounts received from suppliers include 
agreed discounts from suppliers’ list prices, value and volume 
related rebates.
Income from value and volume related rebates is recognised based 
on actual purchases in the period as a proportion of total purchases 
made or forecast to be made over the rebate period.
Rebates received in respect of plant and equipment are deducted 
from the costs capitalised and are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement in line with depreciation.
Agreed discounts relating to inventories are credited to the income 
statement within cost of sales as the goods are consumed.
Rebates relating to items purchased, but still held at the balance 
sheet date, are deducted from the carrying value of these items so 
that the cost of inventories is recorded net of applicable rebates.
I BORROWING COSTS
Borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as 
part of the cost of that asset.
115 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
CONSOLIDATED  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS J OPERATING PROFIT
Operating profit is stated after the share of profit after tax of joint 
ventures and associates, and before finance costs.
K EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional items are disclosed and described separately in the 
consolidated financial statements where it is necessary to do so to 
provide further understanding of the financial performance of the 
Group. They are material items of income or expense that have been 
shown separately due to the significance of their nature or amount.
L TAX
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement except where it 
relates to items taken directly to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income or equity, in which case it is recognised in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or equity 
as appropriate.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the 
period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted in respect of that period by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for tax purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a 
business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
and interest in joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to 
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or 
part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the enacted or substantively enacted tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when 
they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction and 
the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a 
net basis.
M INTANGIBLE ASSETS
GOODWILL
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of the acquired subsidiary, associate or joint 
arrangement at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually 
for impairment and is carried at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing. 
A CGU is identified at the lowest aggregation of assets that generate 
largely independent cash inflows, and that which is looked at by 
management for monitoring and managing the business and relates 
to the total business for a country.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying 
amount, an impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other 
assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of 
each asset in the unit. Any impairment is immediately recognised in 
the consolidated income statement and an impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS 
has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to 
being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to 
reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and 
is not included in determining any subsequent gain or loss 
on disposal.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost or, if 
acquired as part of a business combination, are capitalised at fair 
value as at the date of the acquisition. Amortisation is charged on a 
straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets. 
Internally generated intangible assets are not capitalised. Intangible 
assets are reviewed for impairment annually.
The following rates applied for the Group:
• client contract related intangible assets: the life of the contract
• computer software: 20% to 33% per annum
The typical life of contract related intangibles is two to 20 years.
Client contracts related intangible assets arising on acquisition of a 
business are recognised at fair value and amortised over the life of 
the contract, including the renewal period where appropriate. 
Underlying operating profit and underlying earnings per share 
exclude the amortisation of contract related intangible assets arising 
on acquisition of a business as it is not considered to be relevant to 
the underlying trading performance of the Group.
GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
For the year ended 30 September 2017
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 116 N PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
All tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when there are 
indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Freehold 
land is not depreciated. All other property, plant and equipment 
assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
recognised impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the anticipated 
useful lives of the assets.
The following rates applied for the Group:
• Freehold buildings and long term leasehold property: 2% per 
annum
• Short term leasehold property: the life of the lease
• Plant and machinery: 8% to 33% per annum
• Fixtures and fittings: 8% to 33% per annum
When assets are sold, the difference between sales proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the assets is dealt with in the consolidated 
income statement.
O ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for 
sale if the carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is 
regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, management 
is committed to a sale plan, the asset is available for immediate sale 
in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed 
within one year from the date of classification. These assets are 
measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs 
to sell.
P INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost is calculated using either the weighted average price or the first 
in, first out method as appropriate to the circumstances. Net 
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course 
of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Q FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and 
liabilities, including derivative financial instruments, denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated into sterling at period end exchange 
rates. Gains and losses are dealt with through the consolidated 
income statement, unless hedge accounting treatment is available.
INVESTMENTS
The Group’s available for sale investments are measured at fair value 
or, where fair value cannot be reliably measured, at cost less 
impairment. They are included in non-current assets unless 
management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months 
of the balance sheet date.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and 
short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
BORROWINGS
Borrowings are recognised initially at the proceeds received, net of 
direct issue costs. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of direct issue costs) 
and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective 
interest method, unless included in a fair value hedge.
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE 
ACCOUNTING
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward 
currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge the risks 
associated with changes in foreign exchange rates and interest 
rates. Such derivative financial instruments are initially measured at 
fair value on the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at 
subsequent reporting dates.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies 
approved by the Board of Directors that provide written principles on 
the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk 
management strategy. The Group does not use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by 
reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with 
similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swaps is 
determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either 
fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the 
fair value of a recognised asset or liability; or cash flow hedges where 
they hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either 
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or 
liability or a forecasted transaction; or net investment hedges where 
they hedge the exposure to foreign currency arising from a net 
investment in foreign operations.
In relation to fair value hedges (interest rate swaps) which meet the 
conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring 
the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the 
consolidated income statement. Any gain or loss on the hedged item 
attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying 
amount of the hedged item and recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount 
of a hedged interest bearing financial instrument, the adjustment is 
amortised to the net profit and loss such that it is fully amortised 
by maturity.
When fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, any adjustment 
to the carrying amount of the hedged item for the designated risk for 
interest bearing financial instruments is amortised to profit or loss, 
with amortisation commencing no later than when the hedged item 
ceases to be adjusted.
The Group’s policy is to convert a proportion of its floating rate debt 
to fixed rates, using floating to fixed interest rate swaps. The Group 
may designate these as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk 
whenever the hedge accounting conditions are met.
117 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
CONSOLIDATED  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Group may also designate foreign currency firm commitments 
as cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk whenever the hedge 
accounting are met.
The portion of the gain or loss arising from the cash flow hedging 
instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised 
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the 
income statement.
For cash flow hedges of firm commitments which result in the 
recognition of an asset or liability, then at the time the asset or 
liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had 
previously been recognised in equity are recognised in the initial 
measurement of the acquisition cost and carrying amount of the 
asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses 
that are recognised in equity are transferred to the consolidated 
income statement in the same period in which the hedged firm 
commitment affects the net profit and loss, for example when the 
future sale occurs.
For derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are 
taken directly to the consolidated income statement in the period.
The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt, forward 
currency contracts and cross currency swaps to partially hedge 
against the change in the sterling value of its foreign currency 
denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange 
rates. The Group designates these as a hedge of its net investments 
in foreign operations and recognises the gains or losses on the 
retranslation of the borrowings in other comprehensive income. If 
the Group uses derivatives as the hedging instrument, the effective 
portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income, 
with any ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the 
income statement. Exchange differences arising from a monetary 
item receivable from or payable to a Group foreign operation, the 
settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable 
future, are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign 
operation and are recognised directly in equity in the 
translation reserve.
Gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are 
recycled through the consolidated income statement on disposal of 
the foreign operation.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until 
the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised 
in equity is transferred to the consolidated income statement in 
the period.
R LEASES
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the 
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to 
the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the 
Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the 
lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the 
balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are 
apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease 
obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged 
directly to the consolidated income statement.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to income on 
a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Any incentives to 
enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis 
over the lease term.
S PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the 
directors’ best estimate of the cost of settling these liabilities and are 
discounted to present value where the effect is material.
T EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
PENSION OBLIGATIONS
The Group operates two types of pension plans:
• defined contribution plans where the Group makes contributions 
to a member’s pension plan but has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have been paid
• defined benefit plans which provide pension payments upon 
retirement to members as defined by the plan rules
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to 
separately administered pension plans. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. 
The contributions are recognised in current service cost in the 
consolidated income statement when they are due. Payments made 
to state managed schemes are treated as payments to defined 
contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the 
schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution 
pension scheme.
For defined benefit plans, the calculation of the defined benefit 
obligation is performed at least once a year by a qualified actuary 
using the projected unit credit method. The consolidated balance 
sheet reflects a net asset or net liability for each defined benefit 
pension plan. The liability recognised is the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation discounted using the yields on high quality 
corporate bonds less the fair value of plan assets (at bid price), if 
any. If the fair value of the plan assets exceeds the defined benefit 
obligation, a pension surplus is only recognised if the Group 
considers that it has an unconditional right to a refund.
For the UK defined benefit plan, the Group considers that it has an 
unconditional right to a refund of a surplus, assuming the gradual 
settlement of the plan liabilities over time until all members have left 
the plan. The trustees cannot unconditionally wind up the plan or 
use the surplus to enhance member benefits without employer 
consent. The Group’s judgement is that these trustee rights do not 
prevent the Group from recognising an unconditional right to a 
refund and therefore a surplus.
GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
For the year ended 30 September 2017
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 118 The IASB was considering an amendment to pension accounting 
(IFRIC 14) as published in an exposure draft in June 2015. The 
Group will reconsider the implications of any amendment to IFRIC 
14 and IAS 19 if and when it has been finalised and published.
Net interest income (if a plan is in surplus) or interest expense (if a 
plan is in deficit) is calculated using yields on high quality corporate 
bonds and recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
A current service cost is also recognised which represents the 
expected present value of the defined benefit pension entitlement 
earned by members in the period.
Remeasurements, which include gains and losses as a result of 
changes in actuarial assumptions, the effect of the limit on the plan 
surplus (if any) and returns on plan assets (other than amounts 
included in net interest) are recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they 
occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in 
subsequent periods.
OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATIONS
Some Group companies provide other post employment benefits. 
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period 
of employment using a similar basis to that used for defined benefit 
pension schemes. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised 
immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2 
'Share-based payments'.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value 
(excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at 
the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of 
the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate 
of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect 
of non-market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using either the binomial distribution or 
Black-Scholes pricing models as is most appropriate for each 
scheme. The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, 
based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations.
HOLIDAY PAY
Paid holidays and similar entitlements are regarded as an employee 
benefit and are charged to the consolidated income statement as 
the benefits are earned. An accrual is made at the balance sheet 
date to reflect the fair value of holidays earned but not taken.

1. IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: recognition and measurement’.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge 
the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. As explained in section Q of the Group’s accounting 
policies, such derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at 
subsequent reporting dates. For derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from 
changes in fair value are taken directly to the income statement in the period.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the balance sheet. All the derivatives held by the Group at fair value are 
considered to have fair values determined by Level 2 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’. The 
fair values of derivative financial instruments represent the maximum credit exposure.

TOTAL INCOME TAX
Income tax expense 389 319
The income tax expense for the year is based on the effective United Kingdom statutory rate of corporation tax for the period of 19.5% 
(2016: 20%). The impact of changes in statutory rates relates principally to the reduction of the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% 
from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020. These changes have resulted in a deferred tax charge arising from the reduction in the 
balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse. Overseas 
tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The income tax expense effects of the adjustments between statutory and underlying results are shown in note 32. There is no difference 
between the statutory and underlying cash tax paid of £357 million (2016: tax paid of £263 million was adjusted for the cash tax effect of 
amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition of £1 million and hedge accounting ineffectiveness of £1 million giving underlying cash tax 
paid of £261 million).

Income tax expense 389 319
Permanent differences primarily relate to the internal financing that is in place to ensure the Group’s overseas businesses are appropriately 
capitalised. These intra-group arrangements provide a benefit to the Group’s effective tax rate. Prior year items relate to the reassessment of 
prior year tax estimates and the resolution of open items.
The global nature of the Group’s operations gives rise to several factors which could affect the future tax rate. These include the mix of profits, 
changes to statutory tax rates or tax legislation and the foreign exchange rates applicable when those profits are translated into sterling. In 
addition, the future tax charge could be affected by the impact of acquisitions, disposals or other restructurings and the resolution of open 
issues with tax authorities.
Since the year end, changes in UK tax legislation have introduced restrictions on the extent to which interest income on certain inter-company 
financing structures is exempt from tax which, if not mitigated, would increase the Group’s effective tax rate in 2018 by around 1%.
127 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
CONSOLIDATED  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 TAX CONTINUED
The Group has various ongoing routine tax audits and in addition a number of open tax returns which may become subject to audit by 
tax authorities in the territories in which we operate. The Group has recognised potential liabilities in respect of uncertain tax positions as 
described in section B of the Group accounting policies, none of which is individually material. In determining such liabilities, having regard 
to the specific circumstances of each tax position and external advice where appropriate, the Group assesses the range of potential outcomes 
and estimates whether additional tax may be due.
Tax uncertainties and associated risks are increasing for all multi national groups as a consequence of changes to local and international tax 
rules, for example the OECD’s Base Erosion & Profit Shifting project and other possible changes such as tax reform in the USA. In these 
circumstances tax risk can arise from unclear regulations and differences in interpretation, but most significantly where tax authorities apply 
diverging standards in assessing intra-group cross-border transactions.
The Group does not currently anticipate any material changes to the amounts recorded in respect of these liabilities as at 30 September 2017.

Deferred tax assets 132 149
Deferred tax liabilities (48) (40)

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses of £54 million (2016: £101 million) and other temporary differences of 
£23 million (2016: £16 million). Of the total tax losses, £44 million (2016: £92 million) will expire at various dates between 2018 and 2022. 
These deferred tax assets have not been recognised as the timing of recovery is uncertain.
The Group does not recognise any deferred tax liability on temporary differences relating to potentially taxable unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries totalling £452 million (2016: £416 million) because it is able to control the timing of reversal of these differences. It is probable 
that no reversal will take place in the foreseeable future.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable 
amount of a CGU is determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations are long term growth rates and 
pre-tax discount rates and use cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management 
covering a five year period. Budgets and forecasts are based on expectations of future outcomes taking into account past experience, adjusted 
for anticipated revenue growth, from both new business and like for like growth and taking into consideration external economic factors. Cash 
flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates based on local expected economic conditions and do not 
exceed the long term average growth rate for that country. The pre-tax discount rates are based on the Group’s weighted average cost of 
capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the country in which the CGU operates.

Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill for all CGUs. This 
has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be reasonably possible by management. The directors do not consider that any 
reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the net operating assets of the individually significant 
CGUs disclosed above to fall below their carrying values.

TRADE RECEIVABLES
The book value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value due to the short term nature of the majority of the receivables.
Credit sales are only made after credit approval procedures have been completed satisfactorily. The policy for making provisions for bad  
and doubtful debts varies from country to country as different countries and markets have different payment practices, but various factors  
are considered, including how overdue the debt is, the type of receivable and its past history, and current market and trading conditions.  
Full provision is made for debts that are not considered to be recoverable.
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the diverse and unrelated nature of the Group’s client 
base. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the provision for the impairment of 
receivables. The book value of trade and other receivables represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
Trade receivable days at 30 September 2017 were 41 days (2016: 41 days) on a constant currency basis.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended 30 September 2017
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 140 17 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group manages its capital structure to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern. The capital structure of the Group 
consists of cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in note 15; debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 16; and equity 
attributable to equity shareholders of the Parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity.
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
The Group continues to manage its interest rate and foreign currency exposure in accordance with the policies set out below. The Group’s 
financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings, receivables and payables that are used to finance the Group’s operations. The Group also 
uses derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to manage interest rate and currency 
risks arising from the Group’s operations. The Group does not trade in financial instruments. The Group’s treasury policies are designed to 
mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates and to manage the Group’s financial risks. The Board approves any 
changes to the policies.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group finances its operations through cash generated by the business and borrowings from a number of sources including the bank,  
the public and the private placement markets. The Group has developed long term relationships with a number of financial counterparties 
with the balance sheet strength and credit quality to provide credit facilities as required. The Group seeks to avoid a concentration of debt 
maturities in any one period to spread its refinancing risk. The maturity profile of the Group’s principal borrowings at 30 September 2017 
shows that the average period to maturity is 5.6 years (2016: 5.0 years). Liquidity risk faced by the Group is mitigated by having diverse 
sources of finance available to it and by maintaining substantial unutilised committed banking facilities to maintain a level of headroom in  
line with Board approval. The level of undrawn facilities is set out in note 16.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Group’s policy is to match as far as possible its principal projected cash flows by currency to actual or effective borrowings in the same 
currency. As currency cash flows are generated, they are used to service and repay debt in the same currency. Where necessary, to 
implement this policy, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps are executed which, when applied to the actual currency 
liabilities, convert these to the required currency.
The borrowings in each currency can give rise to foreign exchange differences on translation into sterling. Where the borrowings are less than, 
or equate to, the net investment in overseas operations, these exchange rate variances are treated as movements on reserves and recorded in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income rather than in the consolidated income statement.
Non-sterling earnings streams are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. Fluctuations in exchange rates have given and will 
continue to give rise to translation differences. The Group is only partially protected from the impact of such differences through the matching 
of cash flows to currency borrowings.
The Group has minimal exposure to the foreign currency risk of trade receivables and payables as operations within individual countries have 
little cross-border activity which might give rise to translation risks on trade related balances.
The main currencies to which the Group’s reported sterling financial position is exposed are the US dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen.  
As set out above, the Group seeks to hedge its exposure to currencies by matching debt in currency against the cash flows generated by the 
Group’s foreign operations in such currencies.
The effect on profit after tax and equity of a 10% strengthening of sterling against these currencies on the Group’s financial statements is 
shown below. A 10% weakening would result in an equal and opposite impact on the profit or loss and equity of the Group. This table shows 
the impact on the financial instruments in place on 30 September and has been prepared on the basis that the 10% change in exchange 
rates occurred on the first day of the financial year and applied consistently throughout the year.

INTEREST RATE RISK
As set out above, the Group has effective borrowings in a number of currencies and the policy is to ensure that, in the short term, it is not 
materially exposed to fluctuations in interest rates in its principal currencies. The Group implements this policy either by borrowing fixed rate 
debt or by using interest rate swaps so that the interest rates on at least 80% of the Group’s projected debt are fixed for one year, reducing to 
60% fixed for the second year and 40% fixed for the third year.
The sensitivity analysis given below has been determined based on the derivative and non-derivative financial instruments the Group had in 
place at the year end date only.
The effect of a 1% increase in interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date on the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and debt subject to 
variable rates of interest at the balance sheet date would be a loss of £8 million (2016: loss of £10 million) over the course of a year. A similar 
1% decrease in interest rates would result in an equal and opposite effect over the course of a year.

These changes are the result of the exposure to interest rates from the Group’s floating rate cash and cash equivalents and debt.  
The sensitivity gains and losses given above may vary because cash flows vary throughout the year and interest rate and currency hedging 
may be implemented after the year end date in order to comply with the treasury policies outlined above.
CREDIT RISK
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations.
The Group’s policy is to minimise its exposure to credit risk from the failure of any single financial counterparty by spreading its risk across a 
portfolio of financial counterparties and managing the aggregate exposure to each against certain pre-agreed limits. Exposure to counterparty 
credit risk arising from deposits and derivatives (including forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps) is concentrated at the Group 
centre where possible. Financial counterparty limits are derived from the long and short term credit ratings, and the balance sheet strength of 
the financial counterparty. All financial counterparties are required to have a minimum short term credit rating from Moody’s of P-1 or 
equivalent from another recognised agency. To reduce credit exposures, the Group has ISDA Master Agreements with all of its counterparties 
for financial derivatives, which permit net settlement of assets and liabilities in certain circumstances. Exposure to counterparty credit risk 
arising from deposits and derivatives is centralised at the Group centre. The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, 
without considering netting arrangements, is equal to the carrying value of the Group’s financial assets.
The Group’s policy to manage the credit risk associated with trade and other receivables is set out in note 13.
HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The following section describes the derivative financial instruments the Group uses to apply the interest rate and foreign currency hedging 
strategies described above.
FAIR VALUE HEDGES
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate borrowings. These instruments swap the fixed interest payable on the 
borrowings into floating interest rates and hedge the fair value of the borrowings against changes in interest rates. These interest rate swaps all 
qualify for fair value hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39, some of which are designated in fair value hedge relationships 
where appropriate.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended 30 September 2017
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 142 17 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
NET INVESTMENT HEDGES
The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps to partially hedge against the 
change in the sterling value of its foreign currency denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates. The carrying  
value of debt and derivatives in a net investment hedge was £1,712 million (2016: £2,079 million). A foreign exchange gain of £116 million  
(2016: loss of £507 million) relating to the net investment hedges has been netted off within currency translation differences as presented  
on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
DERIVATIVES NOT IN A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP
The Group has a number of derivative financial instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting. These include some interest 
rate swaps and some forward currency contracts used for interest and cash management.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values have been determined by 
reference to Level 2 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurements’. Derivative financial instrument fair 
values are present values determined from future cash flows discounted at rates derived from market sourced data. There were no transfers 
between levels in either the year ended 30 September 2017 or 2016. The fair values of derivative financial instruments represent the 
maximum credit exposure.

The provision for workers’ compensation and similar obligations relates mainly to the potential settlement of claims by employees in the US  
for medical benefits and lost wages associated with injuries incurred in the course of their employment, and is essentially long term in nature.
Provisions in respect of discontinued and disposed of businesses relate to estimated amounts payable in connection with onerous contracts 
and claims arising from disposals. The final amount payable remains uncertain as, at the date of approval of these financial statements, there 
remains a further period during which claims may be received. The timing of any settlement will depend upon the nature and extent of 
claims received.
Provisions for onerous contracts represent the liabilities in respect of short and long term leases on unoccupied properties and other contracts 
lasting under five years.
Provisions for legal and other claims relate principally to provisions for the estimated cost of litigation and other sundry claims. The timing of 
the settlement of these claims is uncertain.
Provisions for reorganisation include provision for redundancy costs and these are expected to be utilised over the next year.
Other provisions include environmental provisions. These are in respect of potential liabilities relating to the Group’s responsibility for 
maintaining its operating sites in accordance with statutory requirements and the Group’s aim to have a low impact on the environment.  
These provisions are expected to be utilised as operating sites are disposed of or as environmental matters are resolved.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material using the discount rate applicable to the liability.

PENSION SCHEMES OPERATED
The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory 
requirements and local customs and practices. The majority of schemes are self-administered and the schemes’ assets are held 
independently of the Group’s assets. Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified 
actuaries. The Group makes employer contributions to the various schemes in existence within the range of 2% to 46% of pensionable 
salaries (2016: 2% to 39%).
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of £123 million (2016: £100 million) have been fully expensed against profits  
in the current year.
UK SCHEMES
Within the UK there are now three main arrangements: the Compass Retirement Income Savings Plan (CRISP), the Compass Group Pension 
Plan (the Plan), and the Company’s stakeholder pension arrangement.
CRISP was launched on 1 February 2003. This has been the main vehicle for pension provision for new joiners in the UK since that date but 
existing members of the Plan had continued to accrue benefits under those arrangements up until 5 April 2010. CRISP is a contracted-in 
money purchase arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay (minimum 3%). Within CRISP a new 
defined contribution section was established from April 2006 known as the Compass Higher Income Plan (CHIP). Senior employees who 
contribute to CRISP will receive an additional employer-only contribution into CHIP. The amount of contribution and eligibility for CHIP are 
decided annually at the Company’s discretion. The payment towards CHIP may be taken in part, or in whole, as a cash supplement instead  
of a pension contribution.
CRISP has a corporate trustee. The Chairman, Nigel Palmer, is a former employee of the Group. The other five trustee directors are UK based 
employees of the Group, two of whom have been nominated by CRISP members.
The Plan is a defined benefit arrangement. Those UK employees who transfer from the public sector under the Transfer of Undertakings 
(Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 are eligible to join the Plan, which has otherwise been closed to new entrants since 2003.  
Such transferees enter into the GAD sections of the Plan and are known as ‘GAD members’. The Plan closed to future accrual for all existing 
members, other than GAD members, on 5 April 2010. The affected members were offered membership of CRISP from 6 April 2010.
The Plan is operated on a pre-funded basis. The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as 
achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis. The actuarial assessments covering expense and contributions are carried out  
by independent qualified actuaries. A formal actuarial valuation of the Plan is carried out every three years. The most recent valuation of the 
Plan took place as at 5 April 2016. At the valuation date the total market value of the assets of the Plan was £2,233 million which represented 
105% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
By agreement with the trustees, the Company is no longer funding any deficit. The next triennial valuation is due to be completed as at 
5 April 2019. The Plan is reappraised annually by independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ requirements.
The Plan has a corporate trustee. The Chairman, Phillip Whittome, and one other trustee director are independent. There are six trustee 
directors, four of whom are either UK based employees or former employees of the Group, three of whom have been nominated by 
Plan members.
The Company became subject to the Pensions Automatic Enrolment Regulations for its workforce in the UK on 1 November 2012 but,  
in accordance with the Regulations, deferred its staging date for automatic enrolment of eligible employees until 2 January 2013. Both  
the Plan and CRISP are compliant arrangements under these Regulations and have been registered as such.
Employees who are not already in one of these registered compliant arrangements have been automatically enrolled into the National 
Employment Savings Trust (NEST). The Company considers that NEST provides the right type of service, communication material and 
investment choice for our employees and that it has the capabilities to support a company as large and diverse as Compass.

OVERSEAS SCHEMES
In the USA, the defined benefit plans are frozen to new participants and the main vehicle for retirement are the defined contribution plans. 
The actuary provides Compass USA with the contributions required each year to the defined benefit plans, in order to work towards a 100% 
funding level on a projected salary basis. In Canada, Germany, Norway and Switzerland, the Group also participates in funded defined 
benefit arrangements.
In other countries, Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions.
Other than where required by local regulation or statute, the defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants. For these schemes the 
current service cost will increase under the projected unit credit method as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
In addition, the Group contributes to a number of multi-employer union sponsored pension plans, primarily in the USA. These plans are 
accounted for as defined contribution plans, as the information provided by the plan administrators is insufficient for them to be accounted  
for as defined benefit plans. The Group made total contributions of £16 million in the year (2016: £12 million) to these arrangements.
ALL DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES
The Group’s obligations in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount  
of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years. That benefit is discounted to determine 
its present value and the fair value of scheme assets is then deducted. The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date on high quality 
corporate bonds, whose term is consistent with the timing of the expected benefit payments over future years.
The Group takes advice from independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions which include life expectancy of 
members, expected salary and pension increases, and inflation. It is important to note that comparatively small changes in the assumptions 
used may have a significant effect on the consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid using the 
projected unit method. This method is an accrued benefits valuation method that makes allowances for projected earnings. These calculations 
are performed by a qualified actuary.
Disclosures showing the assets and liabilities of the schemes are set out below. These have been calculated on the following assumptions:
UK SCHEMES USA SCHEMES OTHER SCHEMES
2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016
Discount rate 2.7% 2.3% 3.5% 3.2% 2.0% 1.5%

Rate of increase for deferred pensions

2.8% 2.7% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%
1. This assumption is now presented as a weighted average.
The mortality assumptions used to value the current year UK pension schemes are derived from the S2PA generational mortality tables (2016: 
S2PA generational mortality tables) with improvements in line with the projection model prepared by the Continuous Mortality Investigation of 
the UK actuarial profession, with +0.2 years age rating for male non-pensioners, -0.2 years age rating for male pensioners (2016: +0.2 years 
age rating for male non-pensioners, -0.2 years age rating for male pensioners) and -0.1 years age rating for all females (2016: -0.1 years age 
rating for all females), with a long term underpin of 1.25% p.a. These mortality assumptions take account of experience to date and 
assumptions for further improvements in the life expectancy of scheme members. The Group estimates the average duration of the UK and 
USA Plan’s liabilities to be 19 years (2016: 19 years) and nine years (2016: 10 years) respectively.

Examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows:
2017 2016
LIFE EXPECTANCY AT AGE 65 MALE FEMALE MALE FEMALE
Member aged 65 in 2017 (2016) 22.5 24.4 22.4 24.3
Member aged 65 in 2041 (2040) 24.3 26.8 24.7 26.7
The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data. The 
assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of pension schemes.
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries. The mortality 
assumptions used to value USA schemes are derived from the RP2014 combined healthy table, generational MP2016 scale. Examples of the 
resulting life expectancies are as follows:
2017 2016
LIFE EXPECTANCY AT AGE 65 MALE FEMALE MALE FEMALE
Member aged 65 in 2017 (2016) 22.4 23.9 21.3 23.3
Member aged 65 in 2041 (2040) 24.3 25.8 23.4 25.4
These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market 
(investment) risk.
SENSITIVITIES OF PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS
Measurement of the Group’s defined benefit obligations is particularly sensitive to changes in key assumptions, including discount rate,  
life expectancy and inflation. The sensitivities of the principal assumptions used to measure the defined benefit obligations of the schemes  
are set out below:
ASSUMPTION CHANGE IN ASSUMPTION IMPACT ON SCHEME DEFICIT 2017 IMPACT ON SCHEME DEFICIT 2016
UK
Discount rate Increase by 0.5% Decrease by £203 million Decrease by £227 million
Decrease by 0.5% Increase by £218 million Increase by £244 million
Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by £121 million Increase by £154 million
Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by £115 million Decrease by £126 million
CPI Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by £28 million Increase by £41 million
Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by £27 million Decrease by £31 million
Life expectations from age 65 Increase by 1 year Increase by £93 million Increase by £98 million
Life expectations – annual improvement rate Increase by 1.5% per annum Increase by £40 million Increase by £43 million
USA AND OTHERS
Discount rate Increase by 0.5% Decrease by £18 million Decrease by £22 million
Decrease by 0.5% Increase by £19 million Increase by £23 million
Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by £4 million Increase by £5 million
Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by £4 million Decrease by £5 million
Life expectations from age 65 Increase by 1 year Increase by £8 million Increase by £9 million
The sensitivities above consider the impact of the single change shown, with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged. The sensitivity 
analyses have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on the defined benefit obligations as a result of reasonable 
changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by 
offsetting changes in another assumption (although this is not always the case). The impact of a change in the UK inflation rate shown above 
includes the impact of a change in both the RPI and CPI inflation rates.
The Group’s net pension deficit is the difference between the schemes’ liabilities and the schemes’ assets. Changes in the assumptions may 
occur at the same time as changes in the market value of scheme assets. These may or may not offset the changes in assumptions. For 
example, a fall in interest rates will increase the schemes’ liabilities but may also trigger an offsetting increase in the market value of certain 
assets so there is no effect on the Group’s liability.

The UK Plan has substantial holdings of diversified global equity type investments, mainly shares in listed companies. The return on these 
investments is variable, and they are generally considered to be ‘riskier’ investments. However, it is generally accepted that the yield on these 
investments will contain a premium to compensate investors for this additional risk. There is significant uncertainty about the likely size of this 
risk premium. In respect of investments held in global equities there is also a risk of unfavourable currency movements. The trustee manages 
these risks by holding approximately 50% of those investments in funds which are hedged against currency movements.
The trustee also holds corporate bonds and other fixed interest securities. The risk of default on these is assessed by various rating agencies. 
Some of these bond investments are issued by HM Government. The risk of default on these is lower compared to the risk on corporate bond 
investments, although some risk may remain. The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates can be derived exactly from 
their market value.

During the year, the Company purchased 1,340,379 ordinary shares of 10
5
⁄8 pence each (prior to consolidation) in accordance with its share 
buyback programme (2016: 8,671,579). Of the shares acquired during the year, 10 were transferred into treasury (2016: 6,560,656 at a cost 
of £72 million) and 1,340,369 (2016: 2,110,923) were cancelled. £19 million was paid to acquire shares that were subsequently cancelled 
(2016: £28 million). The total amount paid to acquire all the shares was £19 million which has been deducted from shareholders’ equity 
(2016: £100 million).
On 10 May 2017, the Company announced its intention to return £1 billion to shareholders by way of a special dividend (the Shareholder 
Return) which was to be accompanied by a consolidation of the entire share capital of the Company whereby shareholders would receive  
25 shares of 11
1
⁄20 pence (the New Ordinary Shares) each in return for 26 shares of 10
5
⁄8 pence held (the Existing Ordinary Shares) (the Share 
Capital Consolidation). On 7 June 2017, the Company held a General Meeting at which shareholders approved the Shareholder Return and 
the Share Capital Consolidation. On 26 June 2017, the Share Capital Consolidation took place and the New Ordinary Shares were admitted to 
trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange at 8.00am on 27 June 2017. On 17 July 2017, the special dividend of 61.0 pence 
per Existing Ordinary Share was paid to shareholders. Costs in relation to the Shareholder Return were £3 million.
Prior to consolidation 2,874,893 treasury shares were released to satisfy employee shared-based payments commitments (2016: 3,780,997), 
leaving a balance of 8,701,004 at 26 June 2017. These treasury shares were consolidated into 8,366,350 New Ordinary Shares and 
subsequently a further 138,174 treasury shares were released leaving a balance held at 30 September 2017 of 8,228,176. Proceeds  
received from the reissuance of treasury shares to satisfy employee share awards were £0.4 million (2016: £3 million).

The expense relating to these plans is not significant and no further disclosure is necessary except for the general details provided below:
1. SHARE OPTIONS
Full details of The Compass Group Share Option Plan 2010 (CSOP 2010), the Compass Group Share Option Plan (CSOP 2000), the Compass 
Group Management Share Option Plan (Management Plan) (collectively the Executive and Management Share Option Plans) and the UK 
Sharesave Plan are set out in prior years’ annual reports which are available on the Company’s website.
2. DEFERRED ANNUAL BONUS PLAN (DAB)
Certain senior executives participate in the DAB. A portion of the annual bonus awarded to certain executives is converted into shares. Subject 
to the achievement of local organic revenue growth and cumulative profit before interest and tax (PBIT) targets over the three year deferral 
period, the number of deferred shares may be increased. Enhancements to the deferred shares are only released to the participants subject to 
the performance levels being met.
3. RESTRICTED SHARES
Occasional awards to certain employees in order to incentivise the achievement of particular business objectives under specific circumstances 
or where similar such shares have been forfeit by a new employee on joining the Company. The plan can take different forms such as an 
award of shares dependent on a service or achievement of specific performance conditions other than service.
4. ACCELERATED GROWTH PLAN (AGP)
Contingent share awards under this plan have been awarded to the leadership team in certain countries in order to reward and encourage  
the growth of those businesses. Vesting of these awards was subject to the achievement of local organic revenue growth and cumulative PBIT 
targets over the three year period. 100% of the award vested if the maximum performance targets were met and 50% if minimum threshold 
performance targets were met. Awards vested on a straight line basis between these maximum and minimum points. The shares under the 
AGP have all vested, no extant cycles are in existence.
5. LONG TERM BONUS PLAN
Certain executives participating in the Long Term Bonus Plan in prior years received an award of deferred Compass Group PLC shares. The 
award of bonus shares is subject to performance conditions and matching shares may be released by the Company following the completion 
of a further period of service. The terms of the Plan require that these shares are purchased in the market, rather than being issued by the 
Company. The shares are purchased and distributed by the Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP) and LTIP Trust (LTIPT).

1. Contingent consideration is an estimate at the date of acquisition of the amount of additional consideration that will be payable in the future. The actual amount paid  
can vary from the estimate depending on the terms of the transaction and, for example, the actual performance of the acquired business.
The adjustments made in respect of acquisitions in the year to 30 September 2017 are provisional and will be finalised within 12 months  
of the acquisition date, principally in relation to the valuation of contracts acquired.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the businesses represents the premium the Group paid to acquire companies which complement 
the existing business and create significant opportunities for cross-selling and other synergies. The goodwill arising is not expected to be 
deductible for tax purposes.
In the period from acquisition to 30 September 2017, the acquisitions contributed revenue of £45 million and operating profit of £2.5 million 
to the Group’s results (2016: £129 million and £8 million respectively).
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 October 2016, it is estimated that the combined sales of Group and equity accounted joint ventures  
for the period would have been £22,893 million and total Group operating profit (including associates) would have been £1,667 million.

PERFORMANCE BONDS, GUARANTEES AND INDEMNITIES
The Company and certain subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and entered into counter-
indemnities in respect of such guarantees relating to the Group’s own contracts and/or the Group’s share of certain contractual obligations of 
joint arrangements and associates. Where the Group enters into such arrangements, it does so in order to provide assurance to the beneficiary 
that it will fulfil its existing contractual obligations. The issue of such guarantees and indemnities does not therefore increase the Group’s 
overall exposure and the disclosure of such performance bonds, guarantees and indemnities is given for information purposes only.
EUREST SUPPORT SERVICES
On 21 October 2005, the Company announced that it had instructed Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer to conduct an investigation into the 
relationships between Eurest Support Services (ESS) (a member of the Group), IHC Services Inc. (IHC) and the United Nations (UN).  
Ernst & Young assisted Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in this investigation. On 1 February 2006, it was announced that the investigation 
had concluded.
The investigation established serious irregularities in connection with contracts awarded to ESS by the UN. The work undertaken by 
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Ernst & Young gave no reason to believe that these issues extended beyond a few individuals within ESS 
to other parts of ESS or the wider Compass Group of companies.
The Group settled all outstanding civil litigation against it in relation to this matter in October 2006, but litigation continues between 
competitors of ESS, IHC and other parties involved in UN procurement.
IHC’s relationship with the UN and ESS was part of a wider investigation into UN procurement activity being conducted by the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and with which the Group co-operated fully. The current status of that investigation  
is uncertain and a matter for the US authorities. Those investigators could have had access to sources unavailable to the Group, Freshfields 
Bruckhaus Deringer or Ernst & Young, and further information may yet emerge which is inconsistent with, or additional to, the findings of  
the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer investigation, which could have an adverse impact on the Group. The Group has, however, not been 
contacted by, or received further requests for information from, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York  
in connection with these matters since January 2006. The Group has co-operated fully with the UN throughout.

OTHER LITIGATION AND CLAIMS
The Group is also involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the nature of its business and maintains insurance cover to reduce 
financial risk associated with claims related to these proceedings. Where appropriate, provisions are made to cover any potential 
uninsured losses.
In addition, the Group is subject to periodic tax audits and challenges with/by various fiscal authorities covering corporate, employee and sales 
taxes in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. None of these are currently expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial position.
OUTCOME
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome or quantify the financial effect of these proceedings, or any claim against the Group related 
thereto, in the opinion of the directors, any uninsured losses resulting from the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material 
effect on the financial position of the Group. The timing of the settlement of these proceedings or claims is uncertain.

Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 176 INTRODUCTION
The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation  
of the separate financial statements of Compass Group PLC (the 
Company) are set out below:
A ACCOUNTING CONVENTION AND BASIS OF 
PREPARATION
These financial statements are prepared in accordance with the 
historical cost convention, except as described in the accounting 
policy on financial instruments, Financial Reporting Standard 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101), and in accordance  
with applicable United Kingdom laws. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement  
and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRSs), but makes 
amendments where necessary in order to comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the 
FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. These financial 
statements thus present information about the Company as an 
individual undertaking not as a Group undertaking. In the transition 
to FRS 101 in the year ended 30 September 2016, the Company 
applied IFRS 1 whilst ensuring that its assets and liabilities were 
measured in compliance with FRS 101.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis. This is discussed in the Business Review on page 33.
B EXEMPTIONS
The Company’s financial statements are included in the Compass 
Group PLC consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
30 September 2017. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies 
Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and 
loss account.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the 
exemptions under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
• a cash flow statement and related notes
• transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries
• capital management
• as required by IFRS 13 Fair value measurement and IFRS 7 
Financial instrument disclosures
• the effect of new but not yet effective IFRSs
• disclosures in respect of compensation of key management 
personnel
• FRS 2 Share based payments in respect of Group settled 
share-based payments
C CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company has not applied any accounting standards for the first 
time in the year ended 30 September 2017.
D INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.  
In the opinion of the directors the value of such investments is  
not less than shown at the balance sheet date.
Investment income is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable. It represents dividend income which is 
recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
E FOREIGN CURRENCY
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling 
at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end. Gains and losses 
arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for 
the period.
F BORROWINGS
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction 
costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost unless they are part of a fair value hedge accounting 
relationship. Borrowings that are part of a fair value hedge 
accounting relationship are measured at amortised cost plus  
or minus the fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.
G DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL 
INSTRUMENTS
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its 
exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. 
Derivative instruments utilised include interest rate swaps, currency 
swaps and forward currency contracts. The Company and Group 
policy is disclosed in the accounting policies to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions and 
derecognised when it ceases to be party to such provisions. Such 
assets and liabilities are classified as current if they are expected to 
be realised or settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date.  
If not, they are recognised as non-current.
H DIVIDENDS
Dividends are recognised in the Company’s financial statements  
in the year in which they are approved in general meeting by the 
Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised 
when paid.
I DEFERRED TAX
Deferred tax is provided at the anticipated rates on temporary 
differences arising from the inclusion of items of income and 
expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in 
which they are included in the financial statements. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely 
than not that they will be recovered.

PARENT COMPANY  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PARENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
For the year ended 30 September 2017
J SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at 
fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting 
conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the 
grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed 
on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the 
effect of the non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using either the binomial distribution or 
Black-Scholes option pricing models as is most appropriate for each 
scheme. The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, 
based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The issue of share incentives by the Company to employees of its 
subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions. An addition 
to the Company’s investment in Group undertakings is reported with 
a corresponding increase in shareholders’ funds. For details of the 
charge see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
K INTERCOMPANY AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Intercompany and other receivables are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method less any impairment.
Intercompany and other receivables are assessed for indicators  
of impairment at each reporting end date and are impaired where 
there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events 
that occurred after the initial recognition for the financial asset,  
the estimated cash flows have been adversely affected.

electronically does not discriminate between registered shareholders 
of the same class. The facility is available to all registered 
shareholders on equal terms and participation is made as simple  
as possible. Please note that it is the shareholder’s responsibility  
to notify the registrar (through www.signalshares.com or by post)  
of any change to their email address. Before electing for electronic

CASH DIVIDENDS
The Company normally pays a dividend twice each year. We 
encourage UK resident ordinary shareholders to elect to have their 
dividends paid directly into their bank or building society account. 
This is a more secure method of payment and avoids delays or the 
cheques being lost. Most ordinary shareholders resident outside 
the UK can also have any dividends in excess of £10 paid into their 
bank account directly via Link Asset Services’ global payments 
service. Details and terms and conditions may be viewed at  
http://ips.linkassetservices.com.
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (DRIP)
A DRIP service is provided by Link Market Services Trustees 
Limited. The DRIP allows eligible shareholders to use the whole  
of their cash dividend to buy additional shares in the Company, 
thereby increasing their shareholding. Additional information, 
including details of how to sign up, can be obtained from the 
Company’s website at www.compass-group.com and from  
Link Market Services Trustees Limited; telephone within the UK:

IDENTITY THEFT
Advice on protecting your Compass Group PLC shares:
• keep all Compass correspondence in a safe place, or destroy 
correspondence by shredding
• when changing address, inform the registrar, Link Asset  
Services. If a letter from Link Asset Services is received regarding 
a change of address and you have not moved, contact the 
registrar immediately
• consider having your dividends paid directly into your bank or 
building society account. This will reduce the risk of the cheque 
being intercepted or lost in the post. You can complete a Request 
for Payment of Interest or Dividends form which are available  
from and should be returned to the registrar. Alternatively, register 
online at www.signalshares.com using the Share Portal service.  
If you require further information please contact the registrar
• on changing your bank or building society account, inform the 
registrar of the details of the new account and respond to any 
letters Link Asset Services send you about this
• when buying or selling shares, deal only with brokers registered  
in your country of residence or the UK
WARNING ABOUT SHARE FRAUD
Fraudsters use persuasive and high pressure tactics to lure investors 
into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be 
worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in 
return for an upfront payment.
Whilst high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way, 
you will probably lose your money.
HOW TO AVOID SHARE FRAUD
• keep in mind that firms authorised by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) are unlikely to contact you out of the blue with an 
offer to buy or sell shares
• do not get into a conversation. Note the name of the person and 
firm contacting you and then end the call
• check the Financial Services Register at www.fca.org.uk to see  
if the person and firm contacting you are authorised by the FCA
• beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, 
copying its website or giving you false contact details
• use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want to 
call it back
• call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact 
details on the Register or if you are told they are out of date
• search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at www.fca.org.uk
• consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm 
you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or 
the Financial Services Compensation Scheme
• think about getting independent financial and professional advice 
before you hand over any money
• remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
REPORT A SCAM
If you are approached by fraudsters, please tell the FCA using the 
share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk, where you can find 
out more about investment scams, or call the FCA Consumer 
Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters, you  
should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or online  
at www.actionfraud.police.uk.

SHAREHOLDER  
INFORMATION 2014 RETURN OF CASH AND SHARE CAPITAL 
CONSOLIDATION – BASE COST APPORTIONMENT 
FOR UK TAX PURPOSES
On 11 June 2014, shareholders approved a Return of Cash of 56 
pence per Existing Ordinary Share, which resulted in approximately 
£1 billion being returned through the issue of one B or C Share to 
shareholders for each Existing Ordinary Share held at 6.00pm on 
7 July 2014. The Return of Cash was accompanied by a consolidation 
of the Existing Ordinary Shares in the ratio of 16 New Ordinary 
Shares for every 17 Existing Ordinary Shares. The New Ordinary 
Shares were admitted to trading on 8 July 2014. The B and C shares 
were not admitted to trading.
The Base Cost Apportionment is in general terms based on 
respective market values on the first day after the reorganisation 
on which a price for the New Ordinary Shares was quoted on the 
London Stock Exchange. Based on the New Ordinary Share price of 
1,024.50 pence and the market value of a B Share and of a C Share 
of 56 pence, and calculated using the ratio of 16 New Ordinary 
Shares and 17 B or 17 C Shares for every 17 Existing Ordinary 
Shares previously held, 94.51% of the base cost of the Existing 
Ordinary Shares is apportioned to the New Ordinary Shares and 
5.49% to the B and/or C Shares.

2017 SHAREHOLDER RETURN AND SHARE CAPITAL 
CONSOLIDATION – TAX INFORMATION
On 7 June 2017, shareholders approved a return of 61.0 pence  
per Existing Ordinary Share, which resulted in approximately 
£1 billion being returned to shareholders by way of a special 
dividend (the Shareholder Return). The Shareholder Return was 
accompanied by a Share Capital Consolidation of the Existing 
Ordinary Shares in the ratio of 25 New Ordinary Shares for every 
26 Existing Ordinary Shares held at 6.00pm on 26 June 2017. 
The New Ordinary Shares were admitted to trading on 27 June 2017.
The New Ordinary Shares arising from the Share Consolidation 
result from a reorganisation of the share capital of the Company. 
Accordingly, to the extent that a Shareholder received New Ordinary 
Shares, the Shareholder should not be treated as making a disposal 
of all or part of the Shareholder’s holding of Existing Ordinary Shares 
by reason of the Share Consolidation being implemented, and the 
New Ordinary Shares which replaced a Shareholder’s holding of 
Existing Ordinary Shares as a result of the Share Consolidation will 
be treated as the same asset acquired at the same time as when 
the Shareholder’s holding of Existing Ordinary Shares was acquired.

by Article 13 of the Company’s Articles of Association and in 
addition to any authority granted under Resolution 21 to allot 
equity securities (as defined in the Companies Act 2006) for 
cash under the authority given by that Resolution and/or to sell 
ordinary shares held by the Company as treasury shares for 
cash as if section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 did not apply 
to any such allotment or sale, such authority to be:
22.1  limited to the allotment of equity shares or sale of 
treasury shares up to a nominal amount of £8,746,517 
being not more than 5% of the issued ordinary share 
capital (excluding treasury shares) of the Company as at 
1 December 2017, being the last practicable date prior 
to the publication of this Notice;
22.2  used only for the purposes of financing (or refinancing, 
if the authority is to be used within six months after the 
original transaction) a transaction which the directors 
determine to be an acquisition or other capital investment 
of a kind contemplated by the Statement of Principles on 
Disapplying Pre-Emption Rights most recently published 
by the Pre-Emption Group prior to the date of this Notice,
such authority to expire at the end of the next Annual General 
Meeting of the Company or, if earlier, at close of business on 
7 May 2019, but in each case, prior to its expiry the Company 
may make offers, and enter into agreements, which would,  
or might require equity securities to be allotted (and treasury 
shares to be sold) after the authority expires and the directors 
may allot equity securities (and sell treasury shares) under any 
such offer or agreement as if the authority had not expired.

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING CONTINUED
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 186 RESOLUTION 18 – DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES
It is not Group policy to make donations to political parties.  
However, it is possible that certain routine activities undertaken  
by the Company and its subsidiaries might unintentionally fall within 
the wide definition of matters constituting political donations and 
expenditure in the CA 2006. Any expenditure that is regulated under 
the CA 2006 must first be approved by shareholders and will be 
disclosed in next year’s Annual Report. This Resolution, if passed, 
will renew the directors’ authority until the AGM to be held in 2019 
(2019 AGM) (when the directors intend to renew this authority) to 
make donations and incur expenditure which might otherwise be 
caught by the terms of the CA 2006, up to an aggregate amount  
of £100,000 for the Company and for subsidiary companies.
RESOLUTION 19 – ADOPTION OF THE LONG TERM INCENTIVE 
PLAN 2018 (2018 LTIP)
The Compass Group Long Term Incentive Plan 2010 (2010 LTIP) 
will shortly expire. It is proposed that future share incentive awards 
to the executive directors and members of the Executive Board be 
made under a new long term incentive plan, consistent with the new 
Remuneration Policy to be proposed for shareholder approval as 
Resolution 2. There are no material changes to the 2010 LTIP save 
to the weighting of performance measures and the introduction of 
deferred bonus shares as detailed in the Appendix on pages 190 
and 191. The 2018 LTIP is designed to incentivise executive 
directors and other such senior executives by providing a share of 
the long term value they create for shareholders. The Remuneration 
Committee of the Board believes this to be the most appropriate way 
to recognise superior performance.
The proposed new plan rules have been drafted to take account of 
current governance guidelines and the terms of the proposed new 
plan will remain broadly similar to those of the existing rules, such 
that awards will continue to be subject to three primary performance 
conditions which will be measured over a three year 
performance period.
The performance conditions will remain unchanged: Return on 
Capital Employed (ROCE), Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF) and 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR). However, it is proposed that the 
relative weightings be amended from 1/3 for each performance 
element to 40% for ROCE, 40% for AFCF and 20% for 
TSR respectively.
The maximum opportunity of 250% of base salary for the current 
Group Chief Executive and 200% of base salary for other current 
executive directors remains unchanged, although as part of 
a rebalanced overall remuneration package, as a result of the change 
in executive leadership from 1 April 2018, the maximum opportunity 
will be increased to 300% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive 
and 250% of base salary for other executive directors, subject to 
shareholder approval. An award of up to 400% of base salary may  
be made on appointment and/or in exceptional circumstances.  
Were such an award to be made, an explanation of why it was 
necessary to make the award would be given to shareholders.  
All awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions.
Shareholder approval is being sought for the 2018 LTIP rules  
at the AGM to ensure that the 2018 LTIP reflects the proposed new 
Remuneration Policy. The proposed new Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy, for which shareholder approval is being sought, is set out on 
pages 77 to 83.
EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE RESOLUTIONS
RESOLUTION 1 – ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS
The directors are required to present to the AGM the audited 
Accounts and the Directors’ and Auditor’s Reports for the financial 
year ended 30 September 2017.
RESOLUTION 2 – REMUNERATION POLICY
Shareholders are requested to approve the Remuneration Policy. 
The Remuneration Policy is set out on pages 77 to 83 of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report contained within the 2017  
Annual Report and Accounts.
In accordance with section 439A of the Companies Act 2006 (CA 
2006), a separate Resolution on the Remuneration Policy part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report is required to be put to a vote by 
shareholders. The vote is binding which means that payments 
cannot be made under the Policy until it has been approved 
by shareholders.
The Policy Report must be put to shareholders at least every three 
years, unless during that time it is to be changed. The Company 
currently intends to submit the Policy for approval by shareholders 
every three years.
RESOLUTION 3 – DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
In accordance with section 439 of the CA 2006, shareholders are 
requested to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report. The 
Directors’ Remuneration Report is set out on pages 84 to 94 of the 
2017 Annual Report and Accounts. The vote is advisory.
RESOLUTION 4 – FINAL DIVIDEND
The final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2017 will be 
paid on 26 February 2018 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 19 January 2018, subject to 
shareholder approval.
RESOLUTIONS 5 TO 15 – RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Biographical details of all the directors standing for re-election 
appear on pages 47 to 49 of the 2017 Annual Report.
The Company’s Articles of Association require one third of the 
directors to retire by rotation each year and no director may serve  
for more than three years without being re-elected by shareholders. 
However, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the Code), all the directors will submit themselves for annual 
re-election by shareholders.
Having conducted an evaluation during the year, it is the view of the 
Chairman that the performance of each of the directors continues to 
be effective and that each director demonstrates commitment to the 
role and has sufficient time to meet his or her commitment to 
the Company.
RESOLUTIONS 16 AND 17 – AUDITOR
The auditor is appointed at every general meeting at which 
accounts are presented to shareholders. The current appointment 
of KPMG LLP as the Company’s auditor will end at the conclusion 
of the AGM and it has advised of its willingness to stand for 
reappointment. In accordance with provisions of the Code,  
it is best recommended practice for the Audit Committee to be 
authorised to agree how much the auditor should be paid and 
Resolution 17 grants this authority to the Audit Committee.
187 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017
SHAREHOLDER  
INFORMATION RESOLUTIONS 21 AND 22 – DISAPPLICATION OF  
PRE-EMPTION RIGHTS
If the Company issues new shares, or sells treasury shares, for cash 
(other than in connection with an employee share scheme), it must 
first offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing 
holdings. In accordance with investor guidelines, approval is sought 
by the directors to issue a limited number of ordinary shares for cash 
without offering them to existing shareholders.
The Pre-Emption Group (which represents the Investment 
Association and the Pension and Lifetime Savings Association) 
published a revised statement of principles for the disapplication of 
pre-emption rights (the Principles) in 2015. The Principles provide 
that a general authority for the disapplication of pre-emption rights 
over approximately 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital should be treated as routine. This general authority, which 
the directors have sought and received in previous years, is dealt 
with under Resolution 21.
Subject to the passing of Resolution 20, Resolution 21 seeks to 
replace the authority conferred on the directors at the 7 June 2017 
general meeting (2017 GM) to allot ordinary shares, or grant rights  
to subscribe for, or convert securities into, ordinary shares or sell 
treasury shares for cash (other than pursuant to an employee equity 
incentive share scheme) up to an aggregate nominal value of 
approximately 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital 
without application of pre-emption rights pursuant to Article 13 of 
the Company’s Articles of Association and section 561 of the  
CA 2006. Other than in connection with a rights, scrip dividend,  
or other similar issue, the authority contained in this Resolution 21 
would be limited to a maximum nominal amount of £8,746,517.
The Pre-Emption Group further provides that the Company may, as 
a routine, seek to disapply pre-emption rights over the equivalent of 
approximately an additional 5% of the issued ordinary share capital 
of the Company, so long as certain criteria are met.
Subject to the passing of Resolution 20 and in addition to the 
authority granted by Resolution 21, Resolution 22 seeks to replace 
the authority conferred on the directors at the 2017 GM to allot 
ordinary shares, or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert securities 
into, ordinary shares or sell treasury shares for cash (other than 
pursuant to an employee equity incentive share scheme) up to an 
aggregate nominal value of approximately 5% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital without application of pre-emption 
rights pursuant to Article 13 of the Company’s Articles of Association 
and section 561 of the CA 2006, provided that this authority will only 
be used for the purpose of:
(i) an acquisition; or
(ii) a specified capital investment in respect of which sufficient 
information regarding the effect of the investment on the 
Company, the assets that are the subject of the investment and 
(where appropriate) the profits attributable to those assets is 
made available to shareholders to enable them to reach an 
assessment of the potential return on the investment
which is announced contemporaneously with the issue or which 
has taken place in the preceding six month period and is disclosed 
in the announcement of the issue.
The main features of the plan are summarised in the Appendix to 
this Notice on pages 190 and 191.
The Rules of the 2018 LTIP, together with the other documents for 
inspection, will be available for inspection during normal business 
hours from the date of dispatch of this Notice until the date of the 
AGM (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) at the 
registered office of the Company, Compass House, Guildford Street, 
Chertsey, Surrey KT16 9BQ and, in accordance with Listing Rule 
13.8.11 of the UK Listing Rules, at the offices of Freshfields 
Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, 65 Fleet Street, London, EC4Y 1HS and 
will also be made available at the AGM for a period of 15 minutes 
prior to and during the continuance of the AGM.
RESOLUTION 20 – DIRECTORS’ AUTHORITY TO ALLOT SHARES
The purpose of Resolution 20 is to renew the directors’ power to allot 
shares. Resolution 20.1 seeks to grant the directors authority to allot, 
pursuant to Article 12 of the Company’s Articles of Association and 
section 551 of the CA 2006, relevant securities with a maximum 
nominal amount of £58,299,800. This represents 527,600,000 
ordinary shares of 11
1
⁄20 pence each in the capital of the Company, 
which is approximately one third of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 1 December 2017 
(being the last practicable date prior to the publication of this 
Notice). The Company currently holds 6,640,021 shares in treasury. 
The authority would, unless previously renewed, revoked or varied 
by shareholders, remain in force up to the conclusion of the 2019 
AGM of the Company or close of business on 7 May 2019, 
whichever is earlier.
In accordance with the Investment Association Share Capital 
Management Guidelines (the Guidelines), Resolution 20.2 seeks to 
grant the directors authority to allot approximately a further one third 
of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury 
shares) in connection with a rights issue in favour of ordinary 
shareholders with a nominal value of up to £58,299,800 
(representing 527,600,000 ordinary shares of 11
1
⁄20 pence each). 
Such additional authority will be valid until the conclusion of the 
2019 AGM.
If the Company uses any of the additional one third authority 
permitted by the Guidelines, the Company will ensure that all 
directors stand for re-election. The Company’s current practice is 
that all directors submit themselves for re-election each year in 
accordance with the Code, notwithstanding the provisions set out 
in the Guidelines.
The total authorisation sought by Resolution 20 is equal to 
approximately two thirds of the issued ordinary share capital of  
the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at 1 December 2017,  
being the last practicable date prior to publication of this Notice.
Resolutions 1 to 20 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions and 
require that more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of 
a resolution for it to be passed.
NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING CONTINUED
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 188 No share repurchases were made from 15 June 2017 to 
30 September 2017. No further share repurchases have been 
made between 1 October and 1 December 2017 (being the last 
practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice). The directors 
consider it desirable for such general authority to be available in 
order to maintain an efficient capital structure whilst at the same 
time retaining the flexibility to fund any infill acquisitions.
As at 1 December 2017 (being the last practicable date prior to  
the publication of this Notice) there were 1,589,736,625 11
1
⁄20 
pence ordinary shares in issue and 6,640,021 11
1
⁄20 pence ordinary 
shares held in treasury for the purpose of satisfying the Company’s 
obligations under employee equity incentive schemes. Shares held 
in treasury are not eligible to participate in dividends and do not 
carry any voting rights.
As at 1 December 2017 (being the last practicable date prior 
to the publication of this Notice), there were options to subscribe  
for ordinary shares issued by the Company outstanding over 
approximately 7,300,000 shares which represent 0.46% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) 
at that date. If the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary 
shares was exercised in full, these options would represent 
0.51% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding 
treasury shares).
RESOLUTION 24 – NOTICE OF MEETINGS OTHER THAN 
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGS
The Company’s Articles of Association allow the directors to call 
general meetings, other than AGMs, on 14 clear working days’ 
notice. However, under the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) 
Regulations 2009 (the Regulations), all general meetings must be 
held on 21 days’ notice, unless shareholders agree to a shorter 
notice period, and the Company has met the requirements for 
electronic voting under the Regulations. This Resolution seeks to 
renew the authority granted by shareholders at last year’s AGM 
which preserved the Company’s ability to call general meetings, 
other than AGMs, on 14 clear working days’ notice, such authority to 
be effective until the Company’s next AGM, when a similar resolution 
will be proposed. The directors confirm that the shorter notice period 
would not be used as a matter of routine, but only where flexibility is 
merited by the business of the meeting and it is thought to be to the 
advantage of shareholders as a whole. An electronic voting facility 
will be made available to all shareholders for any meeting held on 
such notice.
Resolutions 21 to 24 will be proposed as special resolutions and 
require that at least three quarters of the votes cast must be in 
favour of a resolution for it to be passed.
RECOMMENDATION
The directors consider that each of the Resolutions is in the best 
interests of the Company and the shareholders as a whole and, 
accordingly, recommend that all shareholders vote in favour of all 
Resolutions, as the directors intend to do in respect of their 
own holdings.
Other than in connection with a rights, scrip dividend, or other 
similar issue, the authority contained in this Resolution 22 would 
be limited to a maximum nominal amount of £8,746,517.
These together represent 158,308,000 ordinary shares of 11
1
⁄20 
pence each in the capital of the Company, which is approximately 
10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding 
treasury shares) as at 1 December 2017 (being the last practicable 
date prior to the publication of this Notice). The authority would, 
unless previously renewed, revoked or varied by shareholders, 
expire at the conclusion of the AGM of the Company to be held 
in 2019 or close of business on 7 May 2019, if earlier.
Save for issues of shares in respect of various employee share 
schemes and any share dividend alternatives, the directors have no 
current plans to utilise the authorities sought by Resolutions 20, 21 
and 22, although they consider their renewal appropriate in order to 
retain maximum flexibility to take advantage of business 
opportunities as they arise. In addition, and in line with best practice, 
the Company has not issued more than 7.5% of its issued share 
capital on a non-pro rata basis over the last three years. The limit 
also applies to shares issued from treasury. A renewal of this 
authority will be proposed at each subsequent AGM and the 
directors confirm their intention to follow best practice set out in the 
Principles which provides that usage of this authority in excess of 
7.5% of the Company’s issued share capital in a rolling three-year 
period would not take place without prior consultation 
with shareholders.
RESOLUTION 23 – PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES
This Resolution authorises the directors to make limited on market 
purchases of the Company’s ordinary shares. The power is limited  
to a maximum of 158,308,000 shares (just under 10% of the issued 
ordinary share capital as at 1 December 2017, being the last 
practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice) and details 
the minimum and maximum prices that can be paid, exclusive of 
expenses. The authority conferred by this Resolution will expire at 
the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM or 18 months from the 
passing of this Resolution, whichever is the earlier.
The CA 2006 permits the Company to hold shares repurchased as 
treasury shares. Treasury shares may be cancelled, sold for cash or 
used for the purpose of satisfying the Company’s obligations in 
connection with employee equity incentive schemes. The authority 
to be sought by this Resolution is intended to apply equally to shares 
to be held by the Company as treasury shares. No dividends will be 
paid on shares which are held as treasury shares and no voting 
rights will be attached to them. Shares held as treasury shares will 
normally be used to satisfy the Company’s obligations under the 
Company’s employee equity incentive schemes.
From 1 October 2016 to 21 April 2017, the Company repurchased 
and subsequently cancelled 1,340,344 ordinary shares of 10
5
⁄8 
pence for a consideration of £19 million (including expenses).
On 14 June 2017, 35 ordinary shares of 10
5
⁄8 pence were 
repurchased for a consideration of £582 (including expenses) 
in relation to the Shareholder Return and associated Share Capital 
Consolidation. Of the 35 shares repurchased 10 were placed into 
treasury and the remaining 25 shares were subsequently cancelled.

SHAREHOLDER  
INFORMATION Timing and basis of awards
Awards may be made within the period of 42 days commencing on 
the date of approval of the 2018 LTIP by shareholders or the day 
following the announcement of the annual or half year results of the 
Company in any year. Awards may also be made at any other time 
when, in the opinion of the Committee, the circumstances are 
considered to be exceptional so as to justify the making of an award.
Awards will be made for nil cost and will be determined by reference 
to a participant’s base salary and the Company’s closing share price 
on the day preceding the date on which an award is made. Benefits 
under the 2018 LTIP will not be pensionable.
No award may be made more than 10 years after the date of 
adoption of the 2018 LTIP and the Committee will formally review 
the 2018 LTIP by no later than February 2028.
Limits of participation
The annual limit for the value of shares over which an award may  
be made under the 2018 LTIP is 250% of base salary for the Group 
Chief Executive and 200% of base salary for all other executive 
directors. Following the change in executive leadership from 
1 April 2018, the maximum shares awarded will be 300% of base 
salary for the Group Chief Executive and 250% for other executive 
directors. An award of up to 400% of base salary may be made  
on appointment and/or in exceptional circumstances.
Dilution Limits
The 2018 LTIP will operate within the limits recommended by the 
Investment Association in respect of awards settled by the issue  
of new shares or by the transfer of treasury shares.
In any 10 year period, not more than 5% of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company may be issued under the 2018 LTIP 
and all other discretionary employee share plans, and not more than 
10% may be issued under the 2018 LTIP and all other employee 
share schemes operated by the Company. These limits do not 
include awards which have lapsed.
Vesting and lapse of awards
At the end of the three year performance period, once the 
Committee has determined the extent to which awards under the 
2018 LTIP have vested, awards will be released within 45 days. 
Awards may be satisfied by the issue of new shares, market 
purchases, treasury shares or, if required (for example, because of 
securities laws), in cash at the discretion of the Committee at any 
time up to the release of an award. If satisfaction is by way of cash, 
such amount is determined by reference to the Company’s share 
price on the vesting date.
Early vesting
If a participant ceases to be an employee in certain circumstances, 
including injury, ill health, disability or redundancy, any unvested 
award will lapse unless the Committee otherwise determines at its 
absolute discretion, in which case it shall permit awards to continue 
until the normal vesting date and be satisfied, subject to the 
achievement of the performance conditions. If a participant ceases 
to be an employee by reason of contractual or agreed early 
retirement, any unvested award will continue until the normal vesting 
date and be satisfied, subject to achievement of the performance 
conditions. In the aforementioned circumstances, any shares vesting 
will be reduced on a time-apportioned basis unless otherwise 
determined by the Committee. In the event of the death of 
APPENDIX
SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF THE COMPASS 
GROUP PLC LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 2018 (2018 LTIP)
Eligibility
The plan is discretionary and participation will be available to 
full time employees of the Group, including executive directors, who 
are not within six months of their expected normal retirement date.
Performance
The vesting of shares (other than awards made as a Deferred Bonus 
Award) under each performance condition is independent. 
Therefore, the total vesting amount is based on the relevant 
percentage achievement for each performance measure.
40% of any LTIP will be based on Return on Capital Employed 
(ROCE), 40% on Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF) and 20% on 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over a three year performance 
period. The precise AFCF target for each award will be linked to the 
Group’s wider business targets and will be set by the Remuneration 
Committee of the Board (the Committee) at the time of award based 
on Group projections and market expectations.
ROCE is calculated at the end of the three year performance period 
as net underlying operating profit after tax divided by 12 month 
average capital employed. If the ROCE target is satisfied, the 
number of awards that vest will depend on the ROCE achieved over 
the performance period such that if the par ROCE target is achieved 
50% of the award based on ROCE will vest and if the maximum 
ROCE target is achieved, 100% of the award based on ROCE vests. 
Awards will vest on a straight line basis between 0% and 100% 
where ROCE is between threshold and maximum performance.
If the threshold AFCF cashflow target is satisfied, the number of 
awards that vest will depend on the level of AFCF achieved over the 
performance period such that if par cashflow target is achieved, 
50% of the portion of the award based on AFCF will vest and if the 
maximum cashflow target is achieved, 100% of the award based  
on AFCF shall vest. Awards will vest on a straight line basis  
between 0% and 100% where AFCF is between threshold and 
maximum performance.
TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and dividends paid 
(assuming reinvestment of those dividends in the Company’s shares 
during the three year performance period). 100% of the portion of 
the award based on TSR will vest if performance is in the upper 
quartile and 25% of the award will vest if performance is at the 
median. Where performance is between the median and top 
quartile, awards will vest on a straight line basis between the median 
and top quartile. No shares will be released if the Company’s TSR 
performance is below the median. The Committee must also be 
satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Company 
justifies the vesting of an award.
Calculations of the achievement of the targets will be independently 
performed and approved by the Committee.

a participant during the performance period, such award will 
immediately vest, subject to the satisfaction of the performance 
conditions on that date and to reduction on a time-apportioned 
basis, unless the Committee decides otherwise.
Dividends
The Committee may permit dividend equivalents to be accrued  
on the shares earned from any awards.
Post-vest holding
The Committee may impose a holding period of up to five years on 
participants whose awards have vested, net of any shares sold to 
meet personal tax and social security obligations of the director. 
A two year post-vest holding period is expected to be imposed upon 
all awards made to executive directors as is the case under the 
2010 LTIP.
Deferred Bonus Award
The Committee may make an award to Participants linked to the 
amount of a Participant’s bonus where the Participant has not met 
the shareholding guidelines in force at the time that a bonus is paid. 
The number of shares subject to a Deferred Bonus Award will be 
calculated using that part of a Participant’s annual bonus (before the 
deduction of tax and social security contributions) which the 
Participant has been required to receive in the form of a Deferred 
Bonus Award using the market value of the shares as determined by 
the Committee. Deferred Bonus Shares would vest after a three year 
period and would be subject to malus and clawback.
Change of control
In the event of a change of control of the Company, any unvested 
awards will vest immediately, subject to satisfaction of the 
performance conditions as at the date of completion of the change of 
control and subject to reduction on a time-apportioned basis. In the 
event of an internal reorganisation, an award will normally be released 
and replaced by a new award which will continue to be governed 
under the rules of the 2018 LTIP.
Recoupment
Malus and clawback can be applied to awards made under the  
2018 LTIP so that the provisions apply both before an award vests  
and for a period of three years after vesting and apply in various 
circumstances, such as serious misconduct of a participant, including 
where facts arise after termination of employment, where the remedies 
include lapsing awards which have not vested and forfeiting of vested 
awards with the right to reclaim amounts from the affected participant.
Variation in share capital
The Committee may make such adjustments to awards as it 
considers appropriate in the event of any variation in the share 
capital of the Company.
Amendments
The Committee may amend the 2018 LTIP as it considers 
appropriate. However, shareholder approval is required to amend 
any provision to the advantage of participants relating to eligibility, 
dilution limits, the terms of vesting, the rights attaching to the shares 
acquired under the 2018 LTIP, or to the adjustment of awards. 
Shareholder approval is not required for minor amendments to 
benefit the administration of the 2018 LTIP or to take account  
of changes in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, 
exchange control or regulatory treatment for participants or 
the Company.

questions at the AGM. When invited by the Chairman, if you wish 
to ask a question, please wait for a Company representative to bring 
you a microphone. It would be helpful if you could state your name 
before you ask your question. A question may not be answered at

added to those received by proxy, and the provisional final votes 
will be displayed at the Meeting.
The indicative voting results, which will include all votes cast for and 
against each Resolution at the Meeting, and all proxies lodged prior 
to the Meeting, will be displayed at the Meeting and the final results 
published on the Company’s website, the London Stock Exchange 
and on the document storage system, Morningstar, as soon as 
practicable after the Meeting. The Company will also disclose the 
number of votes withheld.
If you have already voted by proxy, you will still be able to vote at the 
Meeting and your vote on the day will replace your previously lodged 
proxy vote.
Whomever you appoint as a proxy can vote or abstain from voting 
as he or she decides on any other business which may validly come 
before the AGM. This includes proxies appointed using the CREST 
service. Details of how to complete the appointment of a proxy either 
electronically or on paper are given in the notes to this Notice.

comprised 1,583,096,604 ordinary shares of 11
1
⁄20 pence each 
(excluding treasury shares). The holders of ordinary shares are

a vote by show of hands, every ordinary shareholder who is present 
has one vote and every proxy present who has been duly appointed 
by a shareholder entitled to vote has one vote. On a vote by poll, 
every ordinary shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has
