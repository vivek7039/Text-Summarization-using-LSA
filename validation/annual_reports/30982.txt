INTRODUCTION
2017 was an important year for Parity, one in which good
operational management created continuing
improvement despite the risk and headwinds of the
IR35 regulatory changes to the taxation of intermediaries
which oﬀered a signiﬁcant challenge to our industry.
STRATEGY
Importantly, the management team has begun further
activity to leverage the consulting services side of the
business, to drive operating margin improvement. The
Board will seek to accelerate growth in the consulting
business, whilst sustaining investment in the traditional
professional services side of the business. 
Strategically, Parity believes it has established a clear point
of diﬀerentiation from competitors due to the synergy
between its consulting and professional services divisions.
We are now highly focussed on exploiting this advantage
and we are investing in key hires to optimise the
opportunities which we believe exist. We also believe that
a focus on Data Management, which we ﬁrst identiﬁed as
an opportunity 18 months ago, now has the potential to
become a leading oﬀering for the Group in 2018.
RESULTS 
It has been particularly pleasing in 2017 to see strong
customer relationship management lead to a 73% increase
in proﬁt before tax to £1.66m (2016: £0.96m). This was
further leveraged by strong working capital management,
with Group debtor days at a record low of 20 days (2016:
29 days). As a result of strong cash generation, we were
able to reduce net debt substantially to £1.6m at 31
December 2017 (2016: £4.4m), whilst also investing for
future growth.
Key relationships held by the business for many years such
as the Education and Skills Funding Agency, British
American Tobacco and the Ministry of Defence, continued
to widen and deepen, and we were able to announce post-
close extensions on these contracts. New clients have
been developed such as Primark, the high street retailer,
and this together with the combination of good
relationship management and increasing traction from
new relationships underpin the outlook for 2018.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The ﬁnal legacy from the previous strategy is the Group’s
bespoke 3D development arm, Inition which has for some
time been a non-core asset. It has been held for sale and
accounted for as a discontinued operation in these
accounts. Despite having good skills and some speciﬁc
successes, the business had a disappointing year in 2017
due to its lack of scale and lack of synergy with the rest of
the Group. Following a diligent process, the Board remains
optimistic of a sale of the business to a home where a
greater synergy can be achieved, and will keep this plan
under review. 
DIVIDEND
The Board will not declare a dividend at this time but looks
forward to restoring a dividend in the medium term.
PEOPLE
We would like to thank the wider team across Parity for
all their hard work and commitment in helping the
management team drive the business forward. It is a
testament to this hard work that we have been able to
make such strong progress with our strategy and achieve
such a robust performance despite considerable change. 
BOARD
As ﬁrst announced on 23 March 2017, I joined the Board
as Group Non-Executive Chairman on 27 April 2017,
replacing Lord Freeman.
CURRENT TRADING AND OUTLOOK
Trading in the current ﬁnancial year remains in line with
expectations and the Board remains conﬁdent in the
outlook and continues to target investment to support
strategic progress. We believe our continued drive to
rebalance revenues towards the higher margin consulting
arm of the business positions us well to deliver both
growth and further improvements in proﬁtability in 2018
and beyond.

Strategic Report Governance Accounts, notes and other information
Parity Group enables people led, technology driven
change
Parity drives digital transformation through consultancy,
technology and people solutions. It helps customers
transform the way they deliver their services to improve
speed, eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness. Its distinctive,
integrated oﬀering combines:
•     The consulting business which has secured large
ongoing contracts at higher margins which we have
now focussed on dynamic, high growth services 
•     The recruitment business which provides access to
high-calibre and hard-to-ﬁnd expertise direct to
clients and for Parity managed projects
Parity Consultancy Services
Helping clients to make the best use of technology to
inform better decision making
This division is focused on successful project delivery
driven by senior industry-experienced consultants. They
guide development of data strategy and deliver data
solutions which generate competitive advantage by
closing the gap between information and insight, enabling
more eﬀective decision making.
Parity Professionals
Helping clients to recruit the best people to deliver real
beneﬁt to your business
This division provides targeted recruitment of temporary
and permanent professionals to support IT and business
change programmes. They ensure clients have both the
capacity and capability to transform organisational
performance in high growth and rapidly evolving markets.
Group
By aligning both divisions, Parity provides an attractive
combination of trusted consultancy advice with access to
the best delivery expertise. When necessary, we
supplement our industry and technology specialists with
access to the broader contractor market through Parity
Professionals. As a client-centric organisation, this enables
us to fulﬁl their needs through a broad range of services
ensuring Parity remains innovative, ﬂexible and very
scalable. The model is now proven, and we look forward
to accelerating it during 2018 and 2019.

Alan Rommel – Chief Executive Oﬃcer
Introduction 
I am delighted by the continuing improvement in the
Group’s performance, as shown by ﬁve consecutive halves
of improving comparative metrics, all achieved through
self-funded growth. I would like to thank all my colleagues
at Parity for their continued support in delivering this
positive run of results.
We have plenty still to do to build on our strategic
improvement of the business and we would like to thank
our shareholders who have been both patient and
supportive during our journey to this point. Our focus in
2018 is on demonstrating that the consulting arm, working
in tandem with the recruitment division, can deliver
sustained growth and proﬁtability improvements, to the
beneﬁt of our shareholders.
We aim to grow Group revenues, with further focus on the
development of the consultancy business driving margins,
and to manage that growth with continued strong cost
management.
Our lead oﬀering in support of our consulting proposition
is Data Management - the provision of data-driven insight,
with which we have already demonstrated success with
BAT, MoD and in the Education and Utilities sectors. We
believe this is an attractive area to focus on due to strong
market growth rates and the impact of an increase in
demand for relatively scarce IT and digital specialist skills
across the broader market. The beneﬁts of having an
aligned recruitment business in Parity Professionals
specialising in the sourcing of these niche skills has been
demonstrated by the signiﬁcant increase in collaboration
and inter-company trading. 
The Sector 
Parity as a Group is addressing the needs of a large, high
demand and growing market. 
In early 2018, Mavenlink published a report in conjunction
with Research Now, detailing the results of a survey of 576
executives (Director and above) from service-centric
companies in North America, Europe and Asia-Paciﬁc. 65%
of these executives stated that they had had to turn down
work in the last 12 months:
•     82% said they did not have enough resources;
•     18% said they did not have the right skill set; and
•     50% said contractors/freelancers/sub-contractors
were very important to delivery, and a further 31%
said they were critical to delivery.
With regards to the market for Consultancy Services’ data
oﬀering more speciﬁcally, research by Gartner in 2017
forecast that the global Business Intelligence (BI) and
Analytics market would grow from $18bn to $23bn by
2020.
Gartner estimated that the global Master Data
Management (MDM) market was worth between $3-5bn
in 2016. Furthermore, the MDM market is expected to
experience signiﬁcant growth with MarketsandMarkets
forecasting a compound annual growth rate of 23.3% to
2020.
In addition, market reports indicate that there continues
to be a shortage of people with the necessary digital skills
to meet the demands of the market. Clients are
increasingly reliant upon agencies and third party
suppliers to provide access to the necessary skills or
outsource the projects in part or in whole. 
We are very well positioned as a Group to exploit this
opportunity. We have a strong reputation with long-
standing relationships in both divisions, established over
45 years of delivering successful projects. Our clients
beneﬁt through our deliberate strategy of aligning our
services to provide ﬂexible access to a substantial resource
pool. Digitalisation of services is a global trend that is
creating new business possibilities and new business
models for our customers. Our services are part of the
platform that enables this disruption, driving their
businesses forwards, with Gold Partnerships with Oracle
and Microsoft positioning us at the forefront of technology
developments. 
Parity’s Competitive Advantage
Parity has a proactive and well-received integrated model
and this underpins our consultancy business with the very
best expertise available in the market, while maximising
our exposure to opportunities. This enables ﬂexibility,
speed to scale up for new opportunities, and cost eﬀective
delivery.
Parity can apply delivery models to suit its clients’ speciﬁc
needs at every stage of their development lifecycle, for
example it can: 
•     provide full delivery of data projects; 
•     manage project teams to deliver outcomes-based
managed services; and
•     supply contract or permanent IT skills to supplement
internal staﬀ.
This distinctive, integrated approach is a key point of
diﬀerentiation that we plan to exploit further.

Strategic Report Governance Accounts, notes and other information
2017 Performance
Our emerging strategy has already driven growth in the
more proﬁtable Consultancy Services where we also
beneﬁt from greater visibility of future revenues. The
Group has continued to make progress in line with
expectations, simplifying the structure and improving
focus on proﬁtable activities which are symbiotic,
beneﬁting both operating divisions. The management
team is pleased to have achieved strategic progress
including:
•     proﬁt growth, supported by signiﬁcant revenue
growth in Consultancy Services with the beneﬁt of
greater collaboration with the Professionals Division;
•     the exit from non-core, loss making Talent
Management Services; 
•     improved new sales KPIs in Parity Professionals
against a headwind of disruption caused by changes
to the application of taxation to Public Sector oﬀ
payroll workers (IR35) and to lesser extent,
uncertainty surrounding the impact of Brexit in the
UK; and
•     strong ﬁnancial controls, which resulted in strong
cash generation and a signiﬁcant further reduction
in net debt.
2018 Outlook
Our recent strong run of securing new clients, major
frameworks and contract extensions, in combination with
additional investment in key sales and marketing functions
in the ﬁrst half, leaves us well positioned to beneﬁt in
future periods. We have continued to trade in line with
expectations in the ﬁrst two months of the current year
and we remain conﬁdent in the improving pipeline of
opportunities for both divisions, which we expect to
beneﬁt the second half and beyond.
Alan Rommel
Chief Executive Oﬃcer

I don’t know how to truly
express our gratitude and
appreciation to the Parity team for
the extremely high quality,
eﬃciency and speed of service;
every time it was beyond
exceptional. Many, many thanks!”

The Group’s ﬁnancial performance demonstrates the encouraging progress in rebalancing the business by growing revenues
in the Consultancy Services division which generates greater yields. Consultancy Services now delivers 33.2% of Group
contribution from 11.4% of external revenues. 
The 9% decline in Group revenue for the year from £91.8m to £83.8m is predominately a result of the eﬀect of the IR35
reforms on the Professionals division. A signiﬁcant increase in Consultancy Services’ revenues helped to partially oﬀset the
impact. The improved revenue mix gave rise to a 16% increase in Group operating proﬁt before non-recurring items (non-
recurring items were £nil in 2017), with the Group operating margin improving from 1.9% to 2.5%. We achieved a second
successive year of cash conversion in excess of 100% of EBITDA in 2017, enabling us to reduce net debt from £7.4m at the
end of 2015 to £1.6m at the end of 2017, with the net debt/EBITDA ratio at the end of year improved to 0.7x (2016: 2.0x).

Strategic Report Governance Accounts, notes and other information
Divisional performance (continued)
The Consultancy Services business has grown in line with
our strategic intent with a signiﬁcant improvement in
revenue of 78.5% to £9.5m (2016: £5.3m). This growth has
clearly demonstrated the opportunities in aligning delivery
within the business to support rapid scaling in higher value
services with inter segment revenues of £5.76m (2016:
£0.48m). This revenue growth supported a strong 26.2%
increase in divisional contribution to £1.15m (2016:
£0.91m), whilst we also continued to invest for growth.
As anticipated, Professionals’ revenues reduced by 7.9%
to £80.0m (2016: £86.9m) as contractor volumes were
impacted by IR35 with a corresponding reduction in
divisional contribution of 13.3% to £2.31m (2016:
£2.66m).
Parity Consultancy Services
The consultancy business has undergone a service driven
structural re-organisation to improve focus and align sales
and delivery functions around core propositions. This
provides clarity and ownership to our client facing
activities, centred on the provision of data solutions and
on delivery of IT projects for our clients.
Data-driven insight is critical to optimising operations and
developing informed business strategies for our clients.
Consultancy Services has created a suite of tools and
capabilities to support the development of the Data
Strategy through to the delivery of Data Analytics. We help
clients understand the key data that they need to gain real
insight, with a Data Maturity Diagnostic which
benchmarks the organisation to deﬁne the start point. Our
services then take the client from their current position to
where they need to be, ensuring that the investment
made in driving their data strategy does not just provide
the same management information that the client always
had in a diﬀerent format. 
In addition, Consultancy Services is still able to use its
project management and technical delivery expertise,
supported by contract staﬃng from Parity Professionals
and our internal permanent staﬀ to provide “Outcome
Managed Services”. We work alongside clients on key
projects where they don’t have the internal capability or
bandwidth, oﬀering access to skilled resource, sharing
delivery risk and saving money in comparison to a full
project outsource by managing the ﬂexible resource levels
to suit project demands.
Growth in the business is creating a much better balance
with strong, higher margin and higher value sales linked
with greater project scale and duration. Improving visibility
of recurring revenues provides a strong foundation from
which to build. We are pleased to report that all key
contracts for the business have been extended. In the past
two years, the client base has signiﬁcantly increased in size
to 21 clients and revenues have more than doubled. We are
equally proud to have retained long-term relationships with
the MoD and BA T alongside newer signiﬁcant wins including
the Education and Skills Funding Agency. 
The business has successfully tendered for the Dynamic
Procurement System for the Scottish Government, adding
to the award of G-Cloud and the Digital Outcomes and
Specialists frameworks which provide access to our
specialist services to Public Sector clients in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland. 
Consultancy Services ended the year with an improving
pipeline and stronger visibility on orders with H1 2018
contracted revenues over 33% above H1 2017 contracted
revenues (£2.8m vs £2.1m, measured at the end of
February).
We saw approximately a 10% increase in internal staﬀ days
delivered in the year compared to 2016, though by far the
greatest increase in delivered days was from contract staﬀ
supplied by Professionals. Whilst this underwrites the
beneﬁt of the businesses being aligned, it has held back
operating margin. The division’s overheads also included
talent investment as we continue to develop the division’s
proposition in line with the Group’s strategy. Continuing
to broaden the client base whilst delivering projects with
similar core skills will enable further permanent
recruitment activity to support project delivery which will
help to improve operating margin.

established client base in the Public Sector . As highlighted
in the interim ﬁnancial results, contractor volumes were
impacted due to the implementation of IR35 reforms
applied to Public Sector workers in April 2017. The average
number of contractors on billing in the Professionals
division during the year was 6.6% lower at 942 (2016:
1,009), resulting from an initial post IR35 implementation
drop in overall contractor numbers of approximately 15%
in April. The remainder of the year has seen volumes
recover towards pre-implementation levels. Investment
was sustained in the proﬁtable recruitment business with
costs controlled in part by the exit from a signiﬁcantly
reduced Talent Management team which failed to
generate traction in training and development services in
the year.  
Underwriting these decisions, we are pleased to report an
improvement in the key sales activities at the front end
which mitigated the increased churn in our contractor base.
Sales activity generated an increase in new candidate
placements of 7.7% and the margin generated from these
new placements increased by 9.2% in comparison to 2016,
driving the growth trend in contractor volumes from April.
We are continuing to invest in training and to build both
contract and permanent sales capacity. 
Permanent placements help to develop our market
knowledge and brand awareness in niche sectors with both
the client and the candidate community. Whilst contract
placements provide more predictable longer-term revenue,
the improvement in our permanent capability has supported
our new client acquisition strategy. We improved revenues
on permanent placements by 24% to £657,000 (2016:
£530,000), targeting niche skills verticals with strong growth
in digital skills to the SME sector . 
The long-standing contract covering the service-wrap for
the Public Sector FastStream Graduate intake was
extended for a further 12 months to November 2018. We
extended key Public Sector framework contracts with the
Scottish Government, G-Cloud and Non-Medical Non-
Clinical (NMNC), and continued to build our client base
with 120 new clients in the year, 80 of which were in the
Private Sector. As with permanent placements, we are
seeing increased penetration into the SMEs, assisting with
digital skills which provides a positive balance to
maintaining supply to the larger volume clients that
provide longer-term visibility. Professionals improved
operational proﬁtability with higher conversion of
opportunity to placement, and performed strongly against
our peers. This is evidenced by our improved ranking in
the Recruiter Hot 100 which assesses proﬁtability per head
across the agency sector . Our position improved from 59
th
place to 43
rd
.
Group Costs
Group costs reduced to £1.05m (2016: £1.38m) as a result
of lower headcount and cost savings, for example reduced
insurance costs, through actions taken by management.
The absence of non-recurring items in 2017 provides
greater clarity to the Group’s proﬁtability. 
Taxation
The tax credit on continuing proﬁt before tax was £0.53m
(2016: tax charge of £0.07m) mainly representing a deferred
tax credit in respect of Consultancy Services. The division
previously carried forward an unrecognised deferred tax
asset in respect of deductible timing diﬀerences that had not
been recognised due to historic ﬁnancial performance. Given
the recent turnaround of the division it is considered more
likely than not that there will be suﬃcient taxable proﬁts for
the timing diﬀerences to be deducted, and the
corresponding asset was recognised in accordance with IAS
12. We have taken a prudent view on the division’s carried
forward tax losses which remain unrecognised, but will keep
this under review.
The Group did not provide for corporation tax payable in
2017 due to the utilisation of Group relief and the
availability of carried forward deductible timing
diﬀerences and tax losses.   
Discontinued operations
Inition was held for sale during 2017 and accordingly its
results are presented as discontinued. During 2017 Inition
incurred an operating loss after tax of £0.9m (2016: £0.1m).
In addition, a non-cash charge of £1.1m (2016: £nil) was
incurred in respect of the impairment of the remaining
goodwill relating to Inition. Other discontinued costs
include professional advisor fees incurred in connection
with actions taken to divest of Inition.
Earnings per share and dividend
The basic earnings per share from continuing operations
were 2.15 pence (2016: 0.87 pence). The increase is driven
by proﬁt before tax growth and the deferred tax credit.
The Board does not propose a dividend for 2017 (2016:
nil), but will continue to review this policy and will seek to
restore a dividend in the medium term.

Strategic Report Governance Accounts, notes and other information
Statement of Financial Position
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables decreased by £2.4m to
£12.0m (2016: £14.4m). The decrease is principally
attributable to an improvement in debtor collections in
the Professionals division. Group debtor days, calculated
on billings on a countback basis, decreased to a record low
of 20 days (2016: 29 days).
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables decreased slightly during the
year to £8.3m (2016: £9.1m). At the year end, creditor
days were 28 days (2016: 26 days).
Loans and borrowings
Loans and borrowings represent the Group’s debt under the
asset-based lending facility. This is a working capital facility
and is consequently linked to the same cycle as the trade
receivables. The asset-based lending facility with PNC
Business Credit (“PNC”), a leading secured ﬁnance lender,
allows for borrowing of up to £15m depending on the
availability of appropriate assets as security. The current
facility, which has been in place since 2010, was renewed
on 1 September 2016, and runs until the end of 2018, at
which point PNC have indicated a willingness to renew the
facility. The interest rate applied to borrowings was 2.35%
over the prevailing base rate.
Cash ﬂow and net debt
The Group generated positive net cash ﬂows from
operating activities of £3.0m (2016: £3.4m), driven by
EBITDA and a positive working capital swing with a
reduction in debtor days to 20 (2016: 29 days). The £3.0m
cash generated was after an outflow of £0.7m in respect
of discontinued operations, and despite the reversal of
£0.6m fees in advance carried forward from 2016. 
As a result of the positive cash ﬂow, net debt reduced to
£1.6m (2016: £4.4m).
Deﬁned Beneﬁt Pension Deﬁcit
During the year the Group agreed to the trustees’ proposal
to implement liability driven investment (“LDI”). LDI seeks
to reduce volatility of the scheme deﬁcit by hedging
against liability risks, which was considered to be
appropriate given the maturity of the scheme (88% of
members are pensioners). 
At the year end the deﬁcit had decreased to £1.06m
(2016: £1.85m), primarily due to a good return on the
scheme assets.
Share Capital
In May 2017 we cancelled the legacy deferred shares in
issue. The deferred shares were not listed, and eﬀectively
carried no rights. As a result, share capital reduced to
£2.0m (2016: £16.3m) and a capital redemption reserve
of £14.3m was created (2016: £nil).
Principal risks and uncertainties 
The Board maintains a close watch on issues that aﬀect our
business, markets and the wider economy. Whilst the
markets that we operate in can be cyclical in their nature,
we take necessary action to mitigate the risk and potential
impact proﬁle. We have provided a sample below:
o     Macro-economic uncertainty
Client project decisions can stall and recruitment
activity are aﬀected by conﬁdence. We operate a
largely elastic cost base with ﬂexible resourcing and
costs (both staﬃng and commissions) related to
activity levels, and managed oﬃces on shorter-term
contracts with options to exit. The expected increase
in interest rates has been mitigated with signiﬁcantly
reduced debt, with our debtor days below market
norms (20 days).
o     Brexit
The Group operates predominately in the UK and
notwithstanding delays due to the wider macro-
economic uncertainty, is not expected to suﬀer a direct
long-term negative impact due to Brexit, as it is
supported by the strong underlying UK economy.
Demand for the Group’s services could reduce as an
indirect result of impact of Brexit on the UK economy,
although Brexit has also driven additional opportunity
to the Group with established Public Sector clients
creating additional infrastructure in preparation.  
o     Legislation – e.g. IR35, GDPR 
IR35 has increased the ‘churn’ rate of contractors in
the Public Sector as they leave to work in roles which
are not assessed to be within IR35, elsewhere in the
Public Sector, or leave for roles in the Private Sector
which are assessed diﬀerently. Our exposure was
greater than most with a high concentration of Public
Sector contractors.

Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)
o     Legislation – e.g. IR35, GDPR (continued)
Parity tracks changes directly and as an active
founding member of the Association of Professional
Staﬃng Companies (APSCo) which lobbies and
advises on changes. An internal working group
changed our processes and ensured all stakeholders
(client, candidate and staﬀ) were informed through
the transition. The processes are now business as
usual, sales activities have increased, and our broader
managed services in the consulting business have
expanded to support clients who are also impacted
by increased churn. If the same rules are applied to
the Private Sector as rumoured, we will be very well
prepared. We are following the same principles with
a working group in place focused on GDPR.
o     Strategy fails to deliver anticipated growth
The Group’s anticipated growth may not be
achievable if the Group is unable to implement its
strategy eﬀectively. The Board seeks to mitigate this
through a robust assessment of its opportunities, the
feedback from its clients and potential clients, clear
priorities and focus on delivering key objectives and
incentivising its team to deliver against those
objectives.
o     Loss of key client accounts
A portion of the Group’s revenues are dependent on
the award of framework agreements as an approved
supplier. It is possible that the Group will lose this
status. We seek to mitigate this through closely
monitoring our service level agreements and
ensuring the quality of our delivery. The Group also
has a deliberate focus on winning new client
framework agreements to continue to diversify its
revenue streams.
o     Staff
The risk is that staﬀ do not have the development or
the tools to perform at their best, and without a clear
career path we experience increased staﬀ turnover.
Parity has invested in additional direct training and
training resource for staﬀ. We support staﬀ to achieve
expectations in their roles and there is clarity on the
development required. We support staﬀ by reviewing
and acquiring new tools to help them perform at their
best, and provide competitive remuneration and
incentives to support retention. Our staﬀ
engagement survey for 2017 demonstrated
improvement in all primary metrics, and we score as
good as, or better than the industry ‘norm’ in each of
these metrics. In addition, the Group has various
share plans at its disposal, to provide staﬀ with the
opportunity to beneﬁt from the success of the Group
with minimal ﬁnancial risk.
o     Financial
The Group actively monitors its liquidity position to
ensure it has suﬃcient available funds and working
capital in order to operate and meet its planned
commitments and has a credit risk policy that
requires appropriate status checks and or references
as necessary.
o     Technology
As an IT services provider the Group relies on its IT,
telecommunications and infrastructure systems to
perform and manage the services we provide to
clients. The Group reviews its own disaster recovery
systems regularly in order to minimise the risk of
prolonged disruption to systems.

Capital structure
The Company has one class of share in issue, ordinary shares of 2p. The shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange and
shareholders are entitled to vote at Company meetings, to receive dividends and to the return of their capital in the event
of liquidation, with the exception of ordinary shares held by the Parity Group plc Employee Share Ownership Trust which
are not entitled to receive dividends. 
The Directors are not aware of any restrictions on transfers of shares in the Company or on voting rights or of any agreements
between holders of the Company’s shares which may result in such restrictions.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s cash ﬂow forecasts for the period to 31 December 2019, taking account of
reasonably possible changes in trading performance. The ﬁnancing facility provided by PNC is due for renewal on
31 December 2018 and PNC have formally indicated a willingness in principle to renew at this point. After making appropriate
enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
the Annual Report and Accounts. 
The Company is not party to any signiﬁcant agreements that take eﬀect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the
Company following a takeover bid, except for the ﬁnance facility agreement with PNC. There are no agreements between
the Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of oﬃce or employment that occurs because
of a takeover bid.
Payments to suppliers
The Group seeks to abide by the payment terms agreed with suppliers when it is satisﬁed that the supplier has provided the
goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. In the United Kingdom and Ireland the Group agrees
payment terms with its suppliers when it enters into binding purchase contracts. 
Corporate social responsibility
The Group recognises its corporate social responsibilities and reports on these in a separate statement of social,
environmental and ethical policies on pages 18 and 19. This statement covers the Group’s Employment Policies,
Environmental Policy and Health and Safety Policy.

Employment policies
As a professional services business, Parity’s strength
derives from the commitment, capability and cultural
diversity of its employees. The Group aims to adopt a
policy of diversity at all levels including selection, role
assignment, teamwork and individual career
development. 
The Group encourages the participation of all employees
in the operation and development of the business by
oﬀering open access to senior management, including the
Executive Directors, and adopting a policy of regular
communications through road shows and the intranet. An
Employee Voice forum was introduced during 2017
in order to create more opportunities for upward
communication and generation of ideas from all
employees. The forum comprises volunteer staﬀ members
from diﬀerent oﬃce locations.
The Group also encourages all employees to participate in
an annual employee survey. The survey is administered by
an independent organisation and responses are
anonymous. Results are communicated to staﬀ with
proposed actions to address any identiﬁed issues. The
results from the 2017 survey reﬂected above average staﬀ
engagement and satisfaction, and an overall improvement
on the 2016 results.
The Group incentivises employees through share-based
incentives and the payment of bonuses and commissions
linked to performance objectives. Where appropriate these
objectives are linked to proﬁtability. The Group also has a
structured approach to performance appraisal and career
development and ensures that every employee has an
annual performance review and has clear objectives and
performance standards.
Health & Safety
The Health and Safety of Parity’s employees is paramount.
Group policy is to provide and maintain safe and healthy
working conditions, equipment and systems of work for
all employees and to provide such information, training
and supervision as is needed for this purpose.
Appropriate written health and safety information
outlining the Group’s policy in each area is issued to all
new employees. This includes:
•     First aid — Each oﬃce has a person qualiﬁed in ﬁrst
aid. First aid boxes are readily accessible and records
kept of all accidents and injuries.
•     Fire safety — Each oﬃce has an evacuation marshal
who will liaise with building management or local
emergency authorities, as appropriate. Evacuation
assembly points are agreed for every location and
a full evacuation carried out every six months. Fire
alarms are tested regularly.
•     Employees’ health — Any employee who believes
he/she is suﬀering from an illness or condition related
to their working environment is encouraged to report
this to his/her manager for investigation.
Annual Health and Safety audits are carried out at every
Parity oﬃce to ensure high standards are maintained.
As part of its beneﬁts package Parity oﬀers a number of
beneﬁts to support the health and well being of its staﬀ,
as well as an Employee Assistance helpline.
Social responsibilities
It is Group policy to be a good corporate citizen wherever
it operates. As part of the Group’s social responsibility,
employees are encouraged to support national charities
and also become involved in their local communities and
fund raising events. 
The Group encourages employees who undertake
volunteer work and ﬁrmly believes that the experience
gained contributes to the individual’s personal
development. Where possible, the Group provides
ﬂexibility with working hours to accommodate such
commitments outside of work.
Environmental policy
While Parity Group’s operations by their very nature have
minimal environmental impact, the Group recognises its
responsibilities to protect and sustain the environment
and its resources. The Group’s policy is to meet or exceed
the statutory requirements in this area and it has adopted
a code of good environmental practice, particularly in its
main areas of environmental impact, namely energy
eﬃciency, use and recycling of resources and transport.

Public transport is used whenever possible. Interest-free
season ticket loans are made to staﬀ as part of the
beneﬁts package. Teleconference facilities are extended
to main oﬃce locations to minimise business travel and
increase eﬃciency. PCs (portable or desktop) are made
available to staﬀ where needed to facilitate home working
and minimise the need to travel to oﬃces where this is
appropriate for their role.

Environmental policy (continued)
Energy
Only energy-eﬃcient computers and peripherals are
acquired and they are turned oﬀ at the end of each day.
As a normal part of its operations the Group seeks to
occupy oﬃces which have eﬃcient building management
systems and, ideally, low energy lighting. Oﬃce lighting is
turned oﬀ at the end of each day.
Whenever economically justiﬁable, the paper and other
consumables used are made from environmentally-
friendly or recycled material or from renewable resources.
Recycling
The Group makes every eﬀort to recycle oﬃce paper and
envelopes. Appropriate containers are provided at all
oﬃces and all paper collected is sent to recycling plants.
The Group also recycles as much other material, such as
toner cartridges, as is economically viable. When replaced,
computers and peripherals are oﬀered to employees at
market value, local schools or charities, or sent to recycling
plants.
Paper usage
The Group constantly strives to implement paper-saving
practices to reduce wastage. Examples include: electronic
timesheets, E-invoicing, E-payslips, and electronic expense
claims.
Ethics
Parity Group is committed to maintaining the highest
standards of ethics, professionalism and business conduct
as well as ensuring that we act in accordance with the law
at all times. The Group supports and promotes the
principles of equal opportunities in employment and
promotes a culture where every employee is treated fairly.
A culture of teamwork, openness, integrity and
professionalism forms a key element of our company
principles and values which sets out the standards of
behaviour we expect from all our employees. 
Anti-Bribery Act
Parity’s Anti-Bribery and Corruption policy is written to
follow the UK regulatory requirements in relation to the
Anti-Bribery Act. The policy has Executive Director
ownership and is available on the Group’s intranet. Client
and supplier arrangements are regularly reviewed and
guidance forms part of each employee’s induction. 
Modern Slavery Policy
Parity Group has a zero-tolerance approach to modern
slavery and is committed to acting ethically and with
integrity in all its business dealings and relationships, and
to implement and enforce eﬀective systems and controls
to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in
its own business, or its supply chain. The following actions
have been taken during 2017.
•     Supply Chain Review - we continue to take positive
steps to improve supply chain transparency. As our
supplier chain is mainly made up of UK based
suppliers of professional services, computer software
and equipment, oﬃce supplies and our contractor
and associate workers, we believe that we operate a
supply chain with a very low inherent risk of slavery
and human traﬃcking potential. Nevertheless, we
have amended our contractual clauses with suppliers
to ensure their suitability and ongoing compliance to
the Modern Slavery Act 2015. We will continue to
assess and manage the risk in our supply chain as part
of an annual review of our policy.
•     Staﬀ Training - we have provided training to all our
employees on the Modern Slavery Act 2015 in order
to provide general awareness across the company and
ensure all employees are aware of their
responsibilities. This training has now been built into
our staﬀ induction processes to ensure it is provided
to all new recruits coming on board.
I’d say the best
vendor I ever have the pleasure
of working with.”

Strategic Report Governance Accounts, notes and other information
Introduction
As the Company is AIM listed, it is not required to follow the
provisions of The UK Corporate Governance Code published
by the Financial Reporting Council (the Code). However , the
Board is committed to maintaining high standards of
corporate governance and seeks to follow the Code as far
as is practicable and appropriate, having regard to the size
and resources of the Company and to the Quoted
Companies Alliance Corporate Governance Code for Small
and Mid-Size Quoted Companies. Accordingly, this report
sets out how the Company applies elements of the Code
that are deemed appropriate.
Going concern
The Board conﬁrms that, after making enquiries, the
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the accounts. Further details are outlined in the
Directors’ Report on pages 15 to 17.
The workings of the Board and its Committees
The Board
At the date of this report, the Board comprises the Non-
Executive Chairman, John Conoley, Non-Executive
Director, David Firth, Group Chief Executive, Alan Rommel
and Group Finance Director, Roger Antony. During the year
John Conoley was appointed Non-Executive Chairman on
27 April 2017 with Lord Freeman stepping down from this
role on the same date. The table on page 28 sets out the
dates of tenure of the current Directors on the Board. The
Directors’ biographies, which are set out on page 14,
illustrate the range of business backgrounds, skills,
independence and experience contributed by each Board
member. 
Non-Executive Chairman
The Non-Executive Chairman, John Conoley, is responsible
for the leadership of the Board, ensuring its eﬀectiveness
on all aspects of its role. This includes ensuring that Board
meetings are held in an open manner, that the Directors
receive accurate, timely and clear information and
allowing suﬃcient time for agenda items to be discussed.
Annual appraisals are held of each Director, providing
feedback and reviewing any training or development
needs. The Chairman is also responsible for eﬀective
communications with shareholders and relaying any
shareholder concerns to the Directors. During the year the
Non-Executive Chairman met with the other Non-
Executive Director without the Executive Directors being
present. 
Senior Independent Director
David Firth acted as the de facto Senior Independent
Director during 2017. He was an additional contact point
for shareholders if they had reason for concern, when
contact through the normal channels of the Executive
Directors and Chairman had failed to resolve their
concerns, or where such contact was inappropriate.
Re-election of Directors
Directors appointed since the last annual General
Meeting, and those retiring by rotation will submit
themselves for election or re-election at the next Annual
General Meeting, as set out in the Directors’ report on
page 15 and in the separate Notice of Annual General
Meeting sent to all Shareholders. The Non-Executive
Chairman conﬁrms that the performance of each Director
continues to be eﬀective and the individuals continue to
demonstrate commitment to their role.
Company Secretary
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the
Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that
Board procedures, applicable rules and regulations are
observed. There is an agreed procedure for Directors to
obtain independent professional advice, if necessary, at
the Company’s expense. 
New Directors receive a comprehensive, formal and
tailored induction to the Group’s operations including
corporate governance, the legislative framework and visits
to Group premises.
Board meetings
The Board has meetings scheduled regularly throughout
the year to review and approve the Group’s strategy and
to monitor progress against set objectives. Additional
meetings are also held as business dictates. A table
showing the number of meetings of the Board and its
Committees held during the year, and attendance at those
meetings by each Board member, is set out on page 22.
The Board maintains close dialogue by email, telephone
and conference calls between scheduled meetings. The
Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its
speciﬁc approval which was reviewed during the year and
includes a review of Group strategic, operational and
ﬁnancial matters such as proposed acquisitions and
divestments. It approves the annual accounts and interim
report, the annual budget, signiﬁcant transactions, major
capital expenditure and reviews the eﬀectiveness of the
system of internal control and the risks faced by the
Group. It covers all controls, including ﬁnancial,
operational, compliance and risk management. During
2017 the Board continued to regularly track potential risks
associated with Brexit.

                 Report and Accounts 2017                       stock code: PTY
Board meetings (continued)
The Board delegates speciﬁc responsibilities to three
Committees: The Audit Committee, The Remuneration
Committee and the Nomination Committee. Authority is
delegated to management through Group authorisation
limits on a structured basis, ensuring that proper
management oversight exists at the appropriate level. The
Group authorisation levels were reviewed by the Board in
December 2017.
All members of the Board are normally supplied in
advance of meetings with the agenda and supporting
papers covering the matters which are to be considered.
If unable to attend a meeting the Director is able to
provide feedback to the Chairman, the Chair of the
Committee or the Company Secretary and their comments
are then communicated at the meeting. A procedure exists
for the Directors, in the furtherance of their duties, to take
independent professional advice if required. If a Director
has any concerns about a particular issue, such concerns
are recorded in the minutes of the relevant Board
meeting. In the event that a Director resigned over a
matter that was of concern to him, such concerns would
be communicated to the other Directors. All Directors
have the opportunity to undertake relevant training. 
The continuing operational businesses are divided into
two separate divisions, Parity Professionals and Parity
Consultancy Services. Inition is a non-core separate
business oﬀering, acquired under the previous strategy,
and was held for sale during 2017. Each division or
business oﬀering has a Managing Director . The operational
board comprises the Chief Executive Oﬃcer, the Group
Finance Director and the divisional Managing Directors.
The operational board meetings are held monthly and are
attended by other senior management as appropriate.
Regular updates are provided by the heads of Shared
Service functions such as Marketing, HR and IT. Any key
issues arising from these meetings are reported to the
main Board. Non-Executive Directors are invited to visit
the Group’s premises and are encouraged to have an
informal dialogue with the divisions.
Performance evaluation
The Board undertook an annual evaluation of its own
performance and that of its Committees and individual
Directors for the year. The performance of the Non-
Executive Chairman was reviewed by the other
Non-Executive Director . The outcome of the evaluation of
the Board is reviewed by the Board as a whole and the
results are used to assist the Board in developing its
approach going forward.
Board balance and independence
The Board has a balance of Executive and Non-Executive
Directors such that no individual or small group of
individuals can dominate the Board’s decision making. The
Board has a range of backgrounds and skills. The Non-
Executive Directors ensure that independent judgement
is brought to Board discussions and decisions. The Board
are aware of the importance of attaining greater diversity
amongst its members.
The Board considers that there are no relationships or
circumstances which are likely to aﬀect the independent
judgement of the Non-Executive Directors.
Attendance at board and committee meetings
During the year 11 scheduled Board meetings and 5 ad
hoc Board meetings were convened as necessary to deal
with various matters. Details of attendance at Board
meetings is summarised below. Committee attendance is
shown for Committee members only. 
                                                                                         Board Audit Nomination Remuneration

Committees
The Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees of
the Board each have formal written terms of reference.
These terms of reference are made available on request to
the Company Secretary, can be inspected at the Company’s
head oﬃce and are also available in the Corporate
Governance section of the Group’s website.
Audit Committee
David Firth was appointed Chair of the Audit Committee
on 6 October 2016. Details of Davids’s recent and relevant
ﬁnancial experience are set out in his biography on
page 14. John Conoley was appointed as the other
member of the Audit Committee after Lord Freeman
stepped down on 27 April 2017. The Audit Committee
meets three times a year. 
Audit committee meetings are attended by the external
auditors and all of the Executive Directors, at the invitation
of the Committee. The external auditors meet separately
with the Audit Committee on request, without the
presence of the Executive Directors, to ensure open
communication.
The Audit Committee reviews and, as appropriate, actively
engages in the processes for ﬁnancial reporting, internal
control, risk assessment, audit, compliance assurance and
considers the independence of the Group’s external auditor
as well as the eﬀectiveness of the Group’s system of
accounting, its internal ﬁnancial controls, external audit
process and risk management. The Audit Committee’s
principal terms of reference include:
•     the oversight responsibilities described in the
foregoing paragraph;
•     reviewing compliance with laws, regulations and the
Group’s code of conduct and policies;
•     monitoring the integrity of the Group’s ﬁnancial
statements and announcements relating to the
Group’s ﬁnancial performance and reviewing
signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting judgements, changes in
accounting policies and practices, signiﬁcant
adjustments resulting from the audit and the
application of the going concern assumption;
•     reviewing the ﬁndings of the external audit with the
external auditor;
•     making recommendations to the Board, for it to put
to the shareholders for their approval, regarding the
appointment, re-appointment and removal of the
external auditor and approving the remuneration and
terms of engagement of the external auditor;
•     monitoring and reviewing the external auditor’s
independence and the eﬀectiveness of the audit
process;
•     developing and implementing policy on the
engagement of the external auditors to supply non-
audit services;
•     reviewing the risk management framework and risk
assessments;
•     reviewing the Group’s arrangements for its employees
to raise concerns, in conﬁdence, about possible
wrong doing in ﬁnancial reporting or other matters;
and
•     reviewing and monitoring the adequacy and
eﬀectiveness of the Company’s internal ﬁnancial
controls, internal control, and risk management
systems.
In order to ensure an appropriate balance between cost
eﬀectiveness, objectivity and independence, the Audit
Committee reviews the nature of all services, including
non-audit work, provided by the external auditor each
year. The Group normally expects to retain the external
auditor to provide non-audit related services, including
work in relation to shareholder circulars and similar
services. The external auditor provided non-audit related
services during 2017, details of which are set out in note
3 to the accounts.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises both Non-
Executive Directors and is chaired by David Firth. John
Conoley became a member after Lord Freeman stepped
down on 27 April 2017. Details of the responsibilities of
the Remuneration Committee are set out in the
remuneration report on pages 26 to 29. Where necessary,
specialist external consultants are used to assist the
Committee. 
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises both Non-Executive
Directors and is chaired by John Conoley. John Conoley was
appointed Chairman after Lord Freeman stepped down on
27 April 2017. David Firth is the other member of the
Nomination committee. The Committee is responsible for
proposing candidates for appointment to the Board, having
due regard to the balance and structure of the Board, as
well as succession planning. During the year the Committee
considered the size, composition, skills, experience and
independence of the Board having regard to the
requirements of the business. 
The process for new Board appointments includes an
initial search, preliminary interviews and discussions.
Following this process, recommendations are then made
by the Committee to the Board on merit against objective
criteria. Where necessary external recruitment
consultants are used to assist the process.

Investor relations
The Company engages where possible in regular dialogue
with its major Shareholders through presentations and
meetings after the announcement of the Group’s full year
and interim results. Private and institutional shareholders
are given an opportunity to communicate directly with the
Board at the Annual General Meeting. Shareholders’
queries received via the Company Secretary’s email
address at cosec@parity.net or by telephone to the
Group’s head oﬃce are responded to in person by the
Company Secretary or by another appropriate employee.
All members of the Board usually attend the Annual
General Meeting. The chairmen of the Audit,
Remuneration and Nomination Committees will normally
be available to answer Shareholders’ questions at that
meeting. Notice of the Meeting is posted to Shareholders
with the report and accounts no fewer than 21 clear days
prior to the date of the Annual General Meeting. The
information sent to Shareholders includes a summary of
the business to be covered at the Annual General Meeting,
where a separate resolution is proposed for each
substantive matter. The Group’s annual report and
accounts, interim report and other stock exchange
announcements are published on the Group’s website at
www.parity.net
Annual Report
The Annual Report is designed to present a fair, balanced
and understandable view of the Group’s activities and
prospects. The Operating & Financial Review provides an
assessment of the Group’s aﬀairs and position. The Annual
Report is sent to all Shareholders on the Register.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of
the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual
Report and the Group and parent Company ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and
parent Company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial
year. As required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock
Exchange they are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRSs as
adopted by the EU) and applicable law and have elected
to prepare the parent Company ﬁnancial statements on
the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the
ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they
give a true and fair view of the state of aﬀairs of the Group
and parent Company and of their proﬁt or loss for that
period. In preparing each of the Group and parent
Company ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required
to:
•     select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;
•     make judgements and estimates that are reasonable,
relevant and reliable; 
•     state whether they have been prepared in accordance
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
•     assess the Group and parent Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern; and 
•     use the going concern basis of accounting unless they
either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate
accounting records that are suﬃcient to show and explain
the parent Company’s transactions and disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of
the parent Company and enable them to ensure that its
ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are responsible for such internal control as they
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
ﬁnancial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have
general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other
irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are
also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report and a
Directors’ Report that complies with that law and those
regulations. 
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the annual
report and the ﬁnancial statements are made available on
the Parity Group website. Financial statements are
published on the Company’s website in accordance with
AIM company requirements governing the preparation
and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements. The
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the
responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility
also extends to the on-going integrity of the ﬁnancial
statements contained therein.

25
Strategic Report Governance Accounts, notes and other information
Internal control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system
of internal control and for reviewing its eﬀectiveness and
is assisted in this respect by the Audit Committee. Such a
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the
risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss. The Group’s system of
internal control, which materially complies with the
Financial Reporting Council’s Risk Management, Internal
Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting
September 2014 guidance has been in place throughout
the year and up to the date of this report. The Directors
conﬁrm that they have reviewed the eﬀectiveness of the
Group’s system of internal controls during the year.
The Group did not consider it necessary to have a separate
internal audit function, but will continue to keep the need
under review.
Risk management
The Group is exposed through its operations to the
following ﬁnancial risks:
•     Interest rate risk;
•     Foreign currency risk;
•     Liquidity risk; and
•     Credit risk.
The policies for managing these risks are set by the Board
following recommendations from the Group Finance
Director. Certain risks are managed centrally, while others
are managed locally following guidelines communicated
from the centre. The policies for each of the above risks,
and the nature and extent of those risks, are described in
detail in note 20 to the ﬁnancial statements. Other risks
and uncertainties are discussed in the Operational and
Financial Review on pages 11 and 12.
Each of the persons who is a Director as at the date of
approval of this annual report conﬁrms that:
•     so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant
audit information of which the Company’s auditors
are unaware; and
•     the Director has taken all the steps that he ought to
have taken as a Director in order to make himself
aware of any relevant audit information and to
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of
that information. 
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in
accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies
Act 2006.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises David Firth as Chairman, and John Conoley who joined on 27 April 2017. Lord
Freeman was Chairman in the year until 27 April 2017 when he stepped down. Directors are excluded from discussions
about their personal remuneration.
The committee is responsible for reviewing the Group’s remuneration policy, the emoluments of the Executive Directors and
other senior management and the Group’s pension arrangements and for making recommendations thereon to the Board.
The committee also makes recommendations to the Board in respect of awards of options under the Senior Executive Share
Option Plan, Executive Share Option Plan and Sharesave Schemes and in respect of employees who should be invited to
participate in the Co-investment Scheme. It also reviews the terms of service contracts with senior employees and Executive
Directors and any compensation arrangements resulting from the termination by the Company of such contracts.
The committee has access to external advisors to assist it with ensuring that salary and beneﬁt packages are competitive
and appropriate. In addition, committee members keep themselves fully informed of all relevant developments and best
practice by reading the circulars on remuneration and related matters that the Company receives from its advisers and,
if appropriate, by attending seminars. Pension advice is provided by Cartwright Group Limited in relation to the deﬁned
beneﬁt scheme and advice is taken on an ad hoc basis in relation to the deﬁned contribution scheme. Advice on share
options and Co-investment Plans is provided by Pinsent Masons, who also provide other legal services to the Group.
The Board determines the remuneration of all Non-Executive Directors within the limits set out in the Company’s Articles
of Association. Non-executive Directors are not involved in any decisions about their own remuneration. Details of Directors’
remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2017 are set out in the table on page 28.
Remuneration policy
Parity aims to recruit, motivate and retain high calibre executives capable of achieving the objectives of the Group and to
encourage and reward appropriately superior performance in a manner which enhances shareholder value. Accordingly,
the Group operates a remuneration policy which ensures that there is a clear link to business strategy and a close alignment
with shareholder interests and current best practice, and aims to ensure that senior executives are rewarded fairly for their
respective individual contributions to the Group’s performance.
The four key elements of the remuneration package of senior executives, including Executive Directors, in the Group in 2017
were basic annual salary and beneﬁts in kind; performance bonuses; long term incentives including share options; and
pension arrangements.
Salaries and beneﬁts are reviewed annually. In order to assess the competitiveness of the pay and beneﬁts packages oﬀered
by the Group, comparisons are made to those oﬀered by similar companies. These are chosen with regard to the size of the
company (turnover, proﬁts and employee numbers); the diversity and complexity of their businesses; the geographical
spread of their businesses; and their growth, expansion and change proﬁle. 
Performance bonus
The terms of an incentive bonus for Executive Directors are agreed annually. For 2017, performance targets were set, but
were not met, and no performance bonuses were earned by, or paid to, Executive Directors in 2017.
Share option schemes
During 2017 the Group operated two types of share option scheme: An Executive Share Option Plan, and a Savings Related
Share Option Scheme (Sharesave Scheme).
Executive share option plans
The Group operates both an HMRC Approved Share Option Plan and an Unapproved Share Option Plan for options awarded
to UK employees in excess of the HMRC limit of £30,000. Share options are granted to Executive Directors and other senior
employees over a period of time and according to performance.
The rules of the Executive Share Option Plans allow for annual grants to be awarded equivalent to a value of up to one times
salary or up to two times salary in exceptional circumstances. A limit of 15% of the issued share capital of the Company in
a ten year period, on a rolling basis, is applicable to the headroom available to award options over the life of the Schemes.
Rules of the current Plans expire in May 2019. The terms and conditions of existing share options have not been varied in
the year.

Strategic Report Governance Accounts, notes and other information
Executive share option plans (continued)
Executive Share Options granted after 2004 are exercisable in normal circumstances between three and ten years after the
date of grant. The exercise of the options is conditional upon the share price either outperforming the average Total
Shareholder Return performance of a comparator group comprising a basket of companies in the IT services sector or
outperforming a target price. 
The exercise of share options is satisﬁed either through shares issued by the Company or through purchases in the market via
the Employee Beneﬁt Trust. In the event that an employee resigns, the options that they hold will lapse. Options are granted at
nil cost. The option exercise price is set at the closing mid-market share price on date of grant without any discount.
Share options awarded to the Executive Directors are disclosed in the table under the section Directors’ Remuneration

1. Our opinion is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Parity 
Group Plc (“the Company”) for the year ended 31 
December 2017 which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, Statements of Changes in Equity, 
Statements of Financial Position, Statements of 
Cash Flows and the related notes, including the 
accounting policies in note 1.
In our opinion: 
— the financial statements give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then 
ended; 
— the group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU);  
— the parent Company financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and  
— the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs 
(UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities are 
described below. We have fulfilled our ethical 
responsibilities under, and are independent of the 
Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements 
including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to 
listed entities. We believe that the audit evidence 
we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate 
basis for our opinion.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by 
us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In 
arriving at our audit opinion above, the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
The risk Our response
Revenue recognition
(£84m; 2016: £92m)
Refer to page 8 (Audit Committee 
Report on Audit Strategy), page 7 
(Audit Committee report on Audit 
Findings) and page 50 (financial 
disclosures)
Although we do not consider revenue to 
be an area with a high risk of significant 
misstatement, or requiring a significant 
level of judgement, it is considered to be 
one of the key drivers of results and as 
such had the greatest effect on our audit 
and allocation of resources in the 
planning and completing our audit.
The majority of the Group’s revenue is 
derived from the supply of professional 
services at pre determined rates. This 
revenue is recognised as and when the 
work is performed based on timesheets 
submitted by contractors. At year end 
the Group estimates adjustments for 
revenue from any work carried out 
during the year where timesheets were 
not submitted before year end.
Revenue from consultancy service 
contracts also contributes towards the 
Group’s revenue. Contracts can either 
be fixed price or time and materials 
based. Fixed price contract revenue is 
recognised based on the percentage of 
completion method. Time and materials 
contract revenue is recognised as the 
services are rendered. 
Our procedures included: 
— Control operation: assessing the 
operating effectiveness of IT systems 
and manual data entry controls used in 
the timesheet and hourly rate input 
processes to assess the accuracy of 
contractor billing data.
— Control operation: assessing the 
operating effectiveness of controls over 
the timesheet approval and sales invoice 
authorisation processes to obtain 
comfort over the hours worked. 
— Test of details: Using Data and Analytics 
procedures to identify customers, 
contractors or individual projects with 
unusually high or low gross margins 
during the year. We investigated any 
outliers by agreeing to supporting 
documentation. 
— Test of details: Selecting a sample of 
invoices and other revenue adjustments 
processed at the year-end and 
challenging whether revenue had been 
accurately recorded in the correct period 
by comparing to supporting 
documentation.
— Reperformance: Recalculating the 
revenue recognised in respect of a 
sample of revenue contracts recognised 
on a percentage of completion basis. 
This included comparing the contract 
terms, days currently worked on the 
project according to timesheets and 
estimated days to complete to assess if 
revenue had been correctly calculated.
To assess the reasonableness of the 
estimated days to complete we 
considered the historical accuracy of 
forecasting and corroborated judgements 
involved in estimates through 
discussions with project level staff.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement (continued)
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by 
us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In 
arriving at our audit opinion above, the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
The risk Our response
Recoverability of parent 
company’s investment in 
subsidiaries 
(£21m; 2016: £21m)
Refer to page 75 (financial 
disclosures).
Low risk, high value
The carrying amount of the parent 
company’s investments in subsidiaries 
represents 14% (2016: 14%) of the 
company’s total assets.  Their 
recoverability is not at a high risk of 
significant misstatement or subject to 
significant judgement.  However, due to 
their materiality in the context of the 
parent company financial statements, 
this is considered to be the area that had 
the greatest effect on our overall parent 
company audit.
Our procedures included:
— Tests of detail: Comparing the carrying 
amount of 100% of investments with the 
relevant subsidiaries’ financial statements to 
identify whether their net assets, being an 
approximation of their minimum recoverable 
amount, were in excess of their carrying 
amount and assessing whether those 
subsidiaries have historically been profit-
making. For the investments where the 
carrying amount exceeded the net asset 
value, comparing the carrying amount of the 
investment with the expected value of the 
business based on discounted forecasted 
cash flows.
— Assessing subsidiary audits: Assessing 
the work performed as part of our audit of 
subsidiaries and considering the results of 
that work, on those subsidiaries’ profits and 
net assets.

3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit 
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was 
set at £0.84m, determined with reference to a benchmark of 
group revenue, of which it represents 1.00% (2016: 0.92%).   
We consider total revenue to be the most appropriate 
benchmark as it provides a more stable measure year on 
year than group profit before tax. 
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a 
whole was set at £0.835m (2016: £0.85m), determined 
with reference to a benchmark of company total assets, of 
which it represents 0.55% (2016: 0.58%). 
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected 
or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.04m, 
in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.  
Of the group’s 12 (2016: 27) components, we subjected the 
9 active subsidiaries (2016: 12) to full scope audits for group 
purposes. The Group  team approved the component 
materialities, which ranged from £0.05m to £0.835m, 
having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group 
across the components. All work was carried out by the 
group engagement team at the group’s London head office 
only.
The components within the scope of our work accounted 
for the percentages illustrated opposite.

4. We have nothing to report on going concern
We are required to report to you if we have concluded that 
the use of the going concern basis of accounting is 
inappropriate or there is an undisclosed material uncertainty 
that may cast significant doubt over the use of that basis for 
a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval 
of the financial statements. We have nothing to report in 
these respects.
5. We have nothing to report on the other information in 
the Annual Report
The directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the financial 
statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated 
below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether, based on our financial 
statements audit work, the information therein is materially 
misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or 
our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have 
not identified material misstatements in the other 
information.
Strategic report and directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
— we have not identified material misstatements in the 
strategic report and the directors’ report; 
— in our opinion the information given in those reports for 
the financial year is consistent with the financial 
statements; and 
— in our opinion those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
6. We have nothing to report on the other matters on 
which we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion: 
— adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
— the parent Company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or 
— certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
— we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects
7. Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 
24, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the 
financial statements including being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and, 
parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent 
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs 
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial 
statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
8.The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the

Strategic Report Governance Accounts, notes and other information
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
Parity Group plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. 
Both the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the Group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared and approved by
the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). On
publishing the parent company ﬁnancial statements here together with the Group ﬁnancial statements, the Company is
taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and
related notes that form a part of these approved ﬁnancial statements.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements are set out below. The policies have
been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group’s business activities, together with the
factors likely to aﬀect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Directors’ Report (Review of
business and future developments). The ﬁnancial position of the Group, its cash ﬂows, liquidity position and borrowing
facilities are described in the Operational and Financial Review on pages 8 to 12 and in note 20 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Note 20 also includes the Group’s objectives for managing capital.
As outlined in note 20, the Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through an asset-based ﬁnance facility. The
facility contains certain ﬁnancial covenants which have been met throughout the period. The facility was renewed during 2016,
on favourable terms, and is currently subject to a minimum period up to 31 December 2018, at which point the facility becomes
evergreen rolling over on the same terms, with six months’ notice from either party. However , the bank who provide the facility,
PNC, has formally indicated a willingness in principle to renew the facility when the minimum term expires.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that
the Group will be able to operate within the level of its current facility for the foreseeable future. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements comprise the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at
31 December 2017. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has:
•    existing rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant activities that signiﬁcantly aﬀect the subsidiary’s returns; and
•    exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary; and 
•    the ability to use its power over the subsidiary to aﬀect the amount of the Group’s returns.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries are
included in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing
so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deﬁcit balance. 
The ﬁnancial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using
consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group
transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.
In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own Income Statement or
Statement of Comprehensive Income. The loss for the year dealt with in the accounts of the Company was £2,149,000 (2016:
£4,531,000).
Business Combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The related costs of acquisition other than those
associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are recognised in the proﬁt and loss as incurred. The acquiree’s
identiﬁable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS3 (2008)
“Business combinations” are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.

1 Accounting policies (continued)
Changes in accounting policies: new standards, interpretations and amendments eﬀective in 2017 adopted by the
Group and published standards not yet eﬀective
No new standards, amendments to published standards or interpretations of existing standards eﬀective in 2017 had a
material impact on the Group’s 2017 ﬁnancial statements. The following new standards and interpretations to existing
standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s future accounting, which the Group does not expect to
have signiﬁcant impact on its accounting policies or disclosures:
•    IFRS 2 ‘Classiﬁcation and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions’ (eﬀective 1 January 2018) - amendment
•    IFRS 4 ‘Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts’ (eﬀective 1 January 2018) - amendment
•    IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (eﬀective 1 January 2018)
•    IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with customers’ (eﬀective 1 January 2018)
•    IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (eﬀective 1 January 2019)
•    IAS 7 ‘Disclosure Initiative’ (eﬀective 1 January 2018)
•    IAS 12 ‘Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses’ (eﬀective 1 January 2018) - amendment
An assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 has been completed following a comprehensive review of the contracts that exist
across the Group’s revenue streams. The review has concluded that revenue recognition under IFRS 15 is expected to be
consistent with current practice for the Group’s revenue and had IFRS 15 been applied in the current reporting period, it
would not have had a material impact on the ﬁnancial statements. 
Under IFRS 16 the Group’s operating leases will be accounted for as right of use assets, which will be largely oﬀset by
equivalent lease liabilities. The assets will be recognised as property, plant and equipment and the lease liability will increase
net debt. The impact to proﬁt before tax is not expected to be material. 
It is not anticipated that there will be a material impact in respect of IFRS 9, as the Group has minimal ﬁnancial assets (except
for trade debtors).
Measurement convention
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at
their fair value: derivative ﬁnancial instruments and ﬁnancial instruments classiﬁed as fair value through the proﬁt or loss or as
available-for-sale. Non-current assets are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Revenue recognition
The Group generates revenue principally through the provision of recruitment and consultancy services. 
The Group recognises revenue when certain criteria are met: there is clear evidence that a contract exists, the amount of
revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that future economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the Group, and the stage of
completion can be measured reliably where services are delivered. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable, net of discounts, volume rebates and value added tax. 
Revenue on contracts for the supply of professional services at pre-determined rates is recognised as and when the work is
performed, irrespective of the duration of the contract. Permanent placement staﬃng revenue is recognised when candidates
commence employment. Rebates may be applicable on a sliding scale where the candidate’s employment is terminated
within nine weeks. Rebate provisions are created based on the experience of claims.
The Group presents interim recruitment revenues, and the related direct costs of services, in accordance with IFRS 15’s
guidance – Principal versus Agency Considerations. The Group acts as principal in all of its interim recruiting transactions in
that it carries the risks and rewards of ownership e.g. it has the obligation to pay the contractor, and it carries the risks of
non-payment due to insolvency or poor performance, and also the risk of pricing reductions. Accordingly, in respect of
interim recruitment, the Group reports gross revenues and gross direct costs. 
Revenue is recognised on ﬁxed price contracts while the contract is in progress, using the percentage of completion method,
having regard to the proportion of the total contract costs which have been incurred at the reporting date. Provision is made
for all foreseeable future losses.
Revenue from systems integration and consulting services under time and material arrangements is recognised as the services
are rendered.

1 Accounting policies (continued)
Non-recurring items
Items which are both material and non-recurring are presented as non-recurring items within the relevant Income Statement
category. The separate reporting of non-recurring items helps provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business
performance. Events which may give rise to the classiﬁcation of items as non-recurring, if of a signiﬁcantly material value,
include gains or losses on the disposal of a business, restructuring of a business, transaction costs, litigation and similar
settlements, asset impairments, onerous contracts, and gains on bargain purchases.
Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the ﬁnance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The
ﬁnance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability.
Financing income and expenses
Financing expenses comprise interest payable and ﬁnance leases recognised in proﬁt or loss using the eﬀective interest
method, unwinding of the discount on the retirement beneﬁt scheme liabilities, and net foreign exchange losses that are
recognised in the income statement (see foreign currency accounting policy). Financing income comprises the expected
return on the retirement beneﬁt scheme assets, interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, and net foreign
exchange gains.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in proﬁt or loss as it accrues, using the eﬀective interest method. Dividend
income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established. Foreign
currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Dividends
Final dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid at the year end are not recognised in the ﬁnancial statements
until they have been approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Interim dividends, which do not require
shareholder approval, are recognised when paid.
Taxation
Tax on the proﬁt or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity or in other
comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary diﬀerences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁnancial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary diﬀerences are not provided for:
the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that aﬀect neither accounting nor taxable
proﬁt other than in a business combination, and diﬀerences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they
will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner
of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted
at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset for deductible temporary diﬀerences is not recognised unless it probable that there will be taxable
proﬁts in the foreseeable future against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised. A deferred tax asset for unused tax
losses carried forward is recognised on the same basis as for deductible temporary diﬀerences. However, the existence of
the unused tax losses is strong evidence that future taxable proﬁt may not be available. Therefore, when an entity has a
history of recent losses, the entity recognises a deferred tax asset arising from unused tax losses only to the extent that
there is convincing evidence that suﬃcient taxable proﬁt will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.

Foreign currencies
Company
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All diﬀerences
are taken to the Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that
are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value
was determined.
Group
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at rates approximating to those ruling when
the transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations are translated at the rate ruling at the reporting
date. Exchange diﬀerences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations
at actual rate are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange
diﬀerences recognised in Other Comprehensive Income relating to that operation up to the date of disposal are transferred
to the consolidated Income Statement as part of the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or
geographical area of operations or its subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, that has been disposed of, has
been abandoned or that meets the criteria to be classiﬁed as held for sale.
Discontinued operations are presented in the Income Statement (including in the comparative period) as a single line which
comprises the post-tax proﬁt or loss of the discontinued operation and the post-tax gain or loss recognised on the re-
measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on disposal of the assets or disposal groups constituting discontinued
operations.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision
Maker. The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Group Board.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of a business combination over the Group’s share of the fair value
of identiﬁable net assets of the business acquired.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-
generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. In respect of equity accounted investees, the
carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the investee.
Gains and losses on disposal of a business include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business sold in determining
the gain or loss on disposal, except for goodwill arising on business combinations on or before 31 December 1997 which
has been deducted from Shareholders’ equity and remains indeﬁnitely in Shareholders’ equity.
Software
The carrying amount of software is its cost less any accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Software is amortised on a straight line basis over its expected useful economic life of three to seven years.
Intellectual property
Intellectual property represents the expenditure incurred on developing new, innovative products/services that are expected
to generate future economic beneﬁts. The carrying amount of intellectual property is its cost less any accumulated
amortisation and any provision for impairment. Intellectual property is amortised on a straight line basis over two years,
with amortisation commencing from the date that the products/services are available for sale.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write oﬀ the cost less estimated residual
value of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful economic life, as follows:
Leasehold improvements                              The lesser of the asset life and the remaining length of the lease
Oﬃce equipment                                           Between 3 and 5 years
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets (excluding deferred tax assets)
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, the
latter being the higher of the fair value less costs to sell associated with the CGU and its value in use. Value in use calculations
are performed using cash ﬂow projections for the CGU to which the goodwill relates, discounted at a pre-tax rate which
reﬂects the asset speciﬁc risks and the time value of money.
Impairment losses are recognised in proﬁt or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated ﬁrst to
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other
assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at each reporting date. The carrying value of other intangible assets and property, plant
and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not
be recoverable. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest
group of assets that generates cash inﬂows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inﬂows of other
assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of
impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units, or (“CGU”). Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the
purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at
which impairment is tested reﬂects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill
acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to beneﬁt from the synergies of the
combination. 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior
periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment
loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss
is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Financial assets
The Group’s ﬁnancial assets fall into the categories discussed below, with the allocation depending to an extent on the
purpose for which the asset was acquired. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the carrying amounts of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets are a reasonable approximation of their
fair values. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the eﬀective interest method, less
any impairment losses.
Loans and receivables: these assets are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. trade
receivables). They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition
or issue, less provision for impairment.
The eﬀect of discounting on these ﬁnancial instruments is not considered to be material.

1 Accounting policies (continued)
Financial assets (continued)
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as signiﬁcant ﬁnancial diﬃculties on the part
of the counterparty or default or signiﬁcant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts
due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the diﬀerence between the net carrying amount and
the present value of the future expected cash ﬂows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, such
provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within other operating expenses in
the Income Statement. 
On conﬁrmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written oﬀ against
the associated provision.
Investments: investments in subsidiary undertakings are recorded at cost. The carrying values of investments are reviewed
for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Cash and cash equivalents: cash and cash equivalents in the Statement of Financial Position comprise cash at bank and in
hand, short term deposits and other short-term liquid investments. In the Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents
comprise cash and cash equivalents as deﬁned above, net of bank overdrafts.
Assets held for sale
Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classiﬁed as held-for-sale if it is highly probable
that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.
Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to
sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated ﬁrst to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and liabilities
on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to work in progress, ﬁnancial assets, deferred tax assets or employee
beneﬁt assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group’s other accounting policies. Impairment losses
on initial classiﬁcation as held-for-sale and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in proﬁt or loss.
Stocks and work in progress
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises equipment for resale. Net realisable value
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling
and distribution.
Costs recoverable on contracts which are expected to beneﬁt performance and be recoverable over the life of the contracts
are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position as work in progress and charged to the Income Statement over the life
of the contract so as to match costs with revenues.
Work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable amount and represents that element of start-up costs
which, at the reporting date, has not been charged to the Income Statement. Cost includes materials, direct labour and an
attributable portion of overheads based on normal levels of activity. Net realisable amount is based on estimated selling
price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal including provision for contingencies and
anticipated future losses.
Accrued income
Accrued income primarily arises where temporary workers have provided their services but approved timesheets are
outstanding. As such, the amount incurred and margin earned thereon has yet to be invoiced onto the client.
Amounts recoverable on contracts and payments in advance
Amounts recoverable on contracts are stated at the net sales value of work done less amounts received as progress payments
on account. Where progress payments exceed the sales value of work done, they are included in payables as payments in
advance.

Financial liabilities
All of the Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities carried at amortised cost. The Group does not use
derivative ﬁnancial instruments or hedge account for any transactions.
Unless otherwise indicated, the carrying amounts of the Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities are a reasonable approximation of their
fair values.
Financial liabilities include the following items:
•    Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently
carried at amortised cost using the eﬀective interest method.
•    Finance leases which are initially measured at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the eﬀective
interest method.
•    Bank borrowings, which are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue
of the instrument. Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eﬀective
interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the
balance of the liability carried in the consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Interest expense in this context includes
initial transaction costs and premiums payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability
is outstanding.
Operating leases 
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives
received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the Balance Sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic beneﬁts will be required to settle
the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ﬂows at a pre-tax rate that reﬂects risks
speciﬁc to the liability.
From time to time the Group faces the potential of legal action in respect of employment or other contracts. In such
situations, where it is probable that a payment will be required to settle the action, provision is made for the Group’s best
estimate of the outcome.
Where leasehold properties are surplus to requirements, provisions are made for the best estimates of the unavoidable net
future costs.
Provisions for dilapidation charges that will crystallise at the end of the period of occupancy are provided for in full on non-
serviced properties.
Pensions
The Group operates a small number of retirement beneﬁt schemes. With the exception of the ‘Parity Retirement Beneﬁt
Plan’, all of the schemes are deﬁned contribution plans and the assets are held in separate, independently administered
funds. The Group’s contributions to deﬁned contribution plans are charged to the Income Statement in the period to which
the services are rendered by the employees, and the Group has no further obligation to pay further amounts.
The ‘Parity Retirement Beneﬁt Plan’ is a deﬁned beneﬁt pension fund with assets held separately from the Group. This fund
has been closed to new members since 1995 and with eﬀect from 1 January 2005 was also closed to future service accrual.
A deﬁned beneﬁt plan is a post-employment beneﬁt plan other than a deﬁned contribution plan. The Group’s net obligation in
respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future beneﬁt that employees have earned
in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that beneﬁt is discounted to determine its present value, and the
fair value of any plan assets at bid price, and any unrecognised past service costs are deducted. The liability discount rate is the
yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds denominated in the currency of, and having maturity dates
approximating to, the terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualiﬁed actuary using the projected
unit credit method. When the calculation results in a beneﬁt to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value
of beneﬁts available in the form of any future refunds from the plan, reductions in future contributions to the plan or on
settlement of the plan and takes into account the adverse eﬀect of any minimum funding requirements.

1 Accounting policies (continued)
Share capital
Following the adoption of IAS 32, ﬁnancial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that
they meet the following two conditions:
(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the company (or Group as the case may be) to deliver cash or other
ﬁnancial assets or to exchange ﬁnancial assets or ﬁnancial liabilities with another party under conditions that are
potentially unfavourable to the company (or Group); and 
(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that
includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will
be settled by the company’s exchanging a ﬁxed amount of cash or other ﬁnancial assets for a ﬁxed number of its own
equity instruments.
To the extent that this deﬁnition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classiﬁed as a ﬁnancial liability. Where the instrument
so classiﬁed takes the legal form of the company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these ﬁnancial statements for
called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 
For the purposes of the disclosures given in note 20, the Group considers its capital to comprise its cash and cash equivalents,
its asset-based bank borrowings, and its equity attributable to equity holders, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained
earnings, as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where Group companies enter into ﬁnancial guarantee contracts and guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within
the Group, the company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the
company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time that it becomes probable that any Group
company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. 
Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP)
As the Company is deemed to have control of its ESOP trust, it is treated as an agent and consolidated for the purposes of
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The ESOP’s assets (other than investments in the Company’s shares), liabilities, income
and expenses are included on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The ESOP’s investment in the
Company’s shares is deducted from shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as if they were
treasury shares.
Share-based payment transactions
Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group and Company receives goods or services as consideration for its
own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity
instruments are obtained by the Group and Company.
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The
fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions
upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reﬂect the actual number of
awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount
ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market
performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date
fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reﬂect such conditions and there is no true-up for diﬀerences between
expected and actual outcomes.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modiﬁed before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options,
measured immediately before and after the modiﬁcation, is also charged to the Income Statement over the remaining vesting
period.
Signiﬁcant accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions regarding the
future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may diﬀer from
these estimates. The estimates and assumptions which have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amount of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year are discussed below.

Signiﬁcant accounting estimates and judgements (continued)
Retirement beneﬁt liability
The costs, assets and liabilities of the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme operated by the Group are determined using methods relying
on actuarial estimates and assumptions. Details of the key assumptions are set out in note 22. The Group takes advice from
independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions. Changes in the assumptions used may have a
signiﬁcant eﬀect on the Income Statement and the Statement of Financial Position.
Recoverability of deferred tax assets
The deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts
will be available against which deductible temporary diﬀerences can be utilised, and there is convincing evidence that
suﬃcient taxable proﬁts will be available against which unused tax losses can be utilised. This is determined based on
management estimates and assumptions as to the future proﬁtability of the related business units. The forecasts for the
business used in this review were the same as those used in the review of impairment of goodwill (see note 12). 
Investments in subsidiaries
The Company reviews its investment in subsidiaries to test whether any impairment has been suﬀered. The recoverable
amounts are determined using discounted future cash ﬂows. 
Intercompany receivables
The Company reviews receivables due from subsidiary undertakings to test whether they are recoverable. Provision is made
for where there is uncertainty as to full recovery.
2 Segmental information
Factors that management used to identify the Group’s reporting segments
In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ the Group’s management structure, and the reporting of ﬁnancial
information to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Group Board), have been used as the basis to deﬁne reporting
segments. The Group has two continuing deﬁned cash generating units (see note 12) which form the basis of each operating
segment. The components of each segment are described below.
The internal ﬁnancial information prepared for the Group Board includes contribution at a segmental level, and the Group
Board allocates resources on the basis of this information. 
Segmental contribution, deﬁned as divisional revenues less attributable overheads, proﬁt before tax, and assets and liabilities
are internally reported at a Group level.
Description of the types of services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues
The Group has two segments:
•    Parity Professionals – provides targeted recruitment of temporary and permanent professionals to support IT and business
change programmes. Parity Professionals provides 89% (2016: 94%) of the continuing Group’s revenues.
•    Parity Consultancy Services – provides business and IT consultancy services focusing on the provision of data solutions
and delivery of IT projects. Parity Consultancy Services provides 11% (2016: 6%) of the continuing Group’s revenues.
Group costs include Directors’ salaries and costs relating to Group activities and are not allocated to reporting segments for
internal reporting purposes. 
Measurement of operating segment contribution
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of signiﬁcant accounting
policies.
The Group evaluates performance on the basis of contribution from operations before tax not including non-recurring items,
such as restructuring costs.
Inter-segment sales are priced on the same basis as sales to external customers, with a discount applied to encourage the
use of Group resources at a rate acceptable to the tax authorities.

The continuing Group operates exclusively in the UK. All revenues are generated and all segment assets are located in the
UK. Inter-segment revenue in the year is a result of Parity Professionals selling IT recruitment services to Parity Consultancy
Services.
68% (2016: 61%) or £50.4m (2016: £52.7m) of the Parity Professionals revenue from external customers was generated in
the public sector . 82% (2016: 57%) or £7.8m (2016: £3.0m) of the Parity Consultancy Services revenue was generated in the
Public Sector. 
The largest single customer in Parity Professionals contributed revenue of £8.8m or 11% and was in the public sector (2016:
£10.8m or 12% and in the public sector). The largest single customer in Parity Consultancy Services contributed revenue of
£4.4m or 46% and was in the Public Sector (2016: £2.9m or 54% and in the Public Sector).

7 Discontinued operations
In December 2016 the Group Board committed to a plan to sell the Inition cash generating unit following the strategic
decision made in May 2015 to place greater focus on the Group’s core business. As such, Inition’s operating result for the
current and comparative year, as well as impairment of goodwill associated with the Inition cash generating unit is presented
as discontinued. 
The results of discontinued operations also include expenses incurred that are associated with the planned disposal of
Inition. 
The post-tax result of discontinued operations was determined as follows:

8 Share based payments
The Group operates several share based reward schemes for employees:
•    A United Kingdom tax authority approved scheme for Executive Directors and senior staﬀ;
•    an unapproved scheme for Executive Directors and senior staﬀ; and
•    a Save As You Earn Scheme for all employees.
Under the approved and unapproved schemes, options vest if the share price averages a target price for 5 consecutive days
over a three year period from the date of grant. Options lapse if the individual leaves the Group, except under certain
circumstances such as leaving by reason of redundancy, when the options lapse 12 months after the leaving date.
Save As You Earn options lapse if not exercised within six months after the vesting date. They are also subject to continued
employment within the Group.
All employee options have a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant. The total share-based remuneration
recognised in the Income Statement was £68,000 (2016: £58,000). Share-based remuneration relating to key management
personnel is disclosed in note 26.

Of the total number of options outstanding at the end of the year 1,455,000 (2016: 2,030,000) had vested and were
exercisable at the end of the year. The weighted average exercise price of those options was 17 pence (2016: 17 pence).
300,000 options were exercised during the year (2016: nil) at an average exercise price of 8 pence (2016: nil). 
There were no options granted during the year (2016: 3,100,000 options granted at a weighted average fair value of 9 pence).
The following information is relevant in determining the fair value of options granted during the year under equity–settled
share-based remuneration schemes operated by the Group. There are no cash-settled schemes.

The volatility assumption is calculated as the historic volatility of the share price over a 3 and 5 year period prior to grant date.
Share options issued to deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme
In December 2010 the Group issued 1,000,000 share options in Parity Group plc to the pension scheme at an exercise price
of 9 pence per share. These options may be exercised at the discretion of the Trustees; they vested on grant and have no
expiry date. Any gain on exercise is to be used to reduce the scheme deﬁcit. These options were valued using the stochastic
method. The share price on the grant date was 15.75 pence. Whilst the options do not have an expiry date, for valuation
purposes it is assumed that the expected life of the options is 8 years. The expected volatility is 64.2% and the average risk
free rate assumed was 3.4%.

The tax (credit)/expense on continuing operations excludes the tax credit from discontinued operations of £85,000 (2016:
£31,000). This has been included in ‘proﬁt/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax’ (see note 7). 
The tax credit from discontinued operations of £85,000 comprises a current tax credit of £112,000 and a deferred tax expense
of £27,000. As such, there is no current tax payable by the Group for 2017.
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 20% to 19% with eﬀect from 1 April 2017. Accordingly, the
Group’s proﬁts for this accounting period are subject to tax at a rate of 19.25% (2016: 20%). A further reduction to 17%
(eﬀective 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 15 September 2016. As such, the tax rate of 17% has been applied in
calculating the UK deferred tax position of the Group at 31 December 2017.
The reasons for the diﬀerence between the actual tax (credit)/charge for the year and the standard rate of corporation tax

10 Earnings per ordinary share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the basic earnings for the year by the weighted average number of fully
paid ordinary shares in issue during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated on the same basis as the basic earnings per share with a further adjustment to the
weighted average number of fully paid ordinary shares to reﬂect the eﬀect of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

12 Goodwill
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the Group’s two separate continuing cash generating units (CGUs) being;
Parity Professionals and Parity Consultancy Services. At 31 December 2016, the goodwill associated with the Inition CGU
was reclassiﬁed as held for sale.

Goodwill was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 at the year end and no impairment charge was recognised. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are based on value in use calculations using the pre-tax cash ﬂows based on budgets
approved by management for 2018. Years from 2019 to 2021 are based on the budget for 2018 projected forward at expected
growth rates. Years from 2022 onward assume no further growth. This approach is considered prudent based on current
expectations of the 2018 long-term growth rate.
Major assumptions are as follows:
                                                                                                                                                                                 Parity

Discount rates are based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the speciﬁc risks of each cash
generating unit. In 2017 the Directors considered it appropriate to increase the WACC in light of industry and sector
comparables.
Forecast revenue growth is expressed as the compound growth rate over the next 4 years from 2018 to 2021. For all CGUs
the rates are based on past experience of growth in revenues and future expectations of economic conditions. Operating
margins are based on past experience.
A 10% change in any of the underlying assumptions used in the discounted cash ﬂow forecasts would not lead to the carrying
value of goodwill being in excess of their recoverable amount.

During 2017, a review of the Group’s ﬁxed asset registers was undertaken. The review identiﬁed fully depreciated items,
with a cost value of £1,976,000, that was no longer used by the Group. As such, the Group recognised a £1,976,000 disposal
for oﬃce equipment at cost and the associated accumulated depreciation.

A deferred tax asset for deductible temporary diﬀerences is not recognised unless it is more likely than not that there will
be taxable proﬁts in the foreseeable future against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised. At the Balance Sheet date,
the Directors assessed the probability of future taxable proﬁts being available against which Parity Consultancy Services
could recognise a deferred tax asset for previously unrecognised deductible temporary diﬀerences. The review concluded
that it is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available. As such, the Directors have recognised a deferred tax asset
for all deductible temporary diﬀerences available to Parity Consultancy Services. 
A deferred tax asset for unused tax losses carried forward is recognised on the same basis as for deductible temporary
diﬀerences. However, the existence of the unused tax losses is itself strong evidence that future taxable proﬁt may not be
available. Therefore, when an entity has a history of recent losses, the entity recognises a deferred tax asset arising from
unused tax losses only to the extent that there is convincing evidence that suﬃcient taxable proﬁt will be available against
which the unused tax losses can be utilised. At the balance sheet date, the Directors considered recognising a deferred tax
asset for previously unrecognised unused tax losses carried forward by Parity Consultancy Services. The review concluded
that given the division’s history of relatively recent tax losses and the additional requirement of providing convincing evidence
that suﬃcient taxable proﬁt will be available, a prudent approach would be taken and deferred tax would remain
unrecognised for tax losses carried forward by the division.

14 Deferred tax (continued)
The Directors believe that the deferred tax asset recognised is recoverable based on the future earning potential of the
Group and the individual cash generating divisions. The forecasts for Parity Professionals comfortably support the unwinding
of the deferred tax asset held by this division of £380,000 (2016: £409,000) and the forecasts for Parity Consultancy Services
comfortably support the unwinding of the deferred tax asset held by this division of £539,000 (2016: £nil).
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2017 has been calculated on the rate of 17% substantively enacted at the Balance
Sheet date.

Group’s accrued income and amounts recoverable on contracts, are pledged as collateral for the asset-based borrowings.
These borrowings ﬂuctuate daily and at the year-end totalled £6,581,000 (2016: £8,613,000). 
The Group records impairment losses on its trade receivables separately from gross receivables. Factors considered in
making provisions for receivables include the ability of the customer to settle the debt, the age of the debt and any other
circumstance particular to the transaction that may impact recoverability. The movements on the allowance account during
the year are included within operating costs in the consolidated income statement and are summarised below:

The balance of impaired losses for the continuing Group at 31 December 2017 was £nil (2016: nil). All debts at 31 December
2017 are considered to be recoverable.
As at 31 December 2017 trade receivables of £737,000 (2016: £1,335,000) were past due, but not impaired. These relate
to customers where there is no evidence of unwillingness or of an inability to settle the debt. The ageing of Group trade

15 Trade and other receivables (continued)
The Company had no provisions for trade receivables, as it has no trade receivables. Other receivables in the Group and
the Company were not past due and not impaired.
The Company’s receivables due from subsidiary undertakings were reviewed for impairment at the year end based on the
performance of 2017 and on subsequent years forecast projections. A discounted future cash ﬂow method was employed
for the review. As a result of this review, no provision was deemed necessary. The assessment was performed on a value
in use basis using discount rates of between 11.5% and 13.0% (2016: between 3.1% and 5.5%) and the other parameters
used in the goodwill impairment review, as outlined in note 12.

Leasehold dilapidations
Leasehold dilapidations relate to the estimated cost of returning a leasehold property to its original state at the end of the
lease in accordance with the lease terms. Dilapidation charges that will crystallise at the end of the period of occupancy are
provided for in full on all non-serviced properties. Based on current lease expiry dates it is estimated these provisions will
be settled over a period of two to three years. The main uncertainty relates to the estimation of the costs that will be incurred
at the end of the lease.
20 Financial instruments – risk management
The Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of ﬁnancial instruments. This note describes the Group’s objectives,
policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information

There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to ﬁnancial instrument risks and the methods used to
measure them from previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note.
Principal ﬁnancial instruments 
The principal ﬁnancial instruments used by the Group, from which ﬁnancial instrument risk arises, are trade receivables,
cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables and bank borrowings.

Fair values of ﬁnancial instruments
The fair values of all of the Group’s, and of the Company’s, ﬁnancial instruments are the same as their carrying values. 
General objectives, policies and processes – risk management
The Group is exposed through its operations to the following ﬁnancial instrument risks: credit risk; liquidity risk; interest
rate risk; and foreign currency risk.
The policy for managing these risks is set by the Board following recommendations from the Finance Director. Certain risks
are managed centrally, while others are managed locally following guidelines communicated from the centre. The overall
objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly aﬀecting the Group’s
competitiveness and ﬂexibility. The policy for each of the above risks is described in more detail below.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the Group’s trade and other receivables. It is the risk that the counterparty fails to discharge their
obligation in respect of the instrument.
The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales. It is Group policy to assess the credit risk of new customers
before entering contracts. Such credit ratings are then factored into the credit assessment process to determine the
appropriate credit limit for each customer. The Group does not collect collateral to mitigate credit risk. 
The Group operates exclusively in the UK. Approximately 69% (2016: 61%) of the Group’s turnover is derived from the Public
Sector. The largest customer balance represents 29% (2016: 19%) of the trade receivable balance.
Quantitative disclosures of the credit risk exposure in relation to ﬁnancial assets are set out below. Further disclosures
regarding trade and other receivables, which are neither past due nor impaired, are provided in note 15.

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes
in interest rates.
It is Group policy that all external Group borrowings are drawn down on the asset-based ﬁnancing facilities arranged with
our bankers which bear a ﬂoating rate of interest based on the PNC base rate. Borrowings against the asset-based ﬁnancing
facilities are typically drawn or repaid on a daily basis in order to minimise borrowings and interest costs and transaction
charges. Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Group entirely from the risk of paying rates in
excess of current market rates, nor eliminates the cash ﬂow risk associated with interest payments, it considers that it
achieves an appropriate balance of these risks. 
Throughout 2017 and 2016 the Group’s variable rate borrowings were denominated in Sterling. Interest costs on borrowings
from the asset-based ﬁnancing facility with PNC was charged at 2.35% above base rate throughout 2017 (2016: 2.5% until
1 September 2016 and 2.35% subsequently). Amounts under this facility are repayable upon demand. 
If interest rates on borrowings had been 1% higher/lower throughout the year with all other variables held constant, the
loss after tax for the year would have been approximately £53,000 higher/lower and net assets £53,000 higher/lower.
The Directors consider a 1% change in base rates is the maximum likely change over the next year, being the period to the
next point at which these disclosures are expected to be made.
The Company holds interest bearing loan agreements with some of its subsidiary undertakings. Interest on all loans is charged
at 2.0% above the prevailing Bank of England base rate, except for one loan with Parity International B.V. which is charged
at 2.0% above the prevailing European Central Bank base rate. As at 31 December 2017, the loan balance due by the Company
to Parity International BV, translated into Sterling, was £27,463,000 (2016: £26,696,000 payable).
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of
changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group no longer has any active overseas operations, but does retain certain overseas subsidiaries that are not trading
and are in the process of being closed down. The Group’s net assets arising from overseas operations are exposed to currency
risk resulting in gains or losses on retranslation into sterling. The asset exposure is mainly in respect of intercompany balances.
The Group does not hedge its net investment in overseas operations as it does not consider that the potential ﬁnancial
impact of such hedging techniques warrants the reduction in volatility in consolidated net assets.
The continuing business has few transactions in foreign currency. The hedging of individual contracts is considered on a case
by case basis. Owing to the small value and volume of such contracts no hedging transactions were entered in 2017 or 2016.
During 2014, the underlying denomination of a large intercompany balance between the Company and one of the Group’s
inactive overseas subsidiaries was revised. As at 31 December 2013, the Company held a loan balance due to the relevant
subsidiary of £24,471,000 which was denominated in Sterling. The base currency of the Company is Sterling and the overseas
subsidiary’s base currency is Euros. In 2014, the denomination of the loan was revised to Euros, and thus subject to exchange
rate ﬂuctuations in the books of the Company. As a result, in 2017 the Company recorded a translation loss of £1,092,000
(2016: loss of £3,212,000). As at the 31 December 2017, the loan balance due by the Company, translated into Sterling, was
£27,463,000 (2016: £26,696,000).

Sterling - -

US Dollar 5 4
Total net exposure (27,450) (26,690)
Sensitivity analysis – Group and Company
If the exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro had been 10% higher/lower at the balance sheet date, with all other
variables held constant, the eﬀect on equity for the year would have been approximately £2,746,300 higher/lower. A 10%
ﬂuctuation in any other currency exchange rate would not have a signiﬁcant impact on proﬁt and loss, nor equity. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the ﬁnance charges on its borrowings under its
asset-based ﬁnancing arrangements. It is the risk that the Group will encounter diﬃculty in meeting its ﬁnancial obligations
as they fall due.
The liquidity of each Group entity is managed centrally, with daily transfers to operating entities to maintain a pre-determined
cash balance. Normal supplier terms range from 2 weeks to 30 days. The level of the Group facility is approved periodically
by the Board and negotiated with the Group’s current bankers. At the reporting date, cash ﬂow projections were considered
by the Board and the Group is forecast to have suﬃcient funds and available funding facilities to meet its obligations as they
fall due.

Capital disclosures
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, equity attributable to equity holders, and asset-
based ﬁnance. There is no long-term external debt, except for a small number of ﬁnance leases. The leases represent a
liability of £19,000 (2016: £45,000) and are repayable within two years. The Company is funded through equity and
intercompany loans.
The Group uses an asset-based ﬁnance facility with PNC Business Credit, a member of The PNC Financial Services Group,
Inc. The facility, which enables the Group to borrow against both trade debt and accrued income and provides for borrowing
of up to £15.0m depending on the availability of appropriate assets as security.
The Group’s and Company’s objectives when maintaining capital are:
•    to safeguard the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for
shareholders and beneﬁts for other stakeholders; and
•    to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.

The Board regularly reviews the adequacy of resources available and considers the options available to increase them. The
asset-based borrowing facility contains certain externally imposed ﬁnancial covenants which have been met throughout the
period.
The Company does not currently have distributable reserves available for dividend payments. A capital reconstruction will
be necessary to create reserves available for distribution. The Board plan to review possible capital reconstruction options
in the near future.

21 Reserves
The Board is not proposing a dividend for the year (2016: nil pence per share). 
The following describes the nature and purpose of each reserve within owners' equity:
Share capital
Share capital consists of ordinary share capital and previously consisted of deferred share capital. 
Ordinary share capital
Share capital is the amount subscribed for ordinary share capital at nominal value. 
During 2017 300,000 share options were exercised, increasing the Group’s ordinary share capital from £2,036,480 to
£2,042,480 (2016: no change to ordinary share capital). 
Deferred share capital
Deferred share capital is the nominal value assigned to the deferred share capital. 
In May 2017 the Directors resolved to compulsorily reacquire and cancel the deferred shares of Parity Group plc. As such,
the deferred share capital at year end was £nil (2016: £14,319,108). 
Share premium reserve
Share premium is the amount subscribed for share capital in excess of nominal value.
Following the exercise of share options in 2017, the share premium reserve increased from £33,195,689 to £33,212,189
(2016: There was no change to the share premium reserve).
Capital redemption reserve
A capital redemption reserve of £14,319,108 was created during 2017 when the Directors resolved to cancel the deferred
shares of Parity Group plc (2016: £nil).
Other reserves
Other reserves of the Group of £44,160,000 relate principally to a reserve created following a change of the Group’s ultimate
parent and a corresponding Scheme of Arrangement in July 1999.
Other reserves of the Company of £22,729,000 relate principally to a reserve created following the reorganisation of the
Group’s capital structure in 2002, which resulted in the Company increasing its investment in subsidiary undertakings.
Retained earnings
Retained earnings represent the cumulative net gains and losses recognised in the Income Statement. 
Consolidated retained earnings are stated after adjustment for the ESOP’s investment in the Company’s shares of £351,000
(2016: £351,000).

22 Pension commitments 
The Group operates a small number of pension schemes. With the exception of the Parity Group Retirement Beneﬁts Plan,
all of the schemes are deﬁned contribution plans and the assets are held in separately administered funds. Contributions to
deﬁned contribution schemes from continuing operations during the year were £192,000 (2016: £178,000). 
Deﬁned beneﬁt plan 
In March 1995, the Group established the Parity Retirement Beneﬁts Plan, renamed as the Parity Group Retirement Beneﬁts
Plan, following a Scheme of Arrangement in 1999, in order to facilitate the continuance of pension entitlements for staﬀ
transferring from other schemes following acquisitions in 1994. The Plan is governed by the Trustees of the plan and is
administered by Cartwright Group Limited in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules, solely for the beneﬁt of its members
and other beneﬁciaries. The Trustees comprise an independent Chairman, one ‘member’ representative and one ‘employer’
representative. It is a funded deﬁned beneﬁt scheme and has been closed to new members since 1995. With eﬀect from 1
January 2005 this scheme was also closed to future service accrual and future contributions paid into money purchase
arrangements.
The weighted average liability duration is approximately 14 years and can be attributed to the scheme members as follows:
Weighted average
No. of liability duration
members (years)
Pensioner members 60 14
Deferred members 8 20
Total 68 14
During the year one deferred member elected to transfer out of the Plan.
The Plan is funded by the Group based on a separate actuarial valuation for funding purposes. The actuarial valuation is
subject to more prudent assumptions than the valuation under IFRS 19. The next triennial actuarial valuation is due as at
April 2018. Funding requirements are formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of Contributions
and Recovery Plan agreed between the Trustees and the Group. 
During March 2015 the Trustees agreed to a temporary suspension of contributions, and subsequently extended this
agreement until July 2016. In February 2016, a lump sum contribution of £100,000 was made by the Group. In March 2016,
agreement was reached with the Trustees to reduce deﬁcit reduction contributions, linking amounts payable to company
performance and aﬀordability on a sliding scale as part of the 2015 triennial valuation review. As a result, monthly
contributions of £15,000 resumed from May 2016 until March 2035, with conditional annual bonus payments predicated
on the Group’s ﬁnancial performance and the divestment of non-core assets. The contributions increase each year in line
with RPI from the 1st January with the ﬁrst increase applied on 1st January 2017. The balance of the deﬁcit is expected to
be met by asset outperformance. The core contributions in 2018 are expected to be £16,700 per month to allow for increased
scheme expenses in addition to the inﬂationary increase.
In 2012 an issue was made to the Plan of 1,000,000 share options in Parity Group plc at an exercise price of 9 pence per
share to be exercised at the discretion of the Trustees and any gain to be used for the beneﬁt of the Plan. These options
vested on grant and have no expiry date.
In 2017 the Trustees changed the investment strategy and fund choices in order to reduce the volatility of the deﬁcit whilst
increasing the longer term expected investment return. This was achieved by using liability driven investment, which provides
leveraged exposure to bond-like assets. The leverage was used to reduce deﬁcit volatility and has allowed a greater share of
the assets to be invested in growth assets, as set out in the Composition of Plan Assets table on page 71. The liability driven
investments signiﬁcantly reduced both interest rate and inﬂation risk so that, using a stochastic ‘value at risk’ model, the
overall investment risk reduced by approximately one third. The main funding risks are as follows:
•    Investment return risk – if the assets underperform the assumed returns in setting the funding targets then additional
contributions may be required;
•    Longevity risk – if the future improvements in mortality exceed the assumptions then additional contributions may be
required;
•    Foreign currency exchange rate risk – the diversiﬁed growth funds have the option to use foreign currency as an asset
class. The diversiﬁed growth funds are actively managed and, consequently, any foreign currency exposure is
constantly monitored and addressed where the risk/reward balance is not appropriate.

22 Pension commitments (continued)
The valuation for IAS 19 has been provided by Cartwright Group Limited, a company that specialises in providing actuarial
services, as at 31 December 2017. 
Principal actuarial assumptions
2017 2016
Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.7% - 3.9% 3.7% - 4.0%
Discount rate 2.45% 2.6%
Retail price inflation 3.3% 3.4%
Consumer price inflation 2.3% 2.4%
In accordance with the revised IAS19, the assumption for future investment returns is the same discount rate (2.45%) used
in calculating the pension liabilities. 
The underlying mortality assumption used is in accordance with the standard table known as S1PA_H, S1PA or S1PA_L
mortality, dependent on the size of each member’s pension, using the CMI_2015 projection based on year of birth with a
long term rate of improvement of 1.25% p.a. (2016: 1.25% p.a.). This results in the following life expectancies:
•    Male aged 65 at 31.12.17 has a life expectancy of 87 years (2016: 87 years)
•    Female aged 65 at 31.12.17 has a life expectancy of 89 years (2016: 89 years)

25 Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Group is exposed to the risk of claims in respect of contracts where the customer or
supplier is dissatisﬁed with the performance, pricing and/or completion of the contracted service or product. Such claims
are normally resolved by a combination of negotiation, further work by Parity or the supplier, and/or monetary settlement
without formal legal process being necessary. Occasionally, such claims progress into legal action. At the present time, Group
management believes the resolution of any known claims or legal proceedings will not have a material further impact on
the ﬁnancial position of the Group.
26 Key management remuneration
Key management comprises the Group’s Board of Directors and the Managing Directors of Parity Professionals and Parity
Consultancy Services. The total remuneration received by key management for 2017 was £803,000 (2016: £909,000). This
comprises emoluments received, pension contributions and share based payment charges (2016: included compensation
for loss of oﬃce). Remuneration of the Board of Directors, including that of the highest paid Director A Rommel, is disclosed
