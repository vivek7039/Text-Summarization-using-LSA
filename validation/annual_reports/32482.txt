Strategic Report
Chairman's Statement
7
We have once again seen another year of excellent performance for our shareholders. Not only have we maintained our 
relative level of organic growth in our Cloud Services segment, our Easyspace segment has also returned to organic growth 
after declining a little last year. 
Both of those elements of organic growth plus the acquisition of Cristie during the year, which we have allocated to a new Non-
recurring Revenue segment, together with the full year contributions of SystemsUp and United Hosting has meant we have 
maintained our overall level of revenue growth for the year. In May, after the end of our financial year we purchased Dediserve 
and we believe that there will be other opportunities to allow us to continue to add to our organic growth through acquisition.
We have again enjoyed a substantial increase in profitability over the year, driven by that organic and acquisitive revenue 
growth.
All of this progress is a result of a great deal of hard work by our executives and staff and I thank them all on behalf of the Board 
and the shareholders for their efforts over the year.
Sarah Haran, who has served as an executive director of iomart throughout the time the Group has been listed on AIM, decided 
to step down from the Board at the end of this financial year. She has given many years of loyal and valuable service to the 
Group and on behalf of all shareholders I thank her warmly for her service.
After nearly 6 years of first class commitment and service, Crawford Beveridge has chosen not to stand for re-election as 
Non-Executive Director at our forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Both personally and on behalf of everyone connected 
with the Group, I want to thank him for his valuable contribution to the development of iomart over the years. The search for 
a replacement for Crawford is at an advanced stage and we expect to be in a position to make an announcement about this 
in the near future.
As we indicated in our trading update which was issued at the end of March we have decided to improve our dividend policy 
to reflect the ongoing growth that we have been delivering, the level of cash we generate, and the confidence we continue to 
have in our future prospects. We had previously committed to paying up to 25% of our adjusted diluted earnings per share by 
way of dividend and last year our pay-out ratio was 22%. We have now increased the upper limit of dividend pay-out to 40% 
and the Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of 6.0p per share on 6 September 2017 to shareholders on the register on 
11 August 2017, based on an ex-dividend date of 10 August 2017. This represents an increase of 90% over the dividend last 
year and equivalent to a pay-out ratio of 35% of adjusted diluted earnings per share. We continue to offer shareholders the 
option to participate in a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) as an alternative to receiving cash. Details of the DRIP scheme will 
be distributed with the annual accounts in due course. 
We have started the new financial year in a strong position and I look forward to another exciting year of growth with 
considerable confidence.

Introduction
We have again enjoyed another very successful year with revenues and profits growing to record levels both organically and through 
acquisition as we continue to deliver an ever broader range of cloud solutions.
Our revenues in the year were £89.6m, an increase of 17% over the previous year, our adjusted EBITDA of £36.6m showed a 13% 
increase over the previous year and our profit before tax also increased by 13% to £14.7m. 
The opportunity remains to continue to grow both organically and through a disciplined acquisition strategy. 
Market
The market for cloud services continues to grow and evolve. There is still a long runway of opportunity as the ‘IT as a service’ philosophy 
and delivery unfolds. There is an inevitability around this fundamental change in how IT is delivered but there is also a built in delay 
mechanism as systems, processes and applications are dealt with on a ‘one by one’ basis rather than in one full organisation wide 
swoop, as applications and workloads are individually considered for an upgrade, refresh or rewrite.
Security has again been in the headlines and it serves to show that on premise infrastructure is far more difficult to keep secure and 
available on a 24x7x365 basis than those in the cloud, in specialist datacentres, with 24x7x365 monitoring and management and with 
all the required perimeter defences in place.
We believe that iomart is one of the most compliant organisations with regard to security and certification in the sector. This will drive 
more opportunity for us, with our long experience of security whether it be infrastructure and network protection, detection and 
response to threats, access control, log management, or compliance with various standards.
We are now less than a year away from the introduction of the new regulations around data security, the EU General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR). Our plans for the introduction of these regulations are well advanced both for the Group’s own needs and to help 
other organisations understand the implications for their own business and thereby to become compliant.
Organisations today are confronted by an increasingly complex set of cloud decisions in terms of cost, value, effectiveness, complexity, 
security, data protection and compliance. Whatever the cloud challenge iomart can assist all organisations in moving to the cloud, 
whether it be private, public or hybrid approach. The long term recurring revenue opportunity for iomart remains compelling. We are 
well established as a major player in providing the flexible cloud solutions that businesses require.
The future success of cloud companies will be driven by their ability to address further towards the application layer as well as the 
underlying infrastructure. There is growing evidence of different market segments with distinct hosting and cloud requirements and 
characteristics. This is leading to a growing trend in specialisation in various verticals such as e-commerce or financial software and 
this is one reason why the hosting and cloud markets will be served by a wide variety of vendors and vendor types.
Our challenge is to continue to navigate through these early days of the further evolution of cloud adoption and to ensure we build 
the skills and resources necessary to be successful in that ever more complex space.
Acquisitions
We again augmented our organic growth through the acquisition of Cristie Data Limited (“Cristie”) in August and after the year-end, in 
May, through the acquisition of Dediserve Limited (“Dediserve”), a Dublin based provider of Cloud solutions in ten locations around the 
world. To date we have not seen any impact from the UK’s decision to leave the European Union other than the weakening of Sterling. 
The Board has considered the impact on the Group of the UK’s decision to leave and whilst there are still many issues to be resolved 
we believe we will be able to deal with them as they arise. The acquisition of Dediserve gives us a Cloud operation in geographical areas 
where we do not currently have a presence, including another base in the European Union.
We continue to look for businesses that fit our criteria with a view to making further acquisitions in the coming year.
Operational Review
We have previously reported in two operating segments (Cloud Services and Easyspace) both of which involve the provision of services 
from common infrastructure delivering a very high level of recurring revenue. During the year we acquired Cristie and we have decided 
to report that in a separate segment as it predominantly involves the provision of IT infrastructure on customers’ premises with little 
by the way of recurring revenue. We have designated this segment as Non-recurring Revenue.
Strategic Report
Chief Executive Officer's Report

Cloud Services 
Revenues in this segment have grown by 11% to £72.7m (2016: £65.4m) partly as a result of the continued organic growth and as a 
result of acquisitions. Organic growth in the year was 10%, slightly above the level of 9% we have delivered in our last two financial years 
and our adjusted EBITDA percentage margin continues to be amongst the highest in the industry.
Through our iomart Cloud unit we provide complex hosting solutions, involving private, public and hybrid cloud solutions with 
customers typically paying for these services on a monthly basis on contracts ranging from one to three years in length. Our churn 
levels in this unit have stabilised and are in line with that experienced last year.
Our server infrastructure business, delivering dedicated physical servers to customers, is run as one unit encompassing the RapidSwitch 
and Redstation brands. We manage many thousands of physical servers for our customers using highly automated systems and 
processes which we continue to develop and improve. 
Our Back-up and Disaster Recovery specialism is primarily sold through Backup Technology.
SystemsUp provides consultancy services to organisations, particularly in the public sector, helping them to decide on their cloud 
strategy with an emphasis on the public cloud. Having a consultancy division within the Group allows us to engage at an earlier stage 
with organisations considering their cloud strategy and provides the opportunity to leverage the provision of those consultancy services 
to gain recurring revenue through the deployment of cloud solutions. However, unlike our other activities within the Cloud Services 
segment there is less recurring revenue generated from consultancy services and this area has not performed as predicted during 
the year and in future we will be more prudent in projecting the revenues which we expect to generate to recognise the difficulty in 
estimating revenue levels. We have made some changes to senior management within the consultancy unit and have also refined its 
strategic approach to focus on the delivery of a set of core cloud technologies. This is with a view to ensuring that as often as possible 
projects that are delivered will ultimately have a managed service and recurring revenue element.
We are able to supply products and services across the cloud spectrum and do so using common platforms across the Group.
Within the scope of our product set we have strengthened our relationships with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft now 
labelled as Hypercloud vendors. Both are growing strongly on a global basis although they still account for a very small fraction of 
overall IT and Cloud spend.
We are now an Advanced Partner of AWS and moving towards the next level. We are one of Microsoft’s most respected Cloud Service 
Providers in the UK and we are being presented with a growing number of Microsoft Azure opportunities. 
We continue to build on our skills and accreditations and see constant improvement across the Group’s skillset.
Easyspace
In line with our expectations the Easyspace segment has performed well over the year, returning to a position of organic revenue 
growth. 
Our activities within this segment provide a range of products to the micro and SME markets including domain names, shared, 
dedicated and virtual servers and email services.
Revenues in the segment have grown by 22% to £13.2m (2016: £10.9m) mainly as a result of the acquisition of United Hosting in the 
previous year.  Organic growth in the year was 4% against a decline of 8% in the previous year.
Non-recurring revenue
The non-recurring revenue segment contains the results of Cristie since we acquired that business in August 2016. In just over 7 
months of ownership the revenue generated was £3.6m. 
Cristie primarily provides solutions similar to those provided by the Cloud Services segment with the exception that they would tend to 
be less complex in nature and predominantly installed on the customers’ own premises rather than from a datacentre location. These 
solutions would involve, for example, the provision of storage and back-up infrastructure. Cristie has a substantial number of public 
sector customers in areas such as health and education and we welcome its activities into the Group.
Current trading and outlook
This has been another year of strong growth and trading since the year end remains good.
The long term opportunity and runway for success remains large and long. iomart remains well positioned to take advantage of that 
opportunity and to deliver further significant growth.
I look forward, once again, with confidence to the year ahead.

Trading Results
Revenue
Revenues for the year grew by 17% to £89.6m (2016: £76.3m) through the combination of continued organic growth and the impact 
of acquisitions.
Our Cloud Services segment grew revenues by 11% to £72.7m (2016: £65.4m). This growth was helped by a full year contribution from 
SystemsUp which we acquired in June 2015. Revenue growth in the Cloud Services segment excluding the impact of acquisitions was 
10% (2016: 9%). 
Revenues within the Easyspace segment grew by 22% to £13.2m (2016: £10.9m). This growth was helped by a full year contribution 
from United Hosting which we acquired in November 2015. Revenue growth in the Easyspace segment excluding the impact of 
acquisitions was 4% (2016: decline of 8%). As expected the decline in the organic revenue levels in this segment has stopped as new 
sales and churn levels have moved into balance, largely due to revised pricing in the domain market and the introduction of new 
products. As a result, the segment has returned to an encouraging level of organic growth.
During the year we acquired Cristie which is largely a non-recurring revenue operation. Given that the vast majority of our revenue in 
our Cloud Services and Easyspace segments is recurring in nature we have decided to review the performance of this unit separately 
and as a consequence we will report this in a separate segment which we have called our Non-recurring Revenue segment. Revenues 
of £3.6m (2016: £nil) were generated in this segment in the year.
We continue to have good revenue visibility and high levels of recurring revenue. With our larger customers we have multi-year 
contracts for the provision of complex managed hosting solutions.  Many of our smaller customers pay in advance for the provision of 
hosting services resulting in a substantial sum of deferred revenue which we then recognise during the period over which we provide 
our services.
Gross Margin
Our gross profit for the year was £57.3m (2016: £51.6m) increasing as a result of the additional revenues we generated as explained 
above. In percentage terms our margin reduced to 64.0% (2016: 67.7%). This expected reduction in percentage has arisen partly due 
to the changing nature of the provision of some of our cloud infrastructure and partly due to the impact of the acquisition of Cristie.
The provision of Public Cloud solutions by our Cloud Services segment results in a charge from the Public Cloud service provider within 
our cost of sales. This is offset by savings in our costs for power, which is included within cost of sales, and some support services which 
are provided by the Public Cloud service provider, which is included within our overheads and depreciation. Whilst our gross margin 
percentage has reduced our adjusted profit before tax percentage margin has been maintained partly due to the offsetting savings 
when providing Public Cloud solutions.
The gross margin within our traditional private and hybrid cloud solutions continues to rise due to our relatively static datacentre costs 
which to some extent are fixed in nature and therefore do not rise in line with revenue growth.
Cristie predominantly sells hardware and software to its customers on which it incurs a substantial cost of sale and therefore a lower 
gross margin percentage contribution than in the other segments.
The gross margin within our Easyspace segment improved over the year due largely to the impact of the acquisition of United Hosting.
Adjusted EBITDA
The adjusted EBITDA for the year was £36.6m (2016: £32.3m) an increase of 13%. As expected, our adjusted EBITDA margin has 
reduced to 40.8% (2016: 42.4%). The Cloud Services segment increased its absolute level of margin over the period whilst experiencing 
a modest reduction in its percentage margin, the Easyspace segment increased both its absolute and percentage margin and the 
Non-recurring Revenue segment has a lower adjusted EBITDA contribution than the other segments which contributed to the overall 
adjusted EBITDA percentage margin reduction. 
Adjusted EBITDA in the Cloud Services segment was £33.7m (2016: £31.1m), an increase of 8.4%. This improved performance is mainly 
a direct result of the additional gross margin delivered by the increase in sales revenue, from both organic and acquired sources, offset 
by a modest increase in administrative expenses which has been helped by an exchange gain. In percentage terms the adjusted EBITDA 
Strategic Report 
Finance Director's Report
10 iomart Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
margin has reduced to 46.3% (2016: 47.5%). This reduction is due to the impact of the reduced gross margin percentage as previously 
explained together with the full year effect of SystemsUp which has a lower adjusted EBITDA margin than the rest of the segment’s 
operations but which, unlike the rest of the segment, has no depreciation charges. This was offset by administrative expenses rising at 
a slower rate than revenue which improved the segment’s EBITDA percentage margin.
The Easyspace segment’s adjusted EBITDA was £6.2m (2016: £5.1m) an increase of 22.6%. This improvement in adjusted EBITDA 
is almost entirely due to the full year impact of United Hosting which was acquired in the previous year. Excluding the acquisition, 
adjusted EBITDA increased slightly as a result of the increase in organic revenue. In percentage terms the adjusted EBITDA margin has 
improved to 47.1% (2016: 46.8%). Excluding the acquisition of United Hosting the Easyspace segment maintained its adjusted EBITDA 
percentage margin. The improvement in percentage margin is therefore entirely due to the impact of the previous year’s acquisition.
The Non-recurring segment’s adjusted EBITDA was £0.3m (2016: £nil). In percentage terms the adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.0%.
Group overheads, which are not allocated to segments, include the cost of the Board, the running costs of the headquarters in 
Glasgow, Group marketing, human resource, finance and design functions and legal and professional fees for the year. These overhead 
costs have reduced slightly to £3.6m (2016: £3.8m) mainly due to staff related costs.
Adjusted profit before tax
Depreciation charges of £11.0m (2016: £10.9m) have remained at the same level as previous years as a result of charges for the 
equipment bought to provide services to the additional Cloud Services segment customers being offset by equipment purchased in 
previous periods becoming fully depreciated and thereby no longer impacting the depreciation charge in the year.
The charge for amortisation of intangibles, excluding amortisation of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions (“amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets”) of £1.9m (2016: £1.2m) has increased over the year as a result of an increase in the level of software 
acquired over the year and the advance purchase of some software licences.
Finance income in the period was £nil (2016: £0.1m). Finance costs of £1.6m (2016: £1.4m), excluding the mark to market adjustment 
in respect of interest swaps on the Company’s loans, the interest charge on the contingent consideration due in respect of acquisitions 
and in the previous year the accelerated write off of arrangement fees on the restructuring of the bank facility, remained static over 
the period.
After deducting the charges for depreciation, amortisation, excluding the charges for the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, 
and finance costs, excluding the mark to market adjustment in respect of interest swaps on the Company’s loans, the interest charge 
on the contingent consideration due in respect of acquisitions and in the previous year the accelerated write off of arrangement fees 
on the restructuring of the bank facility, and crediting the finance income from the adjusted EBITDA, the Group’s adjusted profit before 
tax was £22.4m (2016: £19.0m) an increase of 18%.
The adjusted profit before tax margin for the year was 25.0% (2016: 24.9%). This modest margin improvement of 0.1% has two largely 
offsetting components. The adjusted EBITDA margin reduced by 1.6% as previously explained. Depreciation charges as a percentage 
of revenue have fallen by 2.0% partly due to tangible assets becoming fully depreciated, partly due to the provision of Public Cloud not 
incurring a depreciation charge and partly due to some of our activities not needing the purchase of tangible assets in the provision 
of their services. 
Profit before tax
The measure of adjusted profit before tax is a non-statutory measure which is commonly used to analyse the performance of 
companies particularly where M&A activity forms a significant part of their activities.
A reconciliation of adjusted profit before tax to reported profit before tax is shown below:

Strategic Report. Finance Director's Report
11 iomart Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Profit before tax (continued)
The adjusting items are: charges for the amortisation of acquired intangible assets of £5.6m (2016: £5.4m) which have increased slightly 
mainly as a result of the acquisitions made in the year and the full year effect of acquisitions made in previous years; acquisition costs 
of £0.1m (2016: £0.1m) as a result of acquisitions made; share based payment charges of £1.8m (2016: £1.1m) which have increased 
as a result of the award of share options in the year; a mark to market credit adjustment in respect of interest rate swaps on the 
Company’s loans of £0.08m (2016: £0.06m); the accelerated write off of arrangement fees on the restructuring of the bank facility 
during the  previous year of £nil (2016: £0.2m); the charge of interest, at the weighted average cost of capital rate of 15.5%, on the 
contingent consideration expected to be paid for the acquisition of United Hosting of £0.3m (2016: £0.2m); and in the previous period 
the gain on the revaluation of the contingent consideration to be paid for SystemsUp of £nil (2016: £0.9m). 
After deducting these items from the adjusted profit before tax; the reported profit before tax was £14.7m (2016: £13.0m) an increase 
of 13%. In percentage terms the profit before tax margin was 16% (2016: 17%). The reduction in percentage margin is for the same 
reasons as the adjusted profit before tax percentage margin change and also due to the gain on revaluation of contingent consideration 
recorded in the previous year which improved the percentage margin last year.
Taxation
There is a tax charge for the year of £2.6m (2016: £2.0m). The tax charge for the year is made up of a corporation tax charge of £4.4m 
(2016: £3.6m) with a deferred tax credit of £1.8m (2016: £1.6m). The effective rate of tax for the year is 17.5% (2016: 15.4%) and an 
explanation of this increase in given in note 9. At the year end, the Group has no unused tax losses available for offset against future 
profits (2016: £nil).
Profit for the year from total operations
After deducting the tax charge for the year from the profit before tax the Group has recorded a profit for the year from total operations 
of £12.1m (2016: £11.0m) an increase of 10% which has been significantly adversely affected by the gain on revaluation on contingent 
consideration recorded in the previous year.
Earnings per share
Adjusted diluted earnings per share, based on profit for the year attributed to ordinary shareholders before share based payment 
charges, amortisation charges of acquired intangible assets, mark to market adjustments in respect of interest rate swaps, the charge 
of interest on contingent consideration due, acquisition costs and in the previous year the accelerated write off of arrangement fees 
on the restructuring of the bank facility and the gain on the revaluation of the contingent consideration to be paid for SystemsUp and 
the tax effect of these items was 16.99p (2016: 14.44p), an increase of 18%.
The measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share as described above is a non-statutory measure which is commonly used to analyse 
the performance of companies particularly where M&A activity forms a significant part of their activities.
The calculation of both adjusted earnings per share and basic earnings per share is included at note 12.
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was 11.27p (2016: 10.32p), an increase of 9% which has been significantly 
adversely affected by the gain on contingent consideration recorded in the previous year.
Acquisitions
On 25 August 2016 the Company acquired the entire share capital of Cristie on a no debt, no cash, normalised working capital basis. At 
completion a payment of £3.8m in cash, including adjustments required in respect of normalised working capital, was made to acquire 
Cristie which at the time had net debt/cash of £3.1m resulting in a net outflow of funds of £0.7m to acquire the company.
After the end of the financial year, on 17 May 2017 we completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of Dediserve on a no 
debt, no cash, normalised working capital basis for a total purchase price of €7.9m. An initial payment was made at completion of 
€7.8m (£6.7m) in cash less the sum of €0.25m (£0.21m) in cash as an interim settlement of the expected amount due by the vendors 
in respect of the no debt, no cash, normalised working capital adjustment. The initial payment was funded by a draw down from the 
Group’s revolving credit facility. A further sum of €0.1m has been deferred and is due to be paid on the earlier of the completion of the 
handover of certain operational tasks or 6 months after the original purchase date. 
Dividends
We have proposed a 90% increase in the level of dividend pay-out for this year thereby raising the rate to 6.00p per share (2016: 3.15p). 
We have also committed to an improved pay-out ratio in the future based on the level of adjusted diluted earnings per share we deliver. 
The Board has taken the decision to increase the dividend return to shareholders as a result of the recurring revenue nature of the 
Group, the level of operating cash which we now deliver and the low level of indebtedness within the Group. We have continued with 
our acquisition activity having brought Cristie into the Group during the year and Dediserve post the year end and we are confident 
that we can make additional acquisitions in the future. The proposed change to dividends will have no impact on our ability to continue 
to make acquisitions of the like we have to date.

Cash flow and net debt
Net cash flows from operating activities
The Group continued to generate high levels of operating cash over the year. Cash flow from operations was £37.8m (2016: £30.9m) 
with the significant increase of 22% over the previous year’s level due to a combination of the increase in adjusted EBITDA and 
improvements in working capital management. After deducting payments for corporation tax of £3.9m (2016: £4.3m) the net cash flow 
from operating activities was £33.9m (2016: £26.6m).
Cash flow from investing activities
In line with our strategy of accelerating our growth by acquisition the Group continued to incur substantial sums on investing activities, 
spending a total of £15.2m (2016: £32.6m) in the year. Of this amount, £0.7m (2016: £15.9m), net of cash acquired of £3.1m (2016: 
£4.5m), was incurred in relation to the acquisition of Cristie as described above. In addition, the Group incurred expenditure of £1.16m 
(2016: £1.65m) in respect of contingent consideration due on acquisitions.
The Group continues to invest in property, plant and equipment through expenditure on datacentres and on equipment required to 
provide managed services to both its existing and new customers. As a result, the Group spent £10.2m (2016: £12.4m) on assets, net 
of related finance lease drawdowns, trade creditor movements and non-cash reinstatement provisions.
Expenditure was also incurred on development costs of £1.4m (2016: £1.1m), on intangible assets of £1.8m (2016: £1.2m) and on 
property lease deposits of £nil (2016: £0.3m).
Cash flow from financing activities
There were no drawdowns of the bank loan in the year (2016: £16.5m) to fund the purchase of the acquisitions. Bank loan repayments 
of £16.0m (2016: £3.5m) were made in the year. We received £1.1m (2016: £0.1m) from the issue of shares as a result of the exercise 
of options by employees. We also made a dividend payment of £3.4m (2016: £2.7m); incurred finance costs of £1.2m (2016: £1.5m); 
and made lease repayments of £0.6m (2016: £1.0m).  
Net cash flow
As a consequence, our overall cash expenditure during the year was £1.4m (2016: £2.0m cash generated) which resulted in cash and 
cash equivalent balances at the end of the year of £8.9m (2016: £10.3m). After recognising bank loans of £18.6m (2016: £34.5m) and 
finance lease obligations of £0.9m (2016: £1.4m) net debt balances at the end of the period stood at £10.6m (2016: £25.6m) a level the 
Board is comfortable with given the strong cash generation of the Group.
Exposure to credit and liquidity risks
Disclosures relating to our exposure to credit and liquidity risks are outlined in note 30.
Financial position
The Group is now in a position where it is generating substantial amounts of operating cash. The generation of that cash flow together 
with the committed bank loan facility for acquisitions and capital expenditure and finance lease facilities which are also available to 
fund capital expenditure, means that the Group has the liquidity it requires to continue its growth through both organic and acquisitive 
means.

Key performance indicator review
Revenue Growth 2017 2016
Revenue £89.6m £76.3m
Growth 17% increase 16% increase
Revenue from continuing operations grew by 17% over the year compared to a growth of 16% in the previous year. The Cloud 
Services segment grew revenues by 11% (2016: 19%) and the Easyspace segment grew by 22% (2016: 1%). The Non-recurring 
Revenue segment, which was created on the acquisition of Cristie on 25 August 2016, generated £3.6m (2016: £nil) of revenue 
which helped drive overall revenue growth.
Adjusted EBITDA Margin 2017 2016
Adjusted EBITDA £36.6m £32.3m
Adjusted EBITDA margin 41% 42%
The adjusted EBITDA has shown a 13% increase as a consequence of organic growth and acquisitions. In percentage terms 
there has been a modest decrease partly as a result of recent acquisitions and partly due to the change in the nature of the 
provision of some services from our Cloud Services segment. Easyspace improved its adjusted EBITDA percentage margin 
mainly due to the impact of an acquisition made in the previous year. The Non-recurring Revenue segment adjusted EBITDA 
margin of 9% contributed £0.3m (2016: £nil) to the absolute level of adjusted EBITDA growth.
Adjusted PBT Margin 2017 2016
Adjusted PBT £22.4m £19.0m
Adjusted PBT margin 25% 25%
The adjusted PBT has shown a 18% increase as a consequence of organic growth and acquisitions. The percentage margin 
has been maintained over the year.
Adjusted diluted EPS 2017 2016
Adjusted diluted EPS 16.99p 14.44p
Adjusted diluted EPS growth 18% 14%
Our dividend policy uses adjusted diluted EPS as its calculation basis. We have therefore added adjusted diluted EPS and in 
particular the growth of this measure as a KPI. The adjusted diluted EPS has shown a 18% increase as a consequence of organic 
growth and acquisitions. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
The board has established a formal process to identify risks and uncertainties through the production and maintenance of a 
risk register. There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which have been identified as a result of this process which 
could have a material impact on the Group’s future performance. These are not all the risks which the board has identified 
but those that the Directors currently consider to be the most material. In addition to these risks Note 30 contains details of 
financial risks.
Staff
As with any service organisation iomart is dependent on the skill, experience and commitment of its employees and 
especially a relatively small number of senior staff. The performance of the Group could be adversely affected if the required 
staffing levels are not maintained. The Group seeks to recruit and retain suitably skilled and experienced staff by offering 
a challenging and rewarding work environment. This includes competitive and innovative reward packages and a strong 
commitment to training and development.
Datacentre operation
Any downtime experienced at our datacentres would immediately have an impact on our ability to provide customers 
with the level of service they demand. Should the Group be unable to provide the required level of service this could have 
an adverse effect on the Group’s performance through the loss of customers and reputation. Our ongoing investment in 
preventative maintenance and lifecycle replacement programme ensures our datacentres continue to deliver operational 
efficiency and effectiveness.
Network
The service we provide to customers is dependent on the continued operation of our fibre network which connects our 
datacentre estate. Should the network fail there would be an adverse impact on customers. The Group has implemented a 
resilient network throughout its datacentre estate with no single points of failure to ensure the likelihood of network failure 
is minimised.

Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)
Data and Cyber Security
There has been a sharp rise in recent years in cyber and data related crime. The security of customer, commercial and 
personal data presents both a reputational and financial risk to the Group. Whilst it is a challenge to completely eliminate 
all data and cyber security risks the Group continues to make substantial investment in physical and data security systems 
and promote a culture within the organisation which embeds security across all of our operations. The Group also carries 
specific insurance in this regard.
Customers
The Group provides an essential service to an extensive client base many of whom rely on the provision of that service 
for their major internet presence. Any diminution in the level of service could have serious consequences for customer 
acquisition and retention. This risk is mitigated by the operation of our datacentres, the network and staffing as described 
above. Our high level of recurring revenue and our low level of customer attrition are evidence of our ability to provide the 
level of service required.
Key suppliers
The Group is dependent on certain key suppliers for the continued operation of its business, the most significant of which 
are those for electricity, bandwidth and servers. Were any of these key suppliers to fail in their service provision to the Group 
this could have an adverse effect on the Group’s ability to provide services to its customers. In all cases these supplies are 
obtained from reputable organisations chosen after a thorough selection process. After selection, the Group actively seeks 
to maintain good relationships with the chosen suppliers. The Group also seeks to maintain either several sources of supply 
or in the case of electricity alternative sources of power.
Search engine optimisation
A significant amount of the Group’s sales revenues are generated through consumers using internet search engines to 
acquire goods and services. Should the Group’s search engine optimisation performance deteriorate this could have an 
adverse effect on the revenue of the Group. The Group continually monitors the position of its websites with respect to 
these search engines. Through the allocation of experienced staff the Group seeks to maintain or enhance the position of 
its websites for detection by internet search engines.
Growth management
The Group is experiencing high levels of growth through both organic and acquisitive means. As a consequence we need 
to continue to evolve as an organisation to meet the demands that such growth places on our business operations. Failure 
to evolve in the necessary way could lead to deterioration in overall business performance. As part of our annual strategy 
and budget review process, which is updated as necessary throughout the year we identify the resource and organisational 
changes that are needed to support our growth. In addition a detailed integration and migration plan is produced for each 
acquisition that is made to ensure the acquired operation is successfully integrated into the Group’s operations.
Acquisitions
The Group has made several acquisitions over the last number of years and has a stated strategy to continue to make 
acquisitions. This produces three areas of risk:
•	 Acquisition target risk – We may not be able to identify suitable targets for acquisition. Through a combination of 
internal research and external relations we maintain an active pipeline of potential acquisition targets.  
•	 Acquisition integration risk – We may not integrate the acquired business into the Group in an effective manner and 
as a consequence could lose staff and customers of the acquired business. For each acquisition we prepare a detailed 
integration and migration plan which includes the participation of the vendor to ensure successful integration of the 
acquired business into the Group’s operations.
•	 Acquisition performance risk – The acquired business may not perform in line with expectations. As a consequence the 
expected financial performance of the operation may not be achieved with a resulting adverse effect on profits and 
cashflow. For each acquisition diligence and integration planning is undertaken and all potential synergies identified.

As the company is listed on the Alternative Investment Market it is not required to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) issued in September 2014. However, the Board is committed to ensuring that proper standards of 
corporate governance operate and has established governance procedures and policies that are considered appropriate to the nature 
and size of the Group. 
We do not comply with the Code. During the year the Board met with corporate governance advisers and reviewed trends in corporate 
governance, best practice where compliance with the Code was not required and its current corporate governance arrangements. 
We have reported on our Corporate Governance arrangements by drawing upon that review including those aspects of the Code 
we consider to be relevant to the Company. The Board considers that at this stage in the Group’s development the expense of fully 
complying with the Code is not appropriate.
The Board
The Code requires the Company to have an effective Board whose role is to develop strategy and provide leadership to the Company 
as a whole, as well as ensuring a framework of controls exist which allow for the identification, assessment and management of risk, 
ultimately taking collective responsibility for the success of the Company.
Through the leadership of the Chairman, the Board sets the Company’s strategic goals; ensuring obligations to shareholders are met. 
Matters reserved for a decision of the Board include approval of Group strategy, annual budgets and business plans, acquisitions, 
disposals, business development, annual reports, interim statements, and any significant funding and capital expenditure plans.
The Board meets regularly, usually monthly, to discuss and agree on the various matters brought before it, including the trading results. 
The Company has a highly committed and experienced Board, which is supported by a senior management team, with the qualification 
and experience necessary for the running of the Group.
In addition, there is regular communication between Executive and Non-Executive Directors, where appropriate, to update the Non-
Executive Directors on matters requiring attention prior to the next Board meeting. 
Role of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The Code requires that there should be a clear division of responsibilities between the running of the Board and the executive 
responsible for the Company’s business, so as to ensure that no one person has unrestricted powers of decision.
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting its agenda. Once strategic and 
financial objectives have been agreed by the Board, it is the Chief Executive Officer’s responsibility to ensure they are delivered upon. 
To facilitate this, the Chief Executive Officer chairs the Group’s Operations Boards which additionally comprises the other executive 
directors and, where appropriate, senior members of the management team. The day-to-day operation of the Group’s business is 
managed by these Boards.
The Chairman holds other directorships, as detailed in his biography on page 16. The Board has considered the time commitment 
required by his other roles and has concluded they do not detract from his chairmanship of the Company.
Composition of and Appointments to the Board
The Code requires that there should be a balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors and when appointing new Directors to the 
Board there should be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure.
The Board comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Finance Director and two independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Short biographies of the directors are given on page 16. 
All Non-Executive Directors serving at the year-end are considered to be independent. The Board does not consider the shareholdings 
of the Non-Executive Directors as detailed on page 25 to have any effect on their independence.
The Board is satisfied with this balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The Board considers that its composition 
is appropriate in view of the size and requirements of the Group’s business and the need to maintain a practical balance between 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
Each member of the Board brings different experience and skills to the Board and its various committees. The Board composition is 
kept under review as this mix of skills and business experience is a major contributing factor to the proper functioning of the Board, 
helping to ensure matters are fully debated and that no individual or group dominates the Board decision-making process.
When a new appointment to the Board is made, consideration is given to the particular skills, knowledge and experience that a 
potential new member could add to the existing Board composition. A formal process is then undertaken, which may involve external 
recruitment agencies, with appropriate consideration being given, in regards to Executive appointments, to internal and external 
candidates. Before undertaking the appointment of a Non-Executive Director, the Chairman establishes that the prospective Director 
can give the time and commitment necessary to fulfil their duties, in terms of availability both to prepare for and attend meetings and 
to discuss matters at other times.
Corporate Governance Report
17 iomart Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Information and Development
A further principle of the Code is that information of a sufficient quality is supplied to the Board in a timely manner. 
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that all the Directors continually update their skills, their knowledge and familiarity with the 
Group in order to fulfil their role on the Board and the Board’s Committees. Updates dealing with changes in legislation and regulation 
relevant to the Group’s business are provided to the Board by the Company Secretary/Finance Director and through the Board 
Committees.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring the 
Board procedures are properly complied with and that the discussions and decisions are appropriately minuted. Directors may seek 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in furtherance of their duties as Directors.
Training in matters relevant to their role on the Board is available to all Board Directors. New Directors are provided with an induction 
in order to introduce them to the operations and management of the business.
Performance Evaluation
The Code requires the Board to undertake a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance annually and that of its committees 
and individual Directors. 
During the year a formal evaluation was conducted by means of a detailed questionnaire which was completed by each Director. The 
results of this process were collated by the Chairman and discussed by the Board collectively. The evaluation included a review of 
the performance of individual Directors, including the Chairman, and the Board Committees. Based on this evaluation the Board has 
concluded that its performance in the past year has been satisfactory. 
Re-election
Under the Code, Directors should offer themselves for re-election at regular intervals and under the Company’s Articles of Association, 
at every Annual General Meeting, at least one third of the Directors who are subject to retirement by rotation, are required to retire 
and may be proposed for re-election. In addition, any Director who was last appointed or re-appointed three years or more prior to 
the AGM is required to retire from office and may be proposed for re-election. Such retirement will count in obtaining the number 
required to retire at the AGM. New Directors, who were not appointed at the previous AGM, automatically retire at their first AGM and, 
if eligible, can seek re-appointment.
Two Directors will retire from office at the Company’s forthcoming AGM and stand for re-appointment.
Board Committees
The Board has established two committees to deal with specific aspects of the Board’s affairs: Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
The Board has also established a Nominations Committee which is chaired by Ian Ritchie and includes Crawford Beveridge, Ian Steele 
and the Chief Executive Officer.

The Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee during the year were Ian Steele (Chairman from 24 August 2016 succeeding Chris 
Batterham who retired from the Board on 24 August 2016), Ian Ritchie and Crawford Beveridge.
The Audit Committee, chaired by Ian Steele, who has recent and relevant experience, is authorised by the Board to conduct 
any activity within its terms of reference and to seek any information it requires from any employee. The Audit Committee has 
written terms of reference, which are available on request, and include reviewing and monitoring:
•	 interim and annual reports, including consideration of the appropriateness of accounting policies;
•	 material assumptions and estimates adopted by management;
•	 developments in accounting and reporting requirements;
•	 external auditor’s plans for the year-end audit of the Company and its subsidiaries;
•	 the effectiveness of the Committee;
•	 the Risk Register covering the systems of internal control and their effectiveness, reporting and making recommendations 
to the Board on the results of the review and receiving regular updates on key risk areas of financial control;
•	 the performance and independence of the external auditor concluding in a recommendation to the Board on the 
reappointment of the auditor by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting;
•	 non-audit fees charged by the external auditor; and
•	 the formal engagement terms entered into with the external auditor.
At the invitation of the Committee, meetings are attended by the Chief Executive Officer, the Group Finance Director and the 
Group Financial Controller. Representatives of the external auditors, Grant Thornton, also attend each meeting. The Chairman 
of the Committee also meets separately with senior management and the external auditors.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee reports to the subsequent meeting of the Board on the Committee’s work and the Board 
receives a copy of the minutes of each meeting.
The Committee’s effectiveness is reviewed annually as part of the Board evaluation exercise.
Under its terms of reference, the Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the independence, objectivity and performance 
of the external auditors and for making a recommendation to the Board regarding the appointment of external auditors on an 
annual basis. The Group’s external auditors, Grant Thornton UK LLP, were first appointed as external auditors of the Group for 
the period ended 31 March 2005.
The auditors have confirmed to the Committee that in relation to their services to the Company they comply with UK regulatory 
and professional requirements, including Ethical Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board and that their objectivity is 
not compromised. 
The auditors are required each year to confirm in writing that they have complied with the independence rules of their 
profession and regulations governing independence. Before Grant Thornton takes on any engagement for other services from 
the Company careful consideration is given as to whether the project could conflict with their role as auditor or impair their 
independence.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Crawford Beveridge and its other members are Ian Ritchie and Ian Steele. It is 
normal for the Chief Executive Officer to be invited to attend meetings except where matters under review by the Committee 
relate to him.
The Committee has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the remuneration packages of the Executive 
Directors which includes:
•	 making recommendations to the Board on the Company’s policy on Directors’ remuneration and overseeing long term 
incentive plans (including share option schemes for all employees);
•	 ensuring remuneration is both appropriate to the level of responsibility and adequate to attract and/or retain Directors 
and staff of the calibre required by the Company; and
•	 ensuring that remuneration is in line with current industry practice.

Risk Management and Internal Control
The Directors, who are responsible for the Group’s system of risk management and internal control, have established systems 
to ensure that an appropriate level of oversight and control is provided. The systems are reviewed for effectiveness by the Audit 
Committee and the Board. The Group’s systems of risk management and internal control are designed to help the Company 
meet its business objectives by appropriately managing, rather than eliminating, the risks to those objectives. The controls 
can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. Executive Directors and senior 
management meet to review both the risks facing the business and the controls established to minimise those risks and their 
effectiveness in operation on an on-going basis. The aim of these reviews is to provide reasonable assurance that material risks 
and problems are identified and appropriate action taken at an early stage.
The Board confirms that procedures to identify, evaluate and manage the significant risks faced by the Group have been in place 
throughout the year and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report.
Financial Control
The annual financial plan is reviewed and approved by the Board. Financial results with comparisons to plan and forecast results 
are reported on monthly to the Board together with a report on operational achievements, objectives and issues encountered. 
Significant variances from plan are discussed at Board meetings and actions set in place to address them.
Approval levels for authorisation of expenditure are at set levels and cascaded through the management structure with any 
expenditure in excess of predefined levels requiring approval from the executive directors.
Relations with Shareholders
The Chief Executive Officer and Finance Director have, where appropriate, had regular dialogue with shareholders and analysts 
to discuss strategic and other issues including the Company’s financial results.
The Company engages in full and open communication with both institutional and private investors and responds promptly to 
all queries received. In conjunction with the Company’s brokers and other financial advisers all relevant news is distributed in a 
timely fashion through appropriate channels to ensure shareholders are able to access material information on the Company’s 
progress. The Company’s website has a section for investors, which contains all publicly available financial information and news 
on the Company.
Going Concern
The Directors, having made suitable enquiries and analysis of the accounts, consider that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in business for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. In making this assessment, the Directors have considered the Group budgets and the cash 
flow forecasts for the next two financial periods, and associated risks and the availability of bank and leasing facilities. The £60m 
revolving credit facility is available from Lloyds Banking Group plc until June 2019.
AIM Rule Compliance Report
iomart Group plc is quoted on AIM and as a result the Company has complied with AIM Rule 31 which requires the following:
•	 Have in place sufficient procedures, resources and controls to enable its compliance with the AIM Rules;
•	 Seek advice from its Nominated Advisor (“Nomad”) regarding its compliance with the Rules whenever appropriate and 
take that advice into account;
•	 Provide the Company’s Nomad with any information it reasonably requests in order for the Nomad to carry out its 
responsibilities under the AIM Rules for Nominated Advisors, including any proposed changes to the Board and 
Provision of draft notifications in advance;
•	 Ensure that each of the Company’s Directors accepts full responsibility, collectively and individually, for compliance with

Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year to March 2017
As the Company is listed on the Alternative Investment Market it is not required to comply with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2014 (“Code”) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. However, in framing its remuneration 
policy the committee has given consideration to the Code to ensure that the remuneration policy both reflects our strategy and 
is aligned with shareholders’ interests.
We have provided disclosures in addition to that which is required by AIM Rule 19 on a voluntary basis to enable shareholders to 
understand and consider our remuneration arrangements. In line with best practice, we will also voluntarily submit this report 
to an advisory shareholder vote at the annual general meeting.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee determines, on behalf of the board, the Group’s policy for executive remuneration and the 
individual remuneration packages for executive directors. In setting the Group’s remuneration policy, the remuneration 
committee considers a number of factors, including the following:
•	 salaries and benefits available to executive directors of comparable companies;
•	 the need to attract and retain executives of an appropriate calibre; and
•	 alignment with our overall strategy and the continued commitment of executives to the Group’s success through 
appropriate incentive schemes.
The committee is chaired by Crawford Beveridge.  Ian Ritchie, the Company’s non-executive Chairman and Ian Steele are also 
members of the Committee.  The CEO may attend meetings from time to time at the invitation of the committee and provide 
information and support as requested.  Directors are not present when their own remuneration is being discussed.
The committee normally meets at least twice per year and met two times during the current year.
Remuneration of executive directors
The remuneration packages of the executive directors comprise the following elements:

Opportunity Performance measures
Annual bonus
•	 The executive directors are 
eligible to receive an annual bonus 
dependent on Group and individual 
performance at the discretion of the 
remuneration committee. 
•	 Bonuses are normally paid in cash 
following the year end.
The maximum annual 
bonus opportunity is 
135% of base salary.
•	 The level of executive directors’ 
discretionary bonus payments 
is determined by a number of 
factors including the Group’s 
financial performance, its successful 
continuation of its organic and 
acquisitive strategy, its continual 
internal improvement programme and 
the individual’s own performance.
•	 For the bonus for the March 
2018 financial year the performance 
measures will be based primarily on 
Group adjusted EBITDA performance, 
with the above criteria taken into 
account by the Committee when 
determining payments.
•	 For achievement of target a bonus 
100% of salary is paid.  Executives only 
receive more than 100% of salary for 
performance well in excess of target.  
Bonuses reduce significantly if targets 
are not achieved with no bonuses 
payable if less than 90% of target is 
achieved.
Performance 
share plan
•	 The Group operates a performance 
share plan for executive directors 
and managers to reward, retain and 
incentivise those individuals who have 
made a major contribution to the 
Group and will continue to play a key 
role in helping the Group achieve its 
objectives in the future. 
•	 Awards are granted in the form of 
1p options.
•	 No share options awarded will vest 
any earlier than the third anniversary 
of the date of grant of the option.  
•	 Participants have 10 years from 
award to exercise awards
The maximum 
award under the 
performance share 
plan is 110% of base 
salary.
•	 The vesting of options is subject 
to the achievement of performance 
conditions and the executive 
continuing in employment with the 
group.
•	 Performance is assessed based on 
the achievement of profit targets in 
three years set with reference to our 
organic and acquisitive growth strategy.
•	 Options granted in April 2017 will 
vest based on Group adjusted EBITDA 
performance for the March 2020 
financial year to ensure continued 
focus on driving profit performance.

complexity. Our policy for the March 2018 financial year is to pay a fee of £40,000 per annum for Board Director duties with additional 
fees of £5,000 per annum paid to the Audit and Remuneration Committee chairman to reflect the additional time required to fulfil 
these roles.
The chairman receives a fee of £75,000 per annum.

Report of the board to the members on directors' remuneration
27 iomart Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
The directors present their annual report on the affairs of the Group, together with the financial statements and auditor’s report, for 
the year ended 31 March 2017.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources, bank loans and finance leases together with various items 
such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to 
provide finance for the Group’s operations. 
The Group has a £60m multi option revolving credit facility with Lloyds Banking Group plc. At the start of the year there was £34.5m 
outstanding on the multi option revolving credit facility and there were no drawdowns made from the facility during the year. 
Repayments totalling £16.0m were made resulting in a balance outstanding at the end of the year of £18.5m. 
The multi option revolving credit facility may be used by the Group to finance acquisitions, capital expenditure and for the issue of 
guarantees, bonds or indemnities. The facility is available until June 2019 at which point any advances made under the multi option 
revolving credit facility will become immediately repayable. In addition, each draw down made under this facility can be for either 3 or 
6 months and can either be repaid or continued at the end of the period. Interest is charged on this loan at an annual rate determined 
by the sum of the multi option revolving credit facility margin, LIBOR and the lender’s mandatory costs. The multi option revolving credit 
facility margin is fixed at 1.7% per annum and a non-utilisation fee of 40% of the multi option revolving credit facility margin is due on any 
undrawn portion of the full £60m multi option revolving credit facility. The effective interest rate for multi option revolving credit facility 
in the current year was 3.32% (2016: 3.17%).
The Group has exposure to movements in interest rates on its borrowings. The Group has entered into an interest rate swap in 
respect of £10m which has been drawn under the revolving credit facility from April 2015 which reduces by £2m every 6 months until 
October 2017 and as a consequence the interest rate on that amount of borrowing is fixed at 2.03% from April 2015 until maturity. As a 
consequence, at 31 March 2017, £2m of the amount drawn under the multi option revolving credit facility was covered by interest rate 
swap arrangements. The fair value of the interest rate swap contracts is estimated to be a gain of £84,000 (2016: £64,000) which has 
been recognised in profit or loss for the year.
The Group’s borrowings at 31 March 2017 comprise finance leases totalling £0.9m (2016: £1.4m) and bank facility usage totalling 
£18.5m (2016: £34.5m).  The interest rates on the finance leases are fixed for the term of the lease at between 9.3% and 11.5% and 
the average interest rate was 11.2% (2016: 9.9%). 
The Group has exposure to movements in the exchange rate of the US dollar as certain domain name purchases and licences are 
transacted in this currency. To protect cash flows against the level of exchange rate risk, the Group entered into forward exchange 
contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on the forecast payments. The majority of transactions of the parent company 
and the UK subsidiaries are in UK sterling and, with the exception of forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, the 
Group does not use derivative instruments. Additional information on financial instruments is included in Note 30.
Dividend
The directors have not declared an interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017 (2016: nil). The directors recommend a final 
dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017 of 6.00p per share (2016: 3.15p per share).  
Research and development
The Group develops cloud computing products including private cloud platforms, hybrid cloud platforms, virtual platforms, online 
backup and storage solutions and email related products.  
Post balance sheet events
On 17 May 2017 the Company acquired the entire share capital of Dediserve Limited. Further details of the acquisition have been 
given in note 31.
Future developments
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out

and abilities.  Appropriate training is arranged for disabled persons, including retraining for alternative work of employees who become

Directors' Report
29 iomart Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, and the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have to 
prepare the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed for the Group financial statements and whether United Kingdom Generally  
 Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable laws) have been followed for the Parent   
 Company financial statements, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will   
 continue in business.   
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Parent Company and

responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Parent Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors confirm that: 
•	 so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group and Parent Company’s auditor is   
 unaware; and
•	 the directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of any   
 relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Group's 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors' Responsibilities Statement

We have audited the Group financial statements of iomart Group Plc for the year ended 31 March 2017 which comprise the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of cash 
flows, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

Consolidated statement of changes in equity. Year ended 31March 2017
35 iomart Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
1.  GENERAL INFORMATION
iomart Group plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the 
United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address 
of the registered office is given on page 84 of this report. The 
nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are 
set out in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report.
The financial statements are presented in UK Pounds Sterling 
because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates.
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. The measurement bases and principal 
accounting policies of the Group are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all years presented 
unless otherwise stated.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 
year
There were no additional standards, amendments and 
interpretations that had a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements during the year. The following standards, 
amendments and interpretations were effective in the year but 
had no material impact on the Group’s financial statements:
•	 IAS 16 and IAS 38 - Amendments relating to Clarification
 of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation.
•	 IAS 27 - Amendments relating to Equity Method in Separate 
 Financial Statements.
•	 IFRS 9 – Financial instruments.
•	 IFRS 10 and IAS 28 - Amendments relating to Sale or 
 Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate 
 or Joint Venture.
•	 IFRS 11 - Amendments relating to Acquisitions of Interests in 
 Joint Operations.
•	 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 - 2014 cycle.
New standards and interpretations of existing standards 
that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early 
by the Group
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, becomes 
effective for the Group on 1 April 2018. The guidance permits 
two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior 
reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or 
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying 
the guidance recognised at the date of initial application (the 
cumulative catch-up transition method).  It is expected that the 
Group will adopt the cumulative catch-up transition method. 
The Group is currently performing a detailed analysis of the 
impact of IFRS 15 on all aspects of its business. The preliminary 
analysis has been substantially completed and the indications 
are that the vast majority of the Group’s current accounting 
policies as regards revenue recognition will not change as a 
result of the adoption of IFRS 15.
The review has identified some minor areas in which adjustments 
may be required in revenue and cost recognition and in the 
related procedures and processes.  The areas which are likely 
to be affected are in relation to set-up fees within the Cloud 
Services segment and revenue from domain registration within 
the Easyspace segment.
Cloud Services segment
Under IFRS 15 some set-up fees charged on contracts, 
which are currently recognised when the set-up is 
complete, will require to be spread over the life of the 
contract.
The impact of any changes, both individually and in 
aggregate are not expected to be material to the 
revenue or profits in any given financial year.
Easyspace segment 
The total revenue from the provision of domain names 
is currently recognised at the point of sale when the 
title to the domain name passes to the customer.  
Under IFRS 15 this revenue will require to be split 
between the registration of the domain and the 
ongoing services, such as support and mail forwarding, 
which are provided by the company over the period of 
registration of the domain.
As with the Cloud Services segment, the impact of any 
changes, both individually and in aggregate are not 
expected to be material to the revenue or profits in any 
given financial year.
Non-recurring segment 
The current accounting policies within the non-recurring 
segment comply fully with IFRS 15, and as such, no 
adjustments will be required.
IFRS 16 presents new requirements for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. The 
standard provides that lessees will be required to recognise 
assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 
months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. The 
standard was issued in January 2016 and applies to annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 but is yet 
to be endorsed by the EU. The Directors have not yet assessed 
the impact that this standard will have on the Group’s net asset 
position and are therefore not in a position to make a reliable 
estimate of the impact this revised standard will have on the 
Group’s accounting policies. The standard is expected to be 
applicable to the Group for the period beginning 1 April 2019.
Summary of Accounting Policies
Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the 
Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 
March 2017.  Under IFRS 10, control exists when an investor is 
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the investee. As each of the divisions 
within the Group are 100% wholly owned subsidiaries, the 
Group has full control over each of its investees.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and 
its subsidiaries are eliminated.  Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the asset transferred.  Amounts reported in the 
financial statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies 
adopted by the Group.
Notes to the financial statements. Year ended 31March 2017
36 iomart Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the acquisition 
method. The acquisition method involves the recognition at fair 
value of all identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent 
liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless of 
whether or not they were recorded in the financial statements 
of the subsidiary prior to acquisition.  On initial recognition, 
the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are included in the 
statement of financial position at their fair values, which are also 
used as the bases for subsequent measurement in accordance 
with the Group accounting policies.
Where the Group’s assessment of the net fair value of a 
subsidiary’s identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
is less than the fair value of the consideration including 
contingent consideration of the business combination then the 
excess is treated as goodwill. Where the Group’s assessment 
of the net fair value of a subsidiary’s net assets and liabilities 
exceeds the fair value of the consideration including contingent 
consideration of the business combination then the excess is 
recognised through profit or loss immediately.
Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable for the sale of services in the ordinary course of 
the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, 
returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within 
the Group.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue 
can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic 
benefits will flow from the transaction and specific criteria 
have been met for each of the Group’s activities as described 
below. The amount of revenue is not considered to be reliably 
measurable until all contingencies relating to the sale have been 
resolved. The Group bases its estimates on prior experience, 
taking into consideration the type of customer and the type of 
transaction.
Easyspace 
This operating segment provides domain name registration and 
hosting services.  Revenue from the provision of domain names 
is recognised at the point of sale when the title to the domain 
name passes to the customer.  Revenue from the provision of 
hosting services is recognised evenly over the period of the 
service and only after the service has been established.  Any 
unearned portion of revenue is included in payables as deferred 
revenue.
Cloud Services
This operating segment provides managed cloud computing 
facilities and services including consultancy.  Revenue from the 
sale of cloud computing facilities and managed services is spread 
evenly over the period of the agreement and only after the 
service has been established.  Any unearned portion of revenue 
is included in payables as deferred revenue. Consultancy 
services are generally provided on a “time and materials” basis 
and therefore revenue is recognised as these services are 
rendered.
Non-recurring
This operating segment provides data storage, backup and 
virtualisation solutions. Revenue from the supply of hardware or 
software, and the provision of services in respect of installation 
or training, is recognised when delivery and installation of 
the equipment is completed. Revenue from the sale of cloud 
computing facilities and support services is spread evenly over 
the period of the agreement and only after the service has been 
established.  Any unearned portion of revenue is included in 
payables as deferred revenue.
Interest
Interest is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective 
interest method.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation is capitalised in the 
consolidated statement of financial position and, subject to an 
annual impairment test, has an indefinite life. The carrying value 
of goodwill is cost less accumulated impairment losses and is 
allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment 
testing. The allocation is made to those cash generating units 
that are expected to benefit from the business combination. 
Impairment reviews are carried out by the Board at least 
annually. Impairments to goodwill are charged to profit or loss 
in the period in which they arise.
Customer relationships
Customer relationships are recognised only on acquisition. 
The fair value is derived based on discounted cash flows from 
estimated recurring revenue streams. The carrying value is 
stated at fair value at acquisition less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses. The useful economic life is assessed for 
each acquisition separately. Amortisation is charged over the 
useful life of the relationships in proportion to the estimated 
future cash flows, a period which is generally between five and 
eight years.
Research and development
Expenditure on research (or the research phase of an 
internal project) is recognised as an expense in the period 
in which it is incurred. Development costs incurred are 
capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
•	 completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so 
 that it will be available for use or sale
•	 the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use 
 or sell it
•	 the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset
•	 the intangible asset will generate probable future economic 
 benefits
•	 there are adequate technical, financial and other resources 
 to complete the development and to use or sell the 
 intangible asset, and
•	 the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its 
 development can be measured reliably.
 
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation 
are expensed as incurred. The costs which do meet the criteria 
range from new product development to the enhancement 
of existing services such as mail platforms. The scope of the 
development team’s work continues to evolve as the Group 
continues to deliver business critical solutions to a growing 
customer base. Development costs capitalised are amortised on 
a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. 
The estimated useful life is deemed to be three years for all 
developments capitalised. Amortisation charges are recognised 
through profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Notes to the financial statements. Year ended 31March 2017
37 iomart Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
 
Software
Software is recognised at cost on purchase and amortised on a 
straight-line basis over its useful economic life, which does not 
generally exceed five years.
Acquisition costs 
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, costs 
incurred on professional fees during an acquisition are not 
included in the overall cost of the investment in the acquired 
business. Consequently, these acquisition costs are included 
as Administrative Expenses in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. In addition, the costs associated with 
integrating the acquired businesses into the Group are also 
included in this category. The combination of both these types 
of expenses is also shown in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as acquisition costs.
Non-Statutory Profit Measures
In addition to measuring financial performance of the Group 
based on statutory profit measures, the Group also measures 
performance based on adjusted EBITDA, adjusted profit before 
tax and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Adjusted EBITDA 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) before share based 
payment charges, acquisition costs and any gains or losses on 
the revaluation of contingent consideration. Adjusted EBITDA is 
a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate 
the operating financial performance of companies, particularly in 
the sector that the Group operates.
The Group considers adjusted EBITDA to be a useful measure of 
operating performance because it approximates the underlying 
operating cash flow by eliminating the charges mentioned 
above. It is not a direct measure of liquidity, which is shown in 
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and needs to be 
considered in the context of the Group’s financial commitments.
Adjusted Profit before Tax
Adjusted profit before tax is defined as profit before tax adjusted 
for the following:
•	 amortisation charges on acquired intangible assets;
•	 share based payment charges;
•	 mark to market adjustments in respect of interest rate 
 swaps;
•	 where bank facilities are restructured during the year any 
 accelerated write off of arrangement fees; and
•	 M&A activity including:
- Professional fees;
- Any non-recurring integration costs
- Any gain or loss on the revaluation of contingent 
 consideration
- Any interest charge on contingent consideration
Adjusted profit before tax is a common measure used by 
investors and analysts to evaluate the financial performance of 
companies, particularly in the sector that the Group operates, 
where M&A activity forms a significant part its activities.
The Group considers adjusted profit before tax to be a useful 
measure of performance because it eliminates the impact of 
certain non-recurring items associated with acquisitions and 
other charges commonly excluded from profit before tax by 
investors and analysts for valuation purposes.
Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking 
the adjusted profit before tax as described after deducting an 
appropriate taxation charge and dividing by the total weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year and 
adjusting for the dilutive potential ordinary shares relating to 
share options. 
The Group considers adjusted diluted earnings per share to 
be a useful measure of performance for the same reasons as 
adjusted profit before tax. In addition it is used as the basis for 
dividend payments.
Contingent consideration 
Where an acquisition involves a potential payment of contingent 
consideration the estimate of any such payment is based on its 
fair value. To estimate the fair value an assessment is made as 
to the amount of contingent consideration which is likely to be 
paid having regard to the criteria on which any sum due will be 
calculated and is probability based to reflect the likelihood of 
different amounts being paid. Where a change is made to the fair 
value of contingent consideration within the initial measurement 
period as a result of additional information obtained on facts and 
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date then this is 
accounted for as a change in goodwill. Where changes are made 
to the fair value of contingent consideration as a result of events 
that occurred after the acquisition date then the adjustment is 
accounted for as a charge or credit to profit or loss.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Leasehold 
property is included in property, plant and equipment only 
where it is held under a finance lease.  
Disposal of assets 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined 
as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.  
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of all property, 
plant and equipment to the expected residual value by equal 
annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives.  
All items of plant and equipment have immaterial residual 
values.  The rates generally applicable are:
Freehold property
Between 2.00% and 3.33% 
per annum
Leasehold improvements Between 6% and 10% per annum
Computer equipment Between 20% and 50% per annum
Office equipment Between 10% and 25% per annum
Datacentre equipment Between 6% and 10% per annum
Motor vehicles 25% per annum
Land Not depreciated
Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets 
and property, plant and equipment
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped 
at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows (cash-generating units).  As a result, some assets 
are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at 
cash-generating unit level.  Goodwill is allocated to those cash-
generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of 
the related business combination and represent the lowest level 
within the Group at which management monitors goodwill.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Goodwill, other individual assets or cash-generating units that 
include goodwill, and those intangible assets not yet available 
for use are tested for impairment at least annually.  All 
other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount.  The recoverable amount is the higher of 
fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value 
in use based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation. 
Management estimate expected future cash flows from each 
cash generating unit and determine a suitable interest rate to 
calculate the present value of the future cash flows. Discount 
factors are determined for each cash generating unit to reflect 
the underlying risks involved. The future cash flows used in the 
calculation are based on the Group’s latest approved budget.
 
Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to 
which goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the 
carrying amount of goodwill.  Any remaining impairment loss 
is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash generating 
unit.  With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently 
reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously 
recognised may no longer exist.
Details of the key assumptions and judgements are shown in 
note 13.
Leased assets 
In accordance with IAS  17 Leases, the economic ownership 
of a leased asset is deemed to have been transferred to the 
Group (the lessee) if the Group bears substantially all the risks 
and rewards related to the ownership of the leased asset.  The 
related asset is recognised at the time of inception of the lease 
at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present 
value of the minimum lease payments plus incidental payments, 
if any, to be borne by the lessee.  A corresponding amount is 
recognised as a finance lease liability.  
The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant 
proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to 
profit or loss over the period of the lease.  
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the 
payments made under them are charged to profit or loss on 
a straight line basis over the lease term.  Lease incentives are 
spread over the term of the lease. Where a lease is for land and 
buildings, these are considered separately as to whether there 
is a finance lease within the lease.
Lease deposits 
Rental and re-instatement deposits for leasehold premises are 
included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as 
either non-current assets or current assets depending on the 
length of time to maturity. Where lease deposits are interest 
earning the amount of deposit is not discounted and where they 
are not interest earning they are discounted at an appropriate 
rate.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially stated at fair value after deduction 
of any issue costs. The carrying amount is increased by the 
finance costs in respect of the accounting period and reduced 
by payments made in the period. Borrowings are subsequently 
stated at amortised cost, any difference between the periods 
(net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised 
through profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using 
the effective interest method.  Where borrowings are repaid 
early and new loan facilities agreed the terms of each loan 
facility are compared. Where the terms of the new borrowings 
are significantly different from those of the previous borrowings, 
the previous borrowings are treated as extinguished rather than 
modified as prescribed under IAS 39.
Reinstatement costs 
The Group has made alterations to properties which it occupies 
under lease arrangements. These lease arrangements contain 
provision for reinstatement of the property to its original 
condition at the Group’s cost at the end of the lease should the 
landlord require that to happen. In respect of property leases 
which contain such a reinstatement provision the estimated 
cost of the reinstatement is provided in the financial statements. 
The discounted value of the expected cost of reinstatement is 
recorded as a leasehold improvement within property, plant 
and equipment and is then depreciated over the remaining 
term of the lease. A matching provision is recognised at the 
same time which is increased over the period of the lease by 
way of an interest charge such that the estimated cost of the 
reinstatement has been fully provided at the end of the lease 
period.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions 
are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected 
to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in 
the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest 
expense.
Income taxes
The tax expense recognised in profit or loss comprises the 
sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable 
profit for the year. Deferred income taxes are calculated using 
the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax 
is generally provided on the difference between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  However, 
deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, 
nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the 
related transaction is a business combination or affects tax 
or accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary differences 
associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal 
of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group 
and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable 
future. In addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as 
well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for 
recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that the underlying deductible temporary differences 
will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current 
and deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates 
and laws that are expected to apply to their respective period of 
realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted 
at the period end.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a 
component of tax expense in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, except where they relate to items that are recognised 
directly in other comprehensive income or equity (such as share 
based remuneration) in which case the related deferred tax is also 
recognised in other comprehensive income or equity accordingly.
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.  Financial 
assets other than those categorised as at fair value through profit 
or loss are recognised at fair value plus transaction costs on initial 
recognition.  Financial assets categorised as at fair value through 
profit or loss are recognised initially at fair value with transaction 
costs expensed through profit or loss.
All income and expenses relating to financial assets that are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are 
presented within ‘finance costs’ or ‘finance income’ except for 
impairment of trade receivables which is presented within 
‘administrative expenses’.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market.  Loans and receivables are measured subsequent to 
initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment.  Discounting is omitted 
where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group’s cash 
and cash equivalents, trade and most other receivables fall into 
this category of financial instruments.
Provision against trade and other receivables is made when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of 
those receivables.  The amount of the write-down is determined 
as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows. An assessment for 
impairment is undertaken at least at each reporting date.
Financial derivatives such as forward foreign exchange contracts 
and interest rate swaps are carried at fair value through profit or 
loss subsequent to initial recognition.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial 
assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.  Financial 
liabilities categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are 
recorded initially at fair value, all transaction costs are recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.  All other financial liabilities are 
recorded initially at fair value, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities categorised as at fair value through profit 
or loss are re-measured at each reporting date at fair value, 
with changes in fair value being recognised through profit or 
loss.  All other financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, with interest-related charges 
recognised as an expense in finance costs through profit or loss.  
A financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is 
extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged, cancelled 
or when it expires. Finance charges, including premiums payable 
on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged 
to profit or loss on an accruals basis using the effective interest 
method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument 
to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they 
arise.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at 
the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the period end are 
retranslated at the rates ruling at that date. Any gains or losses 
arising on assets and liabilities between the date of recording 
and the date of settlement are treated as gains or losses through 
profit or loss. Forward foreign exchange contracts used to hedge 
the Group’s exposure to foreign currency transactions are fair 
valued at the balance date and the gain or loss is recognised 
through profit or loss for the period.
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
•	 assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position 
 presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of the 
 statement of financial position;
•	 income and expenses for each income statement are 
 translated at average exchange rates; and
•	 all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate 
 component of equity in the foreign currency translation 
 reserve.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand 
deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash with 
maturities of three months or less from inception and which are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Dividends
Dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included 
in the financial statements within ‘other short term financial 
liabilities’ when a final dividend is approved in a general meeting.  
Interim dividend distributions to equity shareholders approved by 
the Board are not included in the financial statements until paid.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
•	 “Share capital” represents the nominal value of equity shares.
•	 “Own shares Treasury” represents the amount of the 
 Company’s own equity shares, plus attributable transaction 
 costs, that is held by the Company as treasury shares.
•	 “Own shares EBT” represents the amount of the Company’s 
 own equity shares, plus attributable transaction costs, that 
 is held by the Company within the iomart Group plc Employee 
 Benefit Trust. 
•	 “Share premium” represents the excess over nominal value of 
 the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net 
 of expenses of the share issue.
•	 “Merger reserve” represents the excess over nominal value 
 of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, 
 net of expenses of the share issue, when ordinary share 
 capital is included in the consideration for business 
 acquisitions.
•	 “Capital redemption reserve” represents set aside reserves in 
 relation to previous redemption of own shares.
•	 “Foreign currency translation reserve” represents all exchange 
 differences on the translation of the results and financial 
 position of Group entities that have a functional currency 
 different from the presentation currency.
•	 “Retained earnings” represents retained profits.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Employee benefits - pensions
The Group contributes to an auto-enrolment pension scheme 
and also to a number of personal pension schemes on behalf of 
executive directors and some senior employees.  The pension 
costs charged against operating profit are the contributions 
payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
Share-based payment 
The Group operates equity-settled share-based remuneration 
plans for its employees. All goods and services received in 
exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured 
at their fair values.  Where employees are rewarded using 
share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services 
are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the 
instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised 
at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
All share-based remuneration plans are ultimately recognised as 
an expense through profit or loss with a corresponding credit to 
‘retained earnings’.  
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, 
the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the 
best available estimate of the number of share options expected 
to vest.   Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any 
indication that the number of share based incentives expected 
to vest differs from previous estimates. The two main vesting 
conditions that apply to share options relate to the achievement 
of annual objectives and continuous employment. Any cumulative 
adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period.  No 
adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if 
share based incentives ultimately exercised are different to that 
estimated on vesting.
Upon exercise of share based incentives the proceeds received 
net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital, 
and where appropriate share premium.
Segmental reporting
The Group provides segmental reporting on a basis consistent 
with the provision of internal financial information used for 
decision making purposes by the Chief Operating Decision Maker. 
Internal reports are produced on a basis consistent with the 
accounting policies adopted in the Group’s financial statements.
The Group calculates geographical information on the basis of the 
location of the customer.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Strategic Report on pages 7 to 15. The financial position of 
the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are described in the Finance Director’s Report on pages 7 to 10.  
 
In addition, Note 30 to the financial statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk. As described in note 22 the Group has 
a £60m multi option revolving credit facility with Lloyds Banking 
Group of which £18.5m is drawn down at the year end and 
which is available until June 2019. The net debt balances at the 
end of the period stood at £10.6m (2016: £25.6m) a level which 
the Board is comfortable with given the strong cash generation 
of the Group. The Group has considerable financial resources 
together with long-term contracts with a number of customers 
and suppliers across different geographic areas and industries. As 
a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed 
to manage its business risks.
 
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial 
statements.
Key judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the period end, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group is required to make a judgement as to whether there 
is any impairment of goodwill. This requires an estimation of 
the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill 
has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the 
entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from 
the cash-generating unit and to select a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate the present value. Full details of the 
assumptions used in the calculation are disclosed in note 13.
Valuation of intangible assets and fair value adjustments on 
acquisition
As the Group continues to implement its acquisition strategy 
there is a requirement to fair value the assets and liabilities of 
any business acquired during the year. The Group is required to 
make a judgement as to what intangible assets exist within the 
acquired business at the time of the acquisition and what fair 
value adjustments are required. When reviewing the existence 
of intangible assets consideration has been given to potential 
intangible assets such as customer relationships and brand. The 
estimation of the valuation of customer relationships is based 
on the value in use calculation which requires estimates of the 
future cash flows expected to arise from the existing customer 
relationships over their useful life and to select a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate the present value. Full 
details of the assumptions used in the calculation of intangible 
assets and fair value adjustments on the acquisitions that have 
occurred during the current year are disclosed in note 11.
Reinstatement provisions 
The Group is required to make a judgement as to whether any 
reinstatement of buildings held under leases is required. For 
each lease, on an annual basis, the Directors assess the cost of 
restoring leasehold premises to their original condition at the 
end of the lease. These estimates are based on information 
provided by external advisors, the initial cost of the leasehold 
improvements and inflation rates and discount rates until the 
end of the lease. The reinstatement provision required at the 
end of the current year is shown in note 23.
Contingent consideration
Where an acquisition involves a potential payment of contingent 
consideration the Group is required to make a judgement as 
to whether any contingent consideration payment is likely. If 
it is then an estimate of any such payment is based on its fair 
value. To estimate the fair value an assessment is made as to 
the amount of contingent consideration which is likely to be 
paid having regard to the criteria on which any sum due will be 
calculated and is probability based to reflect the likelihood of 
different amounts being paid.

3. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the Company. The Group has three 
operating segments and the CEO reviews the Group’s internal reporting which recognises these three segments in order to assess 
performance and to allocate resources. The Group has determined its reportable segments which are also its operating segments 
based on these reports.
The Group currently has three operating and reportable segments. In the previous year there were only two segments. During the year 
the Group acquired Cristie Data. Unlike the other operations in the Group, Cristie Data has largely non-recurring revenue and therefore 
this has been included in a separate segment.
•	 Easyspace – this segment provides a range of shared hosting and domain registration services to micro and SME companies. 
•	 Cloud Services – this segment provides managed cloud computing facilities and services, through a network of owned datacentres, 
 to the larger SME and corporate markets. The segment uses several routes to market including iomart Cloud, RapidSwitch, 
 Redstation, Backup Technology and SystemsUp.
•	 Non-recurring – this segment provides data storage, backup and virtualisation solutions across a range of sectors, from SMEs to 
 large enterprises, encompassing both public and private sector.
Information regarding the operation of the reportable segments is included below. The CEO assesses the performance of the 
operating segments based on revenue and a measure of Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) 
before any allocation of Group overheads, charges for share based payments, costs associated with acquisitions and any gain or loss 
on revaluation of contingent consideration. This segment EBITDA is used to measure performance as the CEO believes that such 
information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the segment. 
The Group’s EBITDA for the year has been calculated after deducting Group overheads from the EBITDA of the three segments as 
reported internally. Group overheads include the cost of the Board, all the costs of running the premises in Glasgow, the Group 
marketing, human resource, finance and design functions and legal and professional fees.
The segment information is prepared using accounting policies consistent with those of the Group as a whole.  
The assets and liabilities of the Group are not reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker on a segment basis. Therefore none of 
the Group’s assets and liabilities are segmental assets and liabilities and are all unallocated for segmental disclosure purposes. For that 
reason the Group has not disclosed details of segmental assets and liabilities.
All segments are continuing operations. No customer accounts for 10% or more of external revenues. Inter-segment transactions are 
accounted for using an arms-length commercial basis.

Taxation charge for the year 2,571 2,005
The weighted average applicable tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2017 was 20% (2016: 20%). The total current corporation tax 
charge for the year of £4,349,000 (2016: £3,663,000) on operations represents 29.7% (2016: 28.1%) of the Group profit before tax of 
£14,654,000 (2016: £13,024,000). The effective rate of tax for the year, based on the taxation charge for the year as a percentage of 
the profit before tax, is 17.5% (2016: 15.4%). The increase of 2.1% is mainly due to the reduction in future corporation rates which has 
had an adverse impact on the deferred tax charge relating to our deferred tax assets, a prior year adjustment in deferred tax relating 
to the lower availability of capital allowances than previously anticipated and the absence of non-taxable income in the year when in 
the previous year the gain on the revaluation of contingent consideration was non-taxable. This has been partially offset by a prior year 
adjustment in deferred tax relating to share based payments and the absence of a deferred tax charge relating to development costs 
in the current year following the initial recognition of a deferred tax liability in the prior year. 
A number of changes to the UK Corporation tax system were announced in the March 2016 Budget Statement with the main rate 
of corporation tax reduced from 18% to 17% from 1 April 2020. These changes were substantively enacted at the period end and 
therefore are included in these financial statements.

The deferred tax asset in relation to share based remuneration arises from the anticipated future tax relief on the exercise of share 
options.
The deferred tax on capital allowances temporary differences arises mainly from plant and equipment in the Cloud Services segment 
where the tax written down value varies from the net book value.
The deferred tax on development costs arises from development expenditure on which tax relief is received in advance of the 
amortisation charge.
 
The deferred tax on acquired assets arises from datacentre equipment acquired through the acquisition of iomart Datacentres Limited 
on which depreciation is charged but on which there are no capital allowances available.
The deferred tax on customer relationships arises from temporary differences on acquired intangible assets.

11. ACQUISITIONS
Cristie Data Limited
The Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Cristie Data Limited (“Cristie”) on 25 August 2016.
Cristie is a Stroud based data storage, backup and virtualisation solutions provider, which has operated across all sectors of industry 
from SMEs to large enterprises, and public sector to private sector for over 40 years.  Cristie is particularly active in the education and 
health sectors, which offers the opportunity for the Group to increase its presence in these areas.  The acquisition is in line with the 
Group’s strategy to grow its operations both organically and by acquisition.
During the current period the Group incurred £99,000 of third party acquisition related costs in respect of this acquisition. These 
expenses are included in administrative expenses in the Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 
31 March 2017.  
The following table summarises the consideration to acquire Cristie and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed at the acquisition date and are final:
  £’000
Recognised amounts of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed:
Cash and cash equivalents 3,104
Trade and other receivables 2,226
Property, plant and equipment 206
Intangible assets 982
Trade and other payables (3,358)
Current borrowings (25)
Current income tax liabilities (33)
Deferred tax liability (200)
Identifiable net assets 2,902
Goodwill 877
Total consideration 3,779
Satisfied by:
Cash – paid on acquisition 3,779
Total consideration to be transferred 3,779
The agreed purchase price for the shares, on a cash-free, debt-free, normalised working capital basis was £1,250,000.   On the date of 
the acquisition a payment of £3,779,000 was made in cash, including an amount of £2,529,000 in settlement in respect of the additional 
debt assumed, cash acquired and normalised working capital position of Cristie at completion.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Cristie is attributable to the premium payable for a pre-existing, well positioned business 
and the specialised, industry specific knowledge of the management and staff, together with the benefits to the Group in merging 
the business with its existing infrastructure and the anticipated future operating synergies from the combination.  The goodwill is not 
expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The name Cristie Data is not actively advertised or promoted, with the majority of Cristie’s business being generated from existing 
customers, by word of mouth or from attendance at trade exhibitions.  Cristie’s privacy policy includes a commitment not to sell, 
distribute or lease any personal information it holds on customers unless the customer’s permission is given.  As a consequence there 
is no significant value in either the trade name/brand or customer lists acquired at the acquisition date and therefore no value has 
been attributed to either intangible asset.

11. ACQUISITIONS (CONTINUED)
Cristie Data Limited (continued)
The fair value included in respect of the acquired customer relationships intangible asset is £982,000.
To estimate the fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset, a discounted cash flow method, specifically the income 
approach, was used with reference to the directors’ estimates of the level of revenue which will be generated from them. A post-tax 
discount rate of 11.22% was used for the valuation. Customer relationships are being amortised over an estimated useful life of 5 years. 
The fair value of the financial assets acquired includes trade receivables with a fair value of £496,000. The gross amount due under 
contracts is £500,000 of which £4,000 are expected to be uncollectable.
Provisional fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill, were reported in the interim report for the 6 months 
ended 30 September 2016.  Following a detailed review of Cristie’s accounting policies in respect of revenue recognition, the policy 
relating to the sale of third party maintenance and support contracts was changed to defer the revenue over the life of the contract, in 
compliance with FRS 101, rather than recognising it in full when the sale was completed.  The treatment of the cost of purchasing the 
third party maintenance and support contracts, which was previously expensed in full when paid, has also been changed to spread the 
costs over the life of the contract, with the deferred element of the cost being included in receivables.
These adjustments have been reflected in the table of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed with trade and other payables being 
increased by £1,997,000, offset by an increase of £1,655,000 in trade and other receivables, and a reduction in current income tax 
liabilities of £66,000, to give an increase in goodwill of £276,000.
The fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill, are now final.
Cristie earned revenue of £3,639,000 and generated profits, before allocation of group overheads, share based payments and tax, of 
£235,000 in the period since acquisition.
United Communications Limited
The fair values of acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill, previously disclosed as provisional for United Communications 
Limited have been finalised in the current period with no changes to the fair values disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts 2016.

Of the total additions in the year of £1,670,000 (2016: £1,020,000), £122,000 (2016: £297,000) was included in trade payables as unpaid 
invoices at the year end resulting in a net cash outflow of £175,000 (2016: net cash outflow £187,000) in trade payables. Consequently, 
the consolidated statement of cash flows discloses a figure of £1,845,000 (2016: £1,207,000) as the cash outflow in respect of intangible 
asset additions in the year.
All amortisation and impairment charges are included in the depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non-financial assets 
classification, which is disclosed as administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Included within customer relationships are the following significant items: customer relationships in relation to the acquisitions of 
Backup Technology with a net book value of £4.1m and a remaining useful life of 5 years; United Hosting with a net book value of £4.3m 
and a remaining useful life of 7 years; Melbourne Server Hosting with a net book value of £2.0m and a remaining useful life of 4 years; 
and ServerSpace with a net book value of £1.7m and remaining useful life of 6 years.
During the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”. No impairment charges (2016: 
£nil) arose as a result of this review. For this review goodwill was allocated to individual Cash Generating Units (CGU) on the basis of 
the Group’s operations. The goodwill acquired in the Cristie Data acquisition has been allocated to the Non-recurring CGU as this is 
the CGU expected to benefit from the business combination. 
Notes to the financial statements. Year ended 31March 2017

13. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)
The carrying value of goodwill by each CGU is as follows: 
Cash Generating Units (CGU)
2017
£’000
2016
£’000
Easyspace 23,210 23,210
Cloud Services 37,913 37,913
Non-recurring 877 -
62,000 61,123
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow 
projections based on financial budgets approved by the Board covering a two-year period. These projections are the result of detailed 
planning and assume similar levels of organic growth as the Group has experienced in the previous year unless there is a reason to 
alter historic growth rates and also full year contributions from acquisitions. 
The growth rates and margins used to extrapolate estimated future performance in the 3 years after the initial 2 year period continue 
to be based on past growth performance adjusted downwards to take into account the additional risk due to the passage of time. The 
growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates. The growth rates used to 
estimate future performance beyond the periods covered by the annual and strategic planning processes do not exceed the long-term 
average growth rates for similar products.
The assumptions used for the CGU included within the impairment reviews are as follows:
Easyspace
Cloud 
Services
Non-
recurring
Discount rate 13% 12% 14%
Average growth rate in years 3 to 5 2.5% 3.4% 2.5%
Future perpetuity rate 2.0% 2.0% 2.0%
Initial period for which cash flows are estimated (years) 2 2 2
Based on an analysis of the impairment calculation’s sensitivities to changes in key parameters (growth rate, discount rate and pre-tax 
cash flow projections) there was no reasonably possible scenario where the CGU’s recoverable amount would fall below its carrying 
amount. 
14. LEASE DEPOSITS 
The lease deposits of £2,760,000 (2016: £2,760,000) are made up of a rental deposit of £784,000 (2016: £784,000) and a reinstatement 
deposit of £1,976,000 (2016 £1,976,000). The rental and reinstatement deposits are due to be repaid at the end of the lease which at 
the earliest is July 2020. 
The Group is due to receive interest on the lease deposits at the prevailing market rate and therefore they have not been discounted.

The net book value of computer equipment held under finance lease at 31 March 2017 was £546,000 (2016: £930,000) and the net 
book value of datacentre equipment held under finance lease at 31 March 2017 was £456,000 (2016: £536,000).
Of the total additions in the year of £9,690,000 (2016: £11,883,000), none (2016: £97,000) were funded by finance leases and £1,256,000 
(2016: £1,755,000) was included in trade payables as unpaid invoices at the year end resulting in a net decrease of £499,000 (2016: 
net decrease of £599,000) in trade payables. Consequently, the consolidated statement of cash flows discloses a figure of £10,189,000 
(2016: £12,385,000) as the cash outflow in respect of property, plant and equipment additions in the year.

Prepayments 7,889 5,819
Accrued income 602 414
Trade and other receivables       15,080 13,718
The carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value, which has been calculated based on expectations 
of debt recovery from historic performances feeding into impairment provision calculations. Some of the higher value trade receivables 
in the Cloud Services segment are reviewed individually for impairment and judgement made as to any likely impairment based on 
historic trends and the latest communication with specific customers. 
The balance of trade receivables in the Group are individually small in terms of value, so are considered for impairment by business unit 
specific provision calculations and are not individually impaired.
To consider the total exposure to credit risks, the Group uses figures net of VAT. At 31 March 2017, £4,118,000 (2016: £4,460,000) of 
net trade receivables were fully performing. Net trade receivables of £1,918,000 (2016: £2,406,000) were past due, but not impaired. 
The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due or impaired can be assessed by reference to the customer type. Trade 
receivables consist of a large number of customers in various industries and geographical areas. The Group is not exposed to any 
significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics. The aging below 
shows that almost all are less than three months old and historic performance indicates a high probability of payment for debts in this 
aging. Those over three months relate to customers without history of default for which there is a reasonable expectation of recovery.

The effective interest rate earned on short term deposits was 0.33% (2016: 0.50%).

The Group in its ordinary course of business enters into hire purchase and finance lease agreements to fund or re-finance the purchase 
of computer equipment and software. The lease agreements are typically for periods of 2 to 3 years and do not have contingent rent 
or escalation clauses. The agreements have industry standard terms and do not contain any restrictions on dividends, additional debt 
or further leasing.
The finance lease liability has an effective interest rate of 11.2% (2016: 9.9%). Lease payments are made on a monthly and quarterly 
basis. The future lease obligation of £1,112,000 (2016: £1,790,000) has a present value of £858,000 (2016: £1,399,000). 
At the start of the year there was £34.5m outstanding on the multi option revolving credit facility and there were no drawdowns 
made from the facility during the year. Repayments totalling £16.0m were made resulting in a balance outstanding at the end of the 
year of £18.5m. 
The £60m multi option revolving credit facility may be used by the Group to finance acquisitions, capital expenditure and for the issue 
of guarantees, bonds or indemnities. The facility is available until June 2019 at which point any advances made under the multi option 
revolving credit facility will become immediately repayable. In addition, each draw down made under this facility can be for either 3 or 
6 months and can either be repaid or continued at the end of the period. Interest is charged on this loan at an annual rate determined 
by the sum of the multi option revolving credit facility margin, LIBOR and the lender’s mandatory costs. The multi option revolving credit 
facility margin is fixed at 1.7% per annum and a non-utilisation fee of 40% of the multi option revolving credit facility margin is due on any 
undrawn portion of the full £60m multi option revolving credit facility. The effective interest rate for multi option revolving credit facility 
in the current year was 3.32% (2016: 3.17%).

The future loan obligations of £18,722,000 (2016: £34,907,000) equate to a present value of £18,315,000 (2016: £33,922,000). The 
capital element of the bank loans is £18,639,000 (2016: £34,525,000) and this differs from the net amount drawn down of £18,500,000 
(2016: £34,500,000) due to an effective interest rate adjustment.

23. PROVISIONS 
The Group has made provision for the reinstatement of certain leasehold properties and after initial measurement, any subsequent 
adjustments to reinstatement provisions will be recorded against the original amount included in leasehold improvements with a 
corresponding adjustment to future depreciation charges.
Upon the acquisition of ServerSpace, the Group recognised an onerous lease provision for excess datacentre capacity based on the 
contracted future lease rental obligations relating to datacentre capacity that is no longer required.
The directors consider the carrying values of the provisions to approximate to their fair values as they have been discounted.

27. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The Group operated the following share based payment employee share option schemes during the year; an Enterprise Management 
Incentive scheme, a SAYE sharesave scheme and a number of unapproved schemes. All schemes are settled in equity only and are 
summarised below.

employment.
During the year, options over 745,797 ordinary shares (2016: 98,567) were exercised and the average market price at the exercise 
dates was 286.1p (2016: 265.5p). Options over 602,228 ordinary shares (2016: 843,385) were granted under the unapproved share 
option scheme with an average exercise price of 1.0p (2016: 108.9p) and no options over ordinary shares were granted under the 
sharesave scheme (2016: 225,764 options granted with an average exercise price of 194.8p). Options over 473,750 ordinary shares 
(2016: 35,417) lapsed under the unapproved share option scheme with an average exercise price of 184.3p (2016: 118.5p), no options 
lapsed over shares under the EMI scheme (2016: 16,666 shares with an average exercise price of 87.5p); and options over 51,853 
(2016: 62,330) lapsed under the sharesave scheme with an average exercise price of 193.9p (2016: 192.2p).
As disclosed in note 5, a share based payment charge of £1,844,000 (2016: £1,081,000) has been recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income during the year in relation to the above schemes. The fair value of the employee services received is valued 
indirectly by valuing the options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which worked on the following assumptions for 
the options granted in the current and previous year:

30. RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group finances its operations by raising finance through equity, bank borrowings and finance leases. No speculative treasury 
transactions are undertaken however the Group does from time to time enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge known 
currency exposures. Financial assets and liabilities include those assets and liabilities of a financial nature, namely cash, short term 
receivables/payables and borrowings. 
The carrying amounts of financial assets presented in the statement of financial position relate to the following measurement categories

Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash 
safely and profitably. In note 22 the contractual maturity analysis of the Group’s total borrowings of £19.5m (2016: £35.9m) is shown. 
The Group has £41.5m (2016: £25.5m) available to draw down on the revolving credit facility and reviews its cash flow requirements 
on a monthly basis.
Interest rates
The interest rate on the Group’s cash at bank is determined by reference to the base rate and the interest rate on the Group’s revolving 
credit loan facilities is based on LIBOR plus a margin. The Group has entered into an interest rate swap in respect of £10m which has 
been drawn under the revolving credit facility from April 2015 which reduces by £2m every 6 months until October 2017 and as a 
consequence the interest rate on that amount of borrowing is fixed at 2.03% from April 2015 until maturity. As a consequence, at 31 
March 2017, £2m of the amount drawn under the multi option revolving credit facility was covered by interest rate swap arrangements. 
The fair value of the interest rate swap contracts is estimated to be a gain of £84,000 (2016: £64,000) which has been recognised in 
profit or loss for the year.
Currency risk
During the year the Group made payments totalling US$5.5m (2016: US$5.3m) and EUR€0.1m (2016: EUR€0.1m) to acquire domain 
names for its Easyspace segment and licences for its Cloud Services segment. In addition, the Group received US$3.5m (2016: US$3.3m) 
and EUR€0.4m (2016: EUR€0.7m) from Cloud Services customers billed in foreign currency. During the year, the Group entered into 
forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to the US Dollar arising on these purchases but at the year end the Group had no 
outstanding forward contracts in place (2016: none). Consequently, the fair value of currency contracts at the year end was £nil (2016: 
£nil). The Group has no non-monetary assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the level of monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies is minimal. 
Capital risk
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes borrowings (note 22) and cash and cash equivalents, and equity 
attributable to owners of the parent, comprising issued share capital (note 25), other reserves and retained earnings. The Group 
currently has net debt due to its acquisition activities. The Group seeks to maintain a level of gross cash which the Board considers 
to be adequate for the size of the Group’s operations which at the moment is around £10m. Consequently, the Group makes use of 
both banking facilities and finance lease arrangements to help fund the acquisition of companies and capital expenditure in order to 
maintain that level of gross cash. The Group’s current policy is to pay annual dividends depending on the level of adjusted diluted 
earnings per share. The Group was in compliance with all covenants under its banking facility arrangements throughout the reporting 
period.
Credit risk
The Group provides standard credit terms (normally 30 days) to some of its customers which has resulted in trade receivables of 
£6,036,000 (2016: £6,866,000) which are stated net of applicable provisions and which represent the total amount exposed to credit 
risk. The lease deposits of £2,760,000 (2016: £2,760,000) are held in escrow accounts with the landlord’s main UK bankers and the 
landlord is a major UK plc. The Group’s cash at bank £8,906,000 (2016: £10,341,000) is held within the UK clearing banks.
In respect of trade receivables, lease deposits and cash at bank the directors consider the risk of exposure to credit is minimal due to 
the reasons given above.

Acquisition - Dediserve Limited
The Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Dediserve Limited, (“Dediserve”) on 17 May 2017 for €7.9m on a no debt, no 
cash, normalised working capital basis.
Dediserve is a company registered in the Republic of Ireland based in Dublin which provides cloud hosting services to over 1,500 
customers from 10 locations world-wide. The acquisition is in line with the Group’s strategy to grow its hosting operations both 
organically and by acquisition. It also provides the Group with an additional European Union place of operation.
The Group estimates that it will incur £400,000 of third party acquisition related costs in respect of this acquisition. These expenses 
will be included in administrative expenses in the Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period ended 31 
March 2018.  
The following table summarises the consideration to acquire Dediserve and the provisional amounts of identified assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed at the acquisition date:
  £’000
Recognised amounts of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed (provisional):
Cash and cash equivalents 236
Trade and other receivables 190
Property, plant and equipment 779
Intangible assets 3,680
Trade and other payables (384)
Borrowings (279)
Current income tax liabilities (108)
Deferred tax liability (671)
Identifiable net assets 3,443
Goodwill 3,128
Total consideration 6,571
Satisfied by:
Cash – paid on acquisition 6,485
Deferred consideration – payable 86
Total consideration transferred 6,571
The recognised amounts of all the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed are provisional.
The share purchase agreement, in respect of the acquisition of Dediserve, includes a provision under which the total consideration 
payable will be adjusted by a payment to be made either to or by the Company, depending on the level of cash, debt and working 
capital shown in an agreed set of accounts (the Completion Accounts) made up to, and as at, the completion date. The initial payment 
to acquire the company was €7,800,000 (£6,700,000) in cash and in addition an amount of €250,000 (£215,000) in cash was deducted 
as an interim settlement of the expected amount due in respect of the no debt, no cash, normalised working capital adjustment. An 
amount of €100,000 (£86,000) has been deferred and will be paid 6 months after the completion date or at the end of an operational 
handover period, whichever is sooner. The initial payment of €7,550,000 (£6,485,000) was funded by a draw down from the revolving 
credit facility of £6,485,000.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Dediserve is attributable to the premium payable for a pre-existing, well positioned business 
that has excellent growth prospects, together with the benefits to the Group in leveraging its worldwide presence, in merging the 
business with its existing infrastructure and the anticipated future operating synergies from the combination. The goodwill is not 
expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

31. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENT (CONTINUED)
The name Dediserve is not actively advertised or promoted, with the majority of Dediserve’s business being generated from existing 
customers or by word of mouth.  Dediserve has given a commitment to customers not to use for any purpose, other than the service 
agreement, any confidential information received from the customer. As a consequence there is no significant value in either the trade 
name/brand or customer lists acquired at the acquisition date and therefore no value has been attributed to either intangible asset.
The fair value of the financial assets acquired includes trade receivables with a fair value of £151,000. The gross amount due under 
contracts is £151,000, all of which is expected to be collectable.
The fair value included in respect of the acquired customer relationships intangible asset is £3,680,000.
To estimate the fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset, a discounted cash flow method, specifically the income 
approach, was used with reference to the directors’ estimates of the level of revenue which will be generated from them. A post-tax 
discount rate of 13.61% was used for the valuation. Customer relationships are being amortised over an estimated useful life of 8 years.

1. COMPANY INFORMATION
iomart Group plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of 
the registered office is given on page 84 of this report. The nature of the Company’s operations and its principal activity is that of a 
holding company.
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Statement of compliance
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 – ‘The Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101). The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation 
of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have all been applied consistently throughout the year unless otherwise 
stated.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis and are presented in Sterling (£).
Disclosure exemptions adopted 
In preparing these financial statements the Company has taken advantage of all disclosure exemptions conferred by FRS 101. Therefore 
these financial statements do not include:
•	 a statement of cash flows and related notes;
•	 the requirement to produce a statement of financial position at the beginning of the earliest comparative period;
•	 the requirement of IAS 24 related party disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more 
 members of the iomart Group as they are wholly owned within the iomart Group;
•	 disclosure of key management personnel compensation;
•	 capital management disclosures;
•	 certain share based payments disclosures;
•	 business combination disclosures;
•	 disclosures in respect of financial instruments; and
•	 the effect of future accounting standards not adopted. 
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value. As part of the acquisition 
strategy of the Company, the trade and net assets of subsidiary undertakings at or shortly after acquisition may be transferred at book 
value to fellow subsidiaries. Where a trade is hived across to a fellow subsidiary undertaking, the cost of the investment in the original 
subsidiary, which then becomes a non-trading subsidiary, is added to the cost of the investment in the entity to which the trade has 
been hived. In order to accurately assess any potential impairment of investments, the carrying value of the investment in all companies 
transferred is considered together against the future cash flows and net asset position of those companies which received the trade 
and net assets.
Contingent consideration 
Where an acquisition involves a potential payment of contingent consideration the estimate of any such payment is based on its fair 
value. To estimate the fair value an assessment is made as to the amount of contingent consideration which is likely to be paid having 
regard to the criteria on which any sum due will be calculated and is probability based to reflect the likelihood of different amounts being 
paid. Where a change is made to the fair value of contingent consideration within the initial measurement period as a result of additional 
information obtained on facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date then this is accounted for as a change in goodwill. 
Where changes are made to the fair value of contingent consideration as a result of events that occurred after the acquisition date then 
we have elected to account for the adjustment as a charge or credit to profit or loss. iomart Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Parent company financial statements. Year ended 31March 2017

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Income taxes
The tax expense recognised in profit or loss comprises the sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity.
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year. Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability 
method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities and their tax bases.  However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax on 
temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled 
by the Company and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. In addition, tax losses available to be carried 
forward as well as other income tax credits to the Company are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are calculated at tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are 
enacted or substantively enacted at the period end.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, except where they relate to items that are recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity (such as share based 
remuneration) in which case the related deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or equity accordingly.
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.  Financial 
assets other than those categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are recognised at fair value plus transaction costs on initial 
recognition.  Financial assets categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are recognised initially at fair value with transaction costs 
expensed through profit or loss.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market.  Loans and receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less provision for impairment.  Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Company’s cash and cash 
equivalents and most other receivables fall into this category of financial instruments.
Provision against other receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts 
due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables.  The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows. An assessment for impairment is undertaken 
at least at each reporting date.
Financial derivatives such as forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are carried at fair value through profit or loss 
subsequent to initial recognition.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.  Financial liabilities categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are recorded initially at 
fair value, all transaction costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.  All other financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value, 
net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are re-measured at each reporting date at fair value, with changes 
in fair value being recognised through profit or loss.  All other financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, with interest-related charges recognised as an expense in finance costs through profit or loss.  A financial liability is 
derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or when it expires. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged to profit or loss on an accruals 
basis using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled 
in the period in which they arise. iomart Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Leases
In accordance with IAS 17 Leases, the economic ownership of a leased asset is deemed to have been transferred to the Company (the 
lessee) if the Company bears substantially all the risks and rewards related to the ownership of the leased asset.  The related asset is 
recognised at the time of inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease 
payments plus incidental payments, if any, to be borne by the lessee.  A corresponding amount is recognised as a finance lease liability.  
The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to profit 
or loss over the period of the lease.  
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to profit or loss on a straight line 
basis over the lease term.  Lease incentives are spread over the term of the lease. Where a lease is for land and buildings, these are 
considered separately as to whether there is a finance lease within the lease.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially stated at fair value after deduction of any issue costs. The carrying amount is increased by the finance costs in 
respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost, 
any difference between the periods (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised through profit or loss over the 
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.  Where borrowings are repaid early and new loan facilities agreed the 
terms of each loan facility are compared. Where the terms of the new borrowings are significantly different from those of the previous 
borrowings, the previous borrowings are treated as extinguished rather than modified as prescribed under IAS 39.
Pension scheme arrangements
The Company contributes to an auto-enrolment pension scheme and also to a number of personal pension schemes on behalf of 
executive directors and some senior employees. Pension costs are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.
Share-based payment 
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2005 are recognised in 
the financial statements. All share-based payment arrangements in the company are equity settled.  All goods and services received in 
exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values.  Where employees are rewarded using share-
based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted 
to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions (for example, 
profitability and sales growth targets).
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense through profit or loss with a corresponding credit to 
“Profit and loss reserve” unless the share based payment arrangement relates to an employee of a subsidiary company where in such 
instances the share based payment is added to the cost of investment in that subsidiary as a capital contribution.  
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest.   Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that 
the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates.  Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised 
in the current period.  No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised are 
different to that estimated on vesting.
Upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital, and where 
appropriate share premium.
Cash at bank and in hand
Cash at bank and in hand comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash with maturities of three months or less from inception and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.

Notice of the 2017 Annual General Meeting
81 iomart Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL 
MEETING IOMART GROUP PLC
Ordinary Resolutions
Resolutions 1 to 8 are all to be proposed as ordinary resolutions.  
This means that for each of those resolutions to be passed, more 
than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution.
Resolution 1 – To receive and adopt the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 March 2017 and the directors' and 
auditors' reports thereon
For each financial year the directors of the Company must present 
the audited financial statements, the directors' report and the 
auditors' report on the financial statements to the shareholders 
at an annual general meeting.  
Resolution 2 – To approve the directors' remuneration report
Shareholders are asked to approve the directors' remuneration 
report which may be found in the annual report on pages 22 
to 27.  This resolution is an advisory one and no entitlement to 
remuneration is conditional on the resolution being passed.
Resolutions 3, 4 and 5 – Re-election of directors
Under article 24 of the Company's articles of association one third 
of the directors are required to retire by rotation at each annual 
general meeting.  Pursuant to those articles, Mr Angus MacSween 
and Mr Richard Logan are required to retire by rotation at this 
annual general meeting and, being eligible, offer themselves 
for reappointment. In addition, the articles also stipulate that 
any director appointed by the Board during the year must offer 
themselves for reappointment at the next available annual 
general meeting. Mr Richard Masters was appointed on 20 June 
2017 and accordingly offers himself for reappointment. The 
board of directors is satisfied that the performance of Mr Angus 
MacSween, Mr Richard Logan and Mr Richard Masters continues 
to be effective and demonstrates commitment to their roles with 
the Company including commitment of time for board meetings 
and other duties required of them.  Accordingly, resolutions 3, 4 
and 5 propose the reappointment of Mr Angus MacSween, Mr 
Richard Logan and Mr Richard Masters.
Brief biographical details of Mr Angus MacSween, Mr Richard 
Logan and Mr Richard Masters are given below.
Mr Angus MacSween, 60, appointed 2000, founded iomart in 
December 1998 following 15 years spent creating and selling 
businesses in the telephony and internet sector. In 1984, after a 
short service commission in the Royal Navy, Angus started his first 
business selling telephone systems. He then grew and sold five 
profitable businesses – including Prestel, an online information 
division of BT, which he turned into one of the UK’s first internet 
service providers. Following the sale of Teledata Limited, the UK’s 
leading telephone information services company, to Scottish 
Telecom plc, Angus then spent two years on the executive 
of Scottish Telecom plc where he was responsible for the 
development of the company's internet division
Mr Richard Logan, 59, appointed 2006, is a chartered accountant, 
having qualified with Arthur Young in 1984. Richard then spent 
seven years with Ben Line Group Limited initially as Group 
treasurer and latterly as financial director of the main container 
shipping division.  From 1992 to 2002 Richard served as finance 
director of Kingston SCL, which provided administration and 
billing software to the mobile communications market, during 
which time he was involved in a management buy-out and 
subsequent trade sale of the company.  Immediately prior to 
joining iomart Richard served as finance director of ePOINT 
Group Limited, a technology company based in Scotland. Richard 
is a Non-Executive Director of Inspired Energy plc, an AIM listed 
energy procurement organisation.
Mr Richard Masters, 52, appointed 2017; has over 30 years’ 
experience in the legal profession and was managing partner 
with McGrigors LLP until April 2012 when it merged with Pinsent 
Masons LLP. After the merger and until June 2015 he was Head 
of Client Operations for Pinsent Masons LLP, which was a main 
Board executive position, and then held a non-executive role 
through to May 2016. He is currently the Executive Chairman of 
Complete Electronic Risk Compliance Limited (Cerico), a Pinsent 
Masons LLP subsidiary, and has held this role since June 2016.
Resolution 6 – To declare a dividend 6.00p per ordinary share
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the Company may 
by ordinary resolution declare dividends, but no dividend shall 
exceed the amount recommended by the board of directors.  The 
board of directors recommends the payment of a final dividend 
of 6.00p per ordinary share, to be payable to shareholders 
registered at close of business on 11 August 2017.
Resolution 7 – Re-appointment and remuneration of auditors
The Company is required at each general meeting at which 
financial statements are presented to shareholders to appoint 
auditors who will remain in office until the next such meeting.  
Grant Thornton UK LLP have expressed their willingness to 
continue in office for a further year.  In accordance with company 
law and corporate governance best practice, shareholders are 
also asked to authorise the directors to determine the auditors' 
remuneration.
Resolution 8 – Authority to allot shares 
Under section 551 of the Companies Act 2006, the directors of a 
company may only allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for, or 
to convert any security, into shares in the Company if authorised 
to do so.
In line with guidance issued by the Investment Management 
Association (now the Investment Association), the authority 
contained in paragraph (a) of this resolution will (if passed) give 
the directors authority to allot ordinary shares in connection 
with a rights issue in favour of ordinary shareholders up to an 
aggregate nominal amount equal to £718,537.32 (representing 
71,853,732 ordinary shares) as reduced by the nominal amount 
of any shares issued under paragraph (b) of this resolution.  This 
amount (before any reduction) represents approximately two-
thirds of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury 
shares) of the Company as at the latest practicable date prior to 
publication of the notice of the meeting. 
The authority contained in paragraph (b) of this resolution will (if 
passed) give the directors the authority to allot ordinary shares 
up to an aggregate nominal value of £359,268.66 (representing 
35,926,866 ordinary shares of 1p each).  This amount represents 
approximately one-third of the issued ordinary share capital 
(excluding treasury shares) of the Company as at the latest 
practicable date prior to the publication of the notice of the 
meeting.  This authority will expire on 23 November 2018 or, if 
earlier, at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting.
Special Resolutions
Resolutions 9, 10 and 11 will be proposed as special resolutions.  
This means that for each of those resolutions to be passed, at 
least three-quarters of the votes cast must be in favour of the 
resolution.
Notice of the 2017 Annual General Meeting

Resolutions 9 and 10 - Disapplication of statutory 
pre-emption rights
The Companies Act 2006 gives holders of ordinary shares, with 
limited but important exceptions, certain rights of pre-emption 
on the issue for cash of new ordinary shares or on the sale of 
any shares which the Company may hold in treasury following a 
purchase of its own shares. The directors of the Company believe 
that it is in the best interests of the Company that, as in previous 
years, the board of directors of the Company should have limited 
authority to allot some shares for cash or sell treasury shares 
without first having to offer such shares to existing shareholders. 
The directors' current authority expires at the close of the 
forthcoming annual general meeting. The authority sought by 
way of resolution 9 would expire at the earlier of the close of 
the next annual general meeting or 23 November 2018. The 
authority, if granted, will relate to the allotment of new ordinary 
shares or the sale of treasury shares in respect of (a) rights issues 
and similar offerings, where difficulties arise in offering shares 
to certain overseas shareholders, and in relation to fractional 
entitlements and certain other technical matters, (b) the right to 
receive shares, credited as fully paid, instead of cash in respect 
of the whole (or some part, to be determined by the board of 
directors) of such cash dividend or dividends (if the Company 
offers shareholders the option of making an election of that 
nature and if relevant shareholders make such an election), and 
(c) generally to allotments (other than in respect of pre-emptive 
offerings) of ordinary shares or the sale of treasury shares having 
an aggregate nominal value not exceeding  £53,890.30 (being 
equal to 5% of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding 
treasury shares) of the Company as at the latest practicable date 
prior to the publication of the notice of the meeting).
Resolution 10, if approved, would give the directors of the 
Company an additional authority to issue ordinary shares, or 
sell treasury shares, for cash in connection with an acquisition 
or capital investment of kind contemplated by the Pre-Emption 
Group's Statement of Principles up to an additional aggregate 
nominal amount of £53,890.30 (being equal to 5% of the issued 
ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) of the Company 
as at the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the 
notice of the meeting). The directors confirm that they will only 
allot shares pursuant to this authority where the allotment is in 
connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment 
(as defined in the Pre-Emption Group's Statement of Principles) 
which is announced contemporaneously with the allotment or 
sale, or which has taken place in the preceding six-month period 
and is disclosed in the announcement of the allotment of sale.
The powers given by resolutions 9 and 10 will, unless sooner 
revoked or renewed by the Company in a general meeting, last 
until the earlier of the close of the next annual general meeting or 
23 November 2018.
Resolution 11 – Authority to purchase the Company's own 
shares
This resolution grants authority to the Company to make 
purchases of up to a maximum of 10% of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company (excluding for these purposes the 
22,408 shares held by the Company in treasury) as at the date of 
the notice of this meeting.
In certain circumstances it may be advantageous for the Company 
to purchase its ordinary shares.  The directors would use the 
share purchase authority with discretion and purchases would 
only made from funds not required for other purposes and in 
light of market conditions prevailing at the time.  In reaching a 
decision to purchase ordinary shares, your directors would take 
account of the Company's cash resources and capital, the effect 
of such purchases on the Company's business and on earnings 
per ordinary share.
The directors have no present intention of using the authority.  
However, the directors consider that it is in the best interests of 
the Company and its shareholders as a whole that the Company 
should have flexibility to buy back its own shares should the 
directors in the future consider that it is appropriate to do so.
In relation to any buy back, the maximum price per ordinary share 
at which the Company is authorised in terms of resolution 11 
to effect that buy back is 5% above the average middle market 
price of an ordinary share for the five business days immediately 
preceding the date on which the buy back is effected.
The statutory provisions governing buy backs of own shares are 
currently contained in, inter alios, sections 693 and 701 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
