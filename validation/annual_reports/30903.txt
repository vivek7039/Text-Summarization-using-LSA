Significant growth 
from a wider customer base “H& T provides a range of simple and 
accessible financial products tailored for a 
customer base which has limited access to, 
or is excluded from, the traditional banking 
and finance sector.”

Chairman’s statement
The Group has achieved growth in revenues from the  
core services of pawnbroking, retail and personal loans.  
We have improved store profitability and have also  
made progress in the development of our online channel 
although there is still considerable work to do.
Our est1897.co.uk site for watches is a great example of how we 
can successfully use the internet for retailing backed up by our 
store network. The opportunity to build on this concept for our 
core services is clear and will be a key part of our future strategy. 
These activities have repositioned the business within the wider 
alternative credit market and allowed the Group to access  
a broader customer base. The Board ensures that this growth  
is carefully managed with a clear focus on the changing risks, 
both regulatory and financial, that this diversification brings.
The growth in retail, FX and buyback also provide a degree  
of resilience to changes in the marketplace. 
Financial performance 
The Group delivered profit after tax of £11.3m (2016: £7.6m) and 
diluted earnings per share of 30.94 pence (2016: 20.88 pence). 
Subject to shareholder approval, a final dividend of 6.2 pence 
per ordinary share (2016: 5.3 pence) will be paid on 1 June 2018  
to those shareholders on the register at the close of business  
on 4 May 2018. This will bring the full year dividend to 10.5 
pence per ordinary share (2016: 9.2 pence).
The Group’s financial position is strong with growth in the 
combined personal loan and pawnbroking loan books (net) to 
£63.8m (31 December 2016: £50.2m). As a result net debt increased 
to £13.3m at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £5.4m). 
At year end the Group had available headroom of £8.0m on its 
£30m borrowing facilities. I am pleased to report that in March 
2018 the facility was increased by £5.0m.
Regulation
H&T is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) for all consumer credit business. During the  
year the FCA conducted a consultation on creditworthiness  
and is expected to publish the results in 2018.
We engaged with the FCA through our trade associations and 
have analysed the proposals contained within the consultation. 
The consultation provides helpful guidance on effective 
creditworthiness assessments and clarifies some of the specific 
exemptions in relation to pawnbroking. Subject to the final 
policy statement we do not expect it to have an adverse impact 
on our business. We fully support the higher standards that the 
consultation aims to deliver. 
Strategy
We are developing our capabilities to address a changing market 
where we see pressures both on the high street in general and 
the core product of pawnbroking in particular. We are focussed 
on maximising the potential from the core services while 
investing in the development of new products and channels. 
This approach will allow us to improve profitability in the  
short term; in the longer term we can access a wider customer 
base and provide those consumers with products appropriate  
to their needs.
We believe that our network of stores supports this 
development, whether through click-and-collect from the 
est1897 website or by providing a face-to-face underwriting 
decision for customers we cannot serve with an online loan. 
This real-world presence supported by an effective online and 
mobile proposition creates an important distinction between 
H&T and a purely online business.
In developing our personal loan product, we have a clear 
objective to provide our customers with a route to lower 
interest rate credit products as their relationship with H&T 
develops. We believe that this progression is beneficial to the 
customer, builds loyalty and meets the high standards required 
in this regulated marketplace.
Prospects
The overall weakness in sterling following the EU referendum 
result has continued to benefit the sterling gold price for much 
of the year; this in turn provides an improvement in the Group’s 
profits while it continues. Demand for our services remains 
strong and the development in our products and distribution 
enables us to capture a larger share of the significant alternative 
credit market. 
Our thoughtful approach to growth reflects our intention  
to provide our consumers with a service that maintains  
the highest standards of affordability and seeks to avoid  
any consumer detriment.  
On behalf of the Board and our shareholders, I would like to 
thank everyone at H&T for their hard work and dedication over 
the past year.

Our business
Who we are
Our status
Our  
strategy
Our  
market-  
place
As at 31 December 2017, H&T was the largest 
pawnbroking business in the UK by size of pledge book.
H&T has existed in some form since the late 1800s  
and over the years has built or acquired some of the 
oldest and largest pawnbrokers in the UK. Presence  
on the high street and excellent customer service  
to a localised customer base have always underpinned 
H&T’s approach. For example, the store in Edinburgh  
has operated from the same building and served the 
same community for more than 150 years. 
H&T’s listing on AIM provided the Group with access  
to new sources of finance. This has enabled its 
development by adding new products and services and 
bringing the store network to 181 at 31 December 2017.
“H&T will be the premier provider of alternative 
credit in the UK through a range of services that 
help our customers rebuild their credit rating and 
return to the mainstream.”
There are three elements to delivery of the strategy:
1. Maintain the performance of our core products  
and stores
2. Develop a range of credit products to serve a wider 
customer base
3. Enhance distribution by delivering services in store, 
online and through mobile devices.
H&T operates across the UK in a fast-moving, 
competitive environment. It will continue to succeed 
by focussing on customer needs, training, developing 
and retaining key staff, developing existing and new 
products and expanding its distribution channels.  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 05

Our 
customer
Personal 
service
Our loan products are often used by people who cannot access 
mainstream credit. Why? The most common reason is that they may have 
experienced problems in the past which resulted in missed payment or 
defaults on their credit file. Almost half of our personal loan customers  
are aged under 35 and generally have a thin credit file or a low credit score.
Our customers often need money to meet day-to-day expenses and  
as such they need relatively small sums quickly; this demand can be  
met very effectively by our in-store products. It is possible to complete  
a pawnbroking or personal loan in store within 30 minutes. 
Customers often compare our rates with larger, well-known, short-term 
credit brands which is advantageous as we are often considerably cheaper.
We offer our services both online and in store and ensure that there  
is a member of staff available for our customers to speak to if they have 
any questions.
Our staff understand that each customer has different needs and they use 
our range of products to help them to find the best solution. We believe 
that providing customers with the option of face-to-face interaction 
in-store helps to build trust and understanding and delivers genuine,  
high quality service. 
Customer 
feedback
Est1897 /Retail – “Really great service from these guys! Prompt when 
sending my watch. I made an error with the address and they were able to 
sort it without hassle. The watch arrived two days after I ordered and it is 
amazing! Will certainly be telling all of my friends to buy from these guys.”
HandT.co.uk – “They were so helpful. One quick phone call to verify  
some details and the money was in my account within a few hours.”
Online personal loan – “I applied on H&T’s website on Saturday and  
it was processed and agreed on the following Monday. I was surprised  
I was accepted as my credit rating isn’t great but I still have credit.  
H&T didn’t just rely on credit scoring alone. Thanks H&T.”

Our products
PAWNBROKING
A pawnbroking loan is secured on an item of value 
with a term of up to six months. We will lend on any 
asset we can accurately value, typically jewellery  
and watches. The customer enters into a consumer 
credit agreement for a period of six months and the 
customer can redeem the goods at any point during 
this time providing that they repay the original  
loan amount plus any interest due. If the customer 
chooses not to redeem or renew the loan H&T will 
take action to dispose of the goods. The customer 
has no liability to us beyond the value of the goods.
PERSONAL LOANS
H&T’s personal loans are available in store and online. 
They offer flexibility on the length of loan and regular 
repayment amount, depending on the personal 
circumstances of each customer. Before issuing a loan 
we establish the customer’s identity and complete  
a thorough affordability assessment. If approved,  
the customer enters into a consumer credit loan 
agreement and we will collect the repayments  
on the dates agreed with the customer.
JEWELLERY RETAIL
H&T offers a range of new and second-hand jewellery 
and watches sourced from our pledge book, purchased 
over the counter or purchased from suppliers.  
All H&T’s jewellery is professionally cleaned, restored 
and valued before being re-distributed for sale at 
stores across the country. 
PURCHASING
Purchasing is a simple way for customers to use  
their unwanted items, predominantly gold, to raise 
some cash. The process is straightforward with  
the store assessing the items, agreeing a price with 
the customer and purchasing the goods for cash  
on the spot. 
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
H&T offers a foreign exchange service at competitive 
rates and with no commission charges, further 
establishing one of our core strengths of offering 
great value to the customer. 
BUYBACK
Increasingly, a younger generation of customers is 
seeking the opportunity to raise cash from electronic 
items such as phones, tablets, and game consoles. 
Customers can sell their electronic items to H&T  
for cash and buy the item back within 31 days.  
This product is particularly popular with the younger 
generation; 53% of our customers are aged under 35.
CHEQUE CASHING
Cheque cashing is a service that allows customers  
to get cash for their cheques in a few minutes,  
rather than banking the cheque. Customers use H&T 
to speed up the cheque clearance (some building 
societies can take almost two weeks to clear  
a cheque) or to avoid banking the cheque into  
an overdrawn account. 
H& T provide a wide range of services but at the core  
is the provision of money to our customer base whether 
through a loan or by selling an asset to us.  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 07

Our development
Multi-channel
Our store estate is still the largest 
customer acquisition channel for all 
products. We have streamlined a number 
of key processes making it easier for both 
our customers and staff to transact.
We have also made significant progress 
when developing our omni-channel 
approach including improvements to all 
customer journeys; simplifying online to 
store processes and ensuring all customer 
touch points are easily accessible 
regardless of the customers browsing 
preferences (desktop, tablet or mobile). 
Our plan is to capitalise on this by 
introducing a truly “clicks to bricks” offer 
during 2018. A customer will be able to 
apply for any product H&T offers online 
and complete the transaction in store  
(or vice versa).
There was significant improvement  
in the amount of traffic across our  
websites with both www.handt.co.uk  
and www.est1897.co.uk experiencing 
nearly double the traffic than 2016. 
Made for mobile
Throughout 2017 we saw a continuation 
of the trend of customers viewing our 
websites on a mobile device. In response 
to this, we launched a revised version  
of our retail website along with a new 
mobile optimised online loans journey. 
Customer relationship and engagement 
Our customer relationship programme 
has allowed us to communicate more 
effectively with our existing customers 
via both email and text message, creating 
genuine lifetime value. In 2017 we saw  
a continuation of strong demand for 
further borrowing from our existing 
customer base.
Product development
We have made significant progress in 
developing a range of loan products 
which can help our customers return to 
mainstream credit. Our loan products 
now have three distinct products. 
This allows us to lend to a new customer 
who has a less than perfect credit history, 
but also gives us the opportunity to 
maintain a relationship with the customer 
and potentially lend them more at an 
improved rate as they repair and rebuild 
their credit history with us. Our best  
rate loan is typically offered to existing 
customers who have a strong history  
of repaying their loan.
We can now also lend up to £5,000  
to a new customer depending on their 
personal circumstances and affordability. 
This allows us to serve a wider range  
of customers. These customers are not 
necessarily customers we would have 
historically transacted with. 
The new rates also allow us to compete 
in different markets and widen our 
distribution of product through our 
carefully selected portfolio of partners. 
We are now presenting our product 
online to customers who are looking for a 
more traditional unsecured loan product.  08 | www.handt.co.uk
Chief executive’s review
The Group delivered profit before tax of £14.1m (2016: £9.7m)  
as a result of improved gross profits in the key segments of 
pawnbroking, retail and personal loans. 
THE MARKET
Our marketplace has undergone significant changes in the past 
four years, experiencing peak competition, a falling gold price 
and new regulation causing a number of our competitors to 
restructure their businesses or exit the market. In comparison, 
during 2017 we experienced far more stability allowing us to 
focus on developing our proposition.
OUR STRATEGY
Our Vision: 
H& T will be the premier provider  
of alternative credit in the UK through  
a range of services that help our customers  
rebuild their credit rating and return  
to the mainstream.
The Group’s strategy is to serve a customer base whose access 
to mainstream credit is limited and for whom small-sum loans 
can help to address short-term financial challenges. The Group 
will continue to deliver this strategy by developing a range  
of lending products, both secured and unsecured, offered  
in store and online. In expanding our credit products we aim  
to genuinely help our customers and have updated our vision 
statement to reinforce that vital message within the business.
The development of a diversified suite of services including 
retail, buyback and FX, improves returns and reduces the Group’s 
exposure to gold price volatility.
We continue to innovate and explore how to interact most 
effectively with our customers through the development  
of introducer channels, our online capability and our brand.  
This development is supported by our stores that provides  
our online customer with the opportunity to speak to a trained 
member of staff face to face or to collect an item that they 
reserved online.
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Pawnbroking 
Gross profits from pawnbroking increased 4.5% to £29.7m (2016: 
£28.4m) and the gross pledge book increased 11.6% to £46.1m  
(31 December 2016: £41.3m) as a result of the higher gold price, the 
concession format and an increase in loans on quality watches. 
The risk-adjusted margin (revenue as a percentage of the average 
net pledge book) was 68.3% (2016: 72.5%). The reduction in 
risk-adjusted margin is a result of the changing business mix to 
higher value, lower interest rate loans. Redemption of annual 
lending was marginally lower at an estimated 83.6% for lending 
in 2017 (2016 actual: 84.3%).
The pawnbroking segment remains challenging with limited real 
growth in like-for-like stores. There is short-term opportunity  
as a result of the relatively higher gold price and in the medium 
term through further expansion in our concession format and 
lending on high-end products.
The Group has benefitted from the expertise provided by the 
Expert Eye service. This allows high quality images of assets  
in store to be assessed by our team of experts which in turn 
improves both the quality of decisions made and extends the 
range of assets on which we can lend. This has assisted the 
development of watch and diamond lending during the year.
The Group is investing in software to assist the management  
of customer enquiries in respect of pawnbroking as well as the 
acquisition of new partners to introduce customers to the 
business. This investment will allow an expansion to the broker 
and online channels in respect of pawnbroking during 2018.

The Group has produced a strong trading performance  
and made good progress in its strategic development.  
Our intention is to get the best possible result from our 
core operations, develop a range of additional credit 
products and expand the online channel. We have 
delivered against all of those objectives in the past year. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 09

Retail
Retail sales increased 16% to £35.4m (2016: £30.5m), gross profits 
to £12.9m (2016: £11.2m) and margin reduced to 36.3% (2016: 36.8%). 
The Group has invested in store inventories with average 
monthly balances being 12% higher during 2017 than 2016.  
This coupled with control over targeted discounts has resulted 
in the significant improvements in gross profits despite margin 
pressure as a result of increased cost of goods reflecting  
the higher rates on both lending and purchasing activities. 
The development of new-jewellery sales has been particularly 
encouraging with sales increasing by 62% and gross profits  
of £1.3m (2016: £0.9m) as we identify key segments and lines  
to supplement our pre-owned offering.
The est1897 website has been enhanced during the year with 
improved templates, photography and the number of items  
on the site. There are now more than 2000 high-quality  
watches online together with a range of high quality jewellery.  
This enables us to present store inventories to a far wider 
audience and equally, through the use of tablets, we can present 
a far wider range of choice to in-store customers. While in the 
early stages of development we are encouraged by the results 
to date with almost £1m in sales originating on the website 
being completed during 2017 (2016: £0.1m).
We intend to enhance the website further during 2018 with 
greater integration with in-store systems, additional products 
online and improved functionality for the user. 
Personal loans
The net personal loans book has increased by 94.7% to £18.3m  
(31 December 2016: £9.4m). The Board considers revenue less 
impairment to be an important measure of the performance of 
personal loans as it represents the net profit derived directly from 
our lending activities. Revenue less impairment has increased to 
£5.7m (2016: £3.5m) as a result of increased customer numbers and 
the expansion in our longer term, lower interest rate loan product.
The reduction in the risk-adjusted margin (RAM) to 44.9%  
(2016: 55.1%) is the result of the increased proportion of new 
customers, expansion in online and the introduction of our 
lower APR products. Impairment as a percentage of the average 
monthly net loan book has improved to 33.3% (2016: 37.0%) 
reflecting the increased mix of lower yield, higher quality loans. 
This is in line with management expectations for credit quality 
and collections performance.
In line with the strategy of providing larger loans over longer 
terms at a lower interest rate we launched our 49.9% APR 
product in May 2017. This product is designed to provide  
a “near prime” option for our best customers.
The Group now has three distinct products offered both  
in store and online:
• >100% APR loans falling into the high-cost short-term credit 
(HCSTC) definition of the FCA. These loans are intended as the 
starting point of the customer journey with H&T and represent 
the highest volume of loans written as they tend to be lower 
value and shorter term. At 31 December 2017 this segment 
represented approximately 50% of the personal loan book.
• <100% APR loans which are generally provided to customers 
who have established a track record of repayment with H&T.  
At 31 December 2017 this segment represented approximately 
46% of the personal loan book.
• <50% APR loans which are intended to be the final step of the 
journey for our customers as they rebuild their credit rating.  
At 31 December 2017 this segment represented approximately 
4% of the personal loan book.
As a result of these initiatives half of the personal loans loan 
book is now non-HCSTC.
The expansion in other channels of business continues, the net 
online loan book doubled in the year to £1.4m and remains a key 
opportunity for the Group. The broker to store channel is also 
beginning to show positive results as we enhance our customer 
relationship management systems. 
The focus for the Group is to build these alternative sources for 
customers, work is underway to reduce the costs of acquisition 
and processing whilst improving performance.

Gross profits reduced to £1.9m (2016: £2.1m). The result in 2016 
was enhanced as a result of the rapid increase in the sterling

The average gold price during 2017 was £976 per troy ounce

Gold purchasing
Gross profits reduced to £3.4m (2016: £3.9m) despite a higher 
volume of gold scrapped in the year.
H&T purchases gold to achieve a particular margin and it takes 
around two months to process items directly to scrap. If the gold 
price increases during this processing period then our margins 
are enhanced, if it reduces then our margins are compressed.
During 2016, the gold price increased by 29% from January to 
December, whereas during the same period in 2017 it fell by 2.2%. 
Accordingly, our margins were considerably lower in 2017 vs 2016.
We estimate that the weight of fine gold purchased in 2017 
increased by approximately 2.1% from 2016 to 2017.
Other services
Other services principally comprises FX, buyback, cheque 
cashing and Western Union. Gross profits from this segment 
increased to £5.9m (2016: £5.6m), as growth in FX and buyback 
was partially offset by declines in Western Union and  
cheque cashing.
The key growth components of FX and buyback improved in the 
year with gross profits from FX increasing to £2.9m (2016: £2.7m) 
and buyback increasing to £1.8m (2016: £1.6m). 
FX is a simple transactional product which attracts a new 
customer base to the business. Improvements to currency 
holdings in store, point of sale materials and the expansion  
of click and collect will enhance this product in the future.
Buyback enables the Group to service a customer base who may 
not have appropriate assets for a pawnbroking loan. The principal 
assets purchased are mobile phones, tablets and games consoles. 
We have invested in system development to support the 
valuation and testing of the items in store. Further work will be 
completed in 2018 to fully integrate those systems and support 
the clicks-to-bricks customer journey.
PROSPECTS
The Group has enhanced its ability to serve a wider customer 
base, both in store and online, with growth in its well-established 
core products and the newer unsecured lending offering.  
This diversified approach to growth reduces the risks inherent  
in any individual objective and positions the Group to capture 
share in this exciting market. Current trading for 2018 is in line 
with management expectations.
I would also like to add my great thanks to those of the 
Chairman, in recognising all of our people whose skills, 
commitment and enthusiasm continue to drive our success,  
and who give us confidence in the future.

Finance director’s review
FINANCIAL RESULTS
For the year ended 31 December 2017 gross profit increased 11.7% 
from £57.1m to £63.8m driven by growth in the core segments  
of pawnbroking, retail and personal loans. 
Total direct and administrative expenses increased by 4.7% from 
£46.9m to £49.1m, principally as a result of investment in staff to 
support business volumes in personal loans and new initiatives. 
The Board considers the continued investment in people  
and systems to be vital in repositioning the business to take 
advantage of the market conditions.
Finance costs increased 20% to £0.6m (2016: £0.5m), reflecting 
the higher utilisation of the facility during 2017 following 
expansion in the pawnbroking and personal loan books.
Profit before tax increased by £4.4m to £14.1m, up 45.4% from 
£9.7m in 2016.
CASH FLOW
The growth in profit for the year resulted in an increase in 
operating cash flows (before movements in working capital)  
of 26.5% to £17.2m (2016: £13.6m). 
The Group accelerated the growth both in personal loans and 
pawnbroking during 2017 resulting in an increase in receivables 
of £14.2m in the year (2016: £8.2m). This growth, partially offset 
by increased profits, is the principal reason the Group produced 
a cash outflow from operating activities of £2.4m (2016: inflow 
of £1.3m).
BALANCE SHEET
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had net assets of £107.6m 
(2016: £98.8m) with year-end net debt of £13.3m (2016: £5.4m) 
delivering an increase in gearing to 12.4% (2016: 5.5%)  
(see note 27). 
On 1 March 2018, the Group extended the existing facility with 
Lloyds Bank plc by £5m allowing for maximum borrowings  
of £35.0m, subject to covenants, at a margin of between 1.75% 
and 2.75% above LIBOR. At year end £22.0m was drawn on the 
facility and the Group was well within the covenants with a net 
debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.76x and an EBITDA to interest ratio  
of 37.15 (see note 3 for the definition of EBITDA). The facility has 
a termination date of 30 April 2020.
The combination of low gearing and a secure long-term  
credit facility provides the Group with the ability to make 
selective investments in the future while maintaining 
appropriate headroom.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
The Group acquired two pawnbroking loan books for £0.1m, 
there have been no disposals of stores or loan books during  
the year.
IMPAIRMENT REVIEW
The Group performs an annual review of the expected earnings 
of each acquired store and considers whether the associated 
goodwill and other property, plant and equipment are impaired. 
There was no impairment charge during 2017 (2016: £nil/none).
SHARE PRICE AND EPS
At 31 December 2017, the share price was 335p (2016: 259.75p) 
and market capitalisation was £124.6m (2016: £95.5m).  
Basic earnings per share were 31.07p (2016: 20.94p),  
diluted earnings per share were 30.94p (2016: 20.88p).

Principal risks and uncertainties
The directors of H&T Group plc have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group,  
including those that could threaten its business model,  
future performance, solvency or liquidity.
The Board retains ultimate responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management framework and appetite, including reviewing its 
effectiveness and risk exposures measured through the Group’s 
Key Risk Indicators. The Board has delegated responsibility  
for annually reviewing the overall effectiveness of the risk 
management programme to the Audit Committee. The internal 
audit function provides assurance to the Audit Committee  
on the effectiveness of the internal control procedures through 
completion of a risk based annual audit plan, which takes into 
account the current risks faced by the Group. The compliance 
function provides assurance to the Risk Committee on 
regulatory and reputational risk through the completion of the 
annual compliance monitoring plan. 
The Group’s risk management framework and appetite  
is embedded in the Group’s management and governance 
processes and is overseen by the Board. Risks are identified  
both at a Board and an operational level, they are assessed and, 
where appropriate, individuals within the business are given 
responsibility for the management of that risk. The Group has  
in place formal processes for the identification of new risks  
or a change to an existing risk. The Risk Committee oversees  
a formal periodic review of our assessment of individual risks, 
mitigating activities and associated remedial actions.
The table below sets out the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group and how we mitigate them. This is not an 
exhaustive analysis of all the risks the Group may face as there 
may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently 
known to the Board or have not been included in this section 
on the basis that they are not considered to be material.
Area Description of risk Examples of mitigating activities
Regulatory risk Loss arising from a breach of existing 
regulation or regulatory changes in the 
markets within which the Group operates. 
• Experienced Board both in credit and FCA  
regulated businesses
• Dedicated Internal Audit and Compliance functions
• Completion of the annual risk based compliance  
monitoring plan
• Well-developed procedures, training, systems and 
operational controls
• Head of audit & compliance monitors legislative changes and 
supports departmental compliance functions as required
• Expert third-party legal and/or compliance advice is sought 
where necessary
• Membership of appropriate trade associations who assist 
with both regulatory awareness and relationships
Gold price A significant fall in the gold price 
impacting the security of pledge and  
the revenues from scrap operations.
The exit of the UK from the European 
Union may increase volatility in the 
sterling gold price as the exchange rate 
adjusts to the new market conditions. 
• Ensure sufficient headroom on bank covenants to absorb  
a reduction in gold price, should it occur, without  
covenant breach
• Monitoring of gold price at Board level
• Annual testing of forecasts sensitised for gold price
• Maintenance of appropriate margin between pledge value 
and gold price
• Lending on alternative high value items
• Review possible use of hedging instruments
• Focus on increasing redemption rates to minimise reliance  
on disposition
• Increase retail sales as a disposition hedge Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 15

Area Description of risk Examples of mitigating activities
Theft and fraud Loss of inventory or pledge • High levels of physical security
• Insurance for material losses
• Systems and procedures to minimise risk
Internal theft and fraud • Ensure staff are highly motivated
• Avoid lone working to reduce opportunity
• Internal audit visit to each store at least twice a year
• Internal audit team focussed on loss prevention and other 
manipulation for personal gain
• Fair, ethical, compliant and competitive incentive schemes 
and other benefits offered
Reputational risk An event or circumstance could adversely 
impact on the Group’s reputation, 
including adverse publicity from the 
activities of legislators, pressure groups 
and the media.
• Consider regulatory and reputational impact  
of business changes
• Maintain focus on competitive advantage  
of customer service 
• Ensure staff are highly motivated
• Staff undertake a comprehensive induction course  
and formal programme of ongoing training
• Ensure high level of compliance in product  
and service delivery
• Ensure price or short-term earnings are not the  
dominant factor in decision making
• Risk events are recorded and any customer or reputational 
impact is assessed and changes to systems and controls  
are made when necessary
• Retained financial PR and media relations consultancy  
to provide ongoing reputation management support  
and media engagement
Cyber security, 
denial of service 
and data loss
We have observed an increase in the 
frequency, severity and sophistication  
of cyber-attacks on UK businesses  
in general and in our own business.  
H&T is increasingly using online platforms 
both for transactional processing and 
customer acquisition. 
Failure to adequately manage cyber 
threats and to continually review and 
update processes in response to new 
threats could result in operational 
disruption resulting from system 
downtime, financial loss, data loss, 
reputational damage and regulatory fines.
• Utilise appropriate levels of industry-standard information 
security solutions for critical systems
• Conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities  
and deliver improvements
• Continue to monitor cyber-threats using internal and 
external resources and where necessary implement changes 
to combat this
• Daily back-up and secure storage of all systems  
to minimise data loss 
• Detailed disaster recovery and business continuity plans  
are in place, these are regularly reviewed and tested 16 | www.handt.co.uk
Financial risk management  
objectives and policies
The Group’s activities expose it to several financial risks 
including interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, price risk 
and exchange-rate risk. The use of financial derivatives  
is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board, 
which provides written principles on the use of financial 
derivatives to manage these risks. The Group does not use 
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
A summary of the principal financial risks is provided below. 
Further detailed discussion is provided in note 26 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks  
of changes in interest rates. At present the Board does not 
consider it necessary to enter into a hedging arrangement.  
This position is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and 
cash, trade and other receivables. The Group’s credit risk  
is primarily attributable to its trade receivables, the most 
significant of which are the pledge book, the personal loan  
book and cheque cashing balances. In all cases, exposure  
on trade and other receivables is spread over a large number  
of counterparties and customers.
The risk attributable to the pledge book is further mitigated  
due to the presence of security (customer pledges) which can 
be easily liquidated in almost all cases fully recovering the 
amount lent. 
The risks attached to the unsecured personal loan book are 
mitigated by the continual monitoring of bad debts and  
a possible modification of lending criteria. The Group performs 
an external credit check prior to lending. Similar procedures 
mitigate the risks associated with cheque cashing activities.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for 
impairment is made where there is an identified loss event 
which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction 
in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial 
instruments is considered to be low as funds are held with 
financial institutions with high credit-ratings assigned by 
international credit-rating agencies to the Group’s bankers  
as follows:
Moody’s credit rating
Barclays Bank plc A1 (Negative Outlook)
Lloyds Bank plc Aa3
The Group had no significant concentration of credit risk at year 
end other than on bank balances of £47,000 with Barclays Bank 
plc (2016: £944,936) and £1,149,000 (2016: £1,412,480) with Lloyds 
Bank plc. 
Liquidity risk
To maintain liquidity to ensure that sufficient funds are available 
for ongoing operations and future developments, the Group 
uses a mixture of long-term and short-term debt finance.  
At 31 December 2017, the Group had sufficient headroom on its 
current borrowings and remains in full compliance with all loan 
covenants. On 1 March 2018, the Group extended the existing 
facility with Lloyds Bank plc by £5m allowing for maximum 
borrowings of £35.0m.
Furthermore, the Group will review at the appropriate time,  
the possibility of raising future equity finance or refinance 
existing banking facilities to expand activities.
Price risk
With regard to the current balance sheet position, the Group  
is not exposed to price risk, as the majority of its jewellery and 
all of its scrap gold is obtained through unredeemed pledges, 
which have a cost to the Group which is lower than the retail 
value. The Group is however exposed to adverse movements in 
the price of gold in its gold scrap activities and the value of the 
pledge collaterals. Should the price of gold drop significantly, 
the Group can mitigate that risk by changing its lending policy 
on pawnbroking pledges or by entering hedging instruments. 
Currently the Group has no gold hedge in place, although this  
is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
Exchange rate risk
While the Group’s activities are largely conducted in the United 
Kingdom, the Group is impacted by foreign currency exchange 
rates affecting the gold price exchange from USD to GBP and 
the revaluation of foreign currency cash holdings in store.  
The impact of revaluation is monitored on a monthly basis  
and hedging is utilised if required. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 17

the store can choose the destination for a trip of a lifetime.
Employee engagement
Your Voice is a council-style meeting with employees from  
a variety of positions within the Group, and geographically  
from around the country. These provide a forum to discuss 
suggestions and ideas with senior management. The meetings 
are very productive as they allow direct feedback on any issues 
that arise in our stores or the wider organisation.
Internal appointments
We strive to develop and retain our staff. An important part  
of this is to provide opportunities within the Group where 
possible. We advertise positions weekly to every employee  
in order to help them to apply for these positions;  
where appropriate we use the management and star 
development programmes to help individuals progress. 
66% of our Deputy Manager  
and Store Manager roles were filled  
internally in 2017.
We value experience and recognise long service from 5 years on 
in five yearly increments. During 2017, 126 employees received  
a long service award and 64 employees were invited to attend  
a lunch in London to celebrate services of 10 years or more.

Corporate governance
The directors recognise the importance of adopting good 
corporate governance practices in the best interests of all 
shareholders. Although the Group is not required to report  
on compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code  
(“the Code”) since its shares are traded on the AIM Market,  
the Group applies the principles of sound Corporate 
Governance in the following ways:
DIRECTORS
The Board
The Board comprises two executive directors and three 
non-executive directors. Their biographies appear on page 20.  
A review of these shows a range of experience and expertise 
sufficient to bring independent judgement on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources and standards of conduct which is vital 
to the success of the Group. The three non-executive directors 
each hold shares as disclosed on page 28. However, because  
the number of shares held is small, there is no entitlement  
to share options for non-executives, and there are no cross 
directorships between executive and non-executive directors; 
the non-executive directors are considered to be independent. 
Board meetings
The Board is responsible to the shareholders for the proper 
management of the Group. A directors’ responsibilities 
statement in respect of the financial statements is set out  
in this Annual Report on page 31. 
The Board meets 10 times during the year. To enable the Board 
to discharge its duties, all directors receive appropriate and 
timely information. Briefing papers are distributed to all 
directors in advance of the Board meetings. There is a formal 
schedule of matters reserved to the Board which include  
the determination of strategy, approval of new stores and 
acquisitions, approval of budget and major capital expenditure. 
At Board meetings, the agenda normally comprises a review of 
the management financial statements, a CEO review of operations, 
a review of new store proposals and potential acquisitions and an 
update on the progress of the Group’s other strategic objectives. 
The Board meetings in August and March cover the approval of 
the interim and preliminary financial results respectively and the 
November meeting deals with the approval of the annual budget.
The following committees deal with the specific aspects of the 
Group’s affairs:
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises three independent 
non-executive directors. The members of the Committee are:
• Malcolm L Berryman (Chairman)
• Peter D McNamara
• James F Thornton
The Committee meets at least twice in each year and at such 
other times as the Chairman of the Committee sees fit.
The Chairman of the Committee is appointed by the Board  
on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises three independent  
non-executive directors. The members of the Committee are:
• James F Thornton (Chairman)
• Malcolm L Berryman 
• Peter D McNamara
The Audit Committee monitors the integrity of the financial 
statements of the Group and any formal announcements 
relating to financial performance, reviewing and challenging 
where necessary the consistency of accounting policies, and the 
application of critical accounting policies and practices and  
any changes to them. The Audit Committee reviews the scope, 
results and cost-effectiveness of internal and external audit, and 
has delegated power from the Board to exercise the power from 
shareholders to agree fees for external auditors. It is responsible 
each year for satisfying itself on the independence and 
objectivity of external auditors and the independence of 
internal auditors. The Audit Committee meets at least three 
times a year.
As directed by the Audit Committee, the principal function  
of the Group’s internal audit team is to verify the physical 
presence and control procedures surrounding the cash,  
pledge and inventory balances within stores and the Group’s 
Jewellery Centre. The internal audit team report to the Audit, 
Security and Compliance executive meetings and the Board  
and Audit Committee reviews those minutes.
The Audit Committee reviews the operation of internal controls 
and reports to the Board on the annual review of the internal 
control and risk management and the effectiveness of the 
financial reporting policies and systems.
Significant issues and areas of judgement considered  
by the Audit Committee
The significant issues and areas of judgement considered by the 
Audit Committee in relation to the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements 2017 are outlined below. We discussed these with 
the external auditor during the year and, where appropriate, 
these have been addressed as areas of audit focus as outlined  
in the independent auditor’s report on pages 32 to 36.
Issue Judgement Role of the Committee
Impairment of personal  
loan receivables
Personal loan receivables are impaired 
based on the number of payments 
missed based on the original loan 
agreement with the customer.
Impairment is calculated using historical 
payment performance to estimate the 
value and timing of future payments for 
each level of customer arrears.
The key judgements in respect of the 
impairment calculation are:
• The point at which to impair a loan 
account; and
• Whether historical performance 
provides a suitable method to project 
future cash flows.
This is a key audit matter for our  
external auditors and is detailed in their 
independent auditor’s report. 
Reviews analysis and recommendations 
produced by the executive team in 
respect of the required impairment.
Reviews the methodology used and the 
performance of the models versus the 
actual result of prior periods.
Consideration of the potential impact on 
future performance of factors such as:
• Rapid growth of the product
• A range of external economic factors 
including consumer indebtedness
• Changing business mix for product 
type and channel
Reviews the preparatory work  
and analysis in respect of the 
implementation of IFRS 9 in 2018.

Issue Judgement Role of the Committee
Recognition of revenue and the 
associated revenue accrual in respect 
of pawnbroking
Interest income is recognised when it 
has been paid, or is expected to be paid 
by the customer.
The interest accrual is calculated  
by using estimates for the expected 
redemption profile of pawnbroking  
loans based on a range of historical 
performance data.
The key judgement in respect of the 
interest accrual is the determination of 
the correct redemption profile to use  
in the model.
This is a key audit matter for our external 
auditors Deloitte and is detailed in their 
Independent Audit Report.
Reviews the application of the  
agreed methodology and supporting 
calculations.
Considers the impact and validity  
of any changes to the basis of the 
redemption predictions.
Considers the impact of changing 
redemption trends and outcomes  
over time and how to implement  
them in the model.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group historically acquired a 
number of businesses and must consider 
whether goodwill requires impairment.
The impairment is based on the future 
cash flows generated by each individual 
cash generating unit (CGU). Expected 
cash flows are based on the Group 
operating budget for the next year  
and assumptions for growth or decline  
in revenues and costs in future years. 
The key judgement is in respect of the 
forecast cash flows for the CGUs.
Reviews the application of the  
agreed methodology and supporting 
calculations.
Considers factors that may impact  
the future performance of the CGUs 
and whether that should be reflected  
in the forecast.
Considers the sensitivity of the 
projections and the amount of 
headroom available before impairment 
is required.
Provisions relating to store  
lease commitments
The Group operates the store estate on 
a leasehold basis. Provisions are required 
in respect of the costs of reinstatement 
of the premises at the end of the lease 
and potentially future lease costs in the 
case of underperforming stores.
The key judgement in respect of 
reinstatement is its cost and timing.
The key judgement for the onerous lease 
provision is the determination of future 
cash flows from the store. 
Reviews the application of the  
agreed methodology and supporting 
calculations.
Considers factors that may impact  
the future performance of the stores 
and whether that should be reflected  
in the forecast.
Considers the sensitivity of the 
projections to changes in the inputs.
Provisions relating to inventories  
and pawnbroking loans
The Group has significant pledge  
and inventory balances whose value  
is supported by precious metals and 
tradeable assets. The Group considers 
the need to recognise a provision in 
respect of these balances if the net 
realisable value (NRV) falls below cost. 
The key judgement in respect of the 
inventory provision is the calculation of 
NRV. NRV is based on the precious metal 
value where available or an estimate of 
the achievable sales price based on the 
age of the piece.
The key judgements in respect  
of the pledge provision are: the NRV;  
the likelihood of the item not being 
redeemed and whether the item is likely 
to be retailed or scrapped.
In both the inventory and pledge 
provision consideration is also given  
to specific provisions and to the 
estimated losses since the last physical 
audit in store.
Reviews the application of the  
agreed methodology and supporting 
calculations.
Considers the overall adequacy  
of the provisions based on  
historical performance and changes  
in asset balances.
Considers changes in the business or 
external environment which may impact 
on the recoverability, particularly gold 
price and redemption trends. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 25

Risk Committee
The Risk Committee comprises three independent  
non-executive directors. The members of the Committee are:
• Malcolm L Berryman (Chairman)
• Peter D McNamara 
• James F Thornton
The Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting 
to the Board on:
• the Group’s risk appetite and framework (the extent and 
categories of risk which the Board regards as acceptable for 
the Company to bear); 
• the Group’s risk management and internal controls framework 
(it’s principles, policies, methodologies, systems, processes, 
procedures and people); and
• in respect of the processes and procedures, the arrangements 
for the identification, assessment, monitoring management  
and oversight of risk.
The Risk Committee owns the Group’s Risk Appetite Statement 
which sets out the Group’s attitude to risk and the ranges and 
limits of acceptable risk taking. The Committee establishes  
the high level qualitative Risk Appetite Statement for the Group, 
the quantitative Risk Appetite Statement and the Key Risk 
Indicators used to measure risk exposure. The statement  
is subject to annual review by the Risk Committee and the 
Group Board.
The Risk Committee is responsible for the Risk Framework  
in place for identification of enterprise level risks (top down 
approach) and identifying risks that occur in the day to day 
processes and operations of the business (bottom up approach). 
The risks identified are recorded in the Corporate Risk Register 
and reviewed by the Committee on a biannual basis.
The Risk Committee reviews the regular reports of the head of 
audit and compliance to oversee the operational effectiveness 
of the risk management framework and the current risk 
exposure measured through the Key Risk Indicators.
The Committee should make recommendations to the Board in 
respect of all risks faced by the Company outside of its declared 
risk appetite.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises three independent 
non-executive directors. The members of the Committee are:
• Peter D McNamara (Chairman)
• Malcolm L Berryman
• James F Thornton
The function of the Nomination Committee is to provide a 
formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment 
of new Directors to the Board. In carrying out its duties,  
the Nomination Committee is primarily responsible for:
• identifying and nominating candidates to fill Board vacancies;
• evaluating the structure and composition of the Board with 
regard to the balance of skills, knowledge and experience and 
making recommendations accordingly;
• reviewing the time requirements of Non-Executive Directors;
• giving full consideration to succession planning; and
• reviewing the leadership of the Group. 26 | www.handt.co.uk
Corporate governance (continued)
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for the continuing process of 
reviewing the effectiveness of the internal controls. Internal 
control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The directors confirm that they have 
reviewed the effectiveness of the systems of internal control 
that have been in operation during the year. The Group operates 
a three lines of defence model, the first line being the systems 
and controls in place to prevent and detect errors, the second 
provided by compliance monitoring and oversight and the third 
by internal audit. 
Internal control: financial
The internal control process has been reviewed and its main 
features are:
• Financial reporting: there is a comprehensive budgeting system 
with an annual budget approved by the Board. Monthly trading 
results are reported against the corresponding figures for the 
budget and previous year. The Board also reviews re-forecasts 
on a regular basis.
• Capital expenditure: there is a comprehensive budgeting 
system for capital expenditure with an annual budget 
approved by the Board. The Finance Director authorises 
individual items of capital expenditure and material items are 
also authorised by the Board or CEO.
• Cash flow: an annual cash flow forecast is drawn up and 
approved by the Board and actual cash flow is reviewed 
monthly against this forecast.
• Organisational structure: a clear organisational structure with 
defined responsibilities and clear authority levels has been set.
• Store audits: a Store Audit function exists to ensure that 
Group procedures regarding cash, pledges and stock handling 
are being adhered to. On average the internal audit visits  
to stores are performed biannually.
• Corporate audits: the Internal Audit Department has a defined 
audit universe and conducts risk based audits in line with  
the annual plan to address all other risks not covered  
within store audits, the universe and plan is approved by  
the Audit Committee. 
Internal control: risk management 
During the year, the Group had in place formalised procedures 
to identify, evaluate and manage significant risks and to enable 
management to assess and regularly report to the Board on 
issues relating to business, operational, financial, regulatory  
and non-compliance risks.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board recognises the importance of communications  
with shareholders. The chief executive’s review on pages  
8 to 11 include a detailed review of the business and future 
developments. There is a regular dialogue with institutional 
shareholders including presentations after the Group’s 
preliminary announcement of the year-end results and at the 
half year results. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 27

gold purchasing, retail of jewellery, cheque cashing, unsecured 
lending and other related services operated through Harvey  
& Thompson Limited. The principal activity of the Company

Statement and Chief executive’s review on pages 2 to 11.
Dividends
The directors propose a final dividend of 6.2p (2016: 5.3p)  
per share subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting  
on 3 May 2018. This proposed dividend, in accordance with  
IAS 10 ‘Events after the balance sheet date’, has not been 
provided for in the attached financial statements. 
During the year, the Company paid the final dividend for the 
year ended 31 December 2016 of 5.3p per share (2015: 4.5p per 
share) and an interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 
2017 of 4.3p per share (2016: 3.9p per share).

Details of the authorised share capital are shown in note 27  
to the consolidated financial statements. The Company has one 
class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. 
Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of 
the Company. During the period 394,273 ordinary shares (2016: 
187,223) of £0.05 each were issued, called up and fully paid as 
part of the Group’s share option and long-term incentive plans.
The nominal issued share capital as at 31 December 2017 was 
£1,871,888 (31 December 2016: £1,852,174).

Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 28.  
Under these share schemes, there are currently potentially an 
additional 1,281,558 shares that will be issued to current option 
holders at the call of the option holder. Under its Articles of 
Association, the Company has authority to allot under these 
share schemes, for cash, up to a maximum of 3,704,349 ordinary 
shares without being required to offer such securities to all 
shareholders in accordance with statutory pre-emption rights.
On any date, no option may be granted under any share option 
scheme or long term incentive plan, if (as a result) the aggregate 
nominal value of ordinary shares issued or issuable pursuant to 
options granted during the previous 10 years under any share 
option scheme would exceed 10% of the nominal value of the 
share capital of the Company in issue on that date.
There are no other potentially dilutive equity instruments in the 
Company in issue at 31 December 2017 or 31 December 2016. 
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. 
With regard to the appointment and replacement of directors, 
the Company is governed by its articles of association, the 
Companies Acts and related legislation and requires certain 
directors annually to retire by rotation. The Articles themselves 
may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. 
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company, such as 
commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease 
arrangements and employees’ share plans. None of these are 
considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact  
on the business of the Group as a whole. Furthermore,  
the directors are not aware of any agreements between the 
Company, or any other Group Company, and its directors  
or employees that provide for compensation for loss of office 
or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.

Directors’ bonus schemes
The Remuneration Committee considers the total remuneration package available to executive directors in light of market practice 
for companies of a similar size and delivering a similar shareholder performance. As part of the total package, executive directors 
are entitled to receive an annual bonus, subject to meeting certain performance conditions. These performance conditions,  
the maximum bonus payable and the proportion paid for on-target performance are set by the Remuneration Committee in advance  
of each financial year.
In 2015 the Board established a cash settled long-term incentive plan based on the performance of the business over the period  
2015-2017 and provided for a payment at the end of the period of no more than 100% of the annual base salary of the director.  
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the audited performance under the plan and approved a payment of 60% of the base salary 
of the directors. No other long-term bonus plan was active in the three year period.
Directors’ pension entitlements
Two directors (2016: 2) were members of money purchase schemes during the year. Contributions paid by the Group in respect  
of such directors were as follows:

Personnel
Details of the number of employees and related costs can be found in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.  
All employees have contracts of employment with Harvey & Thompson Limited, the trading subsidiary in the H&T Group plc group.
Harvey & Thompson Limited maintains a policy of equal opportunities and is committed to ensuring that all individuals are  
treated fairly, with respect and are valued. 
Harvey & Thompson Limited is committed to providing a safe working environment for all employees through a combination  
of procedural and physical security measures. These measures are kept under review and updated as appropriate.
All employees are incentivised through different bonus schemes. Store managers and management also qualify for the approved 
share option scheme (ASOS) while directors and senior management also qualify for the unapproved share option scheme (USOS). 
The executive directors also qualify for the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Further details on share option plans are provided  
in note 28. 30 | www.handt.co.uk
Directors’ report (continued)
Employee consultation
Consultation with employees or their representatives has 
continued at all levels, with the aim of ensuring that their views 
are taken into account when decisions are made that are likely 
to affect their interests and that all employees are aware of  
the financial and economic performance of their stores, regional 
areas and of the Group as a whole. This is achieved through 
formal and informal meetings, weekly information bulletins, 
employee surveys, a quarterly newsletter and every year 
through a store managers’ conference.
Employment of the disabled
It is the policy of the Group to give full and fair consideration 
to the employment of disabled persons in jobs suited to their 
individual circumstances and, as appropriate, to consider them 
for recruitment opportunities, career development and training. 
Where possible, arrangements are made for the continuing 
employment of employees who have become disabled whilst  
in the Group’s employment.
Health and safety
The safety of our customers and employees is of paramount 
importance to the Group. All employees complete annual 
training, and a programme of annual Health and Safety Risk 
Assessments is in place. 
Health and safety standards and benchmarks have also been 
established in the business and compliance is monitored by  
the Board. 
Political contributions
No political contributions were made during the year (2016: £nil).
Going concern
The Group delivered profit after tax of £11.3m for the year ended 
31 December 2017 (2016: £7.6m). The Group also increased its net 
assets to £107.6m (2016: £98.8m). 
The Board has approved a detailed budget for 2018, which 
indicates surplus cash generated from operations for the year 
after accounting for the Group’s forecast levels of capital 
expenditure.  The existing facility with Lloyds Bank plc allowing 
for maximum borrowings of £30.0m, subject to covenants, 
expires in April 2020.  At the year end, £22.0m was drawn on the 
facility.  This strong balance sheet position provides a high level 
of confidence that the Group will be able to repay all liabilities 
as they fall due during 2018 and Q1 2019. The Group met all 
covenants in 2017 and there is no evidence to suggest that they 
will not be met in 2018 or Q1 2019.
In considering the going concern basis of preparation longer 
term forecasts are also reviewed by the Board, with the financial 
forecasts revealing no inability to meet financial covenants  
or repay liabilities. Sensitivity analysis under less favourable 
scenarios designed to test the point at which the Group will 
either have insufficient headroom or breach financial covenants 
have also been prepared and reviewed.  
The Board considers the selected scenarios as remote, and is 
comfortable that mitigating strategies are available to the Group 
to offset liquidity constraints. 
We believe that the current economic climate should have no 
significant negative impact to our business model. The Group 
offering is principally through secured lending against pledges. 
The Group policies on pawn lending remain rigorous and 
prudent, such that the Group has limited exposure to loss in the 
event of customers not redeeming their pledges, due to the 
value of the pledge collateral held, principally being gold and 
precious stones. The Group has no reason to believe that the 
value will not be maintained in the near future. Further details 
are provided in note 26.
Based on the above considerations and after reviewing in detail 
2018 and Q1 2019 forecasts, the directors have formed the  
view that the Group has adequate resources to continue as  
a going concern for the next 12 months and has prepared  
the financial statements on this basis. Principal risks and 
uncertainties to the Group’s business are discussed in more 
detail in the Strategic Report.
Independent auditor and statement of provision  
of information to the independent auditor
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office 
as auditor and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval  
of this report confirms that:
(1)  so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group’s auditor is unaware; and
(2)  the director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies  
Act 2006.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law), including FRS 101 
“Reduced Disclosure Framework” . Under company law the 
directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for 
that period. 
In preparing the parent Company financial statements,  
the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are  
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have  
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies,  
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable  
and understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable  
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit  
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board  
of Directors on 12 March 2018 and is signed on its behalf by:

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of  
the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit 
for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the  
European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice including 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies  
Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements of H& T Group plc  
(the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (together, the ‘Group’)  
which comprise:
• the Group statement of comprehensive income;
• the Group and Parent Company balance sheets;
• the Group and Parent Company statements of changes in equity;
• the Group cash flow statement;
• the Group and Parent Company statements of accounting 
policies; and
• the related notes 1 to 33 and A to F
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable  
law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation  
of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law  
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
“Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.  
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Revenue recognition: accuracy of pledge interest revenue and the associated accrual at the  
balance sheet date
• Valuation of provisioning in relation to personal loan receivables
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £758,000 which is 5.4% of the Group’s  
profit before tax (PBT) figure of £14,102,000.
Scoping We have performed a full audit scope on both H&T Group plc and its subsidiary  
Harvey & Thompson Limited.

Directors’ report
Financial statements
Conclusions relating to going concern
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following matters where:
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of the financial statements  
is not appropriate; or 
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that  
may cast significant doubt about the Group’s or the Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt  
the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the 
financial statements are authorised for issue.
We have nothing  
to report in 
respect of  
these matters. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the period subject to our audit and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement  
(whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall  
audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Revenue recognition: accuracy of pledge interest revenue and the associated accrual at the balance sheet date
Key audit matter 
description
Interest receivable on pawnbroking loans is recognised as interest accrues by reference to the percentage 
of the pawn loans that are estimated to be redeemed and the effective interest rate applicable.  
The pawn loans interest accrual (‘pledge accrual’) is dependent on the estimate that the Group makes  
of the expected level of redeemed pawn loans. Management apply a best estimate of the redemption  
rate based on a historical analysis, in order to determine the interest revenue due on the pledge receivable 
at balance sheet date. There is a risk that the pledge accrual is misstated due to the use of a redemption 
rate estimate which is inappropriate. This accrual totalled £7.4m as at 31 December 2017.
Management use historical data to build up a profile of historical redemption. The profile is the basis  
for estimates of future redemption rates used to calculate the year end pledge accrual. In recent years, 
through evolution in customer redemption patterns, the historical redemption profile has changed over 
time. The redemption rate is a key assumption in driving pledge interest revenue recognition and is a key 
management judgement; hence we consider this to be a key audit matter for the audit.
The estimated redemption on annual lending for the year ended 31 December 2017 is 83.6%  
(Actual redemption of 2016 loans: 84.3%).
Further information regarding the pledge accrual is found within the Corporate governance report on  
page 24 and the critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty on page 47. 
How the scope  
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
We evaluated the design and implementation of controls over the preparation and review of the 
redemption rate estimate used by management to calculate the pledge accrual. We have assessed 
whether management’s application of the redemption rate estimate remains consistent with the prior 
year, and tested whether the judgement regarding future redemption rates is reasonable by:
• Using IT specialists within the audit team to reperform the compilation of historical data into the 
historical redemption profile;
• Analysing historical trends in the rate to assess the appropriateness of the redemption rates,  
taking into consideration shifts in the historical profile;
• Assessing whether the associated interest accrual calculation is compliant with the requirements  
of IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement; and
• Assessing management’s historical forecasting accuracy by performing a retrospective review  
of the prior year pledge interest accrual.
Key observations From the work performed above, we concluded that management’s estimate of the redemption rate 
was appropriate and that the interest recognition policies were appropriately applied. 34 | www.handt.co.uk
Valuation of provisioning in relation to personal loan receivables
Key audit matter 
description
Management apply a best estimate of the likely default on a personal loan based on historical analysis, 
in order to determine the provision value. This estimate requires management to make significant 
judgements regarding the level and timing of expected future cash flows. In recent years,  
the magnitude of the personal loan book has increased significantly. At 31 December 2017 the gross 
loan book totalled £21.6m (2016: £11.1m). 
A risk has been identified in connection with the valuation of the provision in place in relation to 
personal loan receivables. This provision totalled £3.8m as at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £2.1m). 
Further information regarding the loan provision is found within the Corporate governance report on 
page 23 and the critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty on page 48.
How the scope  
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
We evaluated the design and implementation of controls over the calculation and review of the 
personal loan provisioning. We have tested management’s personal loan provision by:
• Assessing whether the personal loan provision calculation is consistent with the requirements  
of IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement;
• Testing the accuracy and completeness of personal loan data used to calculate the provision;
• Challenging the provisioning methodology through discussions with management;
• Analysing historical trends in the default rate to assess for any indication of ongoing increases  
in default; and
• Performing a retrospective review of the prior year provision and subsequent write-offs.
Key observations From the work performed above, we concluded that the inputs and assumptions applied  
in management’s loan provision calculation were reasonable and that the overall estimate  
was appropriate. 
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope  
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
Materiality £758,000 £750,000
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
5.4% of profit before tax. We calculated 3% of net assets as the basis  
of materiality but further capped this at 99%  
of Group materiality.
Rationale for the  
benchmark applied
In determining our materiality benchmark  
we considered the performance indicators  
most applicable to the users of the financial 
statements, the nature of the business and 
comparative audit reports for listed entities. 
Profit before tax is a key measure used by 
analysts in presenting business performance  
to users of the financial statements.
The Parent Company acts principally as  
a holding company and therefore net assets  
is a key measure. The cap has been applied  
in line with our methodology for setting 
materiality for components.

Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £38,000,  
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the  
Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit 
• The Group comprises H&T Group plc and its subsidiary, Harvey & Thompson Limited. Both entities were subject to a full scope  
audit with all work performed by the group engagement team. Our audit work was executed at levels of materiality applicable  
to each individual entity which were lower than group materiality. At the Group level, we also tested the consolidation process.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement 
of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing  
to report in 
respect of  
these matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability  
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis  
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have  
no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance  
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect  
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our independent auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required  
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and or the Parent Company and their environment obtained  
in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate  
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing  
to report in 
respect of  
these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures  
of directors’ remuneration have not been made.
We have nothing  
to report in 
respect of  
these matters.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION
H& T Group plc is a company incorporated in England & Wales under the Companies Act. 
The Company is a public company limited by shares and is registered in England and Wales. The address of the Company’s registered 
office is shown on page 21.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) and the nature of the Group’s operations are set out  
in note 6 and in the chairman’s statement, chief executive’s review, the finance director’s review and the directors’ report.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment  
in which the Group operates. 
2. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Adoption of new and revised standards  
Amendments to IFRSs that are mandatorily effective for the current year
In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2017. Their adoption has not had any 
material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
 Amendments to IAS 7  Disclosure Initiative
 Amendments to IAS 12   Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
 Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2014-2016  Amendments to: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
New and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that  
have been issued but are not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU:
 IFRS 9  Financial Instruments
 IFRS 15   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (and the related Clarifications)
 IFRS 16  Leases
 IFRS 17  Insurance Contracts
 IFRS 2 (amendments)  Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions
 IFRS 4 (amendments)  Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts
 IAS 40 (amendments)  Transfers of Investment Property
 IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments)   Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate  
or Joint Venture
 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle   Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial  
Reporting Standards and IFRS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
 IFRIC 22  Foreign Currency Transactions and Advanced Consideration
 IFRIC 23  Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements  
of the Group in future periods, except as noted below:
IFRS 9 Financial instruments
The Group will apply IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. The Group plans to restate comparatives on initial application of IFRS 9. The full 
impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group’s consolidated financial statements will depend on the financial instruments that the Group  
has during 2018 as well as on economic conditions and judgements made as at the year end. The Group has performed an assessment 
of potential impact of adopting IFRS 9 based on the financial instruments as at the date of initial application of IFRS 9 (1 January 2018). 
Classification and measurement 
With respect to the classification and measurement of financial assets, the number of categories of financial assets under IFRS 9 has 
been reduced compared to IAS 39. Under IFRS 9 the classification of financial assets is based both on the business model within which 
the asset is held and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. 
There will be no impact on the classification and measurement of the personal loans or pawnbroking trade receivables, both are 
measured on amortised cost. 
There will be no change in the accounting for any financial liabilities.  42 | www.handt.co.uk
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017 (continued)
2. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Impairment 
The impairment model under IFRS 9 reflects expected credit losses, as opposed to only incurred credit losses under IAS 39. Under the 
impairment approach in IFRS 9, it is not necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead,  
an entity always accounts for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit  
losses should be updated at each reporting date. Under IFRS 9 there will be a material increase in both revenue and impairment for 
Pawnbroking and Personal Loans.
In respect of the personal loan receivable the Group expects to recognise a loss allowance for 12-month expected credit losses where 
the loan is not in arrears, as the loan falls into arrears the loss allowance will be based on the lifetime expected credit losses as there 
has been a significant increase in credit risk. The Group’s estimate of the loss allowance for these assets as at 1 January 2018 is £2.6m 
greater compared to IAS 39.
In respect of the pawnbroking loan receivable the short-term nature of the agreement results in 12-month expected credit losses being 
the same as lifetime expected credit losses. The Group’s estimate of the loss allowance for these assets as at 1 January 2018 is £5.2m 
greater compared to IAS 39.
At the date of initial application of IFRS 9, the estimated impact is a decrease in receivables as at 1 January 2018 of £7.8m which,  
net of deferred tax, results in a reduction in net assets of £6.3m. 
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting treatments for both lessors  
and lessees. IFRS 16 will supersede the current lease guidance including IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations when it becomes 
effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group currently expects to adopt IFRS 16 for the year ending 
31 December 2019. No decision has been made about whether to use any of the transitional options in IFRS 16.
IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer. Distinctions  
of operating leases (off balance sheet) and finance leases (on balance sheet) are removed for lessee accounting, and is replaced by  
a model where a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability have to be recognised for all leases by lessees (i.e. all on balance sheet) 
except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets. 
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost (subject to certain exceptions) less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured  
at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted for interest  
and lease payments, as well as the impact of lease modifications, amongst others. Furthermore, the classification of cash flows  
will also be affected because operating lease payments under IAS 17 are presented as operating cash flows; whereas under the IFRS  
16 model, the lease payments will be split into a principal and an interest portion which will be presented as financing and operating 
cash flows respectively.
In contrast to lessee accounting, IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17, and continues  
to require a lessor to classify a lease either as an operating lease or a finance lease.
Furthermore, extensive disclosures are required by IFRS 16.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £30,333,000. IAS 17 does not require the 
recognition of any right-of-use asset or liability for future payments for these leases; instead, certain information is disclosed as 
operating lease commitments in note 29. Our assessment indicates that these arrangements will meet the definition of a lease under 
IFRS 16, and hence the Group will recognise a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability in respect of all these leases unless they 
qualify for low value or short-term leases upon the application of IFRS 16. The new requirement to recognise a right-of-use asset  
and a related lease liability is expected to have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements and the directors are currently assessing its potential impact. It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the 
financial effect until the directors complete the review. 
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted by the 
European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with the AIM Rules.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments that 
are measured at re-valued amounts or fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies below. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out opposite. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 43
Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows 
relating to transactions between the members of the Group are eliminated on consolidation.
Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group  
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ Report.
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition  
is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss  
as incurred.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets  
and liabilities of a subsidiary, or trade and assets previously operated through either sole partnership in limited companies with  
no audited financial statements at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is  
an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount  
of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to  
the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised  
for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject  
to being tested for impairment annually as described above.
On the disposal of a cash generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit  
or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are carried at cost less amortisation less impairment losses. Intangible assets represent 
intangibles which have been separately identified under IFRS 3 arising in business combinations, being customer relationships,  
or meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38, “Intangible Assets” , being principally computer software assets.
Amortisation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is calculated using the expected life of the intangible assets acquired.
Amortisation of other intangible assets (computer software) is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the 
asset less its assessed realisable value over its estimated useful life (6 to 8 years).
The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes 
and estimates being accounted for on a prospective basis.
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or  
losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset, are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognised.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value  
of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:
 Leasehold premises 
 Leasehold improvements Shorter of 7 years or life of lease 
 Computer equipment 
 Computer hardware 3 to 5 years
 Fixtures and fittings 10 years 
 Motor vehicles 4 years
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end. 44 | www.handt.co.uk
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. For inventory acquired for retail sale the cost represents the 
purchase price plus overheads directly related to bringing inventory to its present location and condition and is measured on a first in 
first out basis. For inventory arising from unredeemed pledges the cost represents the amount originally loaned, plus overheads directly 
related to bringing inventory to its present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Where necessary provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and damaged inventory or inventory shrinkage. The provision for obsolete, 
slow moving and damaged inventory represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its market value. The inventory 
shrinkage provision is based on an estimate of the inventory missing at the reporting date using historical shrinkage experience.  
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially 
measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss. 
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss are 
recognised immediately in profit or loss.
In accordance with IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ the Group has classified its financial assets as ‘loans 
and receivables’ and ‘fair value through profit and loss’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets  
and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Loans and receivables
The principal financial assets included in this measurement category are:
Trade receivables
Trade receivables represent amounts due from customers in the normal course of business. Trade receivables include certain amounts, 
namely pledge receivables and personal loan debtors which are interest bearing. The accrued interest arising on these interest bearing 
assets is included in prepayments and accrued income using the effective interest method. All other amounts which are not interest 
bearing are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts, which are charged 
to the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at hand and deposits held with banks with original maturities of three months or less.
Financial assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss 
Only the Group’s derivative financial instruments, of which there are none outstanding at the year end, are recorded as financial assets 
at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL). Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised 
in profit or loss. 
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are 
impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the 
financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been reduced. 
Objective evidence of impairment could include:
• significant financial difficulty of the counterparty; or
•  default on payments; or
•  it becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are 
subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount 
of the allowance account are immediately recognised in profit or loss.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the Group statement  
of comprehensive income to the extent that the carrying amount of the financial asset at the date the impairment is reversed does  
not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017 (continued) Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 45
Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL 
Only the Group’s derivative financial instruments, of which there are none outstanding at the year end, are recorded as financial 
liabilities at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss 
recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability. 
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. All other financial  
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised  
on an effective yield basis. 
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Group 
statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years  
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates  
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using  
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised 
based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged  
or credited in the Group statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly  
to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which  
the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
VAT
The Group is partially exempt for VAT and operates a number of VAT schemes including the Margin Scheme and the Gold Scheme. The 
Group takes advantage of the simpler approach offered by global accounting under the Margin Scheme. Within the financial statements 
sales are disclosed net of VAT payable, other direct expenses and administrative expenses include the cost of irrecoverable input VAT.
Leases
Leases taken by the Group are assessed individually as to whether they are finance leases or operating leases. Leases are classified  
as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.  
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.  
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Group currently has no finance leases. 46 | www.handt.co.uk
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past 
event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can  
be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle  
the present obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect of the time value of money  
is material.
All the Group’s premises are leased under operating leases. The majority of the leases include end of lease rectification clauses which 
impose certain requirements on the Group to complete repairs and maintenance, or re-decoration activities if required. The Group 
provides for both rectification costs and repairs and maintenance obligations. Rectification costs are provided for on signing the  
lease and repairs are provided as Management becomes aware of any significant amounts that will be required.
Share capital and share premium account
There is one class of shares. When new shares are issued, they are recorded in share capital at their par value. The excess of the  
issue price over the par value is recorded in the share premium account.
Incremental external costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are recorded in equity as a deduction, net of tax,  
to the share premium account.
Employee Benefit Trust Shares
Under the terms of the Group Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) for the directors, the Parent Company issued certain shares to an 
Employee Benefit Trust, paid for through the issuance of a loan to the Trust from the Group. The award of shares under the LTIP  
is conditional upon certain vesting criteria, as outlined in note 28. The fair value of the awards made is measured under the policy 
disclosed below for Share Options. 
The Group presents the conditional shares as an adjustment to its own equity at the balance sheet date through the Employee Benefit 
Trust shares reserve, until the point that the shares are awarded, and cease to be conditional awards of shares.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services and interest income provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
• Pawnbroking, or Pawn Service Charge (PSC), comprises interest on pledge book loans, plus auction profit and loss, less any auction 
commissions payable and less surplus payable to the customer. Interest receivable on loans is recognised as interest accrues by 
reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts the estimated  
future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount;
• Retail comprises revenue from retail jewellery sales, with inventory sourced from unredeemed pawn loans, newly purchased 
inventory and inventory refurbished from the Group’s gold purchasing operation. All revenue is recognised at the point of sale;
• Pawnbroking scrap and gold purchasing comprises proceeds from gold scrap sales and is recognised on full receipt of sale proceeds;
• Personal loans comprise income from the Group’s unsecured lending activities. Personal loan revenues have historically been 
recognised net of related impairment charges. In light of the growth of the personal loans segment the Group has changed the 
personal loan revenue recognition policy to better reflect the underlying nature and substance of such revenues. From 1 January 2017 
onwards, revenue has been stated before impairment, with any impairment charge included within other direct expenses in the 
Group statement of comprehensive income. 2016 revenue, gross profit and other direct expenses have been restated. The revenue 
and other direct expenses as previously stated have been increased by £2,351,000. There have been no changes to previously reported 
operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, earnings per share; nor any change to the Group balance sheet or the Group cash 
flow statement; and
• Other services comprise revenues from third party cheque cashing, foreign exchange income, buyback and other income.  
The commission receivable on cheque cashing is recognised at the time of the transaction. Buyback revenue is recognised at the 
point of sale of the item back to the customer. Foreign exchange income represents the commission when selling or buying foreign 
currencies and is recognised at the point of sale. Any other revenues are recognised on an accruals basis.
The Group recognises interest income arising on secured and unsecured lending within trading revenue rather than investment revenue 
on the basis that this represents most accurately the business activities of the Group.
Gross profit
Gross profit is stated after charging inventory, pledge and other services provisions and direct costs of inventory items sold or scrapped 
in the year.
Other direct expenses
Other direct expenses comprise all expenses associated with the operation of the various shops and collection centre of the Group, 
including premises expenses, such as rent, rates, utilities and insurance, all staff costs and staff related costs for the relevant employees.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017 (continued) Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 47
Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated before investment income and finance costs.
EBITDA
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. It is calculated by adding back depreciation  
and amortisation to the operating profit as follows:
2017
£’000
2016
£’000
Operating profit
Depreciation and amortisation
14,669
2,628
10,198
2,942
EBITDA 17,297 13,140
The Board consider EBITDA to be a key performance measure as the Group borrowing facility includes a number of loan covenants 
based on it.
Retirement benefit costs
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme which is contracted into the State Scheme. The amount charged to the 
Group statement of comprehensive income in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable 
in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or 
prepayments in the balance sheet.
Employee share incentive plans
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees (including directors). These payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant by use of a Black-Scholes model or a Stochastic model depending on the vesting conditions attached to each 
scheme. This fair value cost of equity-settled awards is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of any non-market based vesting conditions. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, 
and behavioural considerations. A corresponding credit is recorded in equity.
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Dividends
Dividends are provided for in the period in which they become a binding liability on the Company.
4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in  
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods  
if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
There are no critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the directors  
have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in financial statements.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have  
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year,  
are discussed below.
Pawnbroking loans interest accrual estimation
The Group recognises interest on pawnbroking loans as disclosed in the Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
section above. The pawn loans interest accrual (‘pledge accrual’) is material to the financial statements and is dependent on the estimate 
that the Group makes of the expected level of redeemed pawn loans. The Group estimates the expected redemptions based on the 
historical redemption rates achieved. There is a risk that the actual redemption rate may vary significantly from the historical rate used  
to estimate the pledge accrual at the balance sheet date. The Directors assess the pledge accrual estimate made at the prior balance sheet 
date annually to determine if the actual redemption differs significantly to the previous estimate. No significant differences were noted  
for 2017 or 2016. The sensitivity of the pledge accrual to reasonable changes in the redemption rate is shown in note 26.  48 | www.handt.co.uk
4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (CONTINUED)
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill  
has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The review is conducted annually, in the final 
quarter of the year. The impairment review is conducted at the level of each cash generating unit, which for acquisitions represents  
the specific store or stores acquired.
There was no impairment loss recorded in the current year (2016: £nil). The principal assumptions applied by management in arriving  
at the value in use of each cash generating unit are as follows:
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts over a five year period for each cash generating unit. Forecast EBITDA (used as a proxy for 
cashflows) has been derived by applying the Board approved base budget assumption to each individual stores’ results for the twelve 
months to September 2017. For impairment review purposes, we have used conservative growth assumptions after 2018, even in this 
scenario there is still significant headroom on each CGU. A perpetuity formula has been applied to the cashflows i.e. we have made the 
assumption that periodic cashflows will be received indefinitely. The Group has discounted the cash flows at a pre-tax, risk adjusted 
rate of 12% (2016: 9%).
While the impairment review has been conducted based on the best available estimates at the impairment review date, the Group 
notes that actual events may vary from management expectation.
Trade receivables provisioning
Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount less expected impairment losses. 
A provision for impairment on personal loans is recognised when a loan has no payments due, when contractual monthly payments  
are missed or when a balance is outstanding beyond the final repayment date. Personal Loan provision was £3,875,000 (2016: £2,195,000).
With respect to all provisions that are based on estimates, there is a risk that actual losses incurred will vary significantly from 
management expectation at the balance sheet date, if historical loss rates are not a good indicator of the actual credit risk profile  
of the year-end receivables.
For further details on the provisions and impairment losses, refer to note 26, which show the amounts recorded in the period and the 
sensitivity at the balance sheet date to changes in the key assumptions with respect to impairment losses.
Revenue recognition
Interest receivable on pawnbroking loans is recognised as interest accrues by reference to the percentage of the pawn loans that  
are estimated to be redeemed and the effective interest rate applicable, for more details see Note 20 “Trade and other receivables” .  
The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset 
to that asset’s net carrying amount. The estimated future cash receipts are based on the historical cash receipts experience (the “Pledge 
Redemption”) of the business which vary from month to month. The Group monitors the Pledge Redemption on a monthly basis.
The critical judgement is that the Group does not recognise interest income on the pawn loans that are not expected to be redeemed. 
The Group recognises income on these loans when the related collateral that supports the loan is disposed of, through either the scrap 
or retail operations of the Group. The Group is of the opinion that the revenue earned on the unredeemed pledges is only realised 
from the Group perspective at the point at which the inventory, or scrap item that the Group obtains from the pledge collateral  
is disposed of. In arriving at this treatment, the Group also considers that the transfer value from pawn loans to inventory of the 
unredeemed pledge collateral cannot exceed the cost to the Group of the inventory item which is represented by the underlying  
loan amount provided on the unredeemed pledge item.
Impairment of personal loans
Impairment is calculated using models which use historical payment performance to generate the estimated amount and timing  
of future cash flows from each arrears stage, more information is set out in Note 6 “Operating Segments” . Judgement is applied  
as to the appropriate point at which receivables are impaired and whether past payment performance provides a reasonable guide  
as to the collectability of the current personal loan receivables book.

6. OPERATING SEGMENTS
For reporting purposes, the Group is currently organised into six segments – pawnbroking, gold purchasing, retail, pawnbroking scrap, 
personal loans and other services. 
The principal activities by segment are as follows:
Pawnbroking: 
Pawnbroking is a loan secured against a collateral (the pledge). In the case of the Group, over 99% of the collateral against which 
amounts are lent comprises precious metals (predominantly gold), diamonds and watches. The pawnbroking contract is a six-month 
credit agreement bearing a monthly interest rate of between 1.99% and 10.00%. The contract is governed by the terms of the Consumer 
Credit Act 2008 (previously the Consumer Credit Act 2002). If the customer does not redeem the goods by repaying the secured loan 
before the end of the contract, the Group is required to dispose of the goods either through public auctions if the value of the pledge 
is over £75 (disposal proceeds being reported in this segment) or, if the value of the pledge is £75 or under, through public auctions  
or the retail or pawnbroking scrap activities of the Group.
Purchasing: 
Jewellery is bought direct from customers through all of the Group’s stores. The transaction is simple with the store agreeing a price 
with the customer and purchasing the goods for cash on the spot. Gold purchasing revenues comprise proceeds from scrap sales  
on goods sourced from the Group’s purchasing operations.
Retail: 
The Group’s retail proposition is primarily gold and jewellery and the majority of the retail sales are forfeited items from the 
pawnbroking pledge book or refurbished items from the Group’s gold purchasing operations. The retail offering is complemented  
with a small amount of new or second-hand jewellery purchased from third parties by the Group.
Pawnbroking scrap: 
Pawnbroking scrap comprises all other proceeds from gold scrap sales other than those reported within gold purchasing. The items  
are either damaged beyond repair, are slow moving or surplus to the Group’s requirements, and are smelted and sold at the current  
gold spot price less a small commission. 50 | www.handt.co.uk
6. OPERATING SEGMENTS (CONTINUED)
Personal loans: 
Personal loans comprises income from the Company unsecured lending activities. Personal loan revenues have historically been 
recognised net of related impairment charges. In light of the growth of the personal loans segment the Group has opted to change the 
personal loan revenue recognition policy to better reflect the underlying nature and substance of such revenues. From 1 January 2017 
onwards, revenue has been stated before impairment, with any impairment charge included within other direct expenses in the Group 
statement of comprehensive income. 2016 revenue, gross profit and other direct expenses have been restated accordingly. There have 
been no changes to previously reported operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, earnings per share; nor any change to the 
Group balance sheet or Group cash flow statement.
Other services: 
This segment comprises:
• Third party cheque encashment which is the provision of cash in exchange for a cheque payable to our customer for a commission 
fee based on the face value of the cheque.
• Buyback which is a service where items are purchased from customers, typically high-end electronics, and may be bought back  
up to 31 days later for a fee.
• The foreign exchange currency service where the Group earns a margin when selling or buying foreign currencies.
• Western Union commission earned on the Group’s money transfer service.
Cheque cashing is subject to bad debt risk which is reflected in the commissions and fees applied.
Further details on each activity are included in the chief executive’s review on pages 8 to 11.

*See note 3 Revenue recognition
As disclosed in note 3, gross profit is stated after charging the direct costs of inventory items sold or scrapped in the period.  
Other operating expenses of the stores are included in other direct expenses. The Group is unable to meaningfully allocate the other 
direct expenses of operating the stores between segments as the activities are conducted from the same stores, utilising the same 
assets and staff. The Group is also unable to meaningfully allocate Group administrative expenses, or financing costs or income 
between the segments. Accordingly, the Group is unable to meaningfully disclose an allocation of items included in the Group 
statement of comprehensive income below gross profit, which represents the reported segment results. 
The Group does not apply any inter-segment charges when items are transferred between the pawnbroking activity and the retail  
or pawnbroking scrap activities.

In addition to the amount charged to the income statement and in accordance with IAS 12, the excess of current and deferred tax  
over and above the relative related cumulative remuneration expense under IFRS 2 has been recognised directly in equity. The amount 
released from equity in the current period was £96,000 (2016: charge of £56,000). 56 | www.handt.co.uk
13. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares. With respect to the Group these represent share options and conditional shares granted to employees where 
the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year.
Reconciliations of the earnings per ordinary share and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

The Harvey & Thompson Limited cash generating unit was created when H& T Group plc acquired Harvey & Thompson Limited in 
September 2004. Management is unable to allocate this goodwill by store and accordingly, tests this for impairment at the subsidiary 
entity level. All assets acquired after September 2004 are reviewed for impairment at the related store level. The stores are grouped for 
financial reporting purposes by year of acquisition to facilitate presentation and comparability on a year by year basis. Additionally, 
store performance is monitored by management based on the year of acquisition as the historical performance of an individual store  
is linked to its acquisition date. This approach is reflected in the way management has presented the above cash generating units. 
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.  
The impairment review was conducted as described in note 4.

The customer relationships intangible assets arise from the acquisition of trade and assets of sole partnerships or limited companies 
with no audited financial statements and reflect the repeat business associated with the pawnbroking and pay day advance industry 
from existing customers at the acquisition date of the relevant assets. 
The amortisation period for customer relationship intangible assets is between 6 and 8 years and the amortisation period for software 
intangible assets is 7 years. These amortisation periods reflect the directors’ best estimate of the estimated useful economic lives  
of these intangible assets. 58 | www.handt.co.uk

23. BORROWINGS (CONTINUED)
As at 31 December 2017 the key terms of the Lloyds Bank plc facility were:
 Key Term Description
 Total Facility Size £30m
 Termination Date 30 April 2020
 Utilisation  The facility is available to be drawn down to the full £30m so long as the Company 
remains compliant with leverage and interest cover ratios as stipulated in the  
Credit Agreement.
 Margin  The facility has an interest calculation of LIBOR plus a margin of between 1.75%  
and 2.75%, dependent on ratios as stipulated in the Credit Agreement.
 Interest Payable  Interest due on the loans is payable at each interest period end.  
Interest amounts outstanding at the year-end are included in accruals.
 Fixed Repayments No capital repayments prior to termination date. 
On 1 March 2018, the Group extended the existing facility with Lloyds Bank plc by £5m allowing for maximum borrowings of £35.0m.
Deferred debt issue costs
There were £94,000 of deferred debt issue costs written off in the period to the Group statement of comprehensive income  
(2016: £130,000).
Security
The facility is secured by a fixed and floating charge over various assets of the Group.
Undrawn borrowing facilities
At 31 December 2017, the Group had available £8,000,000 (2016: £15,000,000) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect  
of which all conditions precedent had been met.

As 31 December 2017 465 — 264 132 861
Deferred tax assets and liabilities all relate to the same tax jurisdiction and taxable entities, and are expected to reverse over the same 
time periods. Accordingly, these have been offset in the balance sheet.
The Finance (No 2) Act 2015, which provides for reductions in the main rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 
2017 and to 18% effective from 1 April 2020, was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. Subsequently, the Finance Act 2016,  
which provides for a further reduction in the main rate of corporation tax to 17% effective from 1 April 2020, was substantively enacted 
on 6 September 2016. 
These rate reductions have been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax at the balance sheet date.
The closing deferred tax asset as at 31 December 2017 has been calculated at a rate between 19% and 17% depending on when the 
deferred tax asset is expected to be utilised in future periods. 
The utilisation of the deferred tax asset is dependent on future taxable profits in excess of the profits arising from the reversal  
of existing taxable temporary difference.

The reinstatement provision represents management’s best estimate of the Group’s liability to repair and maintain certain of the 
properties contracted under operating lease agreements and settled at the individual lease end dates. At the reporting date no demand 
to enforce the contractual obligations has been made by the related property landlords.
Provisions for onerous leases are recognised when the Group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease obligations 
exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the lease.

26. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
Fair value
The assumptions used by the Group to estimate the current fair values are summarised below:
(i)  For trade receivables relating to pawnbroking, the fair value has been calculated by adding:
  • The principal outstanding on pawn loans; 
  • The interest receivable accrued using the effective interest rate method based on assumed redemption; and
  •  Assumed scrap profits on the proportion of the Group’s pledge book that is not expected to be redeemed, i.e. those loans upon 
which the Group does not recognise interest due to the uncertainty of recovery.
(ii)  Other trade receivables and other assets are considered to have fair values which are the same as their book values due  
to the short period over which they will be recovered. Book values for both cheque cashing and financial services trade receivables 
are calculated net of provisions, and hence represent the Group’s best estimate of recovery values based upon recent debt 
collections experience.
(iii)  Cash and cash equivalents are all held on interest bearing bank accounts are considered to have a fair value the same as their  
book value. 
(iv)  For borrowings and trade and other payables, the book value approximates to fair value because of their short maturities and 
interest rates where applicable. None of the trade or other payables are interest bearing. The borrowings are all held at floating 
interest rates which approximate market rates, and accordingly, the book value and fair value are the same.
The fair value of the pawnbroking trade receivables is determined using a model where the inputs are derived from historical trends 
monitored by the Group. This valuation therefore falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in IAS 39. The fair value of all other 
financial instruments is equivalent to their book value due to their short maturities.
Financial risks
The Group monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the financial instruments held. The principal risks include credit risk  
on financial assets, and liquidity and interest rate risk on financial liability borrowings. The key risks are analysed below.
Credit risk
Pawnbroking trade receivables
The Group is exposed to credit risk through customers defaulting on their loans. The key mitigant to this risk is the requirement for the 
borrower to provide security (the pledge) in entering a pawnbroking contract. The security acts to minimise credit risk as a customer’s 
pledge becomes the property of the pawnbroker on default of the loan. 
In addition to holding security, the Group further mitigates credit risk by:
i)  Applying strict lending criteria to all pawn loans
Pledges are rigorously tested and appropriately valued. In all cases where the Group lending policy is applied, the value of the pledge 
items is in excess of the pawn loan.
The Group estimates that the current fair value of the security is equal to the current book value. 
ii)  Seeking to improve redemption ratios:
For existing customers, loan history and repayment profiles are factored into the loan making decision. The Group has a high customer 
retention ratio and all customers are offered high customer service levels.
A 1% increase/(decrease) in the Group’s redemption ratio is estimated to impact the pre-tax profit by £90,000/(£90,000). This does  
not account for lost repeat business however, and as such the Group sees more value in retaining a high redemption ratio.
Additionally, the Group is exposed to risk in recovery of the loan amounts, which is considered to be similar to credit risk, due to:
(i)  assets being pledged as security against loans, which are subsequently seized by the police; and
(ii)  assets being pledged as security against loans which are subsequently lost or stolen, resulting in the borrower being relieved of the 
liability to the Group.
The legal title that the Group can enforce on these items, and their ongoing security are therefore vital to the Group to ensure that the 
credit risk is mitigated to an acceptable level. The Group continually reviews and monitors, at both store and at Board level, its internal 
controls to ensure the adequacy of the pledged items. The key aspects of this are:
• Appropriate details are kept on all customers the Group transacts with;
• All pawn contracts comply with the Consumer Credit Act 2006;
• Appropriate physical security measures are in place to protect pledged items; and
• An internal audit department monitors compliance with policies at the Group’s stores.

The Group has not provided for the £8,681,000 (2016: £8,253,00) contractually overdue receivables (i.e. loans where the pawn agreement 
has terminated but the customer has not redeemed the assets) at the reporting date since the realisable value of the security held  
is greater than the carrying value of the pledge loan as disclosed above. The Group does not start the disposition process of the 
unredeemed pledges until three months after the end of the credit agreement since it is commercial practice to allow additional time 
for the customers to redeem their pledged items, for an additional fee. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk would be £52,923,000 (2016: £47,300,000), being the gross carrying amount net of any amounts 
offset and any impairment losses.
Other trade receivables
This class represents amounts recoverable by the Group through receivables arising from the other financial services activities it 
engages in, and is exposed to credit risk through default on the loan amounts for Personal Loans, or default from the drawer for third 
party cheque encashment. On each product the Group employs appropriate policies to mitigate the credit risk including credit checks, 
obtaining legal security provided and appropriate staff recruitment and training policies. The Group monitors the ongoing risk 
associated with this class of financial assets through a continual review of bad debts, modifications to the lending policy, and internal 
audit activities. In the event of default by the customer, the Group has also developed a debt collection department to recover any 
outstanding debt.

26. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
Credit risk (continued)
Cash and cash equivalents
The cash and cash equivalents balance comprises both bank balances and cash floats at the stores. The bank balances are subject to 
very limited credit risk as they are held with banking institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. 
The cash floats are subject to risks similar to any retailer, namely of theft or loss by employees or third parties. These risks are mitigated 
by the security systems, policies and procedures that the Group operates at each store, the Group recruitment and training policies and 
the internal audit function.
The concentration of bank balances by counterparty financial institution is as follows:

Market risk
Pawnbroking trade receivables
The collateral which protects the Group from credit risk on non-redemption of pawn loans is 99% (2016: 99%) comprised of gold, 
jewellery items and watches. The value of gold items held as security is directly linked to the price of gold. The Group is therefore 
exposed to adverse movements in the price of gold on the value of the security that would be attributable for sale in the event  
of default by the borrower. 
A 5% increase/(decrease) in the gold price is estimated to impact the pre-tax profit by £12,000/(£18,000) and represents management’s 
assessment of the reasonably possible change in gold prices.
The Group considers this risk to be limited for a number of reasons. The Group applies conservative lending policies in pawnbroking 
pledges reflected in the blended margin made on retail sales and scrap gold when contracts forfeit. The value of gold for our customers 
is also much greater than the price of gold since jewellery items contain a retail margin. The Group is also protected due to the 
short-term value of the pawn contract (6 months). In the event of a significant drop in the price of gold, the Group could mitigate this 
risk by reducing its lending policy on pawnbroking pledges, by increasing the proportion of gold sold through retail sales or by entering 
gold hedging instruments. Management monitors the gold price on a constant basis. 
Considering areas outside of those financial assets defined under IAS 39, the Group is subject to more significant levels of pricing risk. 
The price of gold will affect future Group profitability in three key ways:
i)   A lower gold price will adversely affect the scrap disposition margins on existing inventory, whether generated by pledge book 
forfeits or via the Group’s purchasing operations. While scrap profits will be impacted immediately, retail margins may be less 
impacted in the short-term. 
ii)   While the Group’s lending and purchasing rates do not track gold price movements in the short-term, any sustained fall in the price 
of gold is likely to cause lending and purchasing rates to fall in the longer term thus potentially reducing future profitability as:
  a. the size of the pledge book and associated yield is directly linked to lending rates, and
  b. assuming constant disposition margins, absolute disposition profits would decrease as lending and purchasing rates decrease 
iii)  A lower gold price may reduce the attractiveness of the Group’s gold purchasing operations.
Conversely, a lower gold price may dampen competition as lower returns are available and hence this may assist in sustaining margins.
Liquidity risk
Borrowings
The Group has significant borrowings exposing it to liquidity risk in both repayment of borrowings and availability of finance. In order  
to mitigate this risk, the Group uses a mixture of short-term and long-term debt finance with banking institutions with high credit-ratings 
assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The current borrowings are disclosed in detail in note 23, which shows that the Group 
has arrangements in place for funding until 2020. At 31 December 2017, the Group also has available £8,000,000 (2016: £15,000,000)  
of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met. This level of headroom  
is considered sufficient to finance operations at the current level, and as described in note 23. On 1 March 2018, the Group extended  
the existing facility with Lloyds Bank plc by £5m allowing for maximum borrowings of £35.0m Furthermore, as shown in note 30,  
the business generates a positive cash flow from operating activities and has discretion in its expansion programme should the Group  
need to improve short-term cash flow.
The Group is in full compliance with all loan covenants.

The amounts reported above for floating rate borrowings include the principal amount of borrowings as well as the interest payable  
on these borrowings. The floating rates used to predict the interest cash flows are based on the relevant LIBOR yield curve derived from 
quoted interest rates. The above amounts are contractual, undiscounted cash flows.
Interest rate risk
Borrowings
The Group is funded based on a combination of equity and bank borrowings. The bank borrowings are all held at floating rates based  
on LIBOR. Accordingly the Group is exposed to cash flow risk through changes in the LIBOR rate impacting cash flows. 
Analysis is shown below to demonstrate the sensitivity on profitability of a 1.0% change in LIBOR, subject to LIBOR being a minimum of 
0%. The analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. 
A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.

Financial Assets
The Group is not exposed to significant interest rate risk on the financial assets, other than cash and cash equivalents, as these are lent 
at fixed rates, which reflect current market rates for similar types of secured or unsecured lending, and are held at amortised cost.

A. Approved Share Option Scheme (‘ASOS’)
The Approved Share Option Scheme is a share option scheme approved by HMRC where favourable tax treatment is received on exercise 
by the employee. The options may be granted to all management from shop manager to executive director level. The Remuneration 
Committee of the ultimate Parent Company, H& T Group plc, sets the performance conditions.
The performance conditions applicable to the options granted in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 have already been met. The performance 
conditions applicable to grants in subsequent years are as follows: 
• Options granted in 2011, 2012 and 2013 become exercisable subject to continued employment within the Group as at the exercise date. 
Early exercise of the options is permitted if an option holder ceases to be employed by reason of death, injury, disability, retirement  
or sale of his employing company.

A. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
H& T Group plc is a Company incorporated in the England & Wales under the Companies Act. The address of the registered office is given  
on page 21. The nature of the Company’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the business overview on pages 4 to 7.
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The Company meets the 
definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 (Financial Reporting Standard 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly,  
the financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 (Financial Reporting Standard 101) ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ as issued by the FRC in July 2015 and July 2016. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for the goods and services. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
These financial statements are separate financial statements. The Company is exempt from the preparation of consolidated financial 
statements, because it is included in the Group financial statements of H& T Group plc. 
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
business combinations, share-based payment, non-current assets held for sale, financial instruments, capital management, presentation  
of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash-flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment  
of assets and related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the Group financial statements of H& T  
Group plc. The Group financial statements of H& T Group plc are available to the public.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the Directors’ Report.
The particular accounting policies adopted are described below.
Taxation
Current UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been  
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Where tax losses are surrendered to, or received from, Group companies,  
the amount received/surrendered is charged/credited to the profit and loss account and treated as payable to/receivable from the  
related Group party that has surrendered/received the losses.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred  
at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the  
financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they  
are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all available  
evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected  
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax  
is measured on a non-discounted basis. 
Investments
Fixed assets investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Dividends 
Dividends receivable from subsidiary undertakings are recorded in the profit and loss account on the date that the dividend becomes  
a binding liability on the subsidiary Company. Under the terms of IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, the Company records dividends arising 
from pre-acquisition profit and loss reserves of its subsidiary undertaking in the profit and loss account and considers whether the 
distribution affects the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary undertaking.
Dividends payable are recorded as a distribution from retained earnings in the period in which they become a binding liability on the Company.
Share options 
The Company’s trading subsidiary, Harvey & Thompson Limited issues share options to employees in that Company, which are equity settled  
in shares of H& T Group plc. Harvey & Thompson Limited determines the fair value of the options granted measured at the date of grant by  
use of a Black-Scholes model or a Stochastic model depending on the vesting conditions attached to each scheme. This fair value cost of 
equity-settled awards is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in the financial statements of Harvey & Thompson Limited, 
based on the estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of any non-market based vesting conditions. 
The Company receives a payment each period, equal to the annual expense recorded in Harvey & Thompson Limited calculated on  
the basis described above. This amount is credited to the profit and loss account each period and is treated in a similar manner to  
a distribution of dividends from Group companies.
