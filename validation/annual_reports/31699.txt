Another year of delivery in 2017
I am pleased to report that the Group has delivered another strong set of annual results, with 
revenue growing by 19.5% to ¬£2,379m and underlying earnings per share increasing by 31% 
to 20.3 pence per share.
We have continued to deliver good like-for -like sales growth in our existing business, as 
well as a significant increase in net contract gains, which are strengthening our presence 
across the world. Allied to this, our strategic initiatives have delivered further operational 
improvements and margin growth.
We announced a number of important contract wins in the year, further extending our 
presence in North America and in the Rest of the World, where there are significant 
structural growth opportunities. Additionally, this year we have entered the Indian market 
through a joint venture, and the initial performance of this business has been encouraging. 
In 2017 we increased our capital expenditure to a record ¬£115m , reflecting the strong 
increase in net contract gains. Our approach to new business is disciplined and focuses on 
ensuring that we generate good returns on investment. Our success is underpinned by our 
ability to deliver an attractive brand line-up and innovative bespoke concepts for our clients 
and customers. We continue to invest in our people, strengthening central, regional and local 
teams around the world.
Dividend
As a result of the Group‚Äôs strong performance, I am pleased to announce that the Board has 
recommended a final dividend of 4.9 pence per share (subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting in February 2018), making a total dividend for the year of 8.1 pence 
per share, which is at the top end of the dividend payout ratio range we announced at the 
time of IPO. The Board also proposes a special dividend of approximately ¬£100m which will 
be in addition to the final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2017 . This reflects our 
confidence in the future of the business and our desire to maintain an efficient balance sheet.
Sustainability
SSP continues to be committed to operating sustainably in its markets and to responsibly 
manage those environmental and social issues which have been identified as material to our 
business. We have made further good progress in the year in the priority areas as set out on 
pages 23 to 25. 
Our employees and stakeholders
The strength of the Group is principally due to our employees‚Äô skills, experience and 
dedication. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our employees for their 
contribution during the year .
Outlook
Looking forward, we have secured some important new business wins, which means our 
pipeline is encouraging. Increasing passenger numbers around the world, both in the airport 
and rail sectors, provide significant structural growth opportunities. I am confident that 
SSP can continue to benefit from these trends and deliver sustainable value creation 
for shareholders. With this in mind, the Board looks forward to delivering another good 
performance in the year ahead.

Overview
The Group delivered a good performance in the year, driven by like-for -like sales growth, new 
contract openings across the world and the ongoing implementation of our programme of 
operational improvements. We are continuing to invest in the development of the business 
and to bring new brands and concepts to our clients and customers. We have made further 
good progress in the development of the business in North America and Asia Pacific, and the 
first year‚Äôs performance of our joint venture in India has been encouraging. 
Strong financial results
The financial performance of the Group is presented on an underlying basis, for which the 
statutory reported results are adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange, the amortisation 
of intangible assets created on the acquisition of the SSP business in 2006 and the revaluation 
of the obligation to acquire an additional share of TFS by the end of the 2018 calendar year . 
The statutory reported performance of the Group is explained in the financial review, with 
detailed reconciliation between statutory and underlying performance provided on page 15.
The Group delivered a strong financial performance in 2017 , with underlying operating profit 
increasing by 27 .0% (on a constant currency basis) to ¬£162.9m, and with a constant currency 
increase, excluding TFS, in the operating margin of 50 bps. The consolidation of TFS added a 
further 30 bps, bringing the Group margin to 6.8%. 
T otal revenue increased by 11.7% on a constant currency basis, including like-for -like 
sales growth of 3.1%, net contract gains of 6.0% and a negative impact of 0.3% from the 
additional leap year day in 2016. The TFS business contributed a further 2.9% to revenue. 
Like-for -like growth in the air sector has again been stronger than the rail sector, driven by 
increasing passenger numbers in most of our markets. 
Net contract gains were 6.0% in the year , an encouraging increase from last year‚Äôs gains 
of 1.7%. We saw very strong contributions from North America and the Rest of the World, 
reporting net gains of c.23% and c.18% respectively. Significant new openings at Chicago 
Midway and JFK T7 airports in North America, and in Hong Kong and China in the Rest of the 
World, have contributed to this strong performance.
We are encouraged by the pipeline of new contracts. During the year we won a number of 
significant new contracts, including at airports in Seattle, Los Angeles and Boston in North 
America, and at Cebu in the Philippines. 
The strong operating margin improvement of 50 bps reflects the like-for -like sales growth 
and further encouraging progress on our strategic initiatives. 
We delivered strong free cash flow of ¬£89.0m, after investing ¬£115.0m in capital 
expenditure (excluding capital contributions from our partners), which was a ¬£19.1m 
increase on the prior year . The increase in capital expenditure reflects our net gains. 
Reported net debt fell from ¬£317 .4m to ¬£262.2m. The reduction in net debt was driven by 
the free cash flow of ¬£89.0m, net of the dividend payment of ¬£29.0m. We have taken the 
decision to increase the ordinary dividend and pay out 40% of net income. This takes the 
payout ratio to the top of the range we gave at the IPO of 30-40%. Furthermore, we are 
proposing a special dividend of approximately ¬£100m, accompanied by a proposed share 
consolidation, which reflects our confidence in the future of the business and our desire to 
maintain an efficient balance sheet.
Summary and outlook
The Group delivered a strong financial performance in the year with good like-for -like sales 
growth, very strong net gains and improvement in operating margin. The new financial year 
has started in line with our expectations and the pipeline of new contracts is encouraging. 
Looking forward we face a higher level of general economic uncertainty, but the significant 
structural growth opportunities and our programme to deliver operational excellence, leave 
us well placed to continue to deliver both for our customers and our shareholders.

According to Airport Council International (ACI)
2
, air passenger 
numbers are expected to grow at 5.2% per annum to 2029, reaching 
more than double the seven billion passengers in 2015. This growth 
is underpinned by a number of factors, including: rising disposable 
incomes (particularly in developing markets, with the emergence of a 
more affluent middle class); the increasing globalisation of business; 
investment in airline capacity, in particular by low-cost carriers which 
have driven prices down and stimulated demand; and investment in 
airport infrastructure, most notably in developing markets.
As a consequence, further growth in passenger numbers is forecast 
over the medium-term in all our geographic markets. Forecasting to 
2040, ACI anticipates these increases to be strongest in the Middle 
East and Africa (7 .7%) and Asia Pacific (6.2%), with India expected 
to become the third largest country by total passenger traffic. 
Smaller increases are forecast for the more mature European (3.7%) 
and North American regions (2.8%)
3
. 
Spend per passenger is influenced by several factors: the quality of 
the catering proposition at airports; the rapid growth of low-cost 
airlines with a typically limited catering offer; and the scaling back 
of on-board services by major flagship carriers which all help drive 
spend levels.
Rail passengers in our key European markets (UK, France 
and Germany) were estimated to total 5.8 billion
4
 in 2016. 
Passenger numbers within these countries have increased at 
an average annual rate ranging from 1.9% to 3.5% since 2013
4
, 
with¬†moderate growth forecast to continue in the medium term. 
Supporting this growth is the ongoing investment in rail infrastructure 
by governments seeking to encourage passengers to switch from 
road to rail transport and to also address environmental concerns
5
. 
This investment has resulted in a significant expansion in track, 
including in the high-speed rail network, which has increased 13% 
since 2010 across the UK, France and Germany, with a further 
40% already planned or under construction in existing projects
6
. 
The investment in new trains, replacement of existing fleets, and 
the expanded track are all set to deliver increased capacity and to 
support greater passenger numbers in the future.
Our marketplace
Our operations are managed on a regional basis and are primarily focused on the airport 
and railway station markets. During 2017 , 61% of our revenues were generated in the air 
sector and 33% in the rail sector.
We estimate that our core market, comprising food and beverage sales in airports and railway stations, was valued at approximately 
¬£1 4bn in 2015
1
. The travel food and beverage market is highly fragmented with the top three players, of which we are one, accounting 
for¬†approximately a third of the global market on the basis of this valuation.
Our market benefits from a number of long-term structural growth drivers:
‚Ä¢ the increasing propensity to travel, driven by rising GDP and disposable incomes;
‚Ä¢ the ongoing trends towards eating out of home and eating on the move; and
‚Ä¢ investment in travel infrastructure, with increasing focus on the provision of food and beverage offerings in travel hubs to drive additional 
commercial revenue streams.

OUR BUSINESS MODEL
This business model is founded  
on five key elements:
Our business model is focused on meeting the food and beverage needs of our clients 
and customers in the complex and challenging travel environment. We are able to 
achieve this through a combination of international scale and local expertise. 
Our proposition to clients is ‚ÄòThe Food Travel Experts‚Äô. This has helped us achieve our 
leading market position and retain our clients over the long term. It will also provide a 
strong platform for profitable growth in the future.
1
Leading market  
positions 
We have leading positions in some of 
the most attractive sectors and regions 
of the travel food and drink market. 
These sectors have a number of long-
term structural growth drivers, such as 
increasing passenger volumes and rising 
spend per passenger, and are supported 
by clients increasingly seeking to develop 
and commercialise their sites.
We have outlets in over 30 countries 
around the world with experienced 
and established teams in all of 
these countries.
2
Local insight and 
international scale 
We combine local insight into markets 
and customers with international scale 
and expertise. A strong local presence 
enables us to understand local customers‚Äô 
tastes and needs, as well as allowing us to 
maintain close relationships with clients 
and brand partners. 
Our international reach enables us to 
benefit from economies of scale, such as 
in procurement and corporate functions 
and systems, as well as being able to share 
best practice across regions, countries 
and sites. STRATEGIC REPORT SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Food travel  
expertise 
We provide a compelling proposition for 
both clients and customers based on 
our food travel expertise, which includes 
a deep understanding of customers‚Äô 
food and beverage needs, an extensive 
range of brands and concepts, a track 
record of innovation and operational 
expertise in logistically demanding 
travel environments.
4
Long-term client 
relationships 
Our principal clients are the owners 
and operators of airports and railway 
stations, with these locations generating 
c.94% of our revenues in 2017 . 
Other locations we operate in include 
motorway service areas, hospitals, sports 
stadia and shopping areas.
We have demonstrated an ability 
to win, build and maintain strong, 
profitable client relationships. We have 
long-standing relationships with many 
of our clients, and have maintained high 
success rates in retaining our contracts.
5
Experienced 
management team 
Our senior management team has 
deep experience and is supported 
by high-quality local management. 
They have substantial expertise within 
the travel food and beverage market and 
broader retail industry. OUR STRATEGY
Our strategy is focused on creating long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, 
delivered through five key levers. We made further progress on each of these levers 
in¬†the period:
1.  Optimising our offer from the positive 
trends in our markets
We are focused on the food and beverage markets in travel locations, 
which benefit from long-term structural growth. We aim to use our 
broad portfolio of brands and retailing skills to drive profitable like-
for -like sales, ensuring that we benefit from the positive trends in 
these markets. 
Like-for -like sales growth in the year was driven by the ongoing 
roll-out of our retailing programmes which are delivering well. 
We have made further good progress on optimising our product 
ranges and the development of premium products to provide 
customers with additional choice. For example, in conjunction with 
celebrity chef, James Martin, we have recently introduced a new 
James Martin‚Äôs Kitchen (JMK) premium range as part of our UK 
on-board rail offer . We have a new first class menu, and in standard 
class we now include JMK premium lines such as Hot Pots and British 
Ham and Barber Cheese baguettes.
2. Growing profitable new space 
The travel food and beverage market in airports and railway stations 
is valued at approximately ¬£1 4bn and is characterised by long-term 
structural growth. It offers excellent opportunities for us to expand 
our business across the globe.
Net contract gains were 6.0%, driven by new unit openings and 
high levels of contract retention. The higher level of net gains in the 
current year was driven by strong performances in North America 
and the Rest of the World. These large and growing markets (where 
we still have a relatively small share), provide attractive expansion 
opportunities and the pipeline of new contracts is encouraging. 
We have strong disciplines around the contract tendering process 
which support our ability to deliver attractive returns from new 
business investment.
Our new business growth is underpinned by our ability to deliver 
attractive and effective food solutions at travel locations 
internationally. An important element of this is the brand line up we 
can offer . Our brands include both international brands which we 
franchise, such as Burger King and Starbucks, our own proprietary 
brands such as Upper Crust and Ritazza, and bespoke concepts and 
local heroes. We have opened a number of units across our range 
of brands in the year including a new look Ritazza at Euston station, 
a Camden Food Company in Dubai International Airport and an 
Upper Crust at Brisbane Airport. We have further expanded our 
relationships with high profile chefs and this year opened our first 
Paul Hollywood outlet, KNEAD, at Euston station, which has been 
well received by our customers. We have also secured a deal with 
Gordon Ramsay to open a new grab-and-go concept in the air sector .
A significant development for us has been our recent entry 
into India. India is the world‚Äôs second most populous country, 
with over one billion inhabitants, and has seen sustained strong 
passenger growth in recent years, which is forecast to continue. 
Infrastructure growth is expected to support this and it has been 
reported that the government is scheduled to invest USD120bn in 
airport infrastructure over the next decade. We acquired 33% of 
TFS in India during the year and will acquire a further 16% interest 
by the end of calendar year 2018. TFS operates over 200 units, with 
operations in six of the main airports in India including Delhi and 
Mumbai, as well as in railway stations. TFS has delivered a strong 
financial performance in the ten months since acquisition and has 
contributed 2.9% to our revenue. 
3. Optimising gross margins 
Gross margin, excluding TFS, increased by 90 bps in the year at 
constant currency. Approximately 30 bps of this improvement is due 
to higher growth in the air sector , which typically has higher gross 
margins but higher concession fees than the rail sector . As anticipated, 
we have started to see some increased food inflation in the business 
and we expect this to continue in the new financial year .
The roll-out of gross margin initiatives is progressing well across 
our regions. Key areas of focus include procurement disciplines, 
range and recipe rationalisation and the management of waste and 
losses. This year we have made good progress in the introduction of 
equipment that automates food preparation processes in our sites. 
This helps to improve the product consistency, as well as driving  
labour efficiency and reducing waste. T o support these initiatives,  
we continue to invest in both central and local resources. 
4.  Running an efficient and effective 
organisation 
We have a multi-year programme of initiatives to improve operating 
efficiency, which is important to the Group given the backdrop of 
ongoing labour cost inflation. Labour efficiencies contributed a 
20¬†bps improvement to our operating margin.
We continue to develop systems to better align labour to sales, 
allowing us to optimise service levels and labour costs. We have 
developed a more standardised, systematised approach to labour 
forecasting and scheduling through a programme called Better 
Service Planning. We have rolled out the new system across the 
UK and initial results are encouraging. We are now undertaking 
further pilot studies across a number of other countries. We are 
also trialling self-scan and self-serve checkouts at a number of 
units, both of which can contribute to greater efficiency and the 
customer experience. 
5.  Optimising investment utilising best 
practice and shared resource 
We have maintained our focus on generating efficiencies to optimise 
our investments, drive returns and use best practice and shared 
resources. We are continuing to look at how shared back office 
services can reduce cost and drive simpler , more efficient processes. 
We have now established two outsourced shared service centres in 
Pune in India and Lodz in Poland which are used by a number of SSP‚Äôs 
countries for financial transaction processing. We continue to look 
for further opportunities to outsource administration and financial 
processes. In addition to this, we have made good progress in driving 
energy efficiencies in the year and have introduced a number of 
programmes which have helped to reduce overall energy usage.

Group performance
We‚Äôve delivered a good set of results with 
further strong profit growth and healthy 
cash generation.
Jonathan Davies, Chief Financial Officer 
Revenue 
Revenue increased by 11.7% on a constant currency basis, 
comprising like-for -like sales growth of 3.1%, net contract gains 
of 6.0% and a negative impact of 0.3% from the additional leap 
year day in 2016. The TFS business contributed a further 2.9% to 
revenue. At actual exchange rates, total revenue grew by 19.5%, 
to¬†¬£2,379.1m. 
Like-for -like sales growth was 3.1%. The growth in the air channel 
has again been strong, driven by increasing passenger numbers in 
all of our major markets. The growth in the rail channel in the UK and 
Continental Europe continues to be impacted by ongoing terrorist 
incidents, strike action in some markets and an increase in disruption 
due to station redevelopments, particularly in London. 
Net contract gains contributed 6.0% to full year revenue growth, 
driven by strong contributions from North America, including at 
Chicago Midway, JFK T7 , T ampa, Minneapolis and Montreal, and the 
Rest of the World, including in Hong Kong, at Beijing and Sanya in 
China, and at Don Mueang and Phuket in Thailand.
T rading results from outside the UK are converted into Sterling 
at the average exchange rates for the year . The overall impact on 
revenue of the movement of foreign currencies (principally the Euro, 
US Dollar, Swedish Krona and Norwegian Krone) in 2017 compared 
to the 2016 average was + 7 .8%. 
Underlying operating profit 
Underlying operating profit increased by 27 .0% on a constant 
currency basis and by 34.2% at actual exchange rates to ¬£162.9m. 
The underlying operating profit margin, excluding TFS, improved by 
50 bps on a constant currency basis and 40 bps at actual exchange 
rates. The consolidation of TFS added a further 30 bps, bringing the 
overall underlying operating profit margin to 6.8%. Margin growth 
has been delivered through a combination of the good like-for -like 
sales growth and the benefits from our strategic initiatives.
Gross margin increased by 110 bps year -on-year, on a constant 
currency basis, or 90 bps when excluding the impact of TFS. Of the 
90 bps improvement, 30 bps is due to the higher sales growth in 
the air sector, where gross margins are typically higher than the rail 
sector . The remaining improvement reflects the ongoing roll-out 
of our strategic initiatives which have helped to reduce the impact 
of ongoing food cost price inflation. Key areas of focus during the 
year were on reinforced procurement disciplines, range and recipe 
rationalisation, and the strengthening of resources and technology 
to manage waste and losses.
Labour costs improved by 60 bps year -on-year, on a constant 
currency basis, with 40 bps of this improvement coming from the 
inclusion of India with its lower labour cost. Excluding India, the 
underlying improvement was 20 bps or 30 bps before absorbing the 
impact of additional share-based payment costs. The improvement 
in labour ratios benefited from the early roll-out of our Better 
Service Planning system, which forecasts sales and supports better 
labour scheduling, and helped to mitigate ongoing labour inflation.
Concession fees rose by 70 bps during the year with the stronger 
growth in sales in the air channel, where concession fees are typically 
higher, contributing 30 bps to the year -on-year increase, and the 
inclusion of TFS a further 10 bps increase. Without these impacts, 
the underlying increase in concession fees year -on-year was 30 bps.
Overheads increased slightly year -on-year with a 10 bps increase, 
although this is entirely due to the inclusion of the India business. 
Excluding India, our overheads remained flat year -on-year reflecting 
further good progress in overhead efficiency. 
Operating profit 
Operating profit was ¬£161.0m (2016: ¬£119.5m), reflecting an 
adjustment for the amortisation of acquisition-related intangible 
assets of ¬£1.9m (2016: ¬£1.9m).

Revenue increased by 27 .8% on a constant currency basis, 
comprising like-for -like growth of 4.9% and net contract gains of 
22.9%. Like-for -like growth benefited from positive trends in airport 
passenger numbers in the North American market, although growth 
in the second half was impacted by changes in airline route scheduling 
and passenger flows at a few of our airports. Contract gains 
benefited from commencing operations at Chicago Midway Airport 
during the second half of the year, where we have been running 
27 temporary units ahead of the redevelopment next¬†year, after 
which we will operate 18 units, with the remaining units being 
subcontracted to a number of business partners. In addition to this, 
we opened important new business in JFK T7 , T ampa, Minneapolis 
and Montreal in the year . 
Underlying operating profit increased by ¬£1.8m to ¬£1 4.3m. 
Operating profit growth was impacted by higher (c.¬£8m at constant 
currency) depreciation arising from the increased capital invested in 
new units which opened during the year . Excluding this, we saw good 
growth in operating profit.

Revenue increased by 4.8% on a constant currency basis, comprising 
like-for -like growth of 2.1 % and net contract gains of 2.7%. Like-for -like 
growth was particularly strong in the air sector , driven by continued 
growth in UK airport passenger numbers and increased spend per 
passenger . T rading in the rail sector continues to be soft, impacted by 
ongoing disruption, due to redevelopment and terrorist incidents.
Underlying operating profit for the UK increased by 23.2% on a 
constant currency basis to ¬£82.1m, and underlying operating margin 
increased by 160 bps to 10.4%, helped by the strong revenue growth 
in the air sector, gross margin optimisation initiatives and labour

to benefit from tourists switching from the Middle East, and also in 
France and Germany. 
Underlying operating profit increased by 18.6% on a constant

STRATEGIC REPORT SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
10 TFS joint venture performance
In October 2016, SSP announced the agreement to create a joint venture with K Hospitality Group, whereby SSP would own a 49% share in 
T ravel Food Services Private Limited (TFS), a leading operator of food and beverage concessions in travel locations in India, through a two 
stage completion.
The Group owns a 33% share in TFS following the completion of the first stage of the acquisition acquired for net consideration of ¬£35m. 
The Group will acquire a further 16% share by the end of the 2018 calendar year for an estimated consideration of ¬£21m.
SSP has management and operational control of the business and hence it is consolidated into SSP‚Äôs financial results. In the first ten months 
of ownership, revenue was ¬£65.2m, with operating profit of ¬£12.9m (see table below). The strong performance was driven by good sales 
growth and strong profit conversion, in part helped by the relatively lower labour costs in India, but also the delay in opening new units 
secured at Delhi airport, which will now open next year .

in the 10 months to 30 September 2017 . In H1 the non-controlling interest share of TFS‚Äôs PAT was 82.9% and in H2, 77 .2%.
Share of profit of associates
The Group‚Äôs share of profit from associates was ¬£3.4m (2016: ¬£1.3m). During the year we disposed of our investment in Avecra, which 
contributed approximately ¬£1m to the associate income in the year .
Net finance costs 
Underlying net finance costs increased year -on-year to ¬£17 .6m, primarily due to movements in foreign exchange rates and higher interest 
rate swap costs. Reported net finance costs were ¬£19.6m, the additional ¬£2.0m being the revaluation of the financial liability to acquire a 
further 16% interest in TFS.
Taxation
The Group‚Äôs underlying tax charge for the year was ¬£33.8m (2016: ¬£24.2m), equivalent to an effective tax rate of 22.7% (2016: 22.5%) of 
the underlying profit before tax. On a reported basis the tax charge for the year was ¬£33.6m (2016: ¬£23.8m).

Revenue increased by 25.5% on a constant currency basis, with 
an increase in like-for -like sales of 7 .4% and net contract gains of 
18.1%. Like-for -like sales were boosted in the second half by strong 
passenger growth in Asia Pacific, particularly in Hong Kong and 
China, and growth in Egypt as passengers slowly start to return to 
the country, although we continue to see very few flights at Sharm 
el Sheikh. Net gains came primarily from new units at airports in the 
Asia Pacific region, including in Hong Kong, at Beijing and Sanya in 
China, and at Don Mueang and Phuket in Thailand. In addition to these 
we have won a tender to operate at Cebu airport in the Philippines, 
through a joint venture.
Underlying operating profit for the Rest of the World was ¬£8.3m, 
an increase of 11.8% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit 
growth was impacted by higher (c.¬£4m at constant currency) 
depreciation arising from the increased capital invested in new 
openings during the year . Excluding this, we saw good growth in 
operating profit.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Non-controlling interests 
The non-controlling interests increased year -on-year by ¬£8.6m to ¬£18.4m. The increase largely reflects the first time inclusion of TFS 
(¬£6.8m) and the growth in our joint venture businesses, most of which are in North America and the Rest of the World. 
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share, which excludes exceptional items, was 20.3 pence per share (2016: 15.5 pence per share). Reported earnings 
per share was 19.5 pence per share (2016: 15.2 pence per share). 
Dividends 
In line with the Group‚Äôs stated priorities for the uses of cash and after careful review of the capital expenditure requirements for the 
coming years, the Board is proposing to increase the dividend payout ratio for this year to 40%, the top end of the range stated in the IPO 
prospectus. This will equate to a final dividend of 4.9 pence per share (2016: 2.9 pence per share), which is subject to shareholder approval at 
the Annual General Meeting. If approved, this will result in a total dividend per share for the year of 8.1 pence (2016: 5.4 pence). 
In addition to this, the Board proposes a special dividend in the region of ¬£100m. The Company is also proposing to undertake a share 
consolidation on the record date of the special dividend. Both of these will contribute to maintaining balance sheet efficiency and reflect our 
confidence in the business. 
The final dividend will be paid, subject to shareholder approval, on 29 March 2018 to shareholders on the register on 16 March 2018. The ex-
dividend date will be 15 March 2018. The special dividend is expected to be paid in April 2018.
The special dividend and share consolidation will be subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be 
held in February 2018. Further details of the special dividend and share consolidation (including the final amount to be paid, the record date 
and proposed payment date for the special dividend) will be set out in the notice of Annual General Meeting that will be sent to shareholders 
in January 2018.
Post balance sheet events
On 17 October 2017 , the Group successfully agreed an ‚Äòamend and extend‚Äô of its existing debt facilities, securing an extension of the term 
by two years to July 2022, a slight reduction in the margin payable on the debt and an increase in its Revolving Credit Facility by ¬£100m 
to¬†¬£150m. 
Balance sheet and net debt
The Group‚Äôs balance sheet strengthened in the year, with year end net debt reducing to ¬£262.2m (2016: ¬£317 .4m) and net assets increasing 
to ¬£465.0m (2016: ¬£382.7m).
The table below explains the reduction in net debt during the year:
¬£m
Opening net debt (1 October 2016) (317.4)
Net cash flow 67.5
Impact of foreign exchange rates (3.4)
Acquisition of loans and other financial assets arising on business combination (7 .5)
Other (1.4)
Closing net debt (30 September 2017) (262.2)
The reduction in net debt of ¬£55.2m was driven by the net cash flow generation of ¬£67 .5m offset by a foreign exchange translation impact of 
¬£3.4m arising from the weakening of Sterling during the year and the acquisition of loans and other financial assets relating to TFS.
Leverage reduced during the year, leaving net debt:EBITDA at the year end at 1.0 times, compared with 1.6 times at the end of the prior year .  STRATEGIC REPORT SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Comprises consideration of ¬£42.7m adjusted for cash and cash equivalents acquired (¬£15.2m), other financial assets acquired (¬£0.8m) and long and short-term borrowings 
acquired (¬£8.3m), (refer to note 9).
The Group generated net cash flow from operating activities of ¬£255.3m (2016: ¬£188.5m) and underlying free cash flow of ¬£89.0m, 
an¬†increase of ¬£24.0m compared to 2016, driven by the growth in operating profit, and after increased investment in the business. 
Capital expenditure increased by ¬£19.1m to ¬£115.0m, reflecting the increased contract wins in 2017 . 
The payment for the acquisition of the Group‚Äôs current 33% investment in the TFS joint venture in India, after adjusting for net debt acquired, 
was ¬£35.0m. Working capital generated ¬£18.3m of cash flow during the year . The increase of ¬£1 4.5m compared to last year reflected the 
strong sales growth and the fact that some payments at year end fell into October rather than September .
Net finance costs paid of ¬£17 .1m were higher than in 2016, primarily due to movements in foreign exchange rates and higher interest rate 
swap costs.
The dividend paid of ¬£29.0m reflected the cost of the 2016 final dividend of 2.9 pence per share and the 2017 interim dividend of 3.2 pence 
per share. Overall, the Group generated net cash flow of ¬£60.0m during the year .
Summary
Our overall financial performance has been strong, with good progress on underlying operating margin, up 80 bps on a constant currency 
basis, and healthy cash generation, despite increasing investment in the business. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, providing 
capacity for further growth.

Definition ‚Äì Revenue represents amounts for catering and retail 
goods and services sold to customers excluding value added tax 
and similar items. 
Comment ‚Äì T otal revenue grew by 19.5% to ¬£2,379.1m (at actual 
exchange rates). The overall impact on revenue of the movement 
in currencies (principally the Euro, US Dollar , Swedish Krona, and 
Norwegian Krone) was + 7 .8%.
Definition ‚Äì Like-for -like sales represent revenues generated in an 
equivalent period in each financial year in outlets which have been 
open for a minimum of 12 months. 
Revenue in outlets which have been open for less than 12 months 
are excluded from like-for -like sales and classified as contract gains. 
Prior period revenues in respect of closed outlets are excluded 
from like-for -like sales and classified as contract losses.
Comment ‚Äì Like-for -like sales growth was 3.1%. The growth in the 
air channel has again been strong, driven by increasing passenger 
numbers in all of our major markets. The growth in the rail channel 
in the UK and Continental Europe continues to be impacted by 
ongoing terrorist incidents, strike action in some markets and an 
increase in disruption due to station redevelopments, particularly 
in London. 
Definition ‚Äì Underlying operating profit margin represents 
underlying operating profit as a percentage of revenue.
Comment ‚Äì Underlying operating profit margin improved by 80 bps 
on a constant currency basis and 70 bps at actual exchange rates 
to 6.8%, as the combination of the good like-for -like sales growth 
and the benefits from our strategic initiatives continue to improve 
our margins.
Definition ‚Äì Revenue at constant currency eliminates the impact of 
foreign exchange rates on reported revenue. Constant currency is 
based on average 2016 exchange rates weighted over the financial 
year by 2016 results. 
Comment ‚Äì Revenue increased by 11.7% in 201 7 on a constant 
currency basis, comprising like-for -like growth of 3.1%, net contract 
gains of 6.0%, acquisition of TFS of 2.9%, offset by a negative 
impact of 0.3% from the additional leap year day in 2016. 
Definition ‚Äì Underlying operating profit represents revenue less 
operating costs excluding in the current period, the revaluation of 
the obligation to acquire an additional 16% ownership share of TFS 
by the end of calendar year 2018 and the amortisation of intangible 
assets arising on the acquisition of the SSP business in 2006. In the 
prior year the underlying basis only excluded the amortisation of 
intangible assets arising on the acquisition of the SSP business 
in 2006. 
Comment ‚Äì Underlying operating profit increased by 27 .0% on a 
constant currency basis, and by 34.2% at actual exchange rates 
to ¬£162.9m. Operating profit was ¬£161.0m (2016: ¬£119.5m), 
reflecting an adjustment for the amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangible assets of ¬£1.9m (2016: ¬£1.9m).
Definition ‚Äì Underlying operating cash flow represents net cash 
flow from operations after capital expenditure, tax and net cash 
flow to and from non-controlling interests and associates. 
Comment ‚Äì Underlying operating cash flow was ¬£103.5m, an 
increase of ¬£25.2m compared to the prior year . The year -on-year 
improvement was driven by strong growth in underlying trading 
profits, and was after a higher level of capital investment (+¬£19.1m 
year -on-year).

14 Alternative performance measures
The Directors use alternative measures for performance analysis as these measures provide additional useful information on the underlying 
trends, performance and position of the Group. These measures are not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with 
other companies‚Äô performance measures. They are not intended to be a substitute for IFRS measures.
Revenue growth
As the Group operates in over 30 countries, it is exposed to translation risk on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which impact the 
Group‚Äôs reported revenue and operating profit. The Group presents its financial results on a constant currency basis to eliminate the effect 
of foreign exchange rates and to evaluate the underlying performance. The table below reconciles reported revenue to constant currency

During 2017 , the Board reviewed the effectiveness of the Group‚Äôs 
system of controls, risk management and high-level internal control 
processes. These reviews included an assessment of internal 
controls, in particular operational and compliance controls and their 
effectiveness, supported by reports from the internal auditor, as 
well as the external auditor on matters identified in the course of its 
statutory audit work.
The Audit Committee supports the Board by regularly reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group‚Äôs system of internal control.
There were no changes to the Group‚Äôs internal control over financial 
reporting that occurred during the year ended 30 September 2017 
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially 
affect, the Group‚Äôs reported financial position.
The key elements of the internal control environment in relation to 
the financial reporting process are as follows:
‚Ä¢ review of the Group‚Äôs strategic plans and objectives by the Board 
on an annual basis;
‚Ä¢ a detailed budget is produced annually in accordance with the 
Group‚Äôs financial processes and is reviewed and approved by 
the Board; 
‚Ä¢ operational reports are provided to Executive Directors on a 
weekly and monthly basis and performance against the budget is 
kept under regular review in accordance with the Group‚Äôs financial 
procedures manual. The Chief Executive Officer reports to the 
Board on performance and key issues as they arise;
‚Ä¢ the Audit Committee assists the Board in the discharge of its 
duties regarding the Group‚Äôs financial statements, accounting 
policies and maintenance of proper internal business, operational 
and financial controls. The Audit Committee provides a direct link 
between the Board and the internal and external auditors through 
regular meetings;
‚Ä¢ the Board has formal procedures in place for approval of 
client contracts, capital investment and acquisition projects, 
with clearly designated levels of authority, supported by post 
investment review processes for selected acquisitions and 
capital expenditure;
‚Ä¢ each country is required to submit a Controls Self-Assessment 
(CSA) confirmation each year to verify its compliance with the 
controls set over core processes. This must be signed off by senior 
management before being submitted to Group;
‚Ä¢ the Board considers social, environmental, governance and ethical 
matters in relation to the Group‚Äôs business and assesses these 
when reviewing the risks faced by the Group; further information 
regarding environmental and ethical matters is available on pages 
23 to 25;
‚Ä¢ the Group has established and rolled out a Code of Conduct, a 
Whistleblowing Policy and an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption 
Policy and training, all of which are refreshed on an ongoing 
basis. T raining has been provided to the Board and to the senior 
management covering the obligations and behaviours of the UK 
listed company, including those on compliance, insider dealing and 
market abuse; and
‚Ä¢ the Group has implemented a review of policies and procedures 
to ensure the risk of facilitating tax evasion by associates 
is minimised.
Risk management framework
The Group‚Äôs risk management framework is designed to ensure that 
material business risks throughout the business are identified and 
effectively managed on an ongoing basis.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group.
This process was in place throughout 2017 and up to the date of 
approval of this annual report and meets the requirements of the 
guidance produced by the Financial Reporting Council. The Audit 
Committee has kept under review the effectiveness of the system  
of internal control and has reported regularly to the Board.
The key features of the risk management process are as follows:
‚Ä¢ the Group conducts an annual risk assessment and local 
management maintain country and regional risk registers. 
The regional/country registers, covering the assessment of risk 
(including social, environmental, governance and ethical matters) 
as well as current and future mitigation activities, are discussed 
by the Executive Committee. The Group maintains a top down 
consolidated risk register covering risks to the overall Group. 
Risks are evaluated in respect of their potential impact and 
likelihood. Key risks are presented to the Risk Committee and  
the Audit Committee;
‚Ä¢ the Board discusses and agrees the principal risks that are included 
in the annual report;
‚Ä¢ a risk management action plan is put in place to further enhance 
the Group‚Äôs risk management capability; and
‚Ä¢ the management of risk and compliance with associated 
polices is considered as part of the Group‚Äôs performance 
management systems.

The following table summarises the principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed, and the actions taken to mitigate those 
risks and uncertainties. Risks are identified as principal based on the likelihood of occurrence and the potential impact on the Group and are 
listed in order of priority. 
T wo new risks have been added to the principal risks since the prior year, indicated as such in the table below.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND PRINCIPAL RISKS CONTINUED
Risk/Risk Priority Risk Description Mitigating Factors
1
Business 
environment
The Group operates in the travel environment where 
external factors such as the general economic and 
geopolitical climate, levels of disposable income, weather, 
changing demographics and travel patterns could all impact 
both passenger numbers and consumer spending. There is a 
risk that the Group is unable to, or poorly placed to, respond 
to these external events.
The travel environment is vulnerable to acts of terrorism 
or war, an outbreak of pandemic disease, or a major and 
extreme weather event or natural disaster which could 
reduce the number of passengers in travel locations.
The Group monitors the performance of individual business 
units and markets regularly. The Executive Directors review 
detailed weekly and monthly information covering a range of 
KPIs, and monitors progress on key strategic projects with local 
senior management. Specific short and medium-term actions 
are taken to address any trading performance issues which are 
monitored on an ongoing basis.
The Group also conducts extensive research to understand 
current levels of customer satisfaction and gathers feedback 
on changing requirements.
The Group has business continuity plans in place including 
liaison with authorities and clients in key locations to ensure 
that contingency plans are comprehensive and complete.
2
Retention of 
existing client 
relationships
The Group‚Äôs operations are dependent on the terms of 
airport and railway station concession agreements. Growth 
is dependent on the Group‚Äôs ability to retain existing 
concession contracts and win new contracts from either new 
or existing clients. The Group‚Äôs clients may turn to alternative 
operators, cease operations, terminate contracts with the 
Group or increase cost pressure on the Group.
The Group‚Äôs local management structures in all its major 
geographies allow it to maintain strong relationships with its 
clients and monitor performance in close partnership with its 
clients‚Äô management teams. 
The Group has an established contact strategy with key clients 
to establish and/or maintain ongoing relationships.
The Group also has an annual online and interview-based 
client survey to ensure any concerns are being addressed. 
Furthermore, the Group proactively seeks to invest in, extend 
and enhance its offers in key locations, working in conjunction 
with clients.
3
Poor execution and 
mobilisation of new 
contracts
There is a risk that the Group may not be successful in 
mobilising new contracts and operating them successfully.
The Group, regional and country senior management teams 
review mobilisation plans to ensure that new openings are 
delivered on time and in line with the specific agreement or 
contract. 
The Group has strengthened the management teams in the 
high-growth regions of Asia Pacific, and India, especially in 
finance and operations.
4
Labour laws 
and¬†unions
Approximately 46% of the Group‚Äôs employees are subject 
to collective bargaining agreements. These are principally in 
France, Germany, Spain, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden 
and the United States.
The Group is also subject to minimum wage requirements 
and mandatory healthcare subsidisation in some of the 
jurisdictions in which it operates, notably North America,  
the United Kingdom and China.
The Group works proactively with all of its unions to ensure that 
the various collective bargaining agreements are appropriate 
for the Group and minimise commercial risks.
The Group is reviewing the impact of changes in remuneration 
structures, including the introduction of the National Living 
Wage and Apprenticeship Levy in the United Kingdom and the 
healthcare bill in the United States and developing mitigating 
strategies across the Group. 
5
Implementation 
of efficiency 
programmes
The Group is continuously seeking new programmes to 
improve efficiency. These change programmes could fail 
to deliver the desired benefits e.g. labour efficiency and 
improvements in waste and loss.
The Group has completed detailed evaluation, planning and 
partial implementation of its major change programmes, 
adapting and responding to feedback on an ongoing basis. 
Where required to aid these programmes, the Group continues 
to utilise specialist expertise in the business, both at a Group 
and a country level.
The Group provides central support with regional CEOs and 
CFOs to facilitate appropriate country actions based on key 
performance indicators linked to margin management.
Group IT also provides support for project management and 
implementation using agreed standard business processes  
and controls.

Changing client 
behaviours
Changing client requirements, such as splitting tenders 
across two or more providers, partnering with operators in 
joint ventures, developing third party purchasing models and 
favouring local brand operators or partnering directly with 
brand owners, may adversely affect the Group‚Äôs business.
The Group has in place a clear ‚ÄòSSP Value Proposition‚Äô that it 
presents to the client to address this risk.
The Group Director of Strategic Partnerships and the 
Group Chief Commercial Officer work closely with country 
management teams to enhance and clarify the Group‚Äôs 
proposition to its clients.
The Group‚Äôs contact strategy  with key stakeholders and clients 
helps to mitigate this risk. This is informed by its annual client 
survey, which is carried out by an independent party.
7
Expansion into  
new markets
The Group‚Äôs strategy involves expanding its business in 
developing markets, including Asia Pacific, India, Eastern 
Europe and the Middle East.
Political, economic and legal systems and conditions in these 
countries are generally less predictable than in countries 
with more developed institutional structures, subjecting 
the Group to additional commercial, reputational, legal and 
compliance risks.
The Group has strengthened the management team in Asia 
Pacific, and India, especially in finance and operations where 
this risk is high and the Group is growing. 
In addition, the Group adopts a joint venture model in 
certain new territories to provide access to existing local 
infrastructure and expertise as well as to help mitigate the risk 
inherent on entering new territories.
The Group has clearly defined authorisation procedures 
for all contract investment to ensure that it is consistent 
with the objectives set by the Board, and fully considers and 
evaluates the risks inherent in expansion into new locations and 
territories.
The Group works with in-house and external advisors to ensure 
the risks of doing business in developing markets are identified 
and, where possible, mitigated before entering those markets.
This includes appropriate due diligence of potential joint 
venture and other local partners.
The Group legal team works closely with country legal and 
operational teams to support business development activities 
and ensure compliance with local requirements.
The risk of working in developing markets is also monitored by 
the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee.
8
Senior management 
capability and 
retention
The performance of the Group depends on its ability to 
attract, motivate and retain key employees. The skills 
developed in our business are highly attractive to other 
companies, which regularly target our staff for recruitment.
The Group may not have sufficient management capability 
at a senior level, such as country leadership, to execute the 
planned operational efficiency programmes and support the 
growth and development of the business.
The Group may not have sufficient resources such as in legal, 
finance and IT, to meet the changing and complex needs of an 
international and growing business.
The Group continues to review key roles and succession plans 
in country and at a Group level. Senior resources have been 
strengthened in a number of strategically important and 
growing businesses. 
The Remuneration Committee monitors the levels of 
remuneration for senior management and seeks to ensure 
that they are designed to attract, retain and motivate the key 
personnel required to run the Group effectively.
The Group carries out an annual talent mapping exercise to 
identify candidates for future roles and continues to invest in 
additional resource to support change initiatives and business 
development programmes. STRATEGIC REPORT SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Intensified 
competition
Competition intensifies as the Group‚Äôs competitors become 
more sophisticated and direct more resources to the 
preparation of tenders and take a more aggressive position 
on commercial terms when tendering for contracts. This 
could put pressure on the Group‚Äôs profitability and reduce 
the availability and attractiveness of contracts.
The Group has developed high-quality ‚Äòbusiness-to-business‚Äò 
marketing collateral to clearly lay out the benefits of working 
with SSP , which it shares with the clients to help them better 
understand the Group‚Äôs proposition from both quantitative and 
qualitative aspects.
The Group‚Äôs strengthened business development team utilises 
the feedback from regular client satisfaction surveys when 
developing new tenders to ensure they remain competitive  
to clients. 
The Group has clear internal benchmarking and investment 
appraisal processes to evaluate tender proposals and to ensure 
that the Group is able to make a competitive offer, as well as 
meet its investment criteria. 
The Group continues to extend its brand portfolio, including via 
partnerships with celebrity chefs, to provide breadth and depth 
as part of a tender process.
10
Impact of Brexit
NEW RISK
There may be a potential impact from Brexit on consumer 
spending, cost inflation and the mobility of EU labour  
in the UK.
The Group carefully monitors the ongoing negotiations of 
the UK‚Äôs exit from the EU and as further impacts of Brexit 
develop and crystallise, the Executive Directors and senior 
management will consider and implement additional  
mitigating actions.
The Group maintains a global portfolio and regularly monitors 
the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on its cash flows, 
mitigating the impact from exchange risk.
The Group‚Äôs pricing and range initiatives are driven by 
continuous monitoring of consumer spend benchmarks.
Various gross margin initiatives including recipe re-engineering 
and procurement rationalisation continue to be pursued, in 
order to mitigate the impact of cost inflation.
The Group continues to develop its UK recruitment strategy to 
ensure SSP is positioned as an attractive employer in the UK.
11
Insufficient 
business 
development 
capability and 
investment
The Group may not be successful in winning new contracts on 
commercially acceptable terms.
The Group may not have the capability to enter new markets 
and capitalise on the business development opportunities 
these provide.
The Group prioritises its investment in new contracts as part of 
the ongoing review of its global pipeline, and the prioritisation 
of its capital investment and resources.
The Group has strengthened the management team in Asia 
Pacific and India, especially in finance and operations. STRATEGIC REPORT SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Risk/Risk Priority Risk Description Mitigating Factors
12
Compliance Risk
NEW RISK
The laws and regulations governing the Group‚Äôs industry 
have become increasingly complex across a number of 
jurisdictions and a wide variety of areas, including, among 
others, food safety, labour, employment, immigration, 
security and safety, health and safety, competition and 
antitrust, consumer protection (including data protection), 
environment, licensing requirements and related 
compliance.
With a UK parent company, the Group is required to comply 
with the provisions of the UK Bribery Act and the new 
legislation aimed at preventing the facilitation of tax evasion, 
as well as the local equivalent laws in the territories in which 
the Group operates.
The Group is required to comply with current data privacy 
laws, in many of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the 
EU, the Company will be subject to the new General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) from May 2018. This requires 
the adoption of stricter data management processes in 
order to address greater rights for individuals, mandatory 
breach reporting and more rigorous compliance obligations. 
There is a risk that the Group fails to comply with the new 
rules or to implement adequate processes to safeguard 
personal data. This could give rise to larger fines, penalties 
and civil action from individuals.
The preparation of food and maintenance of the Group‚Äôs 
supply chain require a base level of hygiene, temperature 
maintenance and traceability, and expose the Group to 
possible food safety liability claims and issues.
The Group has processes in place to ensure compliance with 
local laws and regulations. The Group may obtain external 
advice to supplement the in-house legal and compliance team.
The Group has a Code of Conduct and Anti-Bribery and  
Anti-Corruption Policy and training has been rolled out 
internationally. 
The Group‚Äôs procedures under the policy include regular 
reporting by the businesses into the Risk Committee. 
Compliance is monitored by Internal Audit and the Risk 
Committee on an ongoing basis and all alleged breaches  
of the Code of Conduct and policy are investigated.
The Group has conducted a risk assessment regarding the new 
UK tax legislation and is reviewing its policies and procedures 
in this regard.
The Group has established a GDPR working group with 
representatives from each key division to assess and ensure 
the Group is able to manage GDPR compliance risk. Local 
champions have been identified and the Group is making 
progress to ensure it is compliant with the new rules.
The Group has food safety controls and procedures in place 
that are embedded in the Group‚Äôs operations. These are 
monitored by country management teams on a regular basis 
and appropriate action is taken if any issues are identified. 
T raining sessions are also held in country to ensure compliance 
with these procedures.
13
Execution of 
outsourcing 
programmes
The Group fails to execute outsourcing projects effectively 
resulting in the business as usual being disrupted and the 
introduction of new third party risks.
The Group continues to utilise specialist resources in the 
business to manage implementation and transition projects 
and to use external advisors to provide input into the 
management of risks on such projects. Performance feedback 
is reported to the Executive Committee on a regular basis and 
the Risk Committee periodically. The Group has included the 
outsourcing centres in its Internal Audit review scope. 
The outsourcing partners are highly reputable and were 
selected after a rigorous tender process and extensive  
due diligence.
14
Maintenance/ 
development of 
brand portfolio
The Group‚Äôs success is largely dependent upon its ability to 
maintain its portfolio of proprietary brands as well as the 
brands of its franchisors, and the appeal of those brands for 
clients and customers. The loss of any significant partner 
brands, the inability to obtain rights to new brands over 
time or the diminution in the appeal of partner brands or the 
Group‚Äôs proprietary brands could impair the Group‚Äôs ability 
to compete effectively in tender processes and ultimately 
have a material adverse effect on the Group‚Äôs business.
The Group carries out extensive customer research into 
passengers‚Äô needs and continually analyses market trends in 
order to enhance its brand and concept portfolio on an ongoing 
basis.
The Group continues to strengthen its dedicated brands team 
to work closely with its partner brands and to enable greater 
capacity to attract and manage a broader portfolio of external 
brands. 
15
Cyber threats
The Group becomes exposed to information security and 
cyber threats e.g. Payment Card Industry Data Security 
Standards (PCIDSS).
The Group continually reviews its business continuity plans for 
its supply chain, IT disaster recovery, and information security 
policies and practices to ensure that these meet the changing 
landscape.
The Group‚Äôs segmental business model and IT systems 
structure help to ensure that potential cyber attacks are  
likely to remain isolated locally rather than impacting  
the whole Group.
16
Tax strategy
Risk that reputation is damaged if customers, clients and/or 
suppliers believe that the Group is engaged in aggressive or 
abusive tax avoidance.
The Group has a tax management policy which is based on 
Board guidance to adopt a low risk tax strategy. RISK MANAGEMENT AND PRINCIPAL RISKS CONTINUED 
Viability statement
As detailed on page 8, the Group‚Äôs strategy is focused on creating long-term sustainable value for its shareholders. T aking this into account 
and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the 
Group for a period longer than the 12 months required by the going concern statement. 
The Directors have carried out a robust assessment with reference to the Group‚Äôs current position and performance, the Board‚Äôs risk 
appetite, the Group‚Äôs principal risks and impact on the current business model, future prospects, and solvency and liquidity. 
The viability period has been considered by the Directors and it was concluded that a three-year period remains appropriate. This is 
consistent with the period covered by the Medium T erm Plan which is approved by the Board annually, most recently in July 2017 . The Board 
consider the Group strategy and principal risks of each business unit when approving the plan. It is underpinned by a detailed financial 
model which is based on a variety of assumptions about the key drivers of revenue, profit, capital expenditure and cash flow. The Medium 
T erm Plan review is supported by regular Board briefings provided by the regional and country management, which considers both the 
market opportunity and the associated risks and mitigating factors. These risks are also reviewed as part of the Board‚Äôs annual risk 
assessment process.
As set out on pages 18 to 21, the Board has identified the Group‚Äôs principal risks to delivering the Group‚Äôs strategy. Using these risks, a 
range of reasonable but severe scenarios which could impact the future prospects and performance of the Group were applied to the plan. 
This includes: one that uses as its reference point the 2008/09 financial crisis, when global economic conditions adversely impacted both 
passenger volumes and the spending habits of customers, leading to a rapid and unprecedented drop in like-for -like sales; one that envisages 
an external event that has a significant impact on the travel sector for a number of months; and one that considers the impact of a combined 
short-term decrease in sales and longer -term sustained decline in like-for -like sales. 
Based on the assessment and considering the mitigating controls the Group has in place in case these extreme scenarios occur, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year 
period to September 2020. 
Going concern
In addition, based on the detailed cash flow projections discussed above, as well as the stress-tested scenarios considered, the Directors are 
confident that the Group will be able to operate within its banking covenants and has sufficient liquidity levels for the next 12 months from 
the date of this report. Accordingly, the Directors believe it is appropriate to prepare the Annual Report and Accounts on a going concern 
basis. See page 55 for further details.

22 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Our sustainability strategy is focused on responsibly managing those environmental 
and social issues which have been identified as material to our business. We seek to do 
this in a way which also supports the Group‚Äôs commercial strategy by improving our risk 
management or supporting operational efficiencies.
A named member of the Executive Committee is responsible for each of the four 
elements of our programme: Marketplace; People; Environment; and Community. 
Day-to-day accountability for sustainability is integrated into our core management 
structures and systems. The Board regularly reviews progress of the implementation of 
our strategy. This report provides a summary of our sustainability activity. More detail, 
together with relevant policies, is available at www.foodtravelexperts.com.
Marketplace
We are committed to providing quality products and services to our 
customers, and to ensuring the safety and sustainability of those 
products, and the supply chain behind them.
Our customers
Customer focus is one of our core business values and our 
colleagues seek to empathise with our customers‚Äô needs, making 
their satisfaction our priority. We encourage customers to give us 
feedback on how we are performing and where we can improve using 
our global digital platform ‚ÄòEat on the Move‚Äô. 
We regularly review our menus to ensure we are offering our 
customers choice, and including healthier options. We focus this 
work around SSP‚Äôs own brands, where we have control over product 
ranges and customer messaging. Low fat and low carbohydrate 
options are available on many of our menus around the world. In our 
Spanish business, for example, our ranges include low-cholesterol 
options, freshly made fruit pots or quinoa salads and low-fat dairy 
products, as well as muffins, cookies and cakes which are low in fat 
and sugar . In the UK, we have reviewed our ranges and increased the 
healthy snacking lines on offer in our coffee and bakery brands by 
27% year -on-year . In Scotland, we have carried out a full review of 
our food and beverage ranges on offer in hospitals, with over 70%  
of our products now meeting the NHS healthy eating criteria. 
Sustainable and ethical sourcing
It is a priority for us that the products we sell should come from 
sustainably managed sources and that the people working within 
our¬†supply chain should be fairly treated. 
Our Supplier Code of Conduct, which is aligned to the Ethical 
T rading Initiative‚Äôs Base Code, outlines the standards we expect our 
suppliers to work towards in term of labour standards. Our global 
purchasing teams contact our key suppliers to confirm their 
compliance with the code and our suppliers are also required to 
share their ethical audit data with us via the Supplier Ethical Data 
Exchange (SEDEX). In the year ahead, we plan to use the SEDEX audit 
data to strengthen our understanding of ethical trade risks within 
our largest suppliers. 
In addition to this work, and in line with the requirements of the 
2015 Modern Slavery Act, we operate a due diligence process 
to ensure that modern slavery risks are closely monitored within 
our business and supply chain. Further detail on our approach is 
provided in our separate Modern Slavery statement, available at 
www.foodtravelexperts.com. 
When sourcing ingredients for our products, we require that 
our purchasing and menu development teams across the world 
follow the standards outlined in our Responsible Sourcing Policy. 
Coffee and tea are a core part of our product offer, and we work 
hard to ensure that the majority of the coffees and teas are 
produced in accordance with ethical and sustainable standards, 
such as the Fairtrade or Rainforest Alliance certification schemes. 
Animal welfare is another focus, and this year we have carried out 
a review of our egg sourcing strategy. Following this review, we are 
now working towards targets for all of the eggs used within our 
proprietary brands operating in the UK to be sourced from cage-free 
hens. Our objective is for whole eggs to be from cage-free sources by 
2020 and to reach the same standards for egg ingredients by 2025. 
We will work with our suppliers over the coming year to implement 
any changes.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT CONTINUED
People
Our employees are core to our business success. We invest in our 
people to enable them to reach their full potential, as well as provide 
a positive, non-discriminatory and safe working environment.
Employee engagement and recognition
It is important to us that our employees are fully engaged with the 
business strategy and objectives. We achieve this through a regular 
programme of briefings, huddles, employee conferences and 
updates via our enterprise social network, SSP Connections. In the 
UK, we have conducted employee engagement surveys in a number 
of our M&S units, with managers then working to respond to the 
feedback given as part of the survey.
Learning and development
Our learning and development strategy is focused on growing talent 
from within. We achieve this through a range of bespoke learning 
and development programmes, each tailored to meet the needs of 
individuals, teams and the operating business. Our online training 
tool, Academy Live, has been relaunched this year, and now offers 
training to every new colleague in the UK. From their first day in the 
business, they can access a range of training to help them get up to 
speed in their new role as well as learning valuable skills that can help 
them to develop personally. We have commenced a roll-out to launch 
the Academy in all our other markets. This will enable us to provide 
the same level of training and opportunities across all our markets.
We offer apprenticeship qualifications in a number of our European 
operations, such as Germany, Norway and the UK, and these 
programmes seek to give our team members the opportunity to 
develop their careers into junior managerial roles. 127 of our UK 
colleagues completed apprenticeship qualifications during the 
year, across our eight different qualifications. This includes T eam 
Member colleagues achieving a food and beverage apprenticeship, 
T eam Leaders achieving a supervisory apprenticeship and front-line 
managers completing a management skill qualification. All these 
programmes support individuals to develop their personal skills  
and support career progression.
Across our operations, we have many partnerships at a local level to 
offer career opportunities to people from deprived communities. 
In America, for example, SSP partners with Job-Corp, a no-cost 
education and career technical centre training programme that 
helps young people aged 16-24 to improve their lives through career, 
technical and academic training. SSP colleagues take part in mock 
interviews, and SSP also hosts job fairs and offers employment to 
qualified individuals.
Equal opportunities and diversity
Our Equality Policy outlines our expectation that all our employees 
should be treated with respect and be able to work in an environment 
in which they can realise their potential, free of harassment and 
discrimination in any form. We provide training and guidance to all 
employees to ensure they understand and comply with this policy. 
We have a number of partnerships which promote a more diverse 
workforce. SSP Hong Kong is developing a partnership with a 
local NGO to help the recruitment of more minority groups to help 
grow diversity amongst our unit employees. SSP America works 
with Refugee Focus to mentor and coach refugees and help them 
to gain employment. In Sweden‚Äôs Arlanda Airport, we are working 
with Samhall, an NGO providing job opportunities for people 
with disabilities.

Health and safety
We are committed to maintaining high standards of health

All employees complete training on health and safety, and we 
monitor performance against key safety performance indicators.
Environment
Reducing the environmental impacts of our operations also make 
them more efficient, so makes good business sense. We focus our 
efforts on improving energy efficiency and reducing waste. In the 
majority of our locations, we do not purchase utilities or services 
ourselves, so we continue to work with our clients to improve the 
quality of environmental impact data and look for ways to improve.

STRATEGIC REPORT SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
24 Reducing our carbon footprint 
We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint through a 
programme of improved energy management. Savings are being 
achieved through the installation of business management systems 
and LED lighting systems, both of which are enabling us to deliver 
material savings in energy consumption and carbon emissions. 
During the year, these systems have been rolled out to our M&S 
stores in the UK and Ireland and Spar Express stores in Germany. 
We have also installed half hour meters across a number of our 
European sites, which allow us to check how much energy is being 
used at all times of the day, and new software which switches off 
non-essential refrigeration cases on store closing. 
Where applicable, we have also installed a last person out switch 
linked into the system to shut down non-essential supplies on store 
closing. We are already seeing efficiencies of over 7% in an average 
unit. In the year ahead, we are looking to extend these initiatives 
across all UK and German sites as well as in France, Hong Kong 
and Belgium. 
Reducing our waste to landfill 
Reducing food waste is a priority for our business. A detailed review 
of the food production processes across our global operations 
has enabled us to identify opportunities to reduce waste. This has 
been achieved by making small changes to the way we prepare core 
ingredients such as fish or vegetables, which reduces the overall 
amount of food that is wasted in our kitchens. Volumes of unsold 
food are also being reduced through improved forecasting of 
customer demand cycles to ensure we have the right volumes of 
product available at the right times.
Our units across the world have developed partnerships with local 
charities to donate unsold food. SSP America, for example, works in 
partnership with Food Donation Connection, a company that assists 
restaurants and food service companies with the development and 
implementation of programmes designed to prevent the discarding 
of surplus food that is consumable. SSP Spain has a partnership 
with the Red Cross to donate unsold food to those most in need in 
communities including Malaga, Granada and T enerife.
Community 
Our units support a wide range of local charities, usually nominated 
by our colleagues or our clients. This year SSP America has provided 
extensive support to charities working with communities affected 
by the Houston flooding. In the UK, the SSP Foundation (registered 
charity no. 1163717) is the focus for our fundraising activity. 
The Foundation works with partner charities on projects to promote 
healthy eating and other causes, and also supports employee-
nominated charities in the communities where SSP operates.
During 2017 , the Foundation made grants to 60 charities nominated 
by our colleagues. It also partnered with UK registered charity, 
the Children‚Äôs Food T rust, to fund Let‚Äôs Get Cooking Clubs in 30 
schools and further education colleges near to Leeds and Stansted 
airports and in Greater London. The clubs have offered students the 
opportunity to learn how to cook simple and healthy meals, how to 
budget for food, and how to use up leftovers and avoid waste. In the 
year ahead, our UK colleagues will be actively involved in determining 
the Foundation‚Äôs charitable strategy by voting for a Charity of 
the Y ear .

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
27 UK Corporate Governance Code compliance
Responsibility for good governance lies with the Board. The Board is accountable to shareholders and is committed to the highest standards 
of corporate governance as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code published in April 2016 (the Code). The Code can be found on 
the Financial Reporting Council website at www.frc.org.uk. This Corporate Governance report, together with the Directors‚Äô remuneration 
report set out on pages 37 to 51, describes how the Board has applied the main principles of good governance set out in the Code during the 
year under review. The Company also has an Audit Committee which functions as an internal control and risk management system for the 
Company, as more fully set out on page 31.
Compliance statement
It is the Board‚Äôs view that for the year ended 30 September 2017 the Company has complied with all of the principles set out in the Code 
applicable to this reporting period.
How we govern the Company
Our governance structure comprises the Board and various committees (detailed below), supported by the Group‚Äôs standards, policies and 
controls, which are described in more detail in this report.
The Board
Composition
As at both 30 September 2017 and the date of this report, the Board of Directors was made up of seven members, comprising the Chairman, 
two Executive Directors and four Non-Executive Directors.
John Barton, Ian Dyson, Denis Hennequin and Per Utnegaard are considered by the Board to be independent of management and free of any 
relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. The Board considers that the Non-Executive 
Directors bring their own senior level of experience, gained in their own fields.
Biographical details of each of the Directors currently in office are shown on pages 26 and 27 . The Company‚Äôs policy relating to the terms of 
appointment and the remuneration of both Executive and Non-Executive Directors is detailed in the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Report which 
is on pages 37 to 51.
The Board meets regularly during the year, as well as on an ad hoc basis, as required by business need. The Board met seven times between 
1 October 2016 and 30 September 2017 and attendance at these meetings is shown in the table on page 30. Each Director is also proposing 
to attend the 2018 Annual General Meeting (the 2018 AGM) to answer shareholder questions.
The Company also has an Executive Committee, composed of the Executive Directors and senior management, which meets regularly to 
discuss the business and strategy of the Company.
Responsibilities
The Board manages the business of the Company and may, subject to the Articles of Association and applicable legislation, borrow 
money, guarantee, indemnify, mortgage or charge the business, property and assets (present and future) and issue debentures and other 
securities and give security, whether outright or as a collateral security, for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of any third 
party. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its decision, although its primary role is to direct the strategic development 
of the Group. In addition, the Board sets the Group‚Äôs values and standards and ensures that it acts ethically and that its obligations to its 
shareholders are understood and met. The Board may delegate any of its powers to any committee consisting of one or more Directors.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group‚Äôs systems of risk management and internal control and for reviewing the effectiveness 
of such systems. The Audit Committee oversees the risk management process and provides oversight of internal controls on the Board‚Äôs 
behalf. Details of the Group‚Äôs systems of risk management and internal control (including financial controls, controls in respect of the 
financial reporting process and operational and compliance controls) can be found in the Audit Committee report on pages 33 to 36.
The Board has established a procedure for Directors, if deemed necessary, to take independent professional advice at the Company‚Äôs 
expense in the furtherance of their duties. Every Director also has access to the General Counsel and Company Secretary, who is charged 
with ensuring that Board procedures are followed and that good corporate governance and compliance are implemented throughout the 
Group. T ogether with the Chief Executive Officer and the General Counsel and Company Secretary, the Chairman ensures that the Board 
is kept properly informed and is consulted on all issues reserved to it. Board papers and other information are distributed at times to allow 
Directors to be properly briefed in advance of meetings.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate and clearly defined in accordance with the division of responsibilities set out 
in writing and agreed by the Board.
Director effectiveness and training
In accordance with best practice, the Chairman addresses the developmental needs of the Board as a whole, with a view to further developing 
its effectiveness as a team, and ensures that each Director refreshes and updates his or her individual skills, knowledge and expertise. This is 
supported by regular legal, compliance and governance updates to the Board by the Group General Counsel.
Meetings between the Non-Executive Directors, both with and without the presence of the Chief Executive Officer, are scheduled in 
the Board‚Äôs annual programme. Board meetings are also held at Group business locations to help all Board members to gain deeper 
understanding of the business. This also provides senior managers from across the Group with the opportunity to present to the Board, as 
well as to meet the Directors on more informal occasions.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
28 Succession planning is a matter for the whole Board, rather than for a committee. The Company‚Äôs Articles of Association provide that at 
every Annual General Meeting (AGM), each Director shall retire and seek re-election. New Directors may be appointed by the Board, but are 
subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment. The Articles of Association limit the number of Directors to not 
less than two, save where shareholders decide otherwise. Non-Executive Directors are normally appointed for an initial term of three years 
which is reviewed and may be extended for a further three years. The Board may then invite Non-Executive Directors to serve for a further 
additional period.
A formal, comprehensive and tailored induction is given to all Non-Executive Directors following their appointment, including visits to key 
locations within the Group and meetings with members of the Executive Board and other key senior executives. The induction also covers 
a review of the Group‚Äôs governance policies, structures and business, including details of the risks (including environmental, social and 
governance risks) and operating issues facing the Group.
John Barton is the Company‚Äôs Senior Independent Director . His role includes providing a sounding board for the Chairman and acting as an 
intermediary for the Non-Executive Directors, where necessary. The Board believes that John Barton continues to have the appropriate 
experience, knowledge and independence to continue in this role.
The Chairman ensures that the Board maintains an appropriate dialogue with shareholders.
A performance evaluation of each of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was separately carried out by the Non-Executive Directors 
(without the Chairman being present for the Chairman‚Äôs evaluation and without the Chief Executive Officer being present for the Chief 
Executive Officer‚Äôs evaluation) as part of the September Board meeting. As a result of the evaluation, overall, the Non-Executive Directors 
continue to consider that each of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is effective and more particularly that the Chairman continues 
to provide effective leadership of the Board and to exert the required levels of governance and control and that the Chief Executive Officer 
continues to provide effective management of the business. T o this extent, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer both continue to have 
the full support of the Non-Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors will continue to review the roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer in the year ahead. 
Board effectiveness
A performance evaluation of the Board and of its committees is carried out annually to ensure that they continue to be effective and that 
each of the Directors demonstrates commitment to his or her respective role and has sufficient time to meet his or her commitment to 
the Company.
This year, the Board carried out a formal evaluation in July and August 2017 . The evaluation was conducted externally by 
EquityCommunications, which provides board evaluation services and has no other connection with the Company. The evaluation was 
conducted by means of individual interviews with each Director and the Company Secretary. The scope of the evaluation was broad and 
included Board effectiveness, Board structure and diversity, decision-making processes, corporate strategy and business model, risk, 
succession planning, values and culture, and Board Committees. The findings of EquityCommunications were presented to the Board in 
September 2017 . The Board considered the results of the assessment and agreed that it confirmed strong leadership and management, 
which were key to the success of the Board‚Äôs effectiveness, as well as a sound governance framework and practices compliant with the Code. 
Following this review, the Board also agreed to work on putting together an action plan for the year ending 30 September 2018, which would 
include ensuring continued focus on succession planning and considering the format and delivery of the strategy Board meeting.
In light of this review, the Board confirms that it considers each Director to be effective and that both the Board and its committees continue 
to provide effective leadership and exert the required levels of governance and control. The Board will continue to review its procedures, 
effectiveness and development in the year ahead.
Conflicts of interest
As part of their ongoing development, the Chief Executive Officer may seek two, and the Chief Financial Officer may seek one, external 
non-executive role(s) on a non-competitor board, for which they may retain remuneration in respect of the appointment. In order to avoid any 
conflict of interest, all appointments are subject to the Board‚Äôs approval and the Board monitors the extent of Directors‚Äô other interests to 
ensure that its effectiveness is not compromised.
Each Director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid a situation in which he or she has or could have a direct or indirect interest 
that conflicts or possibly may conflict with the interests of the Company. This duty is in addition to the obligation that he or she owes to the 
Company to disclose to the Board his or her interest in any transaction or arrangement under consideration by the Company. The Company‚Äôs 
Articles of Association authorise the Directors to approve such situations and to include other provisions to allow conflicts of interest to 
be dealt with. The Board follows an established procedure when deciding whether to authorise an actual or potential conflict of interest. 
Only independent Directors (i.e. those who have no interest in the matter under consideration) will be able to take the relevant decision, and 
in taking the decision the Directors must act in good faith and in a way they consider will be most likely to promote the Company‚Äôs success. 
Furthermore, the Directors may, if appropriate, impose limits or conditions when granting authorisation.
Any authorities are reviewed at least every 12 months. The Board considered and authorised each Director‚Äôs reported actual and potential 
conflicts of interest at its September 2017 Board meeting. 
Committees of the Board
The Board has established a number of committees to assist in the discharge of its duties, and the formal T erms of Reference for the principal 
committees, approved by the Board and complying with the Code, are available from the General Counsel and Company Secretary and also 
on the Company‚Äôs website. The T erms of Reference are reviewed regularly and updated where necessary. Membership and details of the 
principal committees are shown on pages 30 to 32. The General Counsel and Company Secretary acts as Secretary to all Board committees.

Nomination Committee
The following sections constitute the Directors‚Äô Nomination Committee report.
Key responsibilities
The Nomination Committee reviews the structure, size and composition of the Board and its committees and makes recommendations with 
regard to any changes considered necessary in the identification and nomination of new Directors, the reappointment of existing Directors 
and appointment of members to the Board‚Äôs committees. It also assesses the roles of the existing Directors in office to ensure that there 
continues to be a balanced Board in terms of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity. The Nomination Committee reviews the senior 
leadership needs of the Group to enable it to compete effectively in the marketplace. The Nomination Committee also advises the Board 
on succession planning for Executive Director appointments, although the Board itself is responsible for succession generally. In addition, 
following a review of its T erms of Reference during the year (see further below), the Nomination Committee advises the Board on significant 
developments in the law and practice of corporate governance.
The Nomination Committee‚Äôs key objective is to ensure that the Board comprises individuals with the necessary skills, knowledge and 
experience to ensure that it is effective in discharging its responsibilities. 
As noted in the Sustainability report on pages 23 to 25, the Group is committed to equal opportunities and non-discrimination throughout 
the business, which includes its approach to its Board members. The Group believes that diversity, including gender and race diversity, but 
also diversity of experience and backgrounds, is important not only in the business generally, but also with respect to each Board member . 
In order to help ensure the Board has the appropriate balance of skills and attributes required for effective decision making and strategy, 
Board appointments are made purely on merit ‚Äì regardless of a person‚Äôs gender, age, disability, race or religion. The Company (and therefore 
the Nomination Committee) does not therefore have set targets for the composition of the Board, so that all employees have an equal chance 
of progressing their careers within the Company and so that the most appropriate people are appointed to the Board.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
30 Board appointment process
The Company adopts a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors and senior executives with due 
regard to diversity and gender . Prior to making an appointment, the Nomination Committee will evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge, 
independence, experience and diversity on the Board and, in the light of this evaluation, will prepare a description of the role and capabilities 
required, with a view to appointing the best-placed individual for the role.
In identifying suitable candidates, the Nomination Committee:
‚Ä¢ uses open advertising or the services of external advisors to facilitate the search;
‚Ä¢ considers candidates from different genders and a wide range of backgrounds; and
‚Ä¢ considers candidates on merit and against objective criteria ensuring that appointees have sufficient time to devote to the position, in light 
of other significant commitments.
In the year ahead, the Nomination Committee will continue to assess the Board‚Äôs composition and how it may be enhanced and will consider 
diversity (gender and experience) and geographic representation and use independent consultants as appropriate to ensure a broad search 
for suitable candidates.

The Board recognises the importance of promoting mutual understanding between the Company and its shareholders through a programme 
of engagement. This includes the maintenance of a regular dialogue between the Board and senior management and major shareholders. 
The AGM provides an opportunity for all shareholders to meet the Board, and shareholders are encouraged to attend and to raise any 
questions at the meeting or in advance of the 2018 AGM (using the email address shown in the Notice of AGM).
The primary method of communication with shareholders is by electronic means, helping to make the Company more environmentally 
friendly by reducing waste and pollution associated with the printing and posting of its annual report. The SSP Group Annual Report and 
Accounts 2017 is available to all shareholders and can be accessed via the Company‚Äôs website at www.foodtravelexperts.com. The Group‚Äôs 
annual and interim results announcements are also published on the Company‚Äôs website, together with other announcements and 
documents issued to the market, such as trading updates and presentations. Enquiries from shareholders may also be addressed to the 
Group‚Äôs investor relations function through the contacts provided on the Group‚Äôs website.
The Notice of AGM is circulated to shareholders at least 20 working days prior to the AGM, and it is company policy not to combine 
resolutions to be proposed at general meetings insofar as they relate to separate issues. All shareholders are invited to the Company‚Äôs AGM, 
at which they have the opportunity to put questions to the Board, and it is standard practice to have the Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees available to answer questions. The results of proxy voting for and against each resolution, as well as 
abstentions, are announced to the London Stock Exchange and are published on the Company‚Äôs website shortly after the AGM.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
32 Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Audit Committee (the Committee), I am pleased to present its report for the year ended 30 September 2017 . 
Throughout the year, the Committee continued to play a key oversight role for the Group. We focused on monitoring the integrity of the 
Group‚Äôs financial reporting, internal control and risk management systems; reviewing the effectiveness of key audit and risk programmes; 
and maintaining processes to oversee business conduct and ethics, including anti-bribery and anti-corruption and whistleblowing 
arrangements. As part of our meetings, we continued our focus on the review of the Group‚Äôs outsourcing projects and the threat of cyber 
security. This year, we also discussed the appropriate accounting treatment for the Group‚Äôs acquisition of our interest in T ravel Food Services 
Private Limited (our Indian joint venture) and the significant impact of the new lease accounting standard (IFRS 16). 
Membership
The Committee held three meetings during the year and comprises myself and three other independent Non-Executive Directors: 
John Barton, Denis Hennequin and Per Utnegaard. Attendance at these meetings is shown on page 30. As Chairman, I have recent and 
relevant financial experience through my past roles as a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of publicly quoted companies. 
The expertise and experience of the members of the Committee is summarised on pages 26 and 27 . Helen Byrne (Company Secretary) acts 
as Secretary to the Committee.
At the Committee‚Äôs request, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Financial Officer and senior members of the SSP Group Finance and 
Business Controls Departments attend meetings of the Committee, together with senior representatives from the internal and external 
auditors. From time to time, the Committee reserves time for discussions without invitees being present. Senior management from the 
wider business is invited to present such reports as are required for the Committee to discharge its duties. The Committee holds private 
sessions with the external and internal auditors without management being present, and I meet privately with both the internal and external 
auditors. I provide regular updates to the Board on the key issues discussed at the Committee‚Äôs meetings.
The Committee receives independent assurance from the Group‚Äôs internal audit function, which is outsourced to Deloitte, and also receives 
updates from the external auditors across a wide range of issues in support of their respective oversight responsibilities. The Committee is 
further supported by the Risk Committee which meets quarterly.
The Committee seeks to balance independent oversight of the matters within its remit with providing support and guidance to management. 
I am confident that the Committee, supported by members of senior management and the internal and external auditors, has carried out its 
duties effectively and to a high standard during the year .
Overview of the year
During the year the Committee:
‚Ä¢ reviewed the Group‚Äôs risk assessment, with particular focus on the risks which were deemed to have increased, either in likelihood or 
impact, along with the supporting action plans to mitigate the risks. In 2017 , areas of particular focus included the Group‚Äôs ongoing 
outsourcing projects (including the transition of certain finance processes to a shared service centre model), the Group‚Äôs management of 
the risks relating to information security, IT disaster recovery and cyber security, including General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and 
the Group‚Äôs Corporate T ax Strategy;
‚Ä¢ reviewed and evaluated the Group‚Äôs internal financial control and risk management systems, whistleblowing arrangements and other 
audit and risk-related arrangements to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities relating to the effectiveness of those systems. 
It also reviewed a number of detailed reports on the internal controls including the Control Self-Assessment results and risk management 
processes within the business units;
‚Ä¢ agreed the scope of both the external and internal annual audit programmes and reviewed the output, and monitored the effectiveness of 
the internal and external auditors;
‚Ä¢ reviewed and monitored the external auditor‚Äôs independence and objectivity, and approved the policy on the engagement of the external 
auditor to supply non-audit services;
‚Ä¢ oversaw the relationship with the external auditor and made recommendations to the Board in relation to reappointment, remuneration 
and terms of engagement;
‚Ä¢ monitored the integrity of the Group‚Äôs financial statements and continued to challenge the assumptions and judgements made by 
management in determining the financial results of the Group, including ensuring that the disclosures in the financial statements 
were appropriate;
‚Ä¢ oversaw the process for determining whether the Annual Report and Accounts presented a fair, balanced and understandable assessment 
of the Group‚Äôs position and performance, business model and strategy; and
‚Ä¢ evaluated and approved the going concern assumption and longer -term viability statements.
A fuller description of the operation of the Committee during the year is set out in this report. I will be available at the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) to answer any shareholder questions about the work of the Committee.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
33 Terms of reference
The terms of reference of the Committee were reviewed and updated during the year and the latest version can be found at 
www.foodtravelexperts.com. 
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and the system of internal control, and for reviewing their effectiveness; this is 
overseen by the Committee on the Board‚Äôs behalf. The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has established a clear organisational structure with defined authority levels. The day-to-day running of the Group‚Äôs business 
is delegated to the Executive Directors of the Group. The Executive Directors meet with both operational and financial management on a 
weekly and monthly basis. Key financial and operational measures are reported on a weekly and monthly basis and are measured against 
both budget and re-forecasts in these meetings.
The Group maintains Group and regional/country level risk registers which outline the key risks faced by the Group including their impacts 
and likelihood along with relevant mitigating controls and actions. On an annual basis, regional and country management teams are required 
to update local risk registers and risk maps to ensure that the key strategic, operational and financial risks in each location are captured 
and prioritised according to likelihood and impact and to identify the risk management activities for each risk. The regional and country risk 
registers are used in conjunction with input from the Executive Committee (refer to page 31 for members) to update the Group risk register . 
The Risk Committee and Executive Committee review the assessment of risk, as well as current and future mitigation activities, at both 
Group and regional/country level. The Committee reviewed this process and a summary of the risk registers during the year .
Following this process, a summary of the principal risks and uncertainties which are currently judged to have the most significant impact on 
the Group‚Äôs long-term performance are set out on pages 18 to 21.
The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the Group‚Äôs financial controls and system of internal control by reviewing the results of the 
Control Self-Assessment confirmations and scope of work and reports of the internal and external auditors during the year .
Internal audit
Deloitte acts as internal auditor to the Company, and the partner responsible is a permanent member of the Risk Committee and reports 
directly to the Audit Committee. Internal audit plays an important role in assessing the effectiveness of internal controls through a 
programme of reviews based on a continuing assessment of business risk across the Group. 
Internal audit is in regular dialogue with the regional Chief Financial Officers and the Group Chief Financial Officer to discuss the output from 
the assurance work and gain an update on the business risks across the Group. Where control deficiencies are noted through the assurance 
work performed, Deloitte will perform follow-up reviews and visits.
The Committee meets regularly with Deloitte to review and progress the Group‚Äôs internal audit plan. The relevant audit plan and procedures 
are aimed at addressing risk management objectives and providing coverage of the risks identified in the regional and country risk registers. 
The internal audit plans have been prepared in accordance with standards promoted by the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors. 
The Committee continues to monitor the effectiveness of internal audit plans in accordance with the Group‚Äôs ongoing requirements.
The Committee considered the output from the 2017 annual internal audit programme of assurance work, reviewed management‚Äôs 
responses to the matters raised and ensured that any action was timely and commensurate with its level of risk, whether real or perceived.
There were no significant weaknesses identified in the year that would materially impact the Group as a whole, but a number of 
recommendations were acted upon within the Group to strengthen controls or develop action plans to mitigate risk. The Committee remains 
satisfied that the Group‚Äôs system of internal controls works well.
The Committee determines the adequacy of the performance of the internal auditor through the quality and depth of findings and 
recommendations. During 2017 , the Committee also carried out an assessment of Deloitte using questionnaires completed by senior 
finance personnel both at Group and in country, along with key members of the business controls, legal and tax departments. The survey 
covered areas such as their organisation, purpose and remit, process management, people and knowledge, performance and communication. 
The survey indicated overall satisfaction with Deloitte‚Äôs interaction with local teams and their understanding of the business and the issues it 
faces. The Committee was satisfied with Deloitte‚Äôs responses to the points raised in the survey.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
34 Anti-bribery and anti-corruption and whistleblowing
SSP has a Group-wide Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy to comply with the Bribery Act 2010 and it periodically reviews its procedures 
to ensure continued effective compliance in its businesses around the world.
The Group‚Äôs Whistleblowing Policy provides the framework to encourage and give all employees confidence to ‚Äòblow the whistle‚Äô and report 
irregularities. Employees are encouraged to raise concerns with designated individuals, including the Executive Directors or the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee. The Committee monitors this policy and reviews annually the number of matters reported and the outcome of 
any investigations.
The Committee will periodically review the Group‚Äôs policies and procedures for preventing and detecting fraud, its systems, controls and 
policies for preventing bribery and for preventing the facilitation of tax evasion, its code of corporate conduct and business ethics and its 
policies for ensuring that the Group complies with relevant regulatory and legal requirements. The Committee receives updates on bribery 
and fraud trends and activity in the business, if any, at least twice a year, with individual updates being given to the Committee, as needed, 
in¬†more serious cases of alleged bribery, fraud or related activities. During the year, the Group updated its training on anti-bribery and  
anti-corruption.
External audit
The effectiveness and the independence of KPMG LLP (KPMG), the Group‚Äôs external auditor, is key to ensuring the integrity of the Group‚Äôs 
published financial information. Prior to the commencement of the audit, the Committee reviewed and approved the audit plan to gauge 
whether it was appropriately focused. KPMG presented to the Committee its proposed plan of work which was designed to ensure there 
are no material misstatements in the financial statements. The Committee considered the accounting, financial control and audit issues 
reported by the external auditor that flowed from the audit work.
During the 2017 financial year, the Committee carried out an assessment of KPMG. This was supported by the results of discussions with 
individual Committee members and questionnaires completed by senior finance personnel both at Group and in country, along with key 
members of the legal and tax departments. The survey covered areas such as communication, the audit approach and scope, the calibre of 
the audit teams, technical expertise and independence. The survey indicated overall satisfaction with the services provided by KPMG, and 
the Committee was satisfied with KPMG‚Äôs responses to the points raised in the survey.
In 2015, the Group tendered its external audit appointment and, as a result, KPMG was reappointed as external auditor . Under the terms of 
the new legislation and in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Group is required to put its external audit process out to tender 
again in 2025. The Committee confirms it is in compliance with the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation Order 201 4.
Auditor independence and non-audit services policy
The Committee has adopted a formal policy governing the engagement of the external auditor to provide non-audit services, taking 
into account the relevant ethical guidance on the matter . This policy is reviewed annually by the Committee. The policy describes the 
circumstances in which the auditor may be engaged to undertake non-audit work for the Group. The Committee oversees compliance with 
the policy and considers and approves requests to use the auditor for non-audit work.
Recognising that the auditor is best placed to undertake certain work of a non-audit nature, the engagements for non-audit services that are 
not prohibited are subject to formal review by the Committee based on the level of fees involved, with reference to the 70% cap that applies. 
Non-audit services that are pre-approved are either routine in nature with a fee that is not significant in the context of the audit, or are audit-
related services.
Details of fees payable to the external auditor are set out in note 5 on page 76. In 2017 , non-audit fees represented approximately 20% of 
the audit fee. KPMG have provided tax compliance services to certain Group companies in 2017 and the non-audit fees in 2017 included 
¬£0.1m of tax compliance fees where local regulations require these to be performed by the local auditor . In response to the new regulations 
SSP has transitioned all other areas of tax work to other advisors.
The external auditor reported to the Committee on its independence from the Group and confirmed it had complied with the independence 
requirements as set out by the APB Ethical Standards for Reporting Accountants. The Committee is satisfied that KPMG has adequate 
policies and safeguards in place to ensure that auditor objectivity and independence are maintained.
Financial reporting
As part of our work to ensure the integrity of the financial reporting, the Committee focused on the following during the year:
‚Ä¢ Goodwill and intangible assets
The Group has a significant goodwill balance, representing consideration paid in excess of the fair value of the identified net assets 
acquired relating to the 2006 acquisition of the SSP business through the purchase of various Compass Group plc subsidiaries by various 
subsidiaries of SSP Group plc. The net assets acquired include intangible assets relating to the Group‚Äôs own brands and franchise rights in 
respect of third party brands which were determined at the date of acquisition. Further goodwill and intangible assets balance includes 
that which was recognised on acquisition of the Indian business during the current financial year (refer to the point below).
The Committee recognises that there is a risk that an asset can become impaired, for example, due to market changes. As a result, the 
Group monitors carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets to ensure that they are recoverable and any specific indicators of goodwill 
or intangible asset impairment are discussed by the Executive Directors with both operational and financial management at Group and 
in country.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
35 The carrying value of goodwill is subject to impairment testing, at least on an annual basis. The carrying values of goodwill and intangible 
assets are reviewed for the identification of a possible indicator of impairment, to ensure that the carrying values are recoverable. This testing, 
including the key assumptions and sensitivity analysis, is reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer and the Group Financial Controller .
After reviewing reports from management and consulting, where necessary, with the external auditor, the Committee is satisfied that the 
financial statements appropriately address the critical judgements and key estimates, both in respect to the amounts reported and the 
disclosures provided. The Committee agrees with management that no impairment needs to be recognised.
‚Ä¢ Acquisition of subsidiary
In October 2016, the Group announced the agreement to create a joint venture, whereby SSP would ultimately own a 49% interest in T ravel 
Food Services Private Limited (TFS). As at 30 September 2017 , SSP owned a 33% share of the business. The Group‚Äôs full year consolidated 
results include ten months of TFS results. In addition, the balance sheet as at 30 September 2017 includes SSP‚Äôs share of the net assets 
acquired and goodwill and intangible assets recognised on acquisition. 
The Committee recognises that there were multiple accounting judgements to consider including: treatment of the acquisition as a 
subsidiary; identification and valuation of intangible assets; and recognition and measurement of the financial liability to acquire a further 
16% share in 2018. The goodwill recognised on acquisition was also subject to impairment review, and this was included in the Group 
annual impairment review as part of the Asia Pacific cash-generating unit.
After reviewing reports from management, the Committee agreed that the Group has control over the relevant activities of TFS including 
establishing budgets and operating plans, appointing key management personnel and ongoing review of performance and reporting 
procedures and therefore agreed with the treatment of the acquisition as a subsidiary. The Committee also reviewed management‚Äôs and 
the external auditor‚Äôs conclusions on the accounting treatment of the goodwill, intangible assets and financial liability in respect of the TFS 
acquisition and agreed with the treatment.
‚Ä¢ Taxation
The Group operates in, and is subject to income taxes in, a number of jurisdictions. Management is required to make judgements 
and estimates in determining the provisions for income taxes and the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements.
The Committee recognises that management judgement is required in determining the amount and timing of recognition of tax benefits 
and an assessment of the requirement for provisions against the recognition of such benefits.
The Committee reviewed the Group‚Äôs tax strategy and received reports and presentations from the Head of T ax highlighting the principal 
tax risks that the Group faces, the tax strategy and the judgements underpinning the provisions for potential tax liabilities. The Committee 
also reviewed the results of the external auditor‚Äôs assessment of provisions for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities and, 
having done so, was satisfied with the key judgements made by management.
‚Ä¢ Viability statement
The Committee agreed the parameters and the supporting analysis for the viability statement as presented on page 22 of the 
Strategic report.
‚Ä¢ Fair, balanced and understandable financial statements
An intrinsic requirement of a Group‚Äôs financial statements is for the Annual Report and Accounts to be fair, balanced and understandable. 
The co-ordination and review of the Group-wide input into the annual report is a sizeable exercise performed within an exacting timeframe, 
which runs alongside the formal audit process undertaken by the external auditor .
The process to ensure that the Committee, and then the Board, are satisfied with the overall fairness, balance and clarity of the document 
has been underpinned by:
‚Ä¢ guidance issued to contributors at an operational level;
‚Ä¢ a verification process dealing with the factual content of the reports; and
‚Ä¢ comprehensive review by the Directors and the senior management team.
Priorities for 2018
In 2018, the Committee will continue to focus on key areas of judgement, risk management, audit and internal controls to ensure the 
management of risks to strategic objectives and the integrity of financial reporting. As in 2017 , areas of focus will include review of: 
the¬†Group‚Äôs risk assessment; the effectiveness and output of the work of the internal and external auditor; and the financial statements, 
disclosure and associated judgements.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
36 Dear Shareholder
I am delighted to present our Directors‚Äô remuneration report for the financial year ended 30 September 2017 , which comprises this 
statement, the Annual report on remuneration on pages 38 to 44 and the Directors‚Äô remuneration policy on pages 45 to 51.
Our current remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at our 2015 AGM. The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) has 
continued to operate in accordance with that policy during the 2017 financial year . The three-year life of the current policy will expire at 
our AGM in February 2018. We will therefore put forward a revised remuneration policy to a binding vote at that meeting. This is set out on 
pages¬†45 to 51.
Key decisions and pay outcomes for the year ended 30 September 2017
The Group‚Äôs performance in 2017 exceeded expectations with excellent top and bottom line growth. Organic like-for -like sales were strong, 
helped by passenger growth in the air sector, and the year saw the highest level of net gains since IPO at 6.0%, with gains of over 20% in 
North America and 18% in Rest of World. The strategic initiatives continued to drive margin improvement across all cost lines and coupled 
with the sales growth resulted in Group operating profit increasing 27% year -on-year and exceeding the budget target by 11.8%. As at 
30 September 2017 , the TSR for the Group stood at 169% since the IPO compared to the top quartile peer group performance of 70%. 
Further information regarding the Group‚Äôs performance can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 25.
In this context, the Committee awarded an annual bonus of 200% of salary to Kate Swann and 100% of salary to Jonathan Davies. 
Further details of performance achieved and the bonus targets set are shown on page 39.
The first PSP awards since IPO, granted in 201 4, are due to vest in February 2018. This is the first year for which we are required to include an 
estimated value of vested PSP awards in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 38. No PSP awards vested in previous years, so 
the single figure for the year has been increased by the inclusion of these awards for the first time. Subject to meeting certain performance 
criteria, as set out on page 40, the 201 4 PSP awards that were made to Kate Swann were 7 41,384 shares and to Jonathan Davies were 
247 ,127 shares (including accrued dividend equivalents to 30 September 2017). The estimated value of the awards shown is based on the 
EPS performance to 30 September 2017 and an estimate of relative TSR performance as described above. Any amendments required 
to these estimates to reflect the actual outcome of the awards will be shown in the Director‚Äôs remuneration report for the year ended 
30 September 2018.
Following a review during the year, our Executive Directors‚Äô base salaries were increased by 2% effective 1 June 2017 , in line with the average 
salary increases awarded to UK employees who are paid on a monthly basis. This resulted in base salaries of ¬£795,906 for Kate Swann and 
¬£424,483 for Jonathan Davies. 
Proposed policy and remuneration for the year ending 30 September 2018
The Committee intends to apply the revised remuneration policy during the year ending 30 September 2018, subject to shareholder approval.
‚Ä¢ The current salaries of Executive Directors will continue to apply from 1 October 2017 . We will review the salaries during the year with any 
changes effective from 1 June 2018, in line with our usual timetable.
‚Ä¢ The annual bonus plan will operate on the same basis as in 2017 . Awards will be primarily based on underlying Group operating profit.
‚Ä¢ The Performance Share Plan will operate on the same basis as in 2017 . We are intending to grant PSP awards in November 2017 
equal to 200% of salary to Kate Swann and 125% of salary to Jonathan Davies. These awards will be subject to performance over the 
three financial years to 30 September 2020. The performance measures will continue to be 75% EPS growth and 25% relative TSR 
performance. The targets for these awards are set out on page 43. 
‚Ä¢ Our Executive Directors have very significant shareholdings. We believe this provides strong alignment to our other shareholders. 
The Committee did consider bonus deferral and additional holding periods for PSP awards, however, given the level of alignment provided 
by these shareholdings it was not considered that the additional complexity of these features would be appropriate.
‚Ä¢ Under the proposed remuneration policy, the only change that is proposed is that the maximum pension contribution (or cash payment in 
lieu of pension) for new Executive Directors has been reduced from 35% to 20% of salary.
What is included in this report
The remainder of the remuneration report is split into two sections in line with legislative reporting regulations.
‚Ä¢ The Annual report on remuneration ‚Äì contains details of pay received by Directors for the whole of the year ended 30 September 2017 . 
We have also explained how we intend to implement our pay model during the year ended 30 September 2018. The Annual report on 
remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM in February 2018.
‚Ä¢ The Directors‚Äô remuneration policy ‚Äì contains details of our revised policy setting out various elements of our approach to Directors‚Äô 
remuneration. The Directors‚Äô remuneration policy will be subject to a binding shareholder vote at the AGM in February 2018 and, if 
approved by a majority of our shareholders, will apply from that date.
I hope very much that shareholders will support the Committee‚Äôs continuing overall approach to remuneration and, on behalf of the 
Committee, I recommend our report to you.
The Directors‚Äô remuneration report as set out on pages 37 to 51 was approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by:

Notes to the table 
(a) Salary and fees ‚Äì this represents the base salary or fees paid in respect of the relevant financial year. These figures are net of ¬£39k for Kate Swann and ¬£6k for 
Jonathan Davies in relation to salary sacrificed for annual leave (2016: Kate Swann ‚Äì ¬£21k and Jonathan Davies ‚Äì ¬£0k).
(b) Benefits ‚Äì this represents the taxable value of all benefits paid in respect of the relevant financial year. Executive Directors‚Äô benefits may include private 
healthcare (for the Director and their family), car allowance or a company car, company fuel card and travel to and from work (including associated tax paid). 
(c) Pension ‚Äì Executive Directors receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension contributions. Kate Swann received a cash allowance of 35% of salary per annum 
and Jonathan Davies received a cash allowance of 21% of salary per annum. No Director accrues retirement benefits under money purchase or defined 
benefit schemes.
(d) Annual bonus ‚Äì this represents the annual bonus payable for the financial year. Further details on the performance assessment for the 2017 financial year are set 
out on page 39. 
(e) Long-term incentives ‚Äì this represents the value of any long-term incentive awards with a performance period ending in the relevant year. No long-term 
incentive plan awards vested in the 2015, 2016 or 2017 financial years as no performance cycles ended in those financial years. The value for 2017 represents 
the assumed vesting of awards granted in 2014 and accrued dividend equivalents (including associated tax credits where appropriate), which are due to vest 
in early 2018 following the end of the relevant performance period as the performance conditions have been substantially met. The value shown is based on a 
preliminary assessment of performance achieved to 30 September 2017 (100% of maximum under the EPS element and 100% of maximum under the relative 
TSR element). In accordance with UK regulations, the share price is assumed to be the average market price for the fourth quarter of 2017 (¬£5.1567). The value 
will be updated in the 2018 annual report once the final vesting outcome is known.
(f) Other ‚Äì this column shows the face value (at the date of issue) of Matching Shares and Dividend Reinvestment provided to the Executive Directors under the UK 
Share Incentive Plan.
(g) Non-Executive Directors ‚Äì following a review of the Non-Executive Directors‚Äô fee arrangements during the 2017 financial year, the fees remained unchanged. 
We expect the next review to take place in the 2018 financial year.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
38 Annual bonus
The bonus for the 2017 financial year was primarily based on underlying Group operating profit performance. 
For Kate Swann, any bonus is based on underlying Group operating profit. For Jonathan Davies, any bonus is based on a combination of 
underlying Group operating profit performance and his personal performance. If the individual performance rating is significantly below 
expectations, the Committee could decide not to award a bonus.
Under this framework Kate Swann had the opportunity to receive an annual bonus up to a maximum of 200% of her base salary and Jonathan 
Davies had the opportunity to receive up to 125% of his base salary.
The Underlying Group operating profit targets and Group performance for the year are set out in the table below.
Targets set at the start of the 2017 financial year* 2017 financial year
Threshold Budget Maximum Group Performance
Underlying Group operating profit Budget -3.0% ¬£136.1m Budget +7 .0% +11.8%
* Budget target adjusted for the acquisition of Travel Food Services Private Limited.
Underlying Group operating profit performance in the year, at constant currency, exceeded budget by 11.8%. 
In considering Jonathan Davies‚Äô personal performance during the year, the Committee took into account a range of objectives including his 
strong contribution to the successful creation of a joint venture with T ravel Food Services Private Limited in India and the management of 
the ongoing outsourcing of the Group‚Äôs finance and accounting functions. 
In determining these bonus outcomes, the Board has considered the sustainability report which includes environmental, social and 
governance issues within which these results were delivered, and has concluded that these bonus outcomes were appropriate. 
Based on this performance, Kate Swann earned a bonus of ¬£1,560,600 (200% of salary) and Jonathan Davies earned a bonus of ¬£416,160 
(100% of salary).

39 Statement of Directors‚Äô shareholding and share interests
Shareholding guidelines require Executive Directors to build up over time a personal shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to 
200% of salary for the CEO and 125% of salary for the CFO. Executive Directors are encouraged to retain vested shares earned under the 
Company‚Äôs incentive plans until the shareholding guidelines have been met. The Chairman and each Independent Non-Executive Director are 
expected to build and then maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to 100% of their annual gross fee. 
The period over which the minimum shareholding must be built up is a three-year period, either from the date of admission (15 July 201 4), or 
from the date of appointment if later . The table below shows details of the Directors‚Äô shareholdings as at 30 September 2017 .

Notes:
(a) For the purposes of determining Executive Director shareholding requirements, the individual‚Äôs salary/fee at 30 September 2017 and the share price at 
29 September 2017 (535.5 pence) have been used. Further, the total shareholding used to calculate the shareholding percentage excludes Matching Shares 
issued under the UK Share Incentive Plan (842 for each Executive Director as at 30 September 2017).
(b) ‚ÄòShares owned outright at 30 September 2017‚Äô includes shares held by persons connected with a Director. It also includes Partnership Shares purchased, 
Matching Shares awarded and Dividend Shares purchased, under the UK Share Incentive Plan.
(c) ‚ÄòInterests in unvested PSP awards‚Äô refers to Performance Share Plan awards granted in July 2014, November 2015 and November 2016. The performance 
conditions for each award are described in (i), (ii) and (iii) below.
(i) 2014 PSP awards: 75% of these awards may vest based on EPS growth over the three-year period from 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2017 .  
0% of this element will vest if compound EPS growth is less than 7% per annum over the period, 25% will vest for 7% per annum and 100% will vest for EPS 
growth of 12% per annum, with vesting on a straight-line basis between these points. 25% of these awards may vest based on Relative TSR performance. 
SSP‚Äôs TSR will be calculated using the IPO offer price of 210 pence as the starting value. For constituents of the comparator group a three-month average 
from 16 July 2014 will be used. TSR performance will be measured to the three months after the announcement of results for the financial year ending 
30 September 2017 . 25% of this element will vest for median performance and 100% will vest for upper-quartile performance, with vesting on a straight-line 
basis between these points. The TSR comparator group was disclosed in full in the 2014 Annual report on remuneration.
(ii) 2015 PSP awards: 75% of these awards may vest based on EPS growth over the three-year period from 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2018. 0% of this 
element will vest if compound EPS growth is less than 7% per annum over the period, 25% will vest for 7% per annum and 100% will vest for EPS growth 
of 12% per annum, with vesting on a straight-line basis between these points. 25% of these awards may vest based on Relative TSR performance. TSR for 
SSP and the constituents of the comparator group will be measured over the three-year period from 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2018. A three-month 
average share price prior to the start and end of the performance period will be used to calculate TSR. 25% of this element will vest for median performance 
and 100% will vest for upper-quartile performance, with vesting on a straight-line basis between these points. The TSR comparator group was disclosed in 
full in the 2015 Annual report on remuneration.
(iii) 2016 PSP awards: 75% of these awards may vest based on EPS growth over the three-year period from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2019. 0% of this

of 12% per annum, with vesting on a straight-line basis between these points. 25% of these awards may vest based on Relative TSR performance. TSR for 
SSP and the constituents of the comparator group will be measured over the three-year period from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2019. A three-month 
average share price prior to the start and end of the performance period will be used to calculate TSR. 25% of this element will vest for median performance 
and 100% will vest for upper-quartile performance, with vesting on a straight-line basis between these points. The TSR comparator group was disclosed in 
full in the 2016 Annual report on remuneration.

the Performance Share Plan awards since they were granted in July 2014, November 2015 and November 2016 respectively. Dividend equivalents (including 
associated tax credits where applicable) payable in shares will continue to accrue (on a cumulative basis) until the vesting dates of these awards, subject to and in 
accordance with the rules of the Performance Share Plan.
(e) Unvested awards under the Company‚Äôs share plans will be satisfied by the transfer of existing shares held by the Company‚Äôs employee benefit trust (EBT), market 
purchased shares (which will be held by the EBT) or the issue of new shares within limits agreed by shareholders when the plans were approved. These limits 
comply with the Investment Association‚Äôs guidelines which require that no more than 10% of a company‚Äôs issued share capital be issued in accordance with all 
employee share plans in any 10-year period, with no more than 5% issued in accordance with discretionary employee share plans.

On the annual salary review date of 1 June 2017 , the Chief Executive Officer‚Äôs base salary increased by 2%, compared with the average 
annual salary increase of 2% awarded to UK employees who are paid on a monthly basis. This population was chosen as a suitable 
comparator group because it is considered to be the most relevant in terms of employment location and remuneration structure.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
42 The Remuneration Committee has determined that the vesting of these awards will be subject to two types of performance conditions as 
detailed below.
75% of the award ‚Äì Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth over the three-
year period from 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2020.
EPS ‚Äì compound annual growth Percentage of the award vesting
Less than 7% per annum 0%
7% per annum 25%
12% per annum or more 100%
Straight-line vesting operates between these points.
EPS growth will normally be calculated using actual foreign 
exchange rates. However, given the international nature of SSP‚Äôs 
business, in order to ensure that management performance during 
the performance period is appropriately rewarded, the Committee 
may make an adjustment upwards or downwards where there have 
been exceptional movements in foreign exchange rates during the 
performance period.
25% of the award ‚Äì relative T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) 
performance against a comparator group of companies over the 
three-year period from 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2020.
Relative TSR performance Percentage of the award vesting

Median 25%
Upper quartile 100%
Straight-line vesting operates between these points.

43 Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors‚Äô remuneration
The Board entrusts the Remuneration Committee with the responsibility for setting the remuneration policy in respect of Executive 
Directors and senior executives and ensuring its ongoing appropriateness and relevance. In setting the remuneration for these groups, the 
Committee considers the pay and conditions of the wider workforce and roles in relevant geographies.
Internal advice
The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Group HR Director and Company Secretary attend Committee meetings by invitation, 
other than when their personal remuneration is being discussed. The Company Secretary acted as secretary to the Committee. 
External advice
During the year ended 30 September 2017 , the Committee received independent advice on executive remuneration matters from Deloitte. 
Deloitte received ¬£49,380 in fees for these services. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily 
operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. During the year, Deloitte also provided the 
Company with internal audit services, forensic services, tax services and transaction-related services.
The Committee appointed Deloitte to the role of independent advisor to the Committee. The Committee has reviewed the advice provided 
by Deloitte during the year and is comfortable that it has been objective and independent. The Committee has reviewed the potential for 
conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflict.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
44 This part of the Directors‚Äô remuneration report sets out the revised Directors‚Äô remuneration policy as determined by the Remuneration 
Committee (the Committee). In accordance with Section 439A of the Companies Act 2006, a binding shareholder resolution to approve this 
policy will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in February 2018 (the 2018 AGM). The policy will apply to 
payments made to Directors after the 2018 AGM, subject to shareholder approval of the policy. 
A copy of the first shareholder -approved policy is set out in the Annual Report and Accounts 201 4 which is available at 
www.foodtravelexperts.com. The only change proposed under the revised Policy is that the maximum pension contribution (or cash in lieu of 
pension) for newly appointed Executive Directors is reduced from 35% to 20% of salary. 
Key principles of remuneration policy
The remuneration policy for the Directors of the Company is intended to help recruit and retain executives who can execute SSP‚Äôs strategy 
by rewarding them with appropriate compensation and benefit packages. The policy seeks to align the interests of Executive Directors with 
the performance of the Company and the interests of its shareholders. 
Our incentive arrangements are designed to reward performance against key financial and strategic performance objectives. Our aim is to 
reward management for delivering sustainable long-term performance and support the retention of critical talent.
Future policy table
The table below describes the policy in relation to the components of remuneration for Executive Directors and, at the bottom of the table, 
the policy for the Non-Executive Directors. 
Element and link to strategy Operation Maximum potential value Performance metrics
Executive Directors
Base salary
A core element of the 
remuneration package used 
to recruit, reward and retain 
Executive Directors who can 
deliver our strategic objectives.
Normally reviewed annually. The Remuneration 
Committee may however award an out-of-cycle 
increase if it considers it appropriate.
Base salaries are set by the Committee taking into 
account a number of internal and external factors 
including:
‚Ä¢ the individual‚Äôs skills, experience and performance;
‚Ä¢ the size and scope of the Executive Director‚Äôs role 
and responsibilities;
‚Ä¢ market positioning and inflation; and
‚Ä¢ pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Salary increases in percentage 
terms will normally be in line 
with increases awarded to other 
head office employees in the 
relevant geography, but may be 
higher in certain circumstances.
The circumstances may include 
but are not limited to:
‚Ä¢ Where a new Executive 
Director has been appointed 
at a lower salary, higher 
increases may be awarded 
over an initial period as the 
Executive Director gains 
experience in the role;
‚Ä¢ Where there has been an 
increase in the scope or 
responsibility of an Executive 
Director‚Äôs role; and
‚Ä¢ Where a salary has fallen 
significantly below market 
positioning.
There is no maximum increase 
or opportunity.
None
Pension
T o provide an income following 
retirement and assist the 
Executive Director in building 
wealth for their future.
The Company operates an approved defined 
contribution pension arrangement, to which the 
Company may make contributions. A cash allowance 
may be provided in lieu of pension contributions.
Company contributions or cash 
allowance of up to 35% of base 
salary may be paid in respect 
of each financial year of the 
Company to each of the current 
Executive Directors.
Company contributions or cash 
allowance of up to 20% of base 
salary may be paid in respect 
of each financial year of the 
Company to any new Executive 
Director that may be appointed 
from time to time.

Other benefits
T o provide appropriate benefits 
as part of a remuneration 
package that assists in 
recruiting, rewarding and 
retaining Executive Directors.
Each Executive Director receives a tailored benefits 
package including (but not limited to) private 
health insurance for themselves, their spouse 
and dependent children, annual health screening, 
smartphone (or similar devices), life assurance, 
business travel and permanent health insurance.
T ravel benefits, including car allowance, company car, 
driver, the cost of fuel for private mileage, insurance, 
maintenance and servicing and travel to and from 
work (including any associated tax and social security 
charges) may also be provided.
In the event that an Executive Director is required by 
the Group to relocate, other benefits may include, but 
are not limited to, the costs of relocation, housing, 
travel and education allowances and subsistence 
costs.
Expenses incurred in the performance of duties for 
the Group may be reimbursed or paid for directly by 
the Company, as appropriate, including any tax or 
social security charges due on the expenses.
The Executive Directors are eligible to receive other 
benefits (such as a colleague discount card) on the 
same terms as other eligible employees of the Group.
Car allowance of up to ¬£13,000 
per annum.
The cost of insured benefits 
may vary from year to year 
depending on the individual‚Äôs 
circumstances, and therefore 
the Committee has not imposed 
any overall maximum value on 
the benefit.
None
Annual bonus
T o reward performance on an 
annual basis against key annual 
objectives.
Performance objectives will be determined by the 
Committee at the beginning of the financial year.
The Committee will assess performance against 
these objectives following the end of the relevant 
financial year.
Awards are delivered wholly in cash, and are paid once 
the results for the year have been audited.
The Committee may clawback awards up to three 
years after vesting if the Group‚Äôs accounts have been 
materially misstated or there has been an error in 
the calculation of any performance conditions which 
results in overpayment.
The maximum annual bonus 
opportunity is 200% of base 
salary per annum.
For 2017 /18 maximum annual 
opportunities are:
‚Ä¢ Chief Executive Officer, Kate 
Swann ‚Äì 200% of salary per 
annum.
‚Ä¢ Chief Financial Officer, 
Jonathan Davies ‚Äì 125% of 
salary per annum.
Performance is measured 
relative to targets in key 
financial, operational and/
or strategic objectives over 
the financial year.
The measures selected and 
their weightings may vary 
each year according to the 
strategic priorities.
Entitlement to bonus 
only starts to accrue at a 
minimum threshold level of 
performance. Below this 
level, no bonus will be paid.
T o earn a maximum 
bonus there must be 
outperformance against 
stretching objectives.

Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The PSP rewards the delivery 
of Company performance and 
shareholder value over the 
longer term.
The awards are share based to 
align the interests of Executive 
Directors with those of 
shareholders.
Awards may be made to Executive Directors at the 
discretion of the Committee in the form of conditional 
share awards, nil-cost options, forfeitable shares or 
equivalent rights.
Awards will normally be subject to performance 
conditions set by the Committee measured over 
a period of at least three years. Awards will vest 
following the end of the performance period.
Awards (other than forfeitable shares) may 
incorporate the right to receive (in cash or shares) 
the value of dividends that would have been paid on 
the award shares that vest between the grant and 
vesting of awards, which will, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, assume the reinvestment 
of those dividends in the Company‚Äôs shares on a 
cumulative basis.
The Committee has the discretion to reduce the 
number of shares subject to unvested awards if prior 
to vesting there is a material misstatement in the 
Company‚Äôs annual financial statements, or a material 
failure of risk management, or serious reputational 
damage to a member of the Group or relevant 
business unit.
The Committee may clawback awards up to three 
years after vesting if the Group‚Äôs accounts have been 
materially misstated or there has been an error in 
the calculation of any performance conditions which 
results in overpayment.
The maximum award that may 
be made is up to 200% of salary 
per annum under the rules 
of the plan in respect of any 
financial year of the Company.
It is currently anticipated 
that for PSP awards 
performance will be based 
on:
‚Ä¢ 25% on relative T otal 
Shareholder Return (TSR)
‚Ä¢ 75% on Earnings per 
Share (EPS)
If the minimum level 
of performance is not 
achieved then none of the 
award will vest and the 
award will lapse.
For performance at the 
threshold levels 25% of the 
award will vest.
The whole award will vest 
if the maximum level of 
performance, or above, is 
achieved.
Long-term incentive 
performance conditions 
are reviewed on an annual 
basis, and may vary to 
ensure that they are 
aligned with the corporate 
strategy.
The Committee would 
seek to consult with 
its major shareholders 
as appropriate on any 
proposed material changes.
All-employee share plans Executive Directors may participate on the same 
basis as other employees.
Participants can contribute up 
to the relevant limits set out in 
the country plan.
None
Non-Executive Directors
Fees
T o attract and retain Non-
Executive Directors of the 
calibre required to oversee the 
development and execution of 
the Company‚Äôs strategy.
The Chairman‚Äôs fees are determined by the Committee.
The Non-Executive Directors‚Äô fees are determined by 
the Board.
The total fees for Non-Executive Directors, including 
the Chairman, will not exceed the maximum stated in 
the Company‚Äôs Articles of Association.
The level of fees takes into account the time 
commitment, responsibilities, market levels and the 
skills and experience required.
Non-Executive Directors normally receive a 
basic fee and an additional fee for specific Board 
responsibilities, including chairmanship or 
membership of Board committees or acting as the 
Senior Independent Director.
Additional fees may be paid to Non-Executive 
Directors on a per diem basis to reflect increased time 
commitment in certain limited circumstances.
Expenses incurred in the performance of non-executive 
duties for the Company may be reimbursed or paid for 
directly by the Company, as appropriate, including any 
tax and social security due on the expenses.
Non-Executive Directors may be provided with 
benefits to enable them to undertake their duties.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
47 DIRECTORS‚Äô REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
Notes to the tables on pages 45 to 47
The Company also operates a shareholding policy ‚Äì details can be found on page 40 of the Annual report on remuneration.
The PSP will be operated in accordance with the plan rules. In accordance with the rules of the PSP , any performance condition may 
be substituted or varied if the Committee considers it appropriate, provided that the amended performance condition is in its opinion 
reasonable and not materially less difficult to satisfy. The plan rules also provide that the Committee may adjust awards (as it reasonably 
considers appropriate) in the event of any variation of the Company‚Äôs share capital, capital distribution, demerger, special dividend or other 
event having a material impact on the value of shares.
Malus and clawbacks apply where stated in the above table. Other elements of remuneration are not subject to recovery provisions. 
Under Kate Swann‚Äôs service contract, if her employment is terminated by the Company making a payment in lieu of notice and the Company 
subsequently discovers that there were grounds for her summary dismissal, Kate Swann may be required to make a repayment equal to the 
net of tax value of any payments, benefits or shares received under any relevant bonus or incentive plan.
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions 
available to it in connection with such payments) that are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment 
were agreed:
(i) before the AGM on 3 March 2015 (the date the Company‚Äôs first shareholder -approved Directors‚Äô remuneration policy came into effect);
(ii) before the policy set out above came into effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with the shareholder -approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time they were agreed; or
(iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. 
For these purposes, ‚Äòpayments‚Äô include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and an award over shares is ‚Äòagreed‚Äô at the 
time the award is granted.
Performance measures and targets
Annual bonus
Annual bonus metrics and targets are selected to incentivise Directors to meet objectives for the year and are chosen in line with the 
following principles:
‚Ä¢ The targets set for financial measures should be incentivising and appropriately stretching. T argets may be adjusted by the Committee to 
take into account significant capital transactions during the year . 
‚Ä¢ There should be flexibility to change the measures and weightings year -on-year in line with the needs of the business.
PSP
Performance conditions and targets are determined by the Committee to reflect the Group‚Äôs strategy and having regard to market practice 
within the Company‚Äôs business sector . For the awards to be made in November 2017 , the measures were selected taking into account that:
‚Ä¢ Earnings per Share is considered by the Company to be the best indicator of long-term performance.
‚Ä¢ T otal Shareholder Return is a key objective of most of our shareholders.
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group
Differences in the policies for Executive Directors and other employees in the Group generally reflect differences in market practice taking 
into account role and seniority. The remuneration policies for Executive Directors and the senior executive team are generally consistent in 
terms of structure and the performance measures used. All eligible employees may participate in the Company‚Äôs all-employee share plans in 
the relevant territory where they operate.
Illustrative scenario analysis
The following charts show the potential split between the different elements of the Executive Directors‚Äô remuneration under three different 
performance scenarios: ‚ÄòMinimum‚Äô, ‚ÄòT arget‚Äô and ‚ÄòMaximum‚Äô (see table on top of page 49).

Approach to recruitment remuneration
In the event that the Group appointed a new Executive Director, remuneration would be determined in line with the following principles:
‚Ä¢ The Committee will take into account all relevant factors, including the calibre and experience of the individual and the market from 
which they are recruited, while being mindful of the best interests of the Group and its shareholders and seeking not to pay more than 
is necessary.
‚Ä¢ So far as practical the Committee will look to align the remuneration package for any new appointment with the remuneration policy set out 
in the table on pages 45 to 47 .
‚Ä¢ Salaries may be higher or lower than the previous incumbent, but will be set taking into account the review principles set out in the policy 
table. Where appropriate the salaries may be set at an initially lower level, with the intention of increasing salary at a higher than usual rate 
as the Executive Director gains experience in the role. For interim positions a cash supplement may be paid rather than salary (for example; 
a Non-Executive Director taking on an executive function on a short-term basis).
‚Ä¢ T o facilitate recruitment the Committee may need to buy out terms or remuneration arrangements forfeited on joining the Company. 
Any buy-out would take into account the terms of the arrangements, in particular, any performance conditions and the time over which they 
would vest. The overriding principle would be that the value of any replacement buy-out awards should be no more than the commercial 
value of awards that have been forfeited. The form of any award would be determined at the time and the Committee may make buy-out 
awards under LR 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules (for buy-out awards only).
‚Ä¢ The maximum variable pay opportunity in respect of recruitment (excluding buy-outs) comprises a maximum annual bonus of 200% of 
annual salary and a maximum PSP grant of 200% of annual salary, as stated in the policy table on pages 45 to 47 . The Committee retains 
the flexibility to determine that, for the first year of appointment, any annual incentive award within this maximum will be subject to such 
terms as it may determine.
Where an Executive Director is appointed from within the Company or following corporate activity/reorganisation (for example, merger with 
another company), the normal policy would be to honour any legacy arrangements in line with the original terms and conditions. 
Where the recruitment requires relocation of the individual, the Committee may provide for additional costs and benefits. 
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the remuneration package will be consistent with the policy set out above.
Details of Directors‚Äô service contracts 
Executive Directors
Executive Directors have rolling service contracts. None of the existing service contracts for Executive Directors makes any provision for 
termination payments, other than for payment in lieu of notice.
Kate Swann‚Äôs payment in lieu of notice would be calculated by reference to the base salary and pension contributions (or equivalent 
allowance) in respect of any unexpired portion of the notice period. This payment can be made in instalments over the notice period and can 
be reduced where alternative employment is commenced during the notice period. Any such payment to Kate Swann would be repayable (net 
of tax) if it was subsequently discovered that the Company would have been permitted to dismiss her summarily.
Jonathan Davies‚Äô payment in lieu of notice would be calculated by reference to the base salary in respect of any unexpired portion of 
the notice period. This payment can be made in instalments over the notice period and can be reduced where alternative employment is 
commenced during the notice period.
The Executive Directors‚Äô service contracts contain provisions relating to salary, car allowance, pension arrangements, medical insurance, 
life insurance, business travel insurance, company car, holiday and sick pay, and the reimbursement of reasonable out of pocket expenses 
incurred by the Executive Directors while on company business. 
Kate Swann‚Äôs service contract includes the provision that she is entitled to participate in the annual bonus scheme. For any new Executive 
Directors appointed their participation in the Company‚Äôs incentive plans will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
49 DIRECTORS‚Äô REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED

Jonathan Davies 15 July 2014 9 months 12 months
Service contracts for new Executive Directors will be limited to nine months‚Äô notice for the Director and 12 months‚Äô notice for the Company.

Association of the Company. 
The Chairman receives no benefits from the office other than fees and reimbursement of expenses incurred in performance of his duties, 
including any tax due on the expenses. He is not eligible to participate in Group pension arrangements. 
Non-Executive Directors
All Non-Executive Directors have been appointed on an initial term of three years, subject to renewal thereafter . All are subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders. 
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment which can be terminated at any time upon written notice, resignation or in 
accordance with the articles of association of the Company. Non-Executive Directors receive no benefits from their office other than fees 
and reimbursement of expenses incurred in performance of their duties, including any tax due on the expenses. They are not eligible to 
participate in Group pension arrangements.

Per Utnegaard 1 July 2015 30 June 2018
Directors‚Äô service contracts are kept for inspection by shareholders at the Company‚Äôs registered office.
Payments to departing Directors
In the event that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined by reference to 
the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans. The Committee 
may structure any compensation payments in such a way as it deems appropriate, taking into account the circumstances of departure. 
In the event of the Company terminating an Executive Director‚Äôs contract, the level of compensation would be subject to mitigation if 
considered appropriate.
Payment in lieu of notice In the event of termination by the Company of an Executive Director‚Äôs employment, a payment in lieu of notice may be 
paid. This payment would be equal to a maximum of annual base salary and cash allowance in lieu of pension in respect 
of any unexpired portion of the notice period. This payment can be made in instalments over the notice period and can 
be reduced where alternative employment is commenced during the notice period.
Annual bonus Executive Directors may, at the determination of the Committee, remain eligible to receive an annual bonus for the 
financial year in which they ceased employment.
Any such bonus will be determined by the Committee, taking into account time in employment and performance.
Performance Share Plan  
awards
On cessation of employment, any outstanding unvested awards will lapse unless the participant dies or is deemed to be 
a ‚Äògood leaver‚Äô by the Committee in its discretion.
Where the participant is deemed to be a ‚Äògood leaver‚Äô, any outstanding unvested awards will normally continue and 
will vest at the normal vesting date to the extent the original performance conditions have been satisfied. Awards will 
normally, unless the Committee determines that an alternative proportion of the awards should vest, be pro-rated for 
the portion of the vesting period completed in employment.
The Committee may, in exceptional circumstances, or if the participant dies, decide to allow awards to vest on cessation 
of employment subject to the Committee‚Äôs assessment of performance against the original performance conditions 
at that time or the Committee‚Äôs assessment of the likely achievement of the performance conditions over the original 
performance period. Awards will normally, unless the Committee determines that an alternative proportion of the 
awards should vest, be pro-rated for the portion of the vesting period completed in employment.
Payments in relation to 
statutory rights
The Company may pay an amount considered reasonable by the Remuneration Committee in respect of an Executive 
Director‚Äôs statutory rights.
Payments required by law The Company may pay damages, awards, fines or other compensation awarded to an Executive Director by any 
competent court or tribunal or other payments required to be made on termination of employment under applicable 
law.
Professional fees The Company may pay an amount considered reasonable by the Remuneration Committee in respect of fees for legal 
and tax advice, and outplacement support for the departing Executive Director.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
50 Award under LR 9.4.2
Were an award to be made under LR 9.4.2 then the leaver provisions would be determined at the time of award.
Takeovers and other corporate events
Under the PSP , on a takeover or voluntary winding-up of the Company, PSP awards will vest in accordance with the rules of the plan. 
Vesting would be determined by the Committee based on the proportion of the vesting period that has elapsed and the extent to which the 
performance conditions have been satisfied, although the Committee has the discretion to determine that such greater proportion as it 
considers appropriate of the awards should vest, including where it considers the level of shareholder returns is at a superior level.
In the event of a variation of share capital, demerger, capital distribution or any other event having a material impact on the value of 
the shares, the Committee may determine that outstanding PSP awards shall vest on the same basis as set out above for a takeover . 
Alternatively, the Committee may (with the consent of the acquiring company) decide that PSP awards will not vest on a corporate event but 
will be replaced by new awards over shares in the new acquiring company or another company determined by the acquiring company.
Bonuses may be paid in respect of the year in which the change of control or winding up of the Company occurs, if the Committee considers 
this appropriate. The Committee may determine the level of bonus taking into account any factors it considers appropriate.
Amendments
The Committee may make amendments to the terms of the Company‚Äôs incentive plans in accordance with the rules of those plans (which 
were summarised for shareholders in the Company‚Äôs IPO prospectus). The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set 
out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax, administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining 
shareholder approval for that amendment.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group
In making remuneration decisions, the Committee also considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group. 
When reviewing and setting Executive Directors‚Äô remuneration, the Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions 
of Group employees. The Group-wide pay review budget is one of the key factors when reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors. 
Although the Group has not carried out a formal employee consultation regarding Board remuneration, it does comply with local regulations 
and practices regarding employee consultation more broadly.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee consulted with the Group‚Äôs largest shareholders when developing the above policy. In reviewing and setting remuneration, 
including that of Executive Directors, the Committee receives updates on investors‚Äô views, and may from time to time engage directly with 
investors and/or investor representative organisations on remuneration topics as appropriate. These lines of communication ensure that 
emerging best practice principles are factored into the Committee‚Äôs decision-making.

Powers conferred on the Directors in relation to issuing or buying back shares
Subject to applicable law and the Company‚Äôs Articles of Association, the Directors may exercise all powers of the Company, including the 
power to authorise the issue and/or market purchase of the Company‚Äôs shares (subject to an appropriate authority being given to the 
Directors by shareholders in general meeting and any conditions attaching to such authority). The shareholders delegated the following 
powers in relation to the issuing or market purchase by the Company of its shares at the Company‚Äôs 2017 AGM:
Issuing Shares
The Directors were granted authority to allot shares in the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into 
shares in the Company:
(a) up to a nominal amount of ¬£1,584,029; and

The authorities conferred on the Directors to allot securities under paragraphs (a) and (b) will expire on the date of the 2018 AGM or close 
of business on 13 June 2018, whichever is sooner, (the Expiry Date). The Directors will be seeking a new authority at the 2018 AGM for the 
Directors to allot shares and to grant subscription and conversion rights to ensure that the Directors continue to have the flexibility to act  
in the best interests of shareholders when opportunities arise by issuing new shares or granting such rights.
The Directors were also given authority to allot equity securities for cash or to sell ordinary shares as treasury shares for cash subject  
to certain limitations, such authority to apply until the Expiry Date. The Directors will seek to renew this authority at the 2018 AGM.
DIRECTORS‚Äô REPORT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
52 T o date, neither authority has been exercised. During the 2017 financial year, 27 ,390 ordinary shares in the Company were issued to satisfy 
Matching Share awards under the Company‚Äôs UK SIP . However, these do not count against the authorities granted by shareholders in 
accordance with the Act.
Buyback of shares
The Directors were granted authority to make market purchases of its own shares, up to a maximum of approximately 10% of the 
Company‚Äôs issued share capital. This standard authority is renewable annually and the Directors will seek to renew this authority at the 
2018 AGM. 
T o date, this authority has not been exercised.
Rights and restrictions on shares and transfers of shares
Certain restrictions, which are customary for a listed company, apply to the rights and transfers of ordinary shares in the Company. 
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company‚Äôs ordinary shares, in addition to those conferred on their holders by law, are set out in the 
Company‚Äôs Articles of Association, copies of which can be obtained from Companies House in the UK or by writing to the Company Secretary. 
The key points are summarised below. 
Ordinary shares
Notice of meetings must be given to every shareholder and to any person entitled to a share unless the Articles of Association or the rights 
of the shares say they are not entitled to receive them from the Company. The Board can decide that only people who are entered on the 
register of members at the close of business on a particular day are entitled to receive the notice. On a show of hands at a general meeting 
every member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote and, on a poll, every member present in person or by proxy shall have one 
vote for every ordinary share held. No shareholder holds ordinary shares which carry special rights relating to the control of the Company.
Dividends and distributions on winding up to shareholders
Holders of ordinary shares may receive interim dividends approved by Directors and dividends declared in general meetings. On a liquidation 
and subject to a special resolution of the Company, the liquidator may divide among members in specie the whole or any part of the assets of 
the Company and may, for such purpose, value any assets and may determine how such division shall be carried out.
Transfers of ordinary shares
The Articles of Association place no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares or on the exercise of voting rights attached to them 
except: (i) in very limited circumstances (such as a transfer to more than four persons) and (ii) where the Company has exercised its rights to 
suspend their voting rights or to prohibit their transfer following the omission by their holder or any person interested in them to provide the 
Company with information requested by it in accordance with Part 22 of the Act. Restrictions on transfers may apply where the holder is 
precluded from exercising rights by the LRs, the City Code on T akeovers and Mergers or any other regulations.
Dealings subject to Market Abuse Regulation
Pursuant to the Market Abuse Regulation and the Group‚Äôs share dealing policy, Directors, other persons discharging managerial 
responsibilities and certain employees require the approval of the Company to deal in the ordinary shares of the Company.
Exercise of rights of shares in employee share schemes
Awards over shares held by relevant participants under the Company‚Äôs various share plans carry no rights until the shares are issued to 
participants or their nominee. 
The T rustees of each of the Company‚Äôs employee benefit trusts are entitled to vote on unallocated shares held in the trust fund from time to 
time but they may consider, in their absolute discretion, any recommendations made to them by the Company before doing so. In respect of 
allocated shares held by the T rustees as nominee (including the T rustees of the Company‚Äôs Share Incentive Plan), they must seek instructions 
from participants on how they should exercise their voting rights before doing so on their behalf.
Notification of major shareholdings

Directors
Particulars of the Directors in office at the date of this report are listed on pages 26 and 27 . Each of the Directors held office throughout 
the year .
Appointment and removal of Directors
The Company may, by ordinary resolution of the shareholders of the Company at a general meeting, remove any Director from office and 
elect another person in place of a Director so removed from office following recommendation by the Nomination Committee in accordance 
with its terms of reference for approval by the Board.
The processes for the appointment and replacement of Directors are governed by the Company‚Äôs Articles of Association, the Code, the Act, 
the LRs and related legislation. In accordance with the Code, all Directors stand for election at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) following 
their appointment, and stand for re-election on an annual basis.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Articles of Association, the Act and related legislation, any directions given by special resolution and any relevant statutes and 
regulations, the business of the Company will be managed by the Board who may exercise all the powers of the Company.
Directors‚Äô interests
The Directors‚Äô interests in shares and options over ordinary shares in the Company are shown in the Directors‚Äô remuneration report on page 
40. In line with the requirements of the Act, each Director has notified the Company of any situation in which he or she has, or could have, 
a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company (a situational conflict). These were 
considered and approved by the Board in accordance with the Company‚Äôs Articles of Association in September 2017 and each Director was 
informed of the authorisation and any terms on which it was given. The Board has formal procedures to deal with Directors‚Äô conflicts  
of interest. The Board reviews and, where appropriate, approves certain situational conflicts of interest that are reported to it by Directors, 
and a register of those situational conflicts is maintained and will be reviewed by the Board going forward.
Directors‚Äô indemnities
The Company has made qualifying indemnity provisions, as defined by section 236 of the Act, of which the Directors had the benefit of 
during the financial year ended 30 September 2017 and which remain in force at the date of this report. In addition, directors and officers  
of the Company and its subsidiaries are covered by Directors‚Äô and Officers‚Äô liability insurance.
Awards under employee share schemes
Details of the Group‚Äôs employee share schemes and awards made during the year and held by Executive Directors as at 30 September 2017 
are set out in the Annual report on remuneration on pages 38 to 44.
Details of awards made during the year and held by employees as at 30 September 2017 under the Performance Share Plan are disclosed  
in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements on page 92.
Controlling shareholders
Any person who exercises or controls on their own or together with any person with whom they are acting in concert, 30% or more of the 
votes able to be cast on all or substantially all matters at general meetings of a company are known as ‚Äòcontrolling shareholders‚Äô. The LRs 
require companies with controlling shareholders to enter into a written and legally binding agreement, which is intended to ensure that the 
controlling shareholder complies with certain independence provisions.
As at 30 September 2017 , the Company had no controlling shareholders.
Annual General Meeting
All holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend the Company‚Äôs AGM and all holders of ordinary shares on the register at the relevant 
record date are entitled to receive the Notice of AGM, which will be posted at least 20 working days before the AGM. They are also entitled 
to speak at general meetings of the Company, to appoint one or more proxies or, if they are corporations, corporate representatives, and to 
exercise voting rights. Shareholders may vote and appoint proxies electronically. The Notice of AGM specifies deadlines for exercising voting 
rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote in relation to resolutions to be put to the AGM.
DIRECTORS‚Äô REPORT CONTINUED
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
54 The 2018 AGM will be held on 27 February 2018. The results of the voting on resolutions will be made available to shareholders on the 
Group‚Äôs website after the meeting. At the meeting, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairmen of the Board Committees will also be 
present to answer questions on any matters relating to the Group‚Äôs business. Shareholders will also have an opportunity to meet Directors 
informally after the meeting. 
Change of control
Contracts
There are a number of contracts that allow the counterparties to alter or terminate those arrangements in the event of a change of control 
of the Company. These arrangements are commercially sensitive and confidential and their disclosure could be seriously prejudicial to 
the Group. 
Other agreements
The Company does not have agreements with any Director or Officer that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment 
resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the Company‚Äôs employee share plans may cause options and awards granted under such 
plans to vest on a takeover .
The Company‚Äôs main credit facilities, being the committed bank facilities dated 16 June 201 4 (as amended from time to time), contain a 
provision such that in the event of a change of control, if a lender so requires and has notified the agent within 10 business days of the agent 
notifying the lenders of the event, the commitment of that lender will be cancelled and all outstanding amounts, together with accrued 
interest under that commitment, will become repayable, on the date notified in writing by the agent that the relevant commitment has been 
cancelled (where such date must be not fewer than 10 business days after the date of the notice).
Articles of Association
The Articles of Association of the Company may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders.
Political donations
The Company‚Äôs policy is not to make political donations. Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries, during the financial year ended 
30 September 2017 , made any political donation to a political party, other political organisation or independent election candidate,  
or incurred any political expenditure or made any contribution to a non-EU political party. The Company will propose to shareholders  
at the 2018 AGM that a precautionary authority be granted up to ¬£25,000 in aggregate. Details are included in the 2018 Notice of AGM. 
Environmental, social and governance risks
The Board has identified and assessed the significant environmental, social and governance risks to the Company‚Äôs short and long-term 
value, as well as the opportunities to enhance value that may arise from improving its environmental performance. The Sustainability report 
on pages 23 to 25 reports on environmental matters, including the impact of the Group‚Äôs businesses on the environment, the Group‚Äôs annual 
quantity of greenhouse emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide, the Group‚Äôs employees, and on social and community issues.
Treasury and risk management
The Group‚Äôs financial risk management objectives and policies, including its hedging policy, and the main risks arising from the Group‚Äôs 
financial assets and liabilities are summarised in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 93 to¬†97 . 
Going concern
The financial information has been prepared on a going concern basis, in support of which, the Board has reviewed the Group‚Äôs trading 
forecasts for the next 12 months. These forecasts, which include detailed cash flow projections, comprise assumptions as to sales and 
profit performance by segment and by month and take account of the normal seasonality profile of the business. As a result, the Directors 
are confident that the assumptions underlying their forecasts are reasonable and that the Group will be able to operate within its banking 
covenants and available liquidity headroom.
Notwithstanding the above, there remains a risk that a downturn in the global economy could result in passenger numbers and consumer 
spending in the travel market which are worse than the Board is currently envisaging. As a result, the Directors have also reviewed forecasts 
which include sensitivities that make allowance for this risk. Should such a scenario arise, the Directors are confident they have adequate 
liquidity and covenant headroom to ensure that the Group can meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare this financial information on a going concern basis.
In addition, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the Group 
over a longer period than the 12 months required by the Going Concern provision on page 22 of the Strategic report.
Auditor
The auditor, KPMG LLP , has indicated its willingness to continue in office, and a resolution that it will be re-appointed will be proposed at the 
2018 AGM.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
55 Statement of disclosure of information to auditors
In so far as each Director in office on the date of this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company‚Äôs external 
auditor is unaware, and the Directors have taken all the steps which they ought to have taken as Directors to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company‚Äôs external auditor is aware of that information. This confirmation is given and 
should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Act. 
Forward-looking statements
These reports and financial statements contain certain forward-looking statements which are subject to assumptions, risks and 
uncertainties; actual future results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied in such statements. Many of these assumptions, 
risks and uncertainties relate to factors that are beyond the Company‚Äôs ability to control or estimate precisely. The forward-looking 
statements reflect the knowledge and information available at the date of preparation of this annual report, and will not be updated during 
the year . These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout 
this annual report and include statements regarding the current intentions, beliefs or expectations of the Directors, the Company or the 
Group concerning, among other things, the results of operations, financial condition, prospects, growth, strategies, and dividend policy of 
the Company and the industry in which it operates. In particular, the statements regarding the Group‚Äôs strategy and other future events or 
prospects are forward-looking statements. Nothing in this annual report should be construed as a profit forecast.

DIRECTORS‚Äô REPORT CONTINUED
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
56 The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year . Under that law they 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU) and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent 
company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
‚Ä¢ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
‚Ä¢ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent; 
‚Ä¢ for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
‚Ä¢ for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements; 
‚Ä¢ assess the Group and parent company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; 
and 
‚Ä¢ use the going concern basis of accounting, unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company‚Äôs 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that 
its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic report, Directors‚Äô report, Directors‚Äô 
remuneration report and Corporate Governance statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company‚Äôs 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
‚Ä¢ the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and 
‚Ä¢ the Strategic report and Directors‚Äô report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face. 
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group‚Äôs position and performance, business model and strategy.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS‚Äô RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF 
THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
57 The risk Our response
Recoverability of goodwill and 
indefinite life intangible assets 
and of parent‚Äôs investment in 
subsidiary undertakings
(Goodwill and indefinite life 
intangible assets 2017: ¬£688.5m; 
2016: ¬£676.1m; investment in 
subsidiaries 2017: ¬£932.1m, 
2016: ¬£925.8m)
Refer to page 35 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 70 and 
101 (note 1 ‚Äì accounting policies) 
and page 80 and 102 (financial 
disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
The carrying amount of the Group‚Äôs 
goodwill and indefinite life assets, and the 
parent company‚Äôs cost of investment in 
subsidiaries, is significant, representing 
50.7% of total Group assets and 100% 
of total Company assets respectively. 
Whilst the estimate of the recoverability 
of both of these amounts, being based on 
forecast future cash flows, is inherently 
subjective and is affected by general 
economic and political trends such 
as levels of discretionary travel and 
consumer spending, there has historically 
been a sufficient level of headroom in the 
Directors‚Äô impairment calculations and 
we did not identify any indicators which 
would have resulted in the recoverability 
of these balances being subject to high 
risk of material misstatement. However, 
due to their materiality in the context 
of the relevant financial statements, 
they are considered to be two of the 
areas that had the greatest effect on our 
overall audit of the Group and the parent 
company. 
Our procedures included:
‚Ä¢ Benchmarking assumptions: We challenged the assumptions for key inputs 
used by the Group in their forecasts, such as projected market growth, 
future capital expenditure levels, revenue growth rates, cost projections 
and inflation, by comparing them to external data, industry norms and our 
expectations based on our knowledge and experience of the Group. 
‚Ä¢ Our valuation expertise: Our valuation specialists assisted us in assessing 
the appropriateness of the methodology and assumptions used by the 
Group, including discount rates and growth rates. 
‚Ä¢ Sensitivity analysis: We applied sensitivities to key assumptions to assess 
their impact on the recoverability of the assets. 
‚Ä¢ Historical comparisons: We evaluated the historical accuracy of the Group‚Äôs 
forecasts by comparing actual to budgeted results. 
‚Ä¢ Our sector experience: We corroborated our understanding of any changes 
in the business with the Group‚Äôs forecasts and considered whether or not 
these had been appropriately captured in the impairment models. 
‚Ä¢ Comparing valuations: We compared the results of the discounted cash 
flows against the Group‚Äôs market capitalisation, after adjusting for its  
debt to determine if there were any significant differences requiring  
further investigation. 
‚Ä¢ Assessing transparency: We also considered the adequacy of the Group‚Äôs 
disclosure of the key risks and whether that disclosure reflected the risks 
inherent in the valuation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets.
Our results
We found the resulting estimates of the following to be acceptable:
‚Ä¢ recoverable amount of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in the 
Group‚Äôs financial statements; and
‚Ä¢ recoverable amount of investment in parent company‚Äôs financial statements.
1. Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of SSP Group plc 
for the year ended 30 September 2017 which comprise the 
consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of 
other comprehensive income, the consolidated balance sheet, the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated 
cash flow statement, and the related notes, including the accounting 
policies in note 1.
In our opinion: 
‚Ä¢ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group‚Äôs and of the parent company‚Äôs affairs as at 30 September 
2017 and of the Group‚Äôs profit for the year then ended; 
‚Ä¢ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union; 
‚Ä¢ the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and 
‚Ä¢ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our 
opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our report to the 
audit committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the Directors on 20 September 
2006. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is the 
11¬†years ended 30 September 2017 . We have fulfilled our ethical 
responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in 
accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical 
Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. No non-audit 
services prohibited by that standard were provided.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and¬†include the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by 
us, including those which¬†had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key 
audit matters (unchanged from 2016), in decreasing order of audit 
significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with 
our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required 
for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. 
These matters were addressed, and our results are based on 
procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose 
of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
58 3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope 
of¬†our audit 
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set 
at ¬£10.5m, determined with reference to a benchmark of Group 
revenue of ¬£2,379.1m (2016: ¬£1,990.3m), of which it represents 
0.4% (2016: 0.5%). We consider revenue to be the most appropriate 
benchmark as it provides a more stable measure year -on-year than 
Group profit before tax.
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a whole 
was set at ¬£8.4m (2016: ¬£8.0m), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of company total assets, of which it represents 1% 
(2016: 1%).
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected 
identified misstatements exceeding ¬£0.5m (2016: ¬£0.5m), in 
addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting 
on qualitative grounds. 
Of the Group‚Äôs 15 (2016: 15) reporting components, we subjected 9 
(2016: 9) to full scope audits for group purposes. 
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the 
percentages illustrated opposite. T wo reporting components 
subjected to reviews in 2016 were not included for review in the 
current year as they were not individually financially significant so 
as to require a full scope audit for group purposes, and no specific 
individual risks that needed to be addressed had arisen from our 
previous reviews. 
The remaining 20% of total Group revenue, 9% of group profit 
before tax and 16% of total Group assets is represented by 
six¬†reporting components, none of which individually represented 
more than 4% of any of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax 
or total group assets. For these residual components, we performed 
analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment 
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement 
within these.
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the 
significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed 
above and the information to be reported back. The Group audit 
team approved the component materialities, which ranged from 
¬£0.1m to ¬£8.4m (2016: ¬£0.2m to ¬£8m), having regard to the mix of 
size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The work 
on nine of the Group‚Äôs 15 components was performed by component 
auditors and the rest by the Group audit team.
In 2017 , the Group audit team visited three of the 15 (2016: five) 
component locations. Video and telephone conference meetings 
were also held with these component auditors and the majority 
of the others that were not physically visited. At these visits and 
meetings, the findings reported to the Group audit team were 
discussed in more detail.
 
The risk Our response
Completeness, existence 
and accuracy of current and 
deferred tax.
(net current tax liability 
¬£22.0m;¬†2016: ¬£19.5m, and¬†net 
deferred tax asset:  
¬£9.0m; 2016:¬†¬£6.0m)
Refer to page 36 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 
72 (note¬†1 ‚Äì accounting 
policies) and page 78 and 82 
(financial¬†disclosures).
Subjective estimate
The Group operates in numerous tax 
jurisdictions. The interpretation of tax 
law can be complex and judgemental. 
Differences in tax laws may have a 
significant impact on how the Group 
calculates its current and deferred tax 
liabilities. Additionally, the outcomes 
of tax audits and related tax provisions 
may be different to those anticipated 
by the Group. The amount and timing 
of recognition of deferred tax assets 
involves judgement, as it is based on 
specific considerations, such as the 
future profitability of the business in 
various jurisdictions, local tax law and 
availability of temporary differences, 
such as an excess of capital allowances 
over depreciation or tax losses.
Our procedures included: 
‚Ä¢ Our tax expertise: We used our own tax specialists to assist us in assessing 
and challenging the assumptions and judgements made by the Group. 
We considered all significant differences between the statutory and 
effective rates in each jurisdiction and assessed whether adjustments 
from¬†accounting profit to taxable profit are in accordance with local laws. 
We¬†considered whether the tax provisions made by the Group and the 
underlying assumptions are appropriate. 
‚Ä¢ Our sector experience: In assessing the Group‚Äôs calculations, we have 
used our knowledge of recent tax cases and our awareness of the pattern 
of recent tax settlements. We have also considered developments in the 
attitudes of tax authorities globally and discussed issues with the Directors 
in order to determine whether the tax provisions made by the Group were 
reasonable. 
‚Ä¢ Comparing assumptions: In assessing the level of deferred tax asset 
balances recognised in the consolidated balance sheet, we compared 
the assumptions used in respect of future taxable income to the Group‚Äôs 
long-term forecasts and budget for the relevant jurisdictions. 
‚Ä¢ Assessing transparency: We also assessed the adequacy of the Group‚Äôs 
disclosures in respect of current and deferred taxes.
Our results 
‚Ä¢ We found the level of tax provisioning to be acceptable, and the level of 
deferred tax assets recognised to be recoverable.

We are required to report to you if:
‚Ä¢ we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to 
the Directors‚Äô statement in note 1 to the financial statements on 
the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material

Company‚Äôs use of that basis for a period of at least 12 months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements; or 
‚Ä¢ if the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 55

We have nothing to report in these respects. 
5. We have nothing to report on the other information in the 
annual report
The Directors are responsible for the other information presented

consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, 
the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on

other information.
Strategic report and Directors‚Äô report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
‚Ä¢ we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic 
report and the Directors‚Äô report; 
‚Ä¢ in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
‚Ä¢ in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
60 Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention 
to in relation to:

risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity; 
‚Ä¢ the principal risks disclosures describing these risks and explaining 
how they are being managed and mitigated; and 
‚Ä¢ the Directors‚Äô explanation in the viability statement of how they 
have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period 
they have done so and why they considered that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the viability 
statement. We have nothing to report in this respect. 
Corporate Governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if: 
‚Ä¢ we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit 
and the Directors‚Äô statement that they consider that the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group‚Äôs position and performance, 
business model and strategy; or 
‚Ä¢ the section of the annual report describing the work of the 
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance 
statement does not properly disclose a departure from the 11 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the 
Listing Rules for our review. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
Based solely on our work on the other information described above: 
‚Ä¢ with respect to the Corporate Governance report disclosures 
about internal control and risk management systems in relation to 
financial reporting processes and about share capital structures:
‚Ä¢  we have not identified material misstatements therein; and 
‚Ä¢ the information therein is consistent with the financial 
statements; and 
‚Ä¢ in our opinion, the Corporate Governance report has been prepared 
in accordance with relevant rules of the Disclosure Guidance and 
T ransparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.
6. We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are 
required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if,

7 . Respective responsibilities 
Directors‚Äô responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 57 , 
the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the 
Group and parent company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to 
liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor‚Äôs responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud, other irregularities, or error, 
and to issue our opinion in an auditor‚Äôs report. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of the financial statements. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud or other irregularities is higher 
than for one resulting from error, as they may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override 
of internal control and may involve any area of law and regulation not 
just those directly affecting the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC‚Äôs 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company‚Äôs members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company‚Äôs members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor‚Äôs report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company‚Äôs members, as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT
for the year ended 30 September 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
66 1. Accounting policies 
1.1 Basis of preparation
SSP Group plc (the Company) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The Group financial 
statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and equity-account the Group‚Äôs 
interest in associates. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the EU and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company‚Äôs functional currency. All information is given to the nearest ¬£0.1m.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except in respect of the derivative financial instruments that are stated  
at their fair value.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
financial¬†statements.
1.2 Going concern
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Board has reviewed the Group‚Äôs trading forecasts for the next 
12 months. These forecasts, which include detailed cash flow projections, comprise assumptions as to sales and profit performance by 
segment and by month, and take account of the normal seasonality profile of the business. As a result, the Directors are confident that the 
assumptions underlying their forecasts are reasonable and that the Group will be able to operate within its banking covenants and available 
liquidity headroom.
Notwithstanding the above, however, there remains a risk that a downturn in the global economy could result in passenger numbers and 
consumer spending in the travel market that are worse than the Board is currently envisaging. As a result, the Directors have also reviewed 
forecasts that include sensitivities that make allowance for this risk. Should such a scenario arise, the Directors are confident they have 
adequate liquidity and covenant headroom to ensure that the Group can meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable¬†future.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare these financial statements on a going concern basis.
In addition, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the Group 
over a longer period than the 12 months required by the Going Concern provision. Further details of this assessment are provided on page¬†22 
of the Strategic report.
1.3 Basis of consolidation
The financial statements of the Group consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary entities, together with the Group‚Äôs 
attributable share of the results of associates. All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits and losses arising 
from intragroup transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is the power to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary that significantly 
affect the subsidiary‚Äôs return so as to have rights to the variable return from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until 
the date that control ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests 
even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Associates and jointly controlled entities
An associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term equity interest and over which it has the power to exercise significant influence.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost (including transaction costs). The Group‚Äôs interest 
in the net assets of associates is reported as an investment on the consolidated balance sheet and its interest in their results is included in 
the consolidated income statement below the Group‚Äôs operating profit. The Group‚Äôs investment in associates includes goodwill identified 
on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group‚Äôs share of the total 
comprehensive income and equity movements of equity-accounted investees, from the date that significant influence commences until the 
date that significant influence ceases. When the Group‚Äôs share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying 
amount of the Group‚Äôs investment is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has 
incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Investments in associates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. The impairment review compares the net carrying value with the recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is the 
higher of the value in use calculated as the present value of the Group‚Äôs share of the associates‚Äô future cash flows and its fair value less costs 
to sell.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
67 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
1. Accounting policies continued
1.4 Foreign currency
T ransactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate at 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to 
the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in 
the income statement, except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment 
in a foreign operation that is effective, or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at 
the date of the transaction.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the 
Group‚Äôs presentation currency, Sterling, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign 
operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates  
of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the translation reserve or non-controlling interest, as appropriate. When a foreign operation is disposed of, such that control, 
joint control or significant influence is lost, the entire accumulated amount in the foreign currency translation reserve, net of amounts 
previously attributed to non-controlling interests, is recycled to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group 
disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while still retaining control, the relevant proportion of 
the accumulated amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate 
or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while still retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the 
cumulative amount is recycled to the income statement.
Exchange differences arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned 
nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity 
in the translation reserve. Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are 
recognised directly in equity, in the translation reserve, to the extent that the hedge is effective. When the hedged part of a net investment is 
disposed of, the associated cumulative amount in equity is recycled to the income statement as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal.
1.5 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial 
liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and
(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company‚Äôs own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company‚Äôs own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
T o the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
1.6 Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash 
equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables
T rade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Other financial assets
Other financial assets comprise long-term cash deposits with a maturity of more than three months on inception and money market funds 
that are not readily convertible to cash. These are held on the balance sheet at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables
T rade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Group‚Äôs cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
68 1.7 Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature 
of the item being hedged.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly 
probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the cash 
flow hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and 
losses that were recognised directly in equity are recycled into the income statement in the same period or periods during which the asset 
acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss, i.e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed 
from equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects 
profit or loss.
Fair value hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an 
unrecognised firm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged (even if it is normally 
carried at cost or amortised cost) and any gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised immediately in the income statement (even if 
those gains would normally be recognised directly in reserves).
1.8 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, 
plant and equipment.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases. 
Leased assets acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, 
plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
‚Ä¢ Freehold buildings 50 years
‚Ä¢ Leasehold land and buildings  the life of the lease
‚Ä¢ Plant and machinery 3 to 13 years
‚Ä¢ Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3 to 13 years
1.9 Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date at which control is 
transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair value as are the identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired is accounted for 
as¬†goodwill. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. T ransaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Non-controlling interests arising from acquisition are accounted for based on the proportionate share of the fair value of identifiable net 
assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus 
the non-controlling interests‚Äô share of subsequent changes in equity. T otal comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Where the Group recognises a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary, based on the rights the non-controlling interest have to their share 
of the returns of such subsidiaries, the Group recognises obligations to acquire additional shares in these subsidiary undertakings as a 
liability in the consolidated balance sheet at the present value of the estimated exercise price of the forward contract. The present value 
of the forward contracts is estimated based on expected earnings in Board-approved forecasts and the choice of a suitable discount rate. 
Upon initial recognition a corresponding entry is made to other equity. For subsequent changes in the measurement of the liability the 
corresponding entry is made to the consolidated income statement.

69 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
1. Accounting policies continued
1.10 Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with owners 
in their capacity as owners and, therefore, no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling 
interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid or received and the 
amount by which non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent company.
1.11 Goodwill and intangible assets 
Goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is stated at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets
Indefinite-life intangible assets relate to brands recognised on acquisition of the SSP business in 2006. Intangible assets with an indefinite 
useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets, consisting mainly of brands, franchise agreements and software, that are acquired/purchased by the Group are 
stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment¬†losses. Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands 
is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets (between nine 
and 1 4 years) unless such lives are indefinite. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
1.12 Inventories
Inventories comprise goods purchased for resale and consumable stores and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost¬†is 
calculated using the first in first out method.
1.13 Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets 
Financial assets (including receivables)
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective 
evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired (with a charge to the income statement) if objective evidence indicates that a loss 
event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event has had a negative effect on the estimated future cash 
flows of that asset, which can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount 
and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset‚Äôs original effective interest rate. Interest on the impaired 
asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss  
to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group‚Äôs non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting 
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset‚Äôs recoverable amount is 
estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount  
is estimated each period at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from 
continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets. Subject to an operating segment ceiling 
test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which 
impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent the asset‚Äôs 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
70 1.14 Employee benefits
Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group‚Äôs net obligation in respect of 
defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the 
current and prior periods, discounting the amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.
The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the 
calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of the economic benefits available 
in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. T o calculate the present value of economic 
benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.
Remeasurements of the net defined liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the 
effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. Net interest expense and 
other expenses related to defined plans are recognised in the income statement.
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain 
or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the income statement. The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a 
defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the employing company pays fixed contributions into a separate 
entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension 
plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by¬†employees.
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. 
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under a short-term cash bonus if the employing company has a present legal or 
constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated¬†reliably.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value 
excludes the effect of service and non-market-based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves, based on the Group‚Äôs estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of service and 
non- market-based vesting conditions. The impact of changes to the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement such 
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
1.15 Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that 
can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate rate.
1.16 Segment information
Segment information is provided based on the geographical segments that are reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker . In accordance 
with the provisions of IFRS 8 ‚ÄòOperational segments‚Äô, the Group‚Äôs chief operating decision-maker is the Board of Directors. The operating 
segments are aggregated if they meet certain criteria. Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those that 
can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly head office expenses, finance income, finance charges and income 
tax. No disclosure is made for net assets/liabilities as these are not reported by segment to the chief operating decision-maker .
1.17 Revenue
Revenue represents amounts for retail goods and catering services supplied to third party customers (predominantly passengers) excluding 
discounts, value-added tax and similar sales taxes.
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised at the point of sale of food, beverage and retail goods.
Provision of catering services
Revenue is recognised in the period in which services are provided.
1.18 Supplier income
The Group enters into agreements with suppliers to benefit from promotional activity and volume growth. Supplier incentives, rebates and 
discounts are recognised within cost of sales as they are earned.

1.19 Underlying items
Underlying items are those that, in management‚Äôs judgement, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence, in order to draw 
the attention of the reader and to show the underlying business performance of the Group more accurately. Such items are included within 
the income statement caption to which they relate, and are separately disclosed either in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
or on the face of the consolidated income statement.
1.20 Lease payments
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Contingent rent which is dependent on variable factors, such as unit sales, is recognised in the period in which it is incurred. Lease incentives 
received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is 
allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the¬†liability.
1.21 Finance income and expense
Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income and net foreign exchange gains. Finance expense comprises 
interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities, finance lease charges recognised in the income statement using the effective 
interest method, the unwinding of the discount on provisions, and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement. 
Interest income and interest expense are recognised in the income statement as they accrue, using the effective interest method. 
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entity‚Äôs right to receive payment is established. Foreign currency 
gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
1.22 Taxation
T ax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. T ax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
and the amounts used for taxation purposes. No provision is made for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill; 
the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of 
deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised.
1.23 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous year .
The following standards, issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU, have not yet been adopted and unless otherwise stated are not 
expected to have a material impact on the Group: 
IFRS 9 ‚ÄòFinancial Instruments‚Äô replaces IAS 39 ‚ÄòFinancial instruments ‚Äì Recognition and Measurement‚Äô. The standard (effective for the 
year ending 30 September 2019) covers the classification, measurement, impairment and de-recognition of financial assets and liabilities 
and provides new hedge accounting requirements. The Group continues to assess the impact this standard would have on its consolidated 
results and financial position.
IFRS 15 ‚ÄòRevenue from Contracts with Customers‚Äô (effective for the year ending 30 September 2019) is based on the principle that revenue 
is recognised when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer . The standard provides a single, principles-based five-step 
model to be applied to all contracts with customers to determine whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. IFRS 15 replaces the 
separate models for goods, services and construction contracts under IAS 11 ‚ÄòConstruction Contracts‚Äô and IAS 18 ‚ÄòRevenue‚Äô. The Group 
continues to assess the impact of the new standard, but based on a preliminary assessment, the Group believes that IFRS 15 will not have  
a significant impact on the timing and recognition of revenue.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
72 IFRS 16 ‚ÄòLeases‚Äô (effective for the year ending 30 September 2020) requires lessees to recognise operating leases on the Group‚Äôs balance 
sheet, unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. The standard, which replaces IAS 17 ‚ÄòLeases‚Äô, 
will give rise to the recognition of an asset representing the right-of-use of the leased item and a related liability being the future lease 
payment obligations. Costs currently classified as operating lease costs will be reclassified and split between the depreciation of the asset, 
on a straight-line basis, and interest on the lease liability. This reclassification will increase EBITDA with corresponding increases in the 
depreciation charge and interest expense. Interest expense will also be higher in the early stages of a lease and reduce over the term. 
IFRS 16 can either be applied on a fully retrospective basis, which will require the restatement of comparative prior periods, or the 
cumulative retrospective impact can be applied as an adjustment to equity on the date of adoption of the standard. 
The Group is reviewing the standard in more detail to ensure it prepares itself for inception and expects that IFRS 16 will have a material 
impact on the Group‚Äôs consolidated results and associated impact on both assets and liabilities.
2. Significant accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgements and assumptions 
concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. These estimates and 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The¬†estimates 
and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year are discussed below.
Goodwill and intangible assets
The Group recognises goodwill and intangible assets that have arisen through acquisitions. These assets are subject to impairment reviews 
to ensure that the assets are not carried above their recoverable amounts. For goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, reviews are 
performed annually. For other intangible assets, reviews are performed if events or circumstances indicate that this is¬†necessary.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs or groups of CGUs have been determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations require the 
use of estimates and assumptions consistent with the most up-to-date budgets and plans that have been formally approved by the Board. 
The key assumptions used for the value in use calculations are set out in note 11 to these financial statements.
Current and deferred tax
The Group is required to determine the corporate tax provision in each of the many jurisdictions in which it operates. During the ordinary 
course of business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate determination is uncertain. As a result the Group 
recognises tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. The recognition of tax benefits and 
assessment of provisions against tax benefits requires management judgement. In particular the Group is routinely subject to tax audits 
in many jurisdictions, which by their nature are often complex and can take several years to resolve. Provisions are based on management‚Äôs 
interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement, and have been calculated using the single best estimate of likely 
outcome approach. Management takes advice from in-house tax specialists and professional tax advisors, and uses previous experience to 
inform its judgements. T o the extent that the outcome differs from the estimates made, tax adjustments may be required in¬†future periods.
The evaluation of recoverability of deferred tax assets requires judgements to be made regarding the availability of future taxable income. 
Management therefore recognises deferred tax assets only where it believes it is probable that such assets will be realised, taking account 
of current levels of profitability and forecasts prepared for budgets and the Group‚Äôs Medium T erm Plan (as referred to in the viability 
statement in the risk management section of the Strategic report).

3. Segmental reporting
SSP operates in the food and beverage travel sector, mainly at airports and railway stations.
Management monitors the performance and strategic priorities of the business from a geographic perspective, and in this regard has 
identified the following four key ‚Äòreportable segments‚Äô: the UK, Continental Europe, North America and the Rest of the World (RoW). 
The UK¬†includes operations in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland; Continental Europe includes operations in the Nordic 
countries, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Spain; North America includes operations 
in the United States and Canada; and RoW includes operations in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific and India. These segments 
comprise countries which are at similar stages of development and demonstrate similar economic characteristics.
The Group‚Äôs management assesses the performance of the operating segments based on revenue and underlying operating profit. 
Interest income and expenditure are not allocated to segments, as they are managed by a central treasury function, which oversees the  
debt and liquidity position of the Group. The non-attributable segment comprises costs associated with the Group‚Äôs head office function 
 and depreciation of central assets. Revenue is measured in a manner consistent with that in the income statement.

rate for 2016 benefited from the recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets.
Factors that may affect future tax charges
The Group expects the tax rate in the future to be affected by the geographical mix of profits and the different tax rates that will apply to 
those profits.
The main rate of corporation tax in the UK was reduced from 20% to 19% in April 2017 , and will be reduced to 17% in April 2020.

80 Impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators that goodwill might be impaired. This did not result in any 
impairment in the year (2016: ¬£nil).
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations are long-term 
growth rates and pre-tax discount rates and cash flow forecasts from the most recent financial budgets and three-year medium-term plan 
approved by management. The cash flow forecast period is five years, which is based on management‚Äôs budgets and three-year plan, a 
further year of assumed growth, followed by a final year showing a terminal value based on expectations of growth thereafter . 
The key assumptions for these calculations are shown below:

Eastern Europe and Middle East 5.0% 12.2% 5.0% 11.1%
Asia Pacific 5.0% 9.2% 5.0% 7.6%
1 
The discount rates presented are post-tax discount rates. 
The values applied to the key assumptions in the value in use calculations are derived from a combination of internal and external factors, 
based on past experience together with management‚Äôs future expectations about business performance. The pre-tax discount rates are 
based on the Group‚Äôs weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the country in which the CGU operates.
Sensitivity analysis
Whilst management believe the assumptions are realistic, it is possible that an impairment would be identified if any of the above 
sensitivities were changed significantly. A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of these key assumptions with the other variables 
held constant. For each CGU, an increase of 0.5% in the discount rate or a decrease of 0.5% in the growth rate would not result in the carrying 
value for any CGU or any group of CGUs exceeding its recoverable amount.
12. Investments in associates 
The Group uses the equity accounting method to account for its associates, the carrying value of which was ¬£6.8m as at 30 September

The above deferred tax assets have not been recognised either because of uncertainty over the future profitability of the relevant 
companies within the Group to which the deferred tax assets relate, or because the deferred tax assets relate to tax losses which are  
subject to restrictions on use or forfeiture, due, for example, to time restrictions or change in ownership rules.
¬£12.4m of the Group‚Äôs unrecognised deferred tax assets relate to the UK, with the balance relating to unrecognised deferred tax assets in 
overseas jurisdictions, mainly the US and certain countries in Europe. The largest proportion of the unrecognised deferred tax assets relate 
to brought forward losses in territories where operations have been making tax losses for some time. Profitability forecasts are reviewed 
carefully and used as the basis for considering the recognition of deferred tax assets although initial recognition of a deferred tax asset is 
not made until an entity is making taxable profits.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates based on the current 
repatriation policy of the Group and the fact that, given the current tax regimes in the countries in which the Group operates, no withholding 
or other tax should arise should the Group choose to remit the earnings of those subsidiaries, or should associates choose¬†to¬†remit their 
earnings. As such, no deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of undistributed earnings.

84 19. Post-employment benefit obligations
Group
The Group operates a number of post-employment benefit schemes including both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes. 
In respect of the defined contribution schemes, amounts paid during the year were ¬£11.1m (2016: ¬£9.0m) across the Group. There are no 
contributions outstanding at the balance sheet date. The principal defined contribution scheme is called the SSP Group Pension Scheme.
The Group operates a combination of funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes across Europe, the respective net plan liabilities of 
which are presented below:
2017  
¬£m
2016  
¬£m
Funded schemes (see (a) below) (3.5) (8.4)
Unfunded schemes (see (b) below) (10.4) (10.8)
(13.9) (19.2)
These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market 
(investment) risk. The plans are administered by pension funds that are legally separate from the Group and are required to act in the best 
interests of the plan participants. The Group expects to pay ¬£1.0m in contributions to its defined benefit plans in 2018. As at 30¬†September 
2017 , the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation was 18.2 years (2016: 19.9 years).
Information disclosed below is aggregated by funded and unfunded schemes.
(a) Funded schemes
The Group operates funded schemes in the UK and Norway. In the UK, the Group participates in the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS) via the 
Rail Gourmet UK Limited Shared Cost Section (RG section), which is a final salary scheme and provides benefits linked to salary at retirement 
or earlier date of leaving service. The RG section covers permanent managerial, administrative and operational staff of Rail Gourmet UK 
Limited and is closed to new entrants.
The RG scheme was subject to its last full actuarial valuation by a qualified actuary as at 31 December 2016. These results have been used 
by a qualified independent actuary in the valuation of the scheme as at 30 September 2017 for the purposes of IAS 19 ‚ÄòEmployee Benefits‚Äô. 
The amounts shown for the prior year were based on a valuation of the scheme for the purposes of IAS 19 as prepared by an independent 
actuary using the full actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2013.
In 2016, it was agreed with the T rustees of the RPS that, from 1 January 2016, the employing company contributions would be 18.3% 
of¬†pensionable pay (with members paying 12.2%). In addition, it was agreed that from 1 January 2016 the employing company would make 
monthly lump sum contributions of ¬£2,700. At the most recent funding valuation of the RG scheme as at 31 December 2016 showed a 
funding level of 103.6%. Accordingly the contributions that are being paid by the employing company are in respect of future service of 
current members.
Major assumptions used in the valuation of the funded schemes on a weighted average basis are set out below: 
2017 2016 
Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 2.5% 2.2%
Rate of increase in salaries 2.9% 3.0%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 1.5% 1.8%
Inflation assumption 2.7% 2.9%
At the balance sheet date, scheme members were assumed to have the following life expectancies at age 65:
2017 2016 
Male pensioner now aged 65 20.5 20.0
Female pensioner now aged 65 22.6 21.8

The principal unfunded scheme of the Group operates in Germany. T o be eligible for the general plan, employees must complete five years 
of service and the normal retirement age for this plan is 65. Employees in Germany are also provided with a long service (Jubilee) award, 
which provides a month‚Äôs gross salary after the employee has worked a certain number of years of service. All unfunded schemes are valued 
in accordance with IAS 19 and have been updated for the period ended 30 September 2017 by a qualified independent actuary. The major

Provision for onerous contracts is made when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The timing of the utilisation of these provisions is variable, dependent on the 
contract expiry dates, which vary between one and ten years.
Provision for restoration costs represents estimates of expected costs to be incurred in restoring a site to its original condition when it is 
vacated at the end of the lease term. These provisions will be utilised at the end of the lease terms, which vary between one and ten years 
in length.
Other provisions include the estimated cost of an ongoing free travel provision provided to employees of T ravellers Fare Limited, a historic 
acquisition (now part of Select Service Partner UK Limited). The benefit is a lifetime benefit and has been calculated using life expectancies 
and discounted to a prevent value using a suitable discount rate. The remaining amount represents probable expected costs in several 
commercially sensitive areas.

22. Share-based payments
The Group has granted equity-settled share awards to its employees under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), the UK Share Incentive Plan 
(UK SIP) and the International Share Incentive Plan (International SIP).
Details of the terms and conditions of each share-based payment plan and of the Group‚Äôs TSR comparator group are given in the Directors‚Äô 
remuneration report on pages 37 to 51.
Performance Share Plan
The PSP awards are based on two independent performance conditions, which apply to separate numbers of shares under the award and are 
assessed independently. 25% of the award is based on SSP‚Äôs T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to a comparator group and 75% of the 
award is based on an Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance condition.

Weighted average share price at grant (¬£) 3.71
Weighted average exercise price ‚Äì
Expected volatility 24%
Expected life (years) 3.0

Expected volatility was determined with reference to the historic volatility for the constituents of the Group‚Äôs TSR comparator group over  
a period commensurate with the expected life of the awards.
Awards subject to EPS performance criteria have been valued with reference to the share price at the date of the award.
UK Share Incentive Plan
The UK SIP is a share matching scheme which entitles participating employees to be given up to two free ordinary shares (matching shares) 
for each SSP Group plc ordinary share purchased (partnership shares). Both the partnership and matching shares are placed in trust for a 
three-year period. The UK SIP has been in place since December 201 4 onwards.
For the period from January 2017 to December 2017 , the actual entitlement to matching shares was fixed at one matching share for every 
two partnership shares purchased. For the period from January 2016 to December 2016, the actual entitlement was also fixed at one 
matching share for every two partnership shares purchased. The Group incurred a charge of ¬£0.1m in respect of the matching element  
of the UK SIP in 2017 (2016: ¬£0.2m).
International Share Incentive Plan
In September 2015, the Company issued the first invitations to eligible employees under the International SIP , which is an all-employee share 
ownership plan. The International SIP is a share matching scheme which entitles participating employees to be given up to two free ordinary 
shares (matching shares) for each SSP Group plc ordinary share purchased (partnership shares). Both the partnership and matching shares 
are placed in trust for a three-year period. 
For the period from November 2016 to October 2017 , the actual entitlement to matching shares was fixed at one matching share for every 
two partnership shares purchased. For the period from November 2015 to October 2016, the actual entitlement to matching shares was 
fixed at one matching share for each partnership share purchased. The Group incurred a charge of ¬£0.2m in respect of the matching element 
of the International SIP in 2017 (2016: ¬£0.1m).

24. Financial instruments continued 
Bank loans
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the 
balance sheet date. Bank loans are categorised as level 2 financial liabilities, whereby inputs which are used in the valuation of these financial 
liabilities and have a significant effect on the fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
Finance lease liabilities
Fair value is based on the present value of the future lease payments, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease.
Other non-derivative financial instruments (excluding bank loans)
Due to the short-term nature of non-derivative financial instruments (excluding bank loans), the fair value is approximate to the 
carrying¬†value. 
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments relate to interest rate swaps and are valued using relevant yield curves and exchange rates as at the balance 
sheet date.
Fair value hierarchy
All derivative financial liabilities are categorised as level 2 under which the fair value is measured using the inputs other than quoted prices 
observable for the liability, either directly or indirectly.
(c) Credit risk

94 (e) Financial risk management
The main financial risks of the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counterparties to 
financial transactions, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. In this regard, the treasury function is mandated by the Board 
to manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs. The function has clear policies and operating parameters, 
and its activities are regularly reviewed by the Board to ensure compliance. The function does not operate as a profit centre and speculative 
transactions are not permitted.
Financial instruments, including derivatives, are used on occasion to manage the main financial risks arising during the course of business. 
These risks are liquidity risk and market risk and are discussed further below.
Liquidity risk
The Group‚Äôs objective in managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it can meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. In¬†order to 
achieve this, the treasury department maintains an appropriate level of funds and facilities to meet each year‚Äôs planned funding¬†requirement.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group‚Äôs income  
or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. These are discussed further below. Currency risk
Although the functional currency of the Group is Sterling, the Group‚Äôs operating cash flows are transacted in a number of different 
currencies. The Group‚Äôs policy in managing this financial currency risk is to use foreign currency denominated borrowings to ensure that 
interest costs arise in currencies that reflect the operating cash flows, thereby minimising net cash flows in foreign currencies. As the  
mix of foreign currency cash flows generated by the business changes over time, there may be a requirement to restructure borrowings  
(via financial instruments or other treasury products) to maintain this hedge. The Board reviews financial currency risk at least once a year .
The currency profile of the cash balances of the Group at 30 September 2017 was as follows:
Cash at bank and in hand
2017 
¬£m
2016 
¬£m
Sterling 51.2 82.0
Other currencies 126.9 73.8
178.1 155.8
The Group applies hedge accounting to cover the risk of foreign exchange differences arising between the functional currency of the foreign 
operation and the Group‚Äôs functional currency, i.e. Sterling. The designated exchange risk is the spot foreign exchange risk because the 
hedging instruments are not derivatives, but foreign currency-denominated bank loans. The fair value of the bank loans used as hedging 
instruments was ¬£285.3m as at 30 September 2017 (2016: ¬£304.0m). There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement 
arising from hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
No sensitivity analysis is provided in respect of currency risk as the Group‚Äôs currency exposure mainly relates to translation risk  
as discussed above.

Interest rate risk
The Group has entered into a series of interest rate swaps in order to hedge its interest rate exposure from its variable rate term loan 
facilities. The impact of all of these transactions is reflected in the table below.
The interest rate and currency profile of the Group‚Äôs bank loans at 30 September 2017 , after taking into account interest rate swaps and

Interest rate swaps
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating-rate interest amounts for fixed interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges 
to reduce the Group‚Äôs cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. The interest rate swaps and the interest 
payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to the income statement over the period 
that the floating rate interest payments on debt affect the income statement.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps was ¬£9.0m as at 30 September 2017 (2016: ¬£1 4.2m).
In 2017 , credit of ¬£1.2m (2016: debit of ¬£6.7m) was recognised in other comprehensive income representing the effective portion of changes 
in the fair value of the interest rate swaps in the year . There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement in either¬†year .
In 2017 , a credit of ¬£4.0m (2016: credit of ¬£2.7m) in other comprehensive income arose on the reclassification of the cumulative changes  
in fair value of the interest rate swaps to the income statement (see note 7).
Sensitivity analysis
A change of 50 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would have increased/(decreased) equity by the amounts in the table 
below. This is driven by changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments. At 30 September 2017 , these were in fully effective 
hedge relationships and the movement would have had no impact on the income statement.
This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and has been applied to risk exposures existing at that date. 
In addition, all other variables, in particular, foreign currency rates, have been assumed to remain constant.

(f) Capital management
The Group‚Äôs policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future 
development. The Group‚Äôs capital is represented by the share capital and reserves (as set out in note 21), retained earnings, and net debt 
(see below). The funding requirements of the Group are met by a mix of medium-term borrowings, short-term borrowings (under its RCF) 
and available cash (as detailed in the table below). During the year, the Group continued to monitor covenant compliance and has passed 
comfortably the requirements in its borrowing facilities. As part of its banking arrangement, the Group has to comply with the financial 
covenants relating to Net Debt Cover and Interest Cover . These covenants are tested bi-annually.
As at 30 September 2017 , the Group had a leverage of 1.1x underlying L TM (last 12 months) EBITDA (2016: 1.6x).

The Group has created a joint venture with K Hospitality Group, whereby SSP will ultimately own a 49% share in T ravel Food Services Private 
Limited (TFS). 
On 13 December 2016, the Group acquired 15.1% of the issued share capital of TFS, a leading operator of food and beverage concessions 
in travel locations in India. A further 17 .9% of the issued share capital was acquired on 3 March 2017 bringing the total shareholding to 33%. 
As part of the acquisition the Group agreed to acquire a further 16% shareholding by the end of calendar year 2018. 
The acquisition provides an entry point for the Group into the Indian market and the Group expects to benefit from TFS‚Äô established 
strong local presence. By virtue of the agreement with the other shareholders, the Group has control over TFS‚Äô relevant activities including 
establishing budgets and operating plans, appointment of key management personnel and ongoing review of performance and reporting 
procedures and as such is consolidating TFS and its group companies.

 Less: other financial assets acquired (0.8)
Add: long and short-term borrowings acquired 8.3
Acquisition of TFS, adjusted for net debt acquired 35.0
The intangible assets acquired represent the fair value of the brand names acquired, namely Caf√©ccino, Idli.com, Flying Bites and Curry 
Kitchen. The Board believe that the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets is best considered as 
goodwill on acquisition representing relationships with airports, extensive knowledge of the Indian travel catering market and future 
operating synergies.
Included in the 12 month period to 30 September 2017 is revenue of ¬£65.2m and an operating profit of ¬£12.9m in respect of TFS.
If the acquisition of TFS had been made at the beginning of the financial year, the estimated contribution to the results of the Group  
for the year ended 30 September 2017 would have been ¬£78.0m to revenue and ¬£15.1m to operating profit.
Obligation to acquire additional share of subsidiary undertaking
The consideration payable for the additional 16% is based on a multiple of TFS‚Äô 2018 Earnings before Interest, T ax, Depreciation and 
Amortisation (EBITDA) and has been valued with reference to most recent financial statements and internal budgets and forecasts, 
discounted with a suitable discount rate and subject to a cap of ¬£21.4m (undiscounted at 30 September 2017 exchange rates). 
The discount rate is pre-tax and reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and a specific risk premium relevant  
to the TFS business. This discount rate is considered to be equivalent to the rate a market participant would use.
On acquisition, the Group recognised a financial liability of ¬£18.9m in respect of its obligation to acquire a further 16% of TFS in 2018. As at 
30 September 2017 the financial liability was ¬£20.9m. This reflects the TFS updated assumptions on the forecasted 2018 EBITDA due to 
the business exceeding expectations compared to the time of the original acquisition, adjustments for the subsequent foreign exchange 
revaluation and the unwind of discounting.
29. Post balance sheet event
On 17 October 2017 the Group completed an ‚Äòamend and extend‚Äô of its existing debt facilities to: extend the final maturity date by two years 
from July 2020 to July 2022; reduce the margin on the debt and the Revolving Credit Facility by 25 basis points; and increase the size of the 
Revolving Credit Facility by ¬£100m to ¬£150m.

COMPANY STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
As at 30 September 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
100 30. Accounting policies
SSP Group plc (the Company) is a company incorporated in the UK.
These financial statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its Group. The¬†separate 
financial statements are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(FRS101) under the historical cost accounting rules.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions:
‚Ä¢ the cash flow statement and related notes;
‚Ä¢ disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;
‚Ä¢ disclosures in respect of capital management;
‚Ä¢ disclosures required by IFRS 13 ‚ÄòFair Value Measurement‚Äô and IFRS 7 ‚ÄòFinancial Instrument Disclosures‚Äô; and
‚Ä¢ the effects of new but not yet adopted IFRSs.
Where relevant, equivalent disclosures have been given in the consolidated financial statements. The principal accounting policies adopted 
are the same as those set out in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements except as noted below.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Company‚Äôs balance sheet and related notes.
The Company uses Sterling as its presentational and functional currency and all values have been rounded to the nearest ¬£0.1m unless 
otherwise stated.
Under Section s408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement. 
The loss for the financial year (2016: loss) is disclosed in note 34 to these accounts. The Company has no other recognised gains or losses  
in the current or preceding year and, therefore, no statement of comprehensive income is presented.
Going concern
SSP Group plc is the ultimate parent company of the SSP Group. The Company balance sheet has been prepared on a going concern basis, 
having regard to SSP Group‚Äôs trading forecasts for the next 12 months. See page 55 for consideration of the Group‚Äôs going concern basis.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment losses.
Impairment 
The carrying values of the Company‚Äôs assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the asset‚Äôs recoverable amount is estimated. 
An¬†impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. When a subsequent event 
or¬†change in circumstances causes the recoverable amount of an asset to increase, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through  
the income statement.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences 
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. T ax is recognised in the profit and loss account except where 
it relates to items taken directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary 
differences between the treatment of items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the¬†balance sheet 
date, except as otherwise required by FRS 101. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Share-based payment compensation
The Company has granted equity-settled share awards to Group employees. Equity-settled awards are measured at fair value at grant 
date. The fair value of awards granted to employees of the Company is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the Company‚Äôs estimate of the number of shares that will actually vest. The cost of awards to employees of subsidiary undertakings 
is¬†accounted for as an additional investment.

Impairment
The Directors have assessed whether the Company‚Äôs fixed asset investments require impairment under the accounting principles set out 
in FRS101.
In order to make this assessment, future cash flows were forecast for the next five years with growth rates of between 2% and 5% per 
annum thereafter . These cash flows were discounted by applying discount rates of between 8.4% and 1 4.9%. The values applied to the key 
assumptions are derived from a combination of external and internal factors based on past experience together with management‚Äôs future 
expectations about business performance.
This assessment did not result in any impairment in 2017 or 2016.
