STRATEGIC 
REPORT
CHAPTER
Sitting Pretty INTRODUCTION
I am delighted to update the Group’s stakeholders on 
what has been another very good year for the Joules 
brand.  This is the Group’s first full financial year as a 
public company and we have continued to make great 
progress by further expanding Joules as a premium 
lifestyle brand across product categories, distribution 
channels and geographic markets. 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
JOULES GROUP PLC
The brand’s strong momentum during the year, coupled 
with continued cost control and margin improvement, 
has enabled the Group to record strong growth in profit 
before tax for the Period.  We are very pleased with 
this result, which reflects the growing appeal of the 
Joules brand as well as the careful execution of our clear 
growth strategy. 
8    
Chairman’s Statement STRATEGIC PROGRESS
Joules has a distinctive brand and unique product 
proposition.  These qualities, supported by our  
first-class team across the Group, represent our 
strongest competitive advantages in what is a  
fast-changing and challenging retail environment. 
We remain committed to our focused growth strategy 
to deliver the disciplined development and expansion of 
the Joules brand.  At the same time we are challenging 
ourselves to explore new growth opportunities, find 
new ways to delight our customers and operate ever 
more efficiently.  The Chief Executive’s Strategic Report 
provides further details on our growth strategy and the 
progress made during the year. 
The internet and new consumer technologies are 
changing the retail environment in exciting ways and 
creating new opportunities for brands and retailers.  
Joules now has more, and better, methods than 
ever before to engage and connect with its growing 
community of customers.  At the same time, customers’ 
expectations of brands are changing and the requirement 
to provide a seamless and satisfying experience across 
all channels at all times has never been more important.  
As a truly multi-channel brand with an innovative culture 
and very strong customer connection, I am confident 
that Joules will continue to grow, adapt and prosper in 
this dynamic market whilst always remaining true to its 
core values, and providing customers with the quality 
products and experiences we are known and loved for. 
FINANCIAL RESULTS & DIVIDEND
Group revenue of £157.0 million increased by 19.6% 
compared to the prior period (FY16: £131.3m).  
Excluding the impact of currency, Group revenue grew  
by 18.6% in the period.  This reflects strong growth 
in both the Retail and Wholesale segments.  On a 
geographic basis, UK sales increased 17.8% to  
£139.0 million and International sales increased 36.2% to 
£18.0 million, now representing 11.5% of Group revenue.  
Underlying profit before tax increased by 34.0% to  
£10.1 million, and basic underlying EPS was 9.2 pence  
per share (FY16: 6.9 pence).  
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 1.2 pence per 
share, which if approved at the shareholder’s AGM, will 
take the dividend for the full year to 1.8 pence per share 
(FY16: nil).
The Strategic Report and Financial Review that follow 
provide a more in-depth analysis of the trading 
performance and financial results of the Group. 
OUR TEAM
Central to Joules’ continued success is our fantastic 
team of highly skilled, creative and driven people 
across the business.  I never cease to be proud of the 
shared commitment to the brand and our customers 
which runs through the entire team at Joules, from 
our head office to the stores, distribution centres and 
across international markets.  I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank everyone in the Joules team across 
the world for their continued hard work and dedication 
during this outstanding year for the business. 
THE FUTURE 
We have seen good growth in the first few weeks of  
our new financial year and have received positive early 
feedback on our Spring/Summer 2018 ranges from our 
wholesale customers. 
The short to medium-term headwinds facing UK retailers 
are well documented.  In particular, the final outcome of 
the UK’s decision to leave the European Union remains 
unclear and, as a consequence, the specific macro-
economic effects remain difficult to predict.  However, 
I believe that Joules is well placed to meet these 
uncertainties through a combination of the strength of 
its brand and products; its target customer demographic; 
and the substantial investment that has been made in the 
Group’s infrastructure and supply chain. 
We have a loyal and engaged customer base, a committed 
and enterprising team and a well-invested infrastructure.  
These qualities make us confident of successfully 
delivering the Board’s clear strategy for growing the 
Joules brand in the UK and internationally.

Chairman
Chairman’s Statement    
9 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STRATEGIC REPORT
FY17 was another very exciting year for Joules as 
the brand continued to expand across distribution 
channels and product categories both in the UK and 
internationally.  The strong progress delivered during 
the year was again underpinned by our focus on our 
customers and our dedication to provide quality 
products and engaging experiences across all channels. 
THE JOULES BRAND
Ever since Tom Joule established the Joules brand 
nearly three decades ago, Joules has been committed 
to surprising and delighting its growing community of 
customers with a sense of quirky Britishness.  The Joules 
brand remains distinctive not only for its exciting use of 
colour, proprietary hand-drawn prints and unexpected 
details but also for its values that truly connect with 
our customers.  We aim to be an uplifting part of our 
customers’ lives whenever they are spending quality time 
doing the things they love with the people who matter.
The brand’s continued expansion and success was 
recognised at the 2016 Drapers Awards where Joules 
won Mainstream Brand of Year against strong 
competition from other leading lifestyle brands.  This 
award represents a strong stamp of approval from the 
fashion industry for our brand and our talented and 
enterprising team.  
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REPORT
BUSINESS MODEL
OUR BUSINESS MODEL – BORN TO BE MULTI-CHANNEL
Joules was established as a multi-channel brand.   
Our distribution model enables our customers to easily 
engage with the Joules brand and to discover our 
products, shop, pay and collect their purchases in the 
way that suits their lifestyle. 
This multi-channel approach is reflected in the Group’s 
revenue mix between our two key, complementary 
distribution channels: Retail (including stores, 
e-commerce and the country shows and events circuit) 
and Wholesale.  The Group has a small but growing 
product licencing channel which, given the strength 
of the Joules brand, we are confident will become 
increasingly important over time. 
These complementary routes to market underpin our 
focused growth strategy.  Being truly multi-channel 
enables the Group to expand its product offering, 
enter new markets efficiently and exploit further 
growth opportunities within existing ones while 
always maintaining flexibility to meet and exceed our 
customers’ changing needs.

STRATEGIC PILLARS - PRIORITIES AND DEVELOPMENTS
OUR GROWTH STRATEGY 
We have a clear strategy for the long-term sustainable development of Joules as a premium lifestyle brand both in the 
UK and internationally.  This strategy is built on the key pillars described below and is underpinned by our distinctive 
brand, unique products and customer focus.  These pillars of growth are delivered by our exceptional team of people, 
supported by a well-invested infrastructure and supply chain.
1. INCREASING CUSTOMER VALUE - we intend to continue to grow our customer database, increase the number  
of active customers and develop the value of the average active customer through providing consistent and relevant  
cross-channel communication
2 DRIVE TOTAL UK BRAND SALES - as a multi-channel brand, we seek to grow total UK brand sales within target 
customer segments by increasing the availability and accessibility of our products across existing and emerging 
distribution channels - making it easy for our customers to discover, research, purchase and receive our products.   
Our priorities are:
• STORE ROLL-OUT - there is significant further growth potential for the brand in the UK and ROI.  We target  
a net 10 to 12 new stores per year in the medium-term as well as relocating a number of existing stores to larger 
sites that better reflect our brand and product range
• E-COMMERCE – e-commerce is a fast growing and rapidly evolving channel.  With ongoing enhancements to our 
e-commerce platform, the customer proposition and our customer management capability, we aim to increase 
the mix of e-commerce sales as a proportion of our total retail sales
• WHOLESALE – we broaden the reach of the Joules brand through wholesale customers that are closely  
aligned with our brand values and product categories - including independents, department stores and online 
retailers. Our wholesale capabilities position us well for emerging channels such as online marketplaces and 
‘Fulfilled by’ models
3. INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION - the Joules brand and products resonate well in international markets.  We develop 
international markets via a wholesale model supported by e-commerce, leveraging our investment in central creative 
and design functions and our infrastructure.  Our current priority markets are North America and Germany
4. PRODUCT EXTENSION - as a premium lifestyle brand, the Joules product offer naturally extends to meet many of 
the lifestyle needs of our customers.  Joules has had success extending the product offer within existing categories 
and into new categories and we will continue to expand into new areas that are appropriate for the development of 
the Joules brand, both organically and through working with carefully selected licence partners 2. DRIVE TOTAL UK BRAND SALES: 
• New stores: opened 13 new stores and closed two stores  
in the year
• Portfolio management: relocated three stores and 
expanded a further three stores
• E-commerce revenue: represented 35% of total  
retail sales
• E-commerce proposition: new payment options and site 
personalisation deployed in the year – helping drive  
improved conversion metrics
• Cross-channel: ‘Order in Store’ roll-out completed in 
H1 enabling store staff to place a customer order via 
a tablet device, facilitating access to our full product 
range in all stores
• Wholesale: Next Label converted to a ‘commission’ model. 
Continued strong growth in the independent specialist 
retailer channel
3. INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION: 
• International revenue grew at 36.2%  
(29.6% constant currency)
• Launched Childrenswear range in 55 Dillards 
department stores in the US
• Extended number of doors and product categories  
with Nordstrom 
• Further strengthened the team based in our  
New York showroom
• Gave notice to terminate arrangement with the  
third party distributor in the US - over 600  
independent stockists to be managed in-house  
from Spring/Summer 2018
• Germany field accounts increased to over  
400 stockists
4. PRODUCT EXTENSION: 
• Childrenswear category further developed  
with specific ranges for baby and younger  
and older age children

FINANCIAL KPIs RETAIL: MULTI-CHANNEL PROGRESS
Retail sales, which includes stores, e-commerce and 
shows, grew by an impressive 19.4% during the year  
(19.4% in constant currency).  This reflected good growth 
from both stores and e-commerce, which increased by 
29.4% to now represent 34.8% of total retail revenue  
(FY16: 32.1%). 
The Group’s store coverage across the UK and ROI 
continued to expand to 108 stores at the end of the period 
(FY16: 97).  We opened 13 stores and closed two, with 10 
of the net new stores being opened during the first half 
of the year.  This expansion was in line with our previous 
guidance of 10-12 net new stores for the year.  During 
the period we also relocated three stores and extended a 
further three to provide larger sites that better reflect the 
Joules brand proposition, showcase our product range, and 
enable multi-channel activities such as ‘Click & Collect’ 
and ‘Order in Store’.  
This activity resulted in total selling space increasing 
to 135,000 square feet (FY16: 111,000 square feet) at the 
Period end.  The new openings were spread across our 
different store location types reflecting the breadth of 
appeal of the Joules brand:
• Lifestyle - Barnstaple;
• Local – Ashbourne, Ludlow, Woodbridge and Bishops 
Stortford; 
• High Street - Chelmsford and Stratford-upon-Avon; 
• Metro – Leeds, Derby, Bromley and Plymouth;
• Premium Outlet - Swindon and Bridgend.  
The average payback on new stores, opened for more 
than one year, remained at less than 12 months, and all 
continuing stores delivered a positive contribution.
The Group continued to develop its online offering 
following the successful relaunch of the e-commerce 
platform in September 2015.  In the period we added 
new functionality making it easier for our customers 
to shop and pay and continue to increase the use of 
personalisation.  Traffic from mobile and tablet devices 
continued to grow, representing over 75% of the total 
number of visitors and we continued to see improved 
conversion rates.  ‘Click & Collect’ and ‘Order in Store’ 
– where we completed the roll-out to stores in the first 
half of the year - continue to prove popular with our 
customers and demonstrate the importance of our multi-
channel model and ability to deliver an integrated and 
consistent experience across channels. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REPORT
BUSINESS REVIEW
WHOLESALE: UK AND INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION 
Wholesale revenue experienced further good growth, 
up by 20.3% (17.6% in constant currency) year on year to 
£44.8 million (FY16: £37.2m), as the Joules brand continues 
to resonate strongly with wholesale customers both in the 
UK as well as within our targeted international markets: 
North America and Germany.  
In the UK, wholesale expansion was driven through  
both national multi-channel retailers such as John  
Lewis and Next Label as well as through smaller, 
independent specialist retailers that have a good fit  
with the Joules brand.
Strong international wholesale growth helped to drive 
international sales (including international retail) up 36.2% 
(29.6% in constant currency) and they now represent 11.5% 
of total Group revenue.  This growth was underpinned 
by our proprietary hand-drawn prints, colour and British 
character as the Joules brand continues to resonate in 
international markets.  
In the US, we further expanded our presence in key 
department stores, with Dillards launching childrenswear 
for the Autumn/Winter 2016 season and Nordstrom 
increasing Joules’ product range listings and the number 
of doors in response to customers’ appetite for the brand.  
We continue to see exciting growth opportunities for the 
brand in the US market and during the year we started the 
process to bring the management of over 600 independent 
stockist accounts in-house, following the termination of 
our agreement with the third-party distributor that had 
previously been serving this channel.  This new way of 
working will become effective from the Spring/Summer 
2018 season and, under the management of our New York 
based sales and marketing team, will provide us with 
greater control over the long-term growth of the brand 
within the US.
In Germany we continued to perform in line with 
expectations and experienced good growth in the 
independent retailer segment where we now have  
over 400 stockists.

DEVELOPMENT AS A LIFESTYLE BRAND 
Joules delivered sales growth across product categories 
with a particularly strong performance in the core 
womenswear category – with our distinctive and colourful 
“Right as Rain” outerwear and “Warm Welcome” coats and 
gilets all proving particularly popular with our customers.  
Further development of our footwear and childrenswear 
categories also contributed to the strong growth. 
We continued to progress the development of our 
childrenswear range from baby through to toddler,  
younger and older girls and boys.  Notable highlights in  
the year included our colourful ponchos, fun applique  
tops and beautifully designed dresses.  Our childrenswear  
range is becoming increasingly popular with our 
international customers.
Our footwear offer continued to expand with good growth 
from our very popular leather Chelsea boot range and an 
increased range of wellington boot styles and designs.
Whilst licencing remains a small contributor to the Group, 
we are focused on continuing to build the brand through 
careful expansion with licensed partners for home - 
including bedding; toiletries; and eyewear.  These product 
categories continue to perform well and highlight the 
exciting licence income potential available to the brand 
where we are able to identify opportunities that appeal to 
our customers and align with Joules’ distinctive values.  
CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT
Joules has a loyal and highly engaged customer community.  
Active customers, defined as customers who have 
purchased in the last twelve months, increased 14% against 
the prior year to 907,000 supported by effective marketing 
and CRM campaigns, and our total customer database now 
stands at 2.5 million.  One example of a customer campaign, 
was our hugely successful ‘pass the parcel’ competition 
which we ran on the Joules Facebook channel in December 
2016.  The campaign encouraged potential and existing 
customers to unwrap a virtual present to potentially win a 
prize including a weekend stay at The Watergate Bay Hotel 
as well as Joules goodies.  Customers were able to ‘pass the 
parcel’ onto a friend through social media, attracting new 
prospective customers to the brand.  
Another notable and successful multi-channel campaign 
was our ‘win a Joules caravan’ competition that ran from 
February to April 2017 and attracted approximately 135,000 
new and existing customers to take part and enter a 
prize draw to win a luxury caravan decorated externally 
with Joules prints and kitted out inside from the Joules 
homeware and bedding range.  The campaign, which 
attracted a lot of social media engagement, was run on 
Facebook, the Joules website and by pitching the caravan  
at several of our country shows and events.  
One of Joules’ key competitive advantages is our very 
strong customer connection and their engagement with the 
Joules brand.  During the year we appointed our first Chief 
Customer Officer to help further develop our capability in 
this area and to increase brand awareness, customer loyalty 
and value across all channels.
PLATFORM FOR LONG TERM GROWTH
The Group’s strategy and focus is aimed towards the long 
term and sustainable development of the Joules brand.  We 
continue to invest in our stores, infrastructure, systems 
and people to deliver this. 
During the year we invested in our US operations by 
strengthening our US wholesale sales team, trade 
showroom and IT systems.  This has supported the 
development of new and existing department store 
accounts during the year as well as facilitating the 
transition of managing the independent stockist channel 
in-house, which we are confident will support our long 
term growth in the US market. 
Phase two of our company-wide ERP replacement 
programme continued through the year, with migration 
to the Microsoft Dynamics AX ERP platform scheduled 
for FY18.  This represents a significant investment for the 
Group and will bring benefits including enhanced stock 
management across channels, process efficiencies and 
simplification of the IT environment.
The creativity, skill and commitment of the Joules team 
are key to the brand’s continued success.  We continue to 
invest in skills and people development in all areas of the 
business including our customer facing colleagues and team 
leaders across the business. 
Since the year-end we have completed the acquisition 
of the freehold for a new head office premises.  The new 
site, which is located very close to our existing head 
office in Market Harborough, includes an existing 30,000 
square foot office building and development land to 
support future growth.  We expect to commence partial 
occupation towards the end of FY18 following a period of 
refurbishment.  This investment will further strengthen 
our brand values and culture and create a flexible space 
to support modern ways of working across our head office 
teams.  It is an important step to support the next phase  
of growth whilst solidifying our local roots and heritage.

Chief Executive Officer PROFIT BEFORE TAX - UNDERLYING AND STATUTORY
Underlying profit before tax (‘PBT’) was £10.1 million for 
the 52 weeks to 28 May 2017, an increase of 34.0% on the 
prior period.  Statutory PBT including exceptional IPO 
transaction costs and share based compensation was  
£8.9 million (FY16: £(1.2)m).
EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAX, DEPRECIATION & 
AMORTISATION (‘EBITDA’)
Underlying EBITDA increased by 25.3% to £16.9 million 
(FY16: £13.5m).  The underlying EBITDA margin increased 
by 50 basis points from 10.3% to 10.8%.
UNDERLYING AND STATUTORY RESULTS
During the prior period there were some costs that were 
exceptional or non-recurring in nature.  These items 
related primarily to the IPO and to the capital structure 
that was in place prior to the IPO.  
FINANCIAL REVIEW
JOULES GROUP PLC
To provide a meaningful year-on-year comparison these 
items have been excluded from the underlying results 
reported in the front section of the Annual Report.  
As detailed in the IPO Admission Document, executive 
and employee share based compensation plans have been 
established with the first awards made in the current 
financial period.  Further detail on the plans is contained 
within the Director’s Remuneration Report and the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.  In accordance with 
IFRS 2, the expense related to the plans is accounted 
for within administrative expenses.  As the share plan 
cycle matures over the three years following the IPO, the 
related expense is treated as non-Underlying to provide 
meaningful year-on-year comparability. 
A reconciliation between Underlying and Statutory 
(GAAP) results is provided below.

52 WEEKS ENDED 28 MAY 2017 52 WEEKS ENDED 29 MAY 2016 REVENUE
Group revenue increased by 19.6% to £157.0 million from 
£131.3 million in FY16 (up 18.6% on a constant currency 
basis), with Retail revenue increasing by 19.4% and 
Wholesale revenue increasing by 20.3% (up 17.6% on a 
constant currency basis).  Sales in International markets, 
which are predominantly Wholesale, increased by 36.2% 
(29.6% on a constant currency basis) and now represent 
11.5% of Group revenues (FY16: 10.1%). 
Retail - Stores
Store revenue at £68.3 million increased by 17.5%.  
During the year we opened 13 new stores and closed two 
stores, resulting in an increase in store numbers from 97 
to 108.  We also relocated three stores and extended a 
further three.  We had three franchises at the end of  
FY17 (FY16: 3). 
Retail – E-commerce
E-commerce revenue at £38.9 million increased by 29.4% 
and was 34.8% of total Retail revenue (FY16: 32.1%).  
The E-commerce channel continued to benefit from 
more visitors and higher conversion following the prior 
year re-launch of the content rich, mobile optimised 
website, as well as from further customer facing website 
enhancements and ongoing new customer acquisition 
and retention activity.
Wholesale
Wholesale revenue at £44.8 million increased by 20.3% 
(17.6% on a constant currency basis).  Good revenue 
growth was seen in the UK and in international markets; 
and across the larger ‘house account’ and the smaller 
‘field account’ customer bases.
GROSS MARGIN
Gross margin at 55.4% was 190 basis points higher than 
the prior year.  Our commercial and buying activity; 
supported with volume growth, enabled us to offset the 
impact of weaker Sterling, relative to the US Dollar, and 
maintain overall intake margins.  The revenue growth 
and gross margin improvement within our Retail segment 
more than offset the dilutive impact of our growing 
international wholesale business.  Within the Retail 
segment, gross margin benefited from our increased focus 
on optimising full price sales and promotional activity.  
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES - UNDERLYING
Underlying administrative expenses increased by 
23.2% from £62.3 million to £76.7 million and were 
48.9% of revenue (FY16: 47.4%).  During the year we 
increased investment in customer acquisition and 
digital marketing, the results of which are reflected in 
the e-commerce channel performance and our active 
customer numbers at the year end.  Administration 
expenses in the period included the full year impact 
of investments made to strengthen several head office 
functions in the second-half of the prior year as well as 
the first year of post-IPO cost base.
The total rental expense, including service charges, 
for the period was £11.7 million (FY16: £9.3m) with the 
increase due to new store openings, an increase in the 
UK distribution centre rent, following a rent review at the 
start of FY17, the prior year relocation of our Shanghai 
sourcing office and New York showroom expansion.
Underlying depreciation and amortisation increased to 
£6.6 million (FY16: £5.5m) following the completion of 
the first phase of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
programme in the prior period and the impact of our new 
store opening and relocation programme.
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES – NON-UNDERLYING
Non-underlying administrative expenses totalled  
£1.1 million (FY16: £3.1m).  This included IPO transaction 
related costs of £0.3 million (FY16: £2.7m), share based 
compensation expense of £0.8 million (FY16: £nil) and 
non-recurring costs of £nil (FY16: £0.4m). 
Share based compensation expense, accounted for in 
accordance with IFRS 2, includes the anticipated expense 
in relation to the first cycle of the Company’s new share 
plan arrangements, including awards made under the Long 
Term Incentive Plan 2016, Deferred Bonus Plan and the all-
employee Save as You Earn (SAYE) Scheme.  These plans 
are detailed more fully in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and the Consolidated Financial Statements.
NET FINANCE COSTS - UNDERLYING 
Underlying net finance costs of £0.2 million (FY16: £0.5m) 
related to interest and facility charges on the Group’s 
revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank Plc.
Financial Review    
1 9    NET FINANCE COSTS - NON-UNDERLYING
Non-underlying net finance costs totalled £nil  
(FY16: £5.6m).  The prior year figures consisted  
primarily of interest on shareholder loan notes of £4.7 
million and amortisation of the loan note arrangement 
fee of £0.9 million.  The shareholder loan notes were  
converted to equity immediately prior to the IPO.  
TAXATION
The tax charge for the period was £2.6 million  
(FY16: £0.6m).  The effective tax rate was 28.8%.   
This was higher than the applicable UK corporation  
tax rate of 19.8% for the period due to the impact of 
non-deductible expenses including IPO costs and  
non-deductible amortisation and depreciation.  
EARNINGS PER SHARE AND DIVIDEND
Statutory basic earnings per share for the period 
were 7.3 pence per share (FY16: -2.0 pence per share).  
Statutory diluted earnings per share for the period were 
7.2 pence per share (FY16: -2.0 pence per share).  On an 
underlying, pro forma basis the FY17 basic earnings per 
share were 9.2 pence (FY16: 6.9 pence).
To facilitate meaningful comparison of earnings per share 
the weighted average number of shares in issue has been 
restated on a pro forma basis to reflect the post-IPO 
capital structure. The pro forma assumes that the number 
of shares in issue post-IPO were in issue throughout.   
Earnings are adjusted for the non-underlying items 
detailed above and to reflect the statutory tax rate.
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.2 pence 
per share in respect of FY17 (FY16: nil pence per share).  
This brings the total dividend for FY17 to 1.8 pence per 
share (FY16: nil pence per share).  
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
20    
Financial Review
Following approval by shareholders at the AGM on  
27 September 2017, the dividend is expected to be paid 
on 16 November 2017 to shareholders on the register at 
27 October 2017.
CASH FLOW AND CASH POSITION
Net cash flow from operating activities was £14.4 million 
(FY16: £16.9m) including a net working capital outflow of 
£0.9 million (FY16: inflow £7.1m). 
The Group ended the period with net cash of  
£6.3 million (FY16: £3.2m) an improvement of  
£3.1 million in the period.  Gross cash was £7.0 million 
(FY16: £9.3m) and borrowings were £0.6 million (FY16: 
£6.1m), which includes borrowings under the Group’s 
revolving credit facility and asset finance loans.  
The Group has access to a £25 million revolving credit 
facility provided by Barclays Bank Plc to fund seasonal 
working capital requirements.  Subsequent to the  
year-end, this facility was extended by 14 months and  
now matures in July 2021. 
INVENTORY
Inventory at year-end was £21.2 million (FY16: £19.3m).  The 
increase in inventory reflecting the growth in the business.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Investment in property, plant, equipment and intangible 
assets totalled £10.7 million in FY17 (FY16: £7.1m).  
Major areas of expenditure in the year were new store 
openings and relocations and investment in our core 
IT infrastructure including phase two of our ERP 
implementation programme and ongoing enhancements 
to our customer facing website. 
ACQUISITION OF FREEHOLD OFFICE
Subsequent to the year-end, in July 2017, the Group 
completed the acquisition of freehold land and 30,000 
square foot office building for £4.4 million including 
fees and stamp duty. The office building is intended 
for use as the Group’s head office following a period 
of refurbishment. The acquisition was part financed 
through a new £3.5 million, five-year term loan facility 
arranged with Barclays Bank Plc.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
PRINCIPAL RISKS and UNCERTAINTIES
JOULES GROUP PLC
Set out below are the principal risks and uncertainties 
that the Directors consider could impact the business.  
The Board continually reviews the potential risks facing 
the Group and the controls in place to mitigate any 
potential adverse impacts. 
EXTERNAL RISKS
External risks reflect those risks where we are unable to influence the likelihood of the risk arising and 
therefore focus is on minimising the impact should the risk arise.
The Board also recognises that the nature and scope 
of risks can change and that there may be other risks 
to which the Group is exposed and so the list is not 
intended to be exhaustive.
The Corporate Governance Report includes an 
overview of our approach to risk management 
and internal control systems and processes.
RISK AND IMPACT  
Economy  
The majority of the Group’s revenue is generated from sales 
in the UK to UK customers.  A deterioration in the  
UK economy may adversely impact consumer confidence 
and spending on discretionary items.  A reduction in 
consumer expenditure could materially and adversely  
affect the Group’s financial condition, operations and 
business prospects. 
The expected exit of the UK from the EU has increased the 
likelihood and potential impact of this risk.
MITIGATING FACTORS  
  
As a premium lifestyle brand with a geographically disperse 
retail store portfolio, a strong e-commerce channel and 
long standing wholesale customer accounts, the Directors 
consider that the UK business would be less affected by 
a reduction in consumer expenditure than many other 
clothing retailers.  
In addition, the property portfolio has short lease terms, 
providing relative flexibility to close or relocate stores 
should it become necessary. 
Competitor Actions 
New competitors or existing clothing retailers or lifestyle 
brands may target our segment of the market.  Existing 
competitors may increase their level of discounting or 
promotions and/or expand their presence in new channels.   
These actions could adversely impact our sales and profits. 
Regulatory and Political  
New regulations or compliance requirements may be 
introduced from time to time.  These may have a material 
impact on the cost base or operational complexity of the 
business.  Non-compliance with the regulation could result 
in financial penalties.
The anticipated exit of the UK from the EU has increased 
uncertainty in this area.
Foreign Exchange   
The Group purchases the majority of its product stock from 
overseas and is therefore exposed to foreign currency risk, 
primarily the US Dollar. 
Without mitigation, input costs may fluctuate in the short 
term, creating uncertainty as to profits and cash flows.
The anticipated exit of the UK from the EU has resulted in a 
devaluation of GBP to the US Dollar and increased volatility. 
This may be sustained or worsen going forward.
Joules differentiates from competitors through its strong 
brand and products that are known for their quality, details, 
colour and prints.  Our large customer database allows 
the Group to communicate effectively with customers, 
developing customer engagement and loyalty. 
The Group has processes in place to monitor and report to 
the Board on new regulations and compliance requirements 
that could have an impact on the business.  The impact of 
any new regulation is evaluated and reflected in the Group’s 
financial forecasts and planning. 
The Group’s Treasury Policy sets out the parameters and 
procedures relating to foreign currency hedging.  We 
currently seek to hedge a material proportion of forecasted 
US Dollar requirement 12 months ahead through the use of 
forward contracts.
The Group’s US wholesale business generates US Dollar 
income which provides a degree of natural hedging. INTERNAL RISKS
Internal risks reflect those where we can influence the likelihood of the risk arising and the impact  
if the risk should arise.
RISK AND IMPACT  
Brand and Reputation  
The strength of our brand and its reputation are very 
important to the success of the Group.  Failure to protect 
and manage this could reduce the confidence and trust 
that customers place in the business, which could have a 
detrimental impact on sales, profits and business prospects. 
Our brand may be undermined or damaged by our actions 
or those of our wholesale partners.
MITIGATING FACTORS  
  
Brand and reputation are monitored closely by senior 
management and the Board.  The Group’s public relations 
are actively managed and customer feedback, both direct 
and indirect, is carefully monitored. 
We carefully consider each new trade customer with whom 
we do business and monitor on an ongoing basis.
Supply Chain  
The disruption to any material element of the Group’s 
supply chain, in particular the UK central distribution 
centre, could impact sales and impact on our ability to 
supply our wholesale customers, stores and consumers.
Design  
As with all clothing and lifestyle brands there is a risk that 
our offer will not satisfy the needs of our customers or that 
we fail to correctly identify trends that are important to 
our customer base.  These outcomes may result in lower 
sales, excess inventories and/or higher markdowns.
ERP System  
We are in the process of implementing a new IT platform, 
Microsoft Dynamics AX, across the Group.  With any 
project of this scale, there is a risk of a poorly managed 
implementation or take up of new systems, which could 
result in business disruption.
IT Security and Systems Availability  
Non availability of the Group’s IT systems, including the 
website, for a prolonged period could result in business 
disruption, loss of sales and reputational damage.
Malicious attacks, data breaches or viruses, could lead to 
business interruption and reputational damage.
Product Sourcing   
The Group’s products are predominantly manufactured 
overseas.  Failure to carry out sufficient due diligence, and 
to act in the event of any negative findings, especially in 
relation to ethical or quality related issues, could adversely 
impact our brand and reputation.
Key Management  
Our performance is linked to the performance of our people 
and in particular to the leadership of key individuals.  The loss 
of a key individual at management level or within a specialist 
skill set could have a detrimental effect on our operations 
and, in some cases, the creative vision for the brand.
The Business Continuity Plan includes an established 
procedure in the event of the loss of the UK distribution 
centre.  In addition the Group maintains insurance cover at 
an appropriate level to protect against the impact of such 
an interruption.
The Group has a policy and process for the selection of new 
suppliers.  This includes a review of compliance with laws 
and regulations and that suppliers meet generally accepted 
standards of good practice.  In addition, suppliers are 
required to sign up to Joules’ code of conduct. 
The Group operates a programme of ethical audits across 
the product supply base supported by a third party agency. 
Joules has a long established in-house creative and design 
team who have a high level of awareness and understanding 
of our target customer segment.  A large proportion of 
our product range is anchored in classic products that are 
evolved season to season.  Early feedback from our trade 
customers can allow us to further refine our product range 
ahead of significant purchase commitments.
The first phase of our implementation went live in 
November 2015, supporting our US wholesale operations.  A 
dedicated programme team with significant experience of 
our business processes and ERP implementation has been 
established.  The programme team reports monthly to a 
steering committee comprised of Group senior management.
A Business Continuity Plan exists to minimise the impact of 
a loss of key systems and to recover the use of the system 
and associated data.  A regular assessment of vulnerability 
to malicious attacks is performed and any weaknesses 
rectified.  All Group employees are made aware of the 
Group’s IT security policies and we deploy a suite of tools 
(email filtering, antivirus etc) to protect against such events.
The Group’s remuneration policy, which includes a long 
term incentive scheme and performance-related pay, is 
designed to attract and retain key management.  The Group 
operates learning and development initiatives to increase 
the opportunities for internal succession.
Principal Risks & Uncertainties    
23 RESPONSIBLY JOULES 
Our Responsibly Joules framework is central to our 
business and reflects our intrinsic brand values.  The 
framework sets out our core beliefs about the way we 
want our business to operate; fairly, responsibly and 
sustainably.  We believe it is not only the right thing to 
do, but that it also drives value for our many stakeholders, 
both internal and external, including our customers, 
employees, investors, local communities and suppliers.    
This year we established the Responsibly Joules Steering 
Group, chaired by the Group CFO and comprising 
directors from across the business.  Each director  
has responsibility for one element of our Responsibly  
Joules framework and is supported by a team from  
across the business.  This approach is enabling us to 
raise the profile of Responsibly Joules and increase 
employee engagement.     
24    
Social Responsibility 
Our Responsibly Joules framework has four core 
elements which align with the way we operate  
as a business:
• Charitably Joules
• Sourcing with Integrity
• Protecting our Environment from Shire to Shore
• Our Joules Family
CHARITABLY JOULES
We are proud that our stores sit at the heart of many 
communities and believe that we have a responsibility 
to play a positive role within those communities.  We 
continue to support local community causes, charities 
and schools across the country with the local fundraising 
programmes that matter to our customers.  
We also have four charity partners with whom we have 
ongoing relationships; The Princes Trust, The British 
Bee Keepers Association, Nuzzlets and Farms for City 
Children.  All of these partners have a focus or purpose 
that closely aligns with Joules core values increasing the 
engagement with our employees and customers.  This 
year we have expanded the level of support that we have 
been able to provide to these charity partners; both 
financially and physically.  Our achievements include:  
• Working with our employees to raise and donate 
over £70,000 for our Charitably Joules partners
• Donating nearly £100,000 in gifts-in-kind to our 
charity partners.  This included providing Joules 
wellies to all of the Farms for City Children farms 
for adults and children to use as they are exploring 
the muddy outdoors and providing the uniform for 
the volunteers at Nuzzlets
• Facilitating both store and head office staff in 
volunteering with our charity partners, including 
our founder, Tom Joule, who has spent time 
mentoring young people with The Prince’s Trust

SUPPORTING THE PRINCES TRUST (case study)
We support The Prince’s Trust Enterprise Programme in 
Leicester and Kettering, helping to fund an ‘Introduction 
to Business’ course for young people interested in 
setting up their own business.  Our funding also helps 
provide mentors and business loans for those who take 
their business dream forwards into reality.  
This year we ran an employee auction and raffle to 
raise money for The Prince’s Trust.  The auction saw 
employees from across the business offer auction ‘lots’ 
which ranged from a bespoke lunch menu for a week, to 
a holiday home for a weekend.  Employees were invited 
to bid on lots with all proceeds going to The Prince’s 
Trust.  Bidding was fast, furious and engaging and raised 
over £6,400.  This money, in addition to other funds 
donated by Joules in the last year, has helped to support 
the 249 young people that have taken part in  
the Enterprise programme in Leicester and 
Northamptonshire since our partnership commenced.  
“We are delighted to be partnering with Joules to 
transform young lives.  It’s been great to see so many 
teams at Joules driving our partnership across stores 
and engaging customers.  On behalf of everyone at 
The Prince’s Trust and the young people you support 
– the biggest thank you!”

SOURCING WITH INTEGRITY
Our customers, employees and shareholders have 
high expectations of us and our sourcing practices.  
Consequently, we have stringent standards in place which 
govern how we manage our supply chain and partners.  
These include standards on working and labour practices, 
fair wages, health and safety, animal testing and material 
use and sourcing.  All of our direct suppliers are required 
to sign up to the Joules Code and confirm that they are 
complying with these standards.
We recognise that simply communicating our standards 
and expectations isn’t always enough, and we therefore 
regularly audit our product manufacturers for compliance 
with these requirements.  All of our product suppliers 
are audited for ethical and social compliance using 
internationally recognised standards by a respected, 
independent, third party compliance organisation.  
We endeavour to continually review our product supply 
chain to ensure our suppliers meet these requirements 
and strive for best practice in every area.
PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT,  
FROM SHIRE TO SHORE
With our roots in the British countryside, the 
environment is very important to us, and we are 
committed to working to protect it by continually 
considering the environmental impacts of our  
operations and working to reduce them where we  
can.  This includes:
Managing our logistics 
We utilise third party distribution partners to deliver 
our product to our stores, wholesale customers and our 
customers’ homes.  In deciding who to partner with, 
the environmental credentials of these partners are an 
important factor.  This includes considerations such as 
their fill rates, fuel efficiency, use of electric vehicles 
and long-term strategy and environmental targets.  
Our UK logistics partners have strong commitments 
in place to continuously improve their environmental 
performance.  We review their environmental 
performance to ensure that they continue to meet  
our expectations. 
Our packaging focus  
In England, the quality and high levels of recycled 
content in our carrier bags means that we don’t have 
to charge our customer the carrier bag tax.  We are 
continuing to look at ways to further improve the 
environmental credentials of our packaging.
Tracking energy consumption
We continue to operate our biomass boiler which heats 
our Distribution Centre, as well as installing energy 
efficient lighting into all new, relocated and refurbished 
stores.  We are working with our energy suppliers to 
enhance the reporting and insight available to enable 
us to identify opportunities to further reduce energy 
consumption across our business activities.
Measurement
We continue to focus on improving the coverage, quality 
and accuracy of the data to quantify the environmental 
impacts across all areas of our operations.  This data is 
important to prioritise areas of focus as we continue to 
grow both in the UK and internationally.   
“Joules have shown real passion and enthusiasm for 
giving back to their local communities through our 
Team Challenge programme. They have achieved 
great things and made such a difference to the 
projects they have supported. They are a great 
example of how business volunteering can have a 
positive and lasting impact on the community”

It is our people that make our business the great success 
that it is today and we are committed to continuing to 
offer them a working life and benefits programme that 
builds our reputation as an employer of choice.  
In the last year, we have continued to enhance our 
employee offering, expanding existing areas as well  
as launching several new programmes:
Building on the launch of our employee volunteering 
policy, we saw 64 employees participating in 
volunteering days during the last year.  We were 
delighted that of these, over 30% were from senior 
management positions within the business, showing  
the strength of our leadership commitment.
We ran four team volunteering days through the year, 
in partnership with Leicestershire Cares.  Teams 
from across the business spent a day supporting local 
communities doing everything from tree planting to 
clearing waterways of litter.
We launched a Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme in the 
year with nearly a third of eligible staff participating.
The Joules Leadership Development Programme was 
launched during the year with over 250 employees 
participating in the programme that has been delivered 
from the top down, focusing on self-awareness, 
influencing, motivation and team effectiveness to those 
members who manage and influence teams.
We rolled out a series of ‘Listening Groups’ for employees 
across the business.  The Listening Groups allow us to 
gather views on all aspects of working at Joules.  
They cover many areas including culture, learning and 
development, and reward.  Employees are given the 
chance to share with us how they think we’re doing and 
what we are good at and what we could improve.
Employee engagement and communications is achieved 
through regular ‘Directors briefings’ to all head office 
and warehouse employees, a weekly newsletter and the 
Group intranet.  We hold a store manager conference 
twice per year and issue a weekly newsletter for all store 
based employees.  The communications aim to keep 
employees up to date on Group initiatives and financial 
performance.  We encourage employee feedback through 
formal and informal channels.
We are an equal opportunities employer and give full 
and fair consideration to employment applications 
regardless of race, gender and/or disability, having 
regard to an applicant’s aptitudes and abilities.  We also 
strive to provide ongoing training, career development 
and promotion opportunities for all employees.  In 
the unfortunate event that an employee should 
become disabled we are committed to continuing their 
employment and for arranging appropriate training. “A trip to the fishing

31 BOARD DECISIONS AND ACTIVITY DURING THE YEAR
The Board has a schedule of regular business, financial and 
operational matters, and each Board Committee that has 
met to date has compiled a schedule of work, to ensure 
that all areas for which the Board has responsibility are 
addressed and reviewed during the course of the year.  The

Each Committee has written terms of reference setting 
out its duties, authority and reporting responsibilities, 
with copies available on the Company’s website (www.
joulesgroup.com) or on request from the Company 
Secretary.  The terms of reference of each Committee 
were put in place at the time of the Company’s admission 
to AIM on 26 May 2016 and they are kept under review to 
ensure they remain appropriate and reflect any changes in 
legislation, regulation or best-practice. Each Committee 
comprises Non-Executive Directors of the Company. 
The Company Secretary is the secretary of the Audit and 
Nomination Committees and the Group Legal Counsel is 
secretary for the Remuneration Committee.
BOARD EFFECTIVENESS
The skills and experience of the Board are set out in  
their biographical details on page 30.  The experience  
and knowledge of each of the Directors gives them 
the ability to constructively challenge strategy and to 
scrutinise performance.  
SEPARATION OF DUTIES
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  Neil McCausland, 
the Chairman, leads the Board and is responsible for its 
effectiveness and governance.  He sets the Board agenda 
and ensures that sufficient time is allocated to important 
matters, in particular, strategic issues.  Colin Porter, the 
Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of Joules’ operations and for recommending 
strategy to the Board.  Colin is then responsible for 
implementing that strategy supported by the wider 
management team.
The Non-Executive Directors have responsibility for 
determining the remuneration of Executive Directors and 
have a prime role in appointing and, where necessary, 
removing Executive Directors, and in succession planning.
INDUCTION OF NEW DIRECTORS
No new directors were appointed during the year and there 
were no resignations.  It is intended that, in the future, on 
joining the Board, new directors will undergo an induction 
programme which will be tailored to the existing knowledge 
and experience of the director concerned, including store and 
office visits; meetings with key employees; and presentations 
from management on topics such as strategy, finance and risk. 
The Chairman will be responsible for this process. 
TIME COMMITMENTS
The Board is satisfied that the Chairman and each of the 
Non-Executive and Executive Directors continue to be 
able to devote sufficient time to the Company’s business.  
There has been no change in the Chairman’s other time 
commitments since his appointment.

review during the year.  This was led by the Chairman and 
consisted of interviews; the completion of questionnaires; 
and in-depth discussions between the Executive and Non-
Executive Directors.

No major changes to the function and focus of the Board 
arose from this evaluation, however, the findings will be 
used as the basis of future discussions by the Board, and 
the Nomination Committee, when considering short and 
long term succession planning.  The Chairman will continue 
to meet regularly with the Non-Executive Directors 
without the Executive Directors being present.  The Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director will also meet with his 
fellow Non-Executive Director, at least annually, to appraise 
the Chairman’s performance and on such other occasions as 
are deemed appropriate.
DEVELOPMENT
The Company Secretary ensures that all Directors are kept 
abreast of changes in relevant legislation and regulations, 
with the assistance of the Group’s advisers where 
appropriate.  Executive Directors are subject to the Group’s 
performance development review process through which 
their performance against objectives is reviewed and their 
personal and professional development needs considered.  
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
In the appropriate circumstances, the Board may authorise 
Executive Directors to take non-executive positions in 
other companies and organisations provided the time 
commitment does not conflict with the Director’s duties to 
the Company.  The appointment to such positions is subject 
to Board approval.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
At each meeting the Board considers Directors’ conflicts of 
interest.  The Company’s Articles of Association (‘Articles’) 
provide for the Board to authorise any actual or potential 
conflicts of interest.
INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL ADVICE
Directors have access to independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense.  In addition, they have access to 
the advice and services of the Company Secretary who is 
responsible for advice on corporate governance matters to 
the Board. 
DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ LIABILITY INSURANCE
The Company has purchased directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance during the year as allowed by the Company’s 
Articles.
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
In accordance with the Code all Directors will offer 
themselves for election at each AGM.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness.  However, any such system of internal control 
can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.  
The Board considers that the internal controls in place  
are appropriate for the size, complexity and risk profile  
of the Group. 
The principal elements of the Group’s internal control 
system include:
• Day to day management of the activities of the Group 
by the executive Directors
• A detailed annual budget is prepared including an 
integrated profit and loss, balance sheet and cash flow.  
The budget is approved by the Board
• Monthly reporting of performance against the budget 
is prepared and reviewed by the Board
• A schedule of delegated authority is maintained which 
defines levels of approval authority over such items as 
capital expenditure, commercial contracts, litigation 
and treasury matters
• Maintenance of a risk register which is reviewed at 
least annually by the Board 
The Group continues to review its system of internal 
control to ensure compliance with best practice, whilst also 
having regard to its size and the resources available.
BOARD DIVERSITY
The Board does not have a formal board diversity policy 
but plans to continue to review the need for such a policy 
annually taking into account the size of the Board and  
skills required.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Group maintains communication with institutional 
shareholders through individual meetings with Executive 
Directors, particularly following publication of the Group’s 
interim and full year preliminary results.  All shareholders 
are encouraged to attend the Annual General Meeting 
at which the Group’s activities will be considered and 
questions answered.  General information about the Group 
is also available on the Group’s website: www.joulesgroup.
com.  This includes an overview of activities of the Group 
and details of all recent Group announcements.  The Non-
Executive Directors are available to discuss any matters 
stakeholders might wish to raise, and the Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors will attend meetings with 
investors and analysts as required.  Investor relations 
activity and a review of the share register are standing 
items on the Board’s agenda and the chairman ensures 
ongoing, effective communication with shareholders.
The Senior Independent Director is available to 
shareholders if they have any concerns which fail to be 
resolved through normal contact channels of the Chairman, 
Chief Executive or other Executive Directors or when such 
contact channels are inappropriate.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (‘AGM’)
The Company’s AGM will take place on 27 September 2017.  
The Annual Report and Accounts and Notice of the AGM  
will be sent to shareholders at least 20 working days prior 
to this date. On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Audit 
Committee report for the 52 weeks ended 28 May 2017.  
The Audit Committee has responsibility for, amongst 
other things, the monitoring of the financial integrity 
of the financial statements of the Group and the 
involvement of the Group’s auditors in the external audit 
process, together with providing oversight and advice 
to the Board in relation to current and potential future 
risk exposures of the Group, reviewing and approving 
various formal reporting requirements and promoting 
a risk awareness culture within the Group.  The Audit 
Committee also provides advice to the board as to 
whether the annual report and accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy.
MEMBERS OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Committee consists of three Non-Executive 
Directors: David Stead (Chair), Neil McCausland 
and Jill Little.  The Auditor (Deloitte LLP), the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer also attend 
Committee meetings by invitation.  The Committee has 
met three times since 5 September 2016, being the date 
the Group’s last Annual Report was approved.
The Board is satisfied that I, as Chairman of the 
Committee, have recent and relevant financial 
experience.  I am a chartered accountant and I have 
served as Finance Director in a number of companies 
including Dunelm Group plc.  I report formally to 
the Board, as appropriate, on issues discussed by 
the Audit Committee and I present the Committee’s 
recommendations.
The Committee also takes time to meet with the external 
auditors without any Executive Directors or senior 
management present. 
DUTIES
The duties of the Audit Committee are set out in its 
Terms of Reference, which are available on the Company 
website (www.joulesgroup.com) and are also available on 
request from the Company Secretary. 
The Committee meets a minimum of twice per year.
The main items of business considered by the Audit 
Committee during the year have included:
• Review of the financial statements and Annual Report
• Consideration of the external audit report and 
management representation letter
• Going concern review
• Review of the risk management and internal control 
systems
• Reviewing the need for an internal audit function
• Review of whistleblowing reports
• Review of the implications of forthcoming updates or 
changes to accounting standards
ROLE OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Audit Committee monitors the Company’s 
relationship with the external auditor, Deloitte LLP, 
to ensure that auditor independence and objectivity 
are maintained.  As part of its review the Committee 
monitors the provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor.  The breakdown of fees between audit 
and non-audit services is provided in note 5 of the 
Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.  The non-
audit fees related to tax advisory and Remuneration 
Committee advice.  The Committee also assesses the 
auditor’s performance.  Having reviewed the auditor’s 
independence and performance, the Audit Committee 
recommends that Deloitte LLP be re-appointed as the 
Company’s auditor at the next AGM.
AUDIT PROCESS
The auditor prepares an audit plan that sets out the 
scope of the audit, key areas of audit focus, audit 
materiality and the audit timetable for audit work.  
This plan is reviewed and agreed in advance by the  
Audit Committee.  Following the completion of its work, 
the auditor presents its findings to the Audit Committee 
for discussion. 
INTERNAL AUDIT
At present the Group does not have an internal audit 
function.  In view of the size and nature of the Group’s 
business, the Committee believes that management 
is able to derive assurance as to the adequacy and 
effectiveness of internal controls and risk management 
procedures without a formal internal audit function.  
This will be kept under review as the business evolves.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Group has a framework of risk management and 
internal control systems, policies and procedures.  
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the 
risk management and internal control framework and 
ensuring that it operates effectively.  The Committee  
has reviewed the framework and is satisfied that the 
internal control systems in place are currently  
operating effectively.
WHISTLEBLOWING
The Group has in place a whistleblowing policy which 
sets out the formal process by which an employee of  
the Group may, in confidence, raise concerns about 
possible improprieties in financial reporting or other 
matters.  Whistleblowing is a standing item on the 
Committee’s agenda, and updates will be provided 
at each meeting.  During the period, there were no 
incidents for consideration.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have prepared a detailed financial forecast 
with a supporting business plan covering the medium 
term future.  The forecast indicates that the Group 
will remain in compliance with covenants throughout 
the forecast period.  As such, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future.  For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing financial statements.

Nomination Committee Report    DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
JOULES GROUP PLC
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report for the 52 weeks ended 
28 May 2017 (FY17).  Although not subject to the reporting 
regulations of fully listed companies in the UK, the 
Remuneration Committee has taken account of these 
regulations in the preparation of the FY17 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report as a matter of best practice.  
Therefore this report is presented as:
• A Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report – setting 
out the parameters within which the remuneration 
arrangements for Directors operate; and
• An Annual Report on Remuneration – setting out the 
remuneration earned by Directors in respect of FY17 
and how we intend to apply the policy for FY18
OUR APPROACH TO REMUNERATION – KEY PRINCIPLES
Our policy on executive remuneration adopted on 
admission to AIM is designed to:-
• Include a competitive mix of base salary and short and 
long term incentives, with an appropriate proportion 
of the package determined by stretching targets linked 
to the Group’s performance;
• Promote the long-term success of the Group, in 
line with our strategy and focus on profitability and 
growth; and
• Provide appropriate alignment between the interests 
of shareholders and executives.  Alignment is further 
enhanced through shareholding guidelines and the 
deferral of a proportion of the annual bonus as shares
FY17 was the first full year of operation of our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy.
FY17 PERFORMANCE AND ANNUAL BONUS OUTCOME
As detailed in the Strategic Report and Financial Review, 
Joules has delivered strong results and made continued 
progress against its stated strategic priorities.  Growth 
was delivered across the brand’s distribution channels and 
geographic markets, reflecting the growing appeal of the 
Joules brand and the quality and design of our products, 
both in the UK and internationally.   Based on FY17 
underlying PBT of £10.1 million the Executive Directors will 
receive 96.3% of their maximum annual bonus opportunity.  
Half the bonus earned being paid in cash and half as a share 
award deferred over three years.  Further details are set out 
in the following pages.
The Company’s first long-term incentive awards were 
granted under the LTIP in July 2016 (‘LTIP 2016’) and 
therefore there was no LTIP awards due to vest in respect of 
the year ended 28 May 2017. 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SALARIES AND NON-EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR FEES
In line with the salary review timetable for all other 
employees, the Executive Directors’ base salaries were 
reviewed in December 2016. The base salary for C N 
Porter and T S L Joule set at IPO, £345,000 and £335,000 
respectively, is unchanged.  The base salary for M S Dench 
was increased from £220,000 to £250,000 with effect from 
1 December 2016 taking into account his performance, 
development in role and contribution since he joined the 
business in 2015 and the competitiveness of his package 
against the market and his previous employer.
With effect from 29 May 2017, the Chairman’s fee was 
increased to £75,000, as agreed prior to the IPO.  No other 
changes have been made to Non-Executive Directors’ fees.
REMUNERATION FOR THE YEAR COMMENCING 29 MAY 2017
A summary of the proposed application of our remuneration 
policy for FY18 is set out below:
• It is intended that Executive director’s base salaries will 
be reviewed annually in December, at the same time as 
the pay review for the wider workforce
• The maximum annual bonus opportunity for FY18 
will be 100% of salary for C N Porter, T S L Joule and, 
unchanged at 150% of salary for M S Dench.  The annual 
bonus is subject to the achievement of stretching profit 
before tax (‘PBT’) performance targets 
• The second awards under the LTIP (‘LTIP 2017’) will be 
granted following the announcement of the FY17 full 
year results.   The maximum LTIP opportunity for C N 
Porter and T S L Joule is 100% of salary and, unchanged 
at 150% of salary for M S Dench.  These awards are 
subject to stretching targets with 80% of the award 
linked to an EPS target and 20% of the award linked to a 
strategic target of international revenue  
• The 150% of salary annual bonus and LTIP award to M S 
Dench is unchanged from FY17, however, the proportion 
of the FY18 annual bonus earned that will be paid in 
cash has been reduced to one third and the deferred 
share award element has been increased from half to 
two-thirds.  This recognises his on-going contribution 
to the group whilst providing a long term alignment 
with the interests of shareholders.
Directors’ Remuneration Report    
37 BASIC SALARY
To provide a 
competitive base 
salary for the market 
in which the Group 
operates to attract 
and retain Executive 
Directors of a 
suitable calibre.
 
BENEFITS
To provide market 
competitive benefits 
as part of the total 
remuneration 
package.
 
RETIREMENT 
BENEFITS
To provide an 
appropriate level of 
retirement benefit 
(or cash allowance 
equivalent).
Usually reviewed annually taking account of:
• Group performance 
• Role, experience and individual 
performance
• Competitive salary levels and market 
forces
• Pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group
  
Executive Directors currently receive private 
medical insurance, company car or allowance, 
staff discounts and the right to participate in 
the Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme. Other 
benefits may be provided based on individual 
circumstances. For example, relocation or 
travel expenses.
  
Executive Directors are eligible to participate 
in the Group defined contribution pension 
plan. In appropriate circumstances (e.g. if 
contributions exceed the annual or lifetime 
pension allowance in the UK), Executive 
Directors may be permitted to take the  
benefit as additional salary instead of  
pension contributions.
Increases will normally be in line with the range 
of salary increases awarded (in percentage terms) 
to other Group employees. Increases above 
this level may be awarded to take account of 
individual circumstances, such as:
• Promotion
• Change in scope or increase in 
responsibilities
• An individual’s development or  
performance in role 
• Alignment with the market over time
• A change in the size or complexity of  
the business
  
Whilst the Committee has not set a maximum 
level of benefits that Executive Directors may 
receive the value of benefits is set at a level 
which the Committee considers appropriate, 
taking into account market practice and 
individual circumstances.
  
The contribution level for FY18 is set at 5%  
of salary (there is an overall limit of up to 10%  
of salary).

ELEMENT, PURPOSE 
& STRATEGIC LINK OPERATION MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY
The Committee will continue to monitor our remuneration 
policy to ensure it remains aligned to the business strategy

Remuneration Committee Chairman
 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
The following section sets out our Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy (the “Policy”). 
The aim of the Policy is to align the interests of Executive 
Directors with the Group’s strategic vision and the  
long-term creation of shareholder value.  The Policy is 
intended to remunerate Executive Directors competitively 
and appropriately for effective delivery and allows them to 
share in this success and the value delivered  
to shareholders.  
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
The table below sets out the elements of Executive 
Directors’ compensation and how each element operates,  
as well as the maximum opportunity of each element and 
any applicable performance measures. ANNUAL BONUS
Rewards performance 
against targets 
which support the 
strategic direction of 
the Group. Deferral 
provides a retention 
element through 
share ownership and 
direct alignment 
to shareholders’ 
interests.
 
LONG-TERM 
INCENTIVE (‘LTIP’) 
To create alignment 
between the 
interests of 
Executive Directors 
and shareholders 
through the delivery 
of performance  
based awards in 
Group shares.
Awards are based on performance (typically 
measured over one year). Pay-out levels are 
determined by the Committee after the year 
end. The Committee has discretion to amend 
pay-outs should any formulaic output not 
reflect their assessment of performance. A 
proportion (normally 50%) of any bonus is 
paid in cash with the balance paid in the form 
of shares (subject to a de-minimis amount of 
£10,000) usually deferred for three years. For 
M S Dench, the proportion of the FY18 annual 
bonus earned will be paid in cash and has been 
reduced to one third and the deferred share 
award element has been increased to two 
thirds. Awards may include dividend equivalents 
earned between grant and vesting date.
  
Awards can be made over conditional shares 
or nil cost options (or cash equivalent).  
Vesting is subject to the achievement of 
specified performance conditions normally 
over three years. Awards may include 
dividend equivalents earned between grant 
and vesting date. Awards may be structured 
as Qualifying LTIP awards comprising of a 
HMRC tax-qualifying option and an LTIP 
award, with the vesting of the LTIP award 
scaled back to take account of any gain made 
on the exercise of the tax-qualifying option.
The annual bonus opportunity is up to a 
maximum of 150% of base salary. For FY18 the 
maximum bonus opportunity for C N Porter and 
T S L Joule is 100% of salary, and 150% of salary 
for MS Dench. 
Performance measure: Targets are set annually 
and aligned with key financial, strategic and/or 
individual targets with the weightings between 
these measures determined by the Committee 
each year considering the Group’s priorities  
at the time. 
The FY18 bonus is based on a PBT target.
 
  
The maximum LTIP opportunity is 150% of base 
salary. The maximum LTIP 2017 award for C N 
Porter and T S L Joule is 100% of salary and 
150% of salary for M S Dench. Where an award 
is structured as a Qualifying LTIP, the shares 
subject to the tax-qualifying option element are 
excluded for the purposes of this limit, reflecting 
the scale back. 
Performance measure: Set to reflect longer term 
strategy and business performance.  Performance 
measures and their weighting are reviewed 
annually to maintain appropriateness and 
relevance. For threshold levels of performance 25% 
of the award will vest rising to 100% for maximum 
performance.  Below threshold the award will not 
vest. The LTIP 2017 awards are subject to stretching  
targets with 80% of award based on EPS and 20% 
based on international revenue.

INFORMATION SUPPORTING THE POLICY TABLE
EXPLANATION OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES CHOSEN
Performance measures for the annual bonus and long- 
term incentive are selected that reflect the Group’s 
strategy.  Stretching performance targets are set each 
year by the Committee, taking into account a number of 
different factors.
For FY18, the annual bonus is based on PBT.  Stretch 
targets for the maximum awards under the bonus are set 
against outperformance of internal company forecasts.  The 
performance measure for the LTIP 2017 grant is adjusted 
diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) (80% of award weighting) 
and international revenue (20% of award weighting).  
The Committee considers EPS to be the key measure 
of sustainable business performance and international 
revenue growth to be a key strategic priority.
The Committee retains the discretion to adjust or set 
different performance measures or targets where it 
considers it appropriate to do so (for example, to reflect 
a change in strategy, a material acquisition and/or a 
divestment of a Group business or change in prevailing 
market conditions and to assess performance on a fair and 
consistent basis from year to year).  Awards and options 
may be adjusted in the event of a variation of share capital 
in accordance with the rules of the LTIP. 40    
Directors’ Remuneration Report   
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT  
CONTINUED
APPLICATION OF MALUS AND CLAWBACK
For up to three years following the payment of an annual 
bonus award (and two years after the vesting of an LTIP 
award), the Committee may require the repayment of all or 
some of the award if there is corporate failure, a material 
error or misstatement of the financial results, gross 
misconduct or if information comes to light which, had it 
been known, would have affected a decision as to the extent 
to which an award would have vested.  
The Committee also has the right to reduce, cancel or 
impose further restrictions on unvested LTIP and deferred 
bonus shares in similar circumstances (including material 
failure of risk management).
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES
To promote further alignment to shareholders interests 
and share ownership, each Executive Director is required 
to build and maintain a shareholding equal to two times the 
value of their annual base salary. 
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION
The Policy aims to facilitate the appointment of individuals 
of sufficient calibre to lead the business and execute the 
strategy effectively for the benefit of shareholders. When 
appointing a new Executive Director the Committee seeks 
to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of 
the Company and not to pay more than is appropriate.  
The Committee will take into consideration relevant 
factors, which may include the calibre of the individual, 
their existing remuneration package, and their specific 
circumstance, including the jurisdiction from which they 
are recruited.
Until this guideline is met Executive Directors will be 
required to retain half of any shares which vest under the 
deferred bonus or LTIP (after sales to cover tax).
LEGACY REMUNERATION
The Committee has the right to settle remuneration 
arrangements that were put in place prior to this Policy 
being created and in respect of remuneration awarded to 
individuals prior to becoming an Executive Director (and 
which was not awarded in anticipation of becoming an 
Executive Director).
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
The remuneration Policy for the Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors is to pay fees necessary to attract the 
individual of the calibre required, taking into consideration 
the size and complexity of the business and the time 
commitment of the role, without paying more than is 
necessary. Details are set out in the table below:
APPROACH TO 
SETTING FEES
BASIS OF FEES
OTHER
• The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are agreed by the Chairman and CEO and the fees for 
the Chairman are determined by the Board as a whole
• Fees are set taking into account the level of responsibility, relevant experience and specialist 
knowledge of each Non-Executive Director and fees at companies of a similar size and 
complexity
• Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee for membership of the Board with additional fees 
being paid for chairmanship of Board Committees
• Additional fees may also be paid for other Board responsibilities or roles 
• Fees are normally paid in cash
• Non-Executive Directors may be eligible to receive benefits such as travel and other expenses
• Neither the Chairman nor any of the Non-Executive Directors are eligible to participate in any 
of the Group’s incentive arrangements
The Committee will typically seek to align the  
remuneration package with the Group’s Remuneration 
Policy.  The Committee may make payments or awards to 
recognise or ‘buy-out’ remuneration packages forfeited on 
leaving a previous employer.  The Committee’s intention is 
that such awards would be made on a ‘like-for-like’ basis as 
those forfeited.  
The remuneration package for a newly appointed Chairman 
or Non-Executive Director will normally be in line with 
the structure set out in the Non-Executive Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy. SERVICE CONTRACTS
Each of the Executive Directors have service contracts 
with the Group.  The notice period of Executive Directors’ 
service will not exceed 12 months.  All Non-Executive 
Directors have initial fixed term agreements with the Group 
for no more than three years.  Details of the Directors’ 
service contracts, are set out below:
NAME           
T S Joule          
C N Porter       
M S Dench       
N W McCausland 
J C Little 
D A Stead 
CONSULTATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Committee will consider shareholder feedback received 
on remuneration matters including issues raised at the AGM 
as well as any additional comments received during any other 
meeting with shareholders.  The Committee will seek to engage 
directly with major shareholders and their representative 
bodies should any material changes be made to the Policy.
PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
Payments for loss of office will be in line with the 
provisions of the Executive Directors’ service contracts and 
the rules of the share plans (as set out in the IPO Admission 
document).  Where a buy-out award is made then the leaver 
provisions would be determined at the time of the award. 
In appropriate circumstances, payments may also be made 
in respect of accrued holiday, outplacement, legal fees 
and under the terms of the SAYE plan.  The Committee 
reserves the right to make additional payments where such 
payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing 
legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such 
an obligation) or by way of settlement or compromise or 
any claim arising in connection with the termination of 
Director’s office or employment.
Where the Committee retains discretion it will be used to 
provide flexibility in certain situations, taking into account 
the particular circumstances of the Director’s departure and 
performance.  There is no entitlement to any compensation 
in the event of Non-Executive Directors’ contracts not being 
renewed or the agreement terminating earlier.

Annual Report on Remuneration 
SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION
The tables below detail the total remuneration earned by each Director in respect of FY17. For FY18 the annual bonus opportunity for C N Porter and 
T S L Joule will be 100% of salary and for M S Dench 150% 
of salary.  Annual bonus is subject to the achievement of 
stretching PBT performance targets, with payment made 
50% in cash and 50% deferred into shares (vesting after a 
further three years).  For M S Dench payment will be 33% 
cash and 67% deferred into shares (vesting after a further 
three years).   
The Committee considers PBT to be the key short term 
financial measure.  The actual targets are not disclosed due 
to commercial confidentiality reasons but the PBT target 
will be disclosed when we report the performance out-turn 
in the FY18 Directors’ Remuneration Report.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES 
There were no LTIP awards due to vest in respect of  
the year ended 28 May 2017. 
In FY17, the Committee granted LTIP awards as set out  
in the table below.  
LTIP 2016
 
*Note: Because T S L Joule’s existing shareholding in the business is greater than 30%, 
it is intended that the LTIP 2016 awards will be cancelled and re-issued after the AGM 
subject to approval of a separate resolution at the AGM in relation to Rule 9 of the 
Takeover Code.
Vesting of the awards will be based upon the amount of 
the adjusted diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) delivered 
in the final Financial Year of the three year performance 
period (FY19). Below the threshold vesting target of 11.5p, 
none of this component of the award will vest. 25% of this 
component will vest if adjusted diluted EPS is 11.5p, with 
100% vesting at 14p, and vesting determined on a straight-
line basis between these figures.

BASE SALARIES
The base salaries for the Executive Directors will normally 
be reviewed with effect from December. 
T S L Joule  £335,000         £335,000
C N Porter  £345,000         £345,000
M S Dench  £250,000         £220,000
As noted above, the base salary for C N Porter and T S L 
Joule set at IPO is unchanged.  The base salary for M S 
Dench was increased with effect from 1 December 2016 
taking into account his performance, development in role 
and contribution since he joined the business in 2015 and 
the competitiveness of his package against the market and 
his previous employer.
TAXABLE BENEFITS
The taxable benefits for the Executive Directors included 
a company car or car allowance, private fuel and private 
medical insurance.
ANNUAL BONUS
For FY17 the maximum annual bonus opportunity for the 
Executive Directors was 100% of salary (and 150% of salary 
for M S Dench) subject to the achievement of stretching 
PBT performance targets.  The following table set out the 
bonuses earned by the Executive Directors for FY17 and 
how this reflects performance for the year.
For FY17 the values of each Executive Directors’ annual 
bonus paid in cash and deferred into shares for three  
years were as follows:
*Because T S L Joule’s existing shareholding in the business is greater than 30%, the 
deferred share award to be granted to T S L Joule will be conditional on approval of a 
separate resolution at the AGM in relation to Rule 9 of the Takeover Code.

ESOP, LTIP, Deferred share awards and SAYE.
For FY18, the Committee intends to grant LTIP awards as 
set out in the table below.  
*Because T S L Joule’s existing shareholding in the business is greater than 30%, the LTIP 
to be granted to T S L Joule will be conditional on approval of a separate resolution at the 
AGM in relation to Rule 9 of the Takeover Code.
Vesting of the awards will be based upon the amount of the 
adjusted diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) and the level of 
international revenue delivered in the final Financial Year 
of the three year performance period (FY20).  
• EPS target (80% of award): Below the threshold vesting 
target of 14p, none of the award will vest. 25% of the 
award will vest if adjusted diluted EPS is 14p, with 
100% vesting at 18p, and vesting determined on a 
straight-line basis between these figures.   
• International revenue target (20% of award):  Below 
the threshold vesting target of £36 million, none of 
the award will vest.  25% of the award will vest if 
international revenue is £36 million, with 100% vesting 
at £46 million.  Vesting is determined on a straight-line 
basis between these figures.
EPS is the most suitable performance measure for the 
Group supporting a focus on profitability and growth, and 
has therefore been chosen as the primary LTIP metric.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEES
Details of Non-executive Directors’ fees for FY18 are  
set out below:
• Chairman’s fee: £75,000
• Non-executive director fee: £50,000 for D A Stead and 
£45,000 for J C Little
• Additional fee for chair of a Board Committee: £5,000 The interests of the Directors and their immediate families 
in the Group’s ordinary shares did not change between 28 
May 2017 and the date these accounts were signed on 25 
July 2017.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The members of the Committee are J C Little (Chair), N W 
McCausland and D A Stead.  The Group’s General Counsel 
attends the meeting as secretary to the Committee.   
The Committee meets at least once a year and has 
responsibility for: 
• Maintaining the remuneration policy;
• Reviewing and determining the remuneration packages 
of the Executive Directors;
• Monitoring the level and structure of the remuneration 
of Senior Management; and
• Production of the annual report on Directors’ 
remuneration.

C N Porter and M S Dench also received tax qualifying options of up to a maximum of £30,000, which were granted under the Tax Qualifying LTIP, and subject to the same performance 
conditions as the LTIP award. The tax qualifying options have an exercise price of £1.72 per share (being the market value on the date of grant). The vesting of the LTIP award will be scaled 
back to take account of any gain made under the tax qualifying option.

47  STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and Accounts, including the financial statements, 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law 
the Directors have elected to prepare the Group’s 
Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
as adopted by the European Union, and the Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).  
Under company law the Directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. The Directors are also required 
to prepare financial statements in accordance with 
the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies 
trading securities on the Alternative Investment Market.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently
• Make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent
• State whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable accounting standards, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
• Prepare the financial statements on a going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business

Auditor’s Report 
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
OF JOULES GROUP PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Joules Group 
plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) 
for the 52 week period ended 28 May 2017 (‘period’) 
which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash flows and the related 
notes 1 to 28, the Company Balance Sheet, the Company 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 
29 to 36.  The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in the preparation of the group financial 
statements is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union.  The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements is United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice), including FRS101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’ applicable in the UK and Republic 
of Ireland.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS  
AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error.  This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall presentation 
of the financial statements.  In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the 
annual report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit.  If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In our opinion:
• The financial statements give a true and fair view of 
the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s 
affairs as at 28 May 2017 and of the group’s profit for 
the period then ended
• The group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union
• The parent company financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; 
and
• The financial statements for the group and parent 
company have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006
OPINION ON OTHER MATTER PRESCRIBED BY THE 
COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit:
• The information given in the Strategic Report and 
the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which 
the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and 
AUDITOR’S REPORT
JOULES GROUP PLC Auditor’s Report    
53
• The Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have 
been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.   
In the light of the knowledge and understanding  
of the company and it’s environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not identified any  
material misstatements in the Strategic Report  
and the Directors’ Report. 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT 
BY EXCEPTION
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
• Adequate accounting records have not been kept 
by the parent company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
• The parent company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; 
or
• Certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or
• We have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Statement of compliance
The financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.  The particular accounting 
policies adopted and applied are described below. 
The Group financial statements comprise the financial information of the parent undertaking 
and its subsidiary undertakings.
The principal activity of the group is the design and sale of lifestyle clothing, related 
accessories and a homeware range, through the multi-channel business structure embracing 
retail stores, e-commerce, country shows and events and wholesale.  The company’s 
registered office is Joules Building, The Point, Rockingham Road, Market Harborough, 
Leicestershire, LE16 7QU.
(IFRSs) Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
Adoption of new and revised standards
There have been no new IFRSs adopted in the current year which have impacted the Group’s 
financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and 
Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but 
not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 1 (amendments)  Annual improvements
IFRS 2 (amendments)  Share-based payment
IFRS 4 (amendments)  Insurance contracts
IFRS 9    Financial instruments
IFRS 12 (amendments)  Annual improvements
IFRS 17 (amendments)  Insurance contracts
IFRS 15    Revenue from contracts with customers
IFRS 16    Leases
IAS 7 (amendments)  Cash flow statements
IAS 12 (amendments)  Share-based payment
IAS 28 (amendments)  Annual improvements
IAS 40 (amendments)  Investment properties
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards and Interpretations listed 
above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods, 
except that
• IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of Financial Instruments; and
• IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the reported assets, liabilities and income 
statement for the Group.  Furthermore, extensive disclosures will be required by IFRS 16.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the 
effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Basis of preparation
The historical financial information incorporates the financial statements of the group and 
entities controlled by the Group (its subsidiaries) to 28 May 2017 and 29 May 2016.
The historic financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.  These are presented in pounds 
sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group 
operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below.
The annual financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for 
certain financial assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value or amortised cost as 
appropriate.  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting 
Standards adopted by the European Union requires the use of estimates and assumptions  
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reported period.  Although these estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results ultimately may 
differ from those estimates.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company 
and its subsidiaries.  Control is achieved when the Company:
• has power over the investee
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances 
indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.
The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the 
Company’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power over the entity.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary 
and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. 
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring 
their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies.
All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to 
transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Going concern
The Directors have prepared a detailed forecast with a supporting business plan for the 
foreseeable future. The forecast indicates that the Group will remain in compliance with 
covenants throughout the forecast period.  As such, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation the Company and Group will have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future.  As such, they continue to prepare the financial 
statements on the basis of going concern.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.  Revenue is 
reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. 60    
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Sale of goods
• Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are delivered and titles have 
passed, at which time all the following conditions are satisfied:
• the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of 
the goods
• the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually 
associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the 
Group; and
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for 
administrative purposes, are stated in the statement of financial position at their fair 
value, being the deemed cost at the date of revaluation, less any subsequent accumulated 
depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its 
estimated useful life or, if held under a finance lease term, whichever is the shorter.
Leasehold improvements  - straight line over the lease period, typically 5-10 years
Fixtures and fittings  - straight line over 3 – 5 years
Motor vehicles   - straight line over 4 years
Intangible assets
IT projects
Software and IT represent computer systems and processes used by the Group in order to 
generate future economic value through normal business operations.  The underlying assets 
are amortised over the period from which the Group expects to benefit, which is typically 
between three to eight years.
Intangible assets acquired separately
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost  
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.  Amortisation is 
recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.  The estimated useful life 
and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect 
of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.  Intangible assets 
with indefinite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which  
it is incurred.
Internally-generated intangible assets
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development 
phase of an internal project) is recognised if, and only if, all of the following have been 
demonstrated:
• the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for 
use or sale
• the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it
• the ability to use or sell the intangible asset
• how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements    
61
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
• the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the 
development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and
• the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during 
its development
The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the 
expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition 
criteria listed above.  Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, 
development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as 
intangible assets that are acquired separately.
Derecognition of intangible assets
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are 
expected from use or disposal.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and are recognised in 
profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
At each statement of financial position date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its 
tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets 
have suffered an impairment loss.  If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).  Where it 
is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates 
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.  In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-
tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than 
its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the 
relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as 
a revaluation decrease.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance 
for any obsolete or slow moving items.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.  Taxable profit differs from 
net profit reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group’s current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. 62    
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit.  Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can  
be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, following the 
relevant accounting for utilising temporary differences. 
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in 
the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates and tax laws 
enacted by the end of the reporting period.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that 
would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, 
to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Current and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items 
that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the 
current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity respectively. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions entered into by the Group entities in a currency other than the currency of 
the primary economic environment in which they operate (their “functional currency”) are 
recorded at the rates ruling when the transaction occur.  Foreign currency monetary assets 
and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date.  Exchange differences 
arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised 
immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Hire purchase and leasing commitments (Leasing)
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.  All other leases are classified as  
operating leases.
The Group as lessee
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at their fair 
value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments.  The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated statement 
of financial position as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease 
obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance expenses are recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly 
attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the 
Group’s general policy on borrowing costs.  Contingent rentals are recognised as expenses in 
the periods in which they are incurred.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in 
which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.  Contingent rentals arising 
under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements    
63
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable for the period are 
recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to 
settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks 
and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
When a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, 
its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value 
of money is material).
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be 
recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that 
reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Returns provision
Present obligations arising under sales returns are recognised and measured as provisions, 
reducing revenue, when it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation 
under sales contracts. The returns provision is based on Management’s best estimates and the 
actual returns could differ from these estimates.
Lease dilapidation
The Group recognises present obligations arising from lease contracts where it is required  
to restore the stores to their pre-lease condition upon the expiry of leases.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a group entity becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.  Transaction 
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial 
liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) 
are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as 
appropriate, on initial recognition.  Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition 
of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. 
For financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 
based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the 
significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement, which are described as follows:
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date
• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 64    
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
Financial assets
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables originated by the company are stated at amortised cost as reduced 
by appropriate allowances for doubtful debts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are measured at fair value, based on the relevant exchange rates at 
the statement of financial position and include overdrafts where these are used on a day-to-
day basis to manage cash.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments 
that are not quoted in an active market are classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and 
receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for 
short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the 
contractual arrangements entered into and are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at 
FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for 
trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including loans payable, are initially measured at fair value, net of 
transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Loans payable
Interest-bearing loans are initially recorded on the day that the loans are advanced at the net 
proceeds received.
At subsequent reporting dates, interest-bearing borrowings are measured at amortised cost.  
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue 
costs, are accounted for on the accrual basis in the statement of comprehensive income using 
the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to 
the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments and cash flow hedges
The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency exposures. 
These derivatives, classified as cash flow hedges, are initially recognised at fair value and 
then re-measured at fair value at the end of each reporting date. Hedging instruments are 
documented at inception and effectiveness is tested throughout their duration. Changes in the 
value of cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and any ineffective 
portion is immediately recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. If the firm 
commitment or forecast transaction that is the subject of a cash flow hedge results in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then at the time the asset is recognised, the 
associated gains or losses on the derivative that had been previously recognised on other 
comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For 
hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or liability, amounts deferred in other 
comprehensive income are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the same 
period in which the hedged item affects net profit. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements    
65
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date.  The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting 
conditions.  Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based 
transactions are set out in note 27.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
equity instruments that will eventually vest.  At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its 
estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-
market-based vesting conditions.  The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, 
is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services 
acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability.  At each balance sheet date 
until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is 
remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Drawing up the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make 
the necessary estimates and assessments.  Estimates are based on past experience and other 
reasonable assessment criteria.  There remains a probability, however, that the estimates and 
assessments will bring about an adjustment in the value of the assets and liabilities in future 
financial years.
The Directors have made significant accounting estimates and judgements in applying the 
Group’s accounting policies in the following areas:
Impairment 
Stores are identified for further impairment testing primarily on the basis of current 
performance, with growth assumptions based on directors’ knowledge and experience. The 
Directors have used forecast models and an appropriate pre-tax weighted average cost of 
capital in its property, plant and equipment impairment calculations.
Inventory valuation 
The Directors have used their knowledge and experience of the retail industry in determining 
the level and rates of provisioning required to calculate the appropriate inventory carrying 
values.  Inventory is carried in the financial statements at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value.  Sales in the retail industry vary with changes in consumer demand.  As a result there 
is a risk that the cost of inventory exceeds its net realisable value.  Management calculate 
the inventory provision on the basis of the ageing profile of what is in stock.  Adjustments 
are made where appropriate based on directors’ knowledge and experience to calculate the 
appropriate inventory carrying values. 66    
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   
2. REVENUE
The revenue and profit before taxation are attributable to the one principal activity  
of the Group.
3. SEGMENT REPORTING
The Group has three reportable segments; Retail, Wholesale and Other. For each of the 
three segments, the Group’s chief operating decision maker (the “Board”) reviews internal 
management reports on a monthly basis. Each segment can be summarised as follows:
• Retail: Retail includes sales and costs relevant to stores, e-commerce, shows  
and franchises.
• Wholesale: Wholesale includes sales and costs relevant to the sale of products to other 
retail businesses or distributors for onward sale to their customer.
• Other: Other includes income from licencing, central costs and items that are not 
distinguishable into categories above.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as described in note 1. 
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Segment 
results before exceptional items are used to measure performance as management believes 
that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the performance of certain segments 
relative to other entities that operate within these industries. 
There are no discontinued operations in the period.

Geographical Information
The Group’s revenue from external customers by geographical location are as detailed below. 
Predominantly all non-current assets (excluding financial instruments, deferred tax assets and 
other financial assets) are situated in the UK, therefore separate geographical disclosure of

Other expenses include £341,000 for May 2017 (May 2016: £3,128,000) of exceptional items 
which have been disclosed separately on the face of the income statement in order to 
summarise the underlying results.  The exceptional costs in the period of £341,000 relate to 
IPO transaction costs (2016: £2,748,000 of IPO related transaction costs and £380,000 of  
other non-recurring costs, including asset impairment).  Neither ‘underlying profit or loss’  
nor ‘exceptional items’ are defined by IFRS, however, the Directors believe that the  
disclosures presented in this manner provide a clear presentation of the financial  
performance of the group. 70    
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   
During the prior period the Shareholder loan note debt was settled and all remaining 
unamortised debt costs were expensed.  Amortisation of debt costs relates to fees incurred 
in 2013 with regard to the Shareholder loan notes, as these fees related to a debt facility they 
were amortised over the expected life of the facility.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   
7. INCOME TAX (continued)
The Finance Act 2015 included provisions to reduce the rate of UK corporation tax to 19% 
with effect from 1 April 2017. The Finance Act 2016 included provisions to further reduce the 
rate of UK corporation tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. Deferred taxation is measured 
at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which temporary timing differences 
are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. Accordingly the rate used to calculate deferred tax assets 
and liabilities is the effective rate at the date the deferred tax is expected to be realised.  
The UK corporation tax at the standard rate for the year is therefore 19.8% (2016: 20.0%). 
8 & 9. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangibles) of nil book value items which were no longer in existence or use as at the balance

There is no material difference between the balance sheet value of stocks and their replacement cost. 
The cost of inventories recognised as an expense during the year in respect of continuing operations 
in the 52 weeks ended 28 May 2017 was £61,851,000 (2016: £51,376,000).
The cost of inventories recognised as an expense includes £126,000 for 52 weeks ended 28 May  
2017 (2016: £196,000) in respect of write-downs of inventory to net realisable value.  During the 
period £39,000 (2016: £33,000) of stock previously provided for was sold and the provision was 
therefore released. 
Product is purchased on a seasonal basis with the intention of selling that stock within 12 months  
of the balance sheet date.  Any aged stock is appropriately provided for.

OUTSTANDING  
CONTRACTS
The Company does not hold Euro to GBP forward options (2016: 2 Euro to GBP forward options).   
The US Dollar spot rate at 28 May 2017 was $1.2791/£1. 
The fair value of cash flow hedges of the Group as at 28 May 2017 was an asset of £1,345,000  
(2016: £962,000) and a liability of £1,502,000 (2016: £488,000) resulting in a net liability of £157,000 
(2016: net asset £474,000), further detailed in note 24.  74    
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   
All of the other receivables and prepayment balances above are deemed to be current; the 
disclosures above relate only to the trade receivables balance.  The Directors review the 
recoverability of trade receivables on a regular basis and calculate the allowance for doubtful 
debts on both a specific, customer by customer basis and a general basis.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large 
number of counterparties and customers.  Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no 
further credit provision risk required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts. 
Included within the Group’s trade receivables (gross) balance are debtors with a carrying value 
of £873,000 (2016: £1,020,000) which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group 
has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts 
are still considered recoverable.

Returns provision
Present obligations arising under sales returns are recognised and measured as provisions 
when it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation under sales 
contracts.  Returns provisions in existence at the balance sheet date are expected to be utilised 
within 12 months, the provision is recalculated at each balance sheet date taking into account 
recent sales and anticipated levels of returns.
Lease dilapidation
The Group recognises present obligations arising from lease contracts where it is required 
to restore leased properties to their pre-lease condition upon the expiry of leases.  Lease 
dilapidations provisions are expected to be utilised between 0-3 years in line with the expiry  
of the leases. 76    
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   
Summary of borrowing arrangements

17. DEFERRED TAXATION
The following is the analysis of deferred tax assets/(liabilities) presented in the consolidated 
statement of financial position:
There is no unprovided deferred tax in the current period for the Group (2016: £nil).  
The deferred tax asset recognised in the current period is expected to be utilised against 
future taxable profits.  78    
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   
The company was incorporated on 1 May 2016.  The acquisition of Joules Investments Holdings 
Limited by Joules Group plc on 26 May 2016 has been accounted for using reverse acquisition 
accounting principles.  The effect of using reverse acquisition accounting principles on share 
capital and reserves of the Group is that the capital that existed as at the point Joules Group 
plc legally acquired Joules Investments Holdings Limited is accounted for as if it had been in 
existence as at the comparative period end date of the company’s first accounting period end 
(31 May 2015) and as at the opening balance sheet date of the period end (25 May 2014).
Share capital and reserves of the company are therefore a result of the following transactions:
The company was incorporated on 1 May 2016, upon incorporation the company issued 1 
Ordinary B share of £827.22 at par.
On 26 May 2016 the shareholders of Joules Investments Holdings Limited transferred their 
shares to Joules Group plc in exchange for new shares issued by Joules Group plc, the new 
shares issued by Joules Group plc mirrored the shares transferred by the previous shareholders 
of Joules Investments Holdings Limited.
The share capital issued as part of this share for share exchange consisted of 138,188 shares of 
varying classes with a nominal value of £91,508,871.  The varying classes were then converted to 
a single class of ordinary share in Joules Group plc.  The company then had a share capital of 
57,193,545 ordinary £1.60 shares, with a nominal value £91,509,672. 
The movements in the 52 week period to 29 May 2016, which are not accounted for using the 
reverse acquisition accounting principles, are as follows:
As part of this share for share exchange, certain shareholders of Joules Investments Holdings 
Limited ultimately received cash for their shareholdings in Joules Investments Holdings 
Limited, rather than receiving shares in Joules Group plc, these shares equated to 90,980 
ordinary £1.60 shares with a par value, and settlement value of £145,568.  This is adjusted 
through the merger reserve as it is considered part of the consideration paid by Joules Group 
plc to acquire Joules Investments Holdings Limited.
On 26 May 2016 Joules Group plc issued 23,130,400 ordinary £1.60 shares, with a total nominal 
value of £37,008,644.  The shares were issued in order to settle the loan notes which existed at 
the time and had a book and fair value of £37,008,644 excluding accrued interest.
On 26 May 2016 Joules Group plc (when legally still ‘Joules Group Limited’) entered into a capital 
reduction, converting the 80,323,945 ordinary £1.60 shares into 80,323,945 ordinary £0.01 
shares.  The reduction in share capital of £127,715,102 was transferred to retained earnings.
On 26 May 2016 in an initial public offering Joules Group plc issued 7,175,851 ordinary £0.01 
shares at a price of £1.60, resulting in an increase in share capital of £71,758 and share premium 
of £11,409,603. 
All ordinary shares carry equal rights.

19. OTHER RESERVES
Share premium
The share premium reserve contains the premium arising on the issue of equity shares, net of 
issue expenses incurred by the company.  On 26 May 2016 in an initial public offering Joules 
Group plc issued 7,175,851 ordinary £0.01 shares at a price of £1.60, resulting in share premium 
of £11,409,603.
Retained earnings  
The movement on retained earnings is as set out in the consolidated statement of changes in 
equity.  Retained earnings represent cumulative profits or losses, net of dividends and other 
adjustments.
Merger reserve
The movement on the merger reserve is as set out in the consolidated statement of  
changes in equity. 
The effect of reverse acquisition accounting on the merger reserve is that the share capital, 
share premium and other distributable reserves that existed in Joules Group plc (the company) 
as at the point Joules Group plc legally acquired Joules Investments Holdings Limited is 
accounted for as if it had been in existence as at the comparative period end (31 May 2015) and 
as at the opening balance sheet date (25 May 2014).  The corresponding entry being the merger 
reserve so the overall net assets as at the comparative dates are not affected.
The movement on the merger reserve during the 52 weeks ended 29 May 2016 period arose 
due to certain shareholders of Joules Investment Holdings Limited transferring their shares to 
Joules Group plc in exchange for cash, with a settlement value, of £145,568.  This is adjusted 
through the merger reserve as it is considered part of the consideration paid by Joules Group 
plc to acquire Joules Investments Holding Limited.

Translation reserve
Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net asset of the Group’s foreign 
operations which relate to subsidiaries only, from their functional currency into the Group’s

24. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
If interest rates on all borrowings had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held 
constant, the Group’s profit for the period ended 52 weeks to 28 May 2017 would decrease/
increase by £41,000 (2016: £57,000).
This has been calculated by applying the amended interest rate to the weighted average rate 
of borrowings for the period to 28 May 2017, other than borrowings which are held at a fixed 
interest rate as those borrowings are not sensitive to external variables, such as movement in 
interest rates.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to fluctuations in the US $, which is used for stock purchases.  If 
the US $ exchange rate, on average through the period, weakened/strengthened by 10 percent 
and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the period ended 52 weeks to 
28 May 2017 would increase/decrease by £82,000 and £101,000 respectively (2016: £369,000 and 
£451,000).  This has been calculated by applying the amended currency rate to the US $ value 
of financial assets and financial liabilities held at the period end, an amended rate has not been 
applied to US $ purchases in the period as they have been effectively hedged against currency 
fluctuations via forward contracts. 
Maturity of financial liabilities
The maturity of borrowings is included in note 15.  All other financial liabilities are expected to 
mature within six months of the year-end. 
Carrying value of financial assets
The Directors have assessed that, on the basis of the net assets of the owing companies, the 
intercompany receivables are fully recoverable. 
As noted in note 12 the Directors do not believe any of the trade receivables to be impaired. 
A significant decrease in the net assets and trade of the owing company or a decline in the 
financial position of customers would trigger an impairment review.

NOTE 82    
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   
24. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
Credit risk
In the opinion of the Directors, the only financial instrument that is subject to credit risk is 
the trade receivables.  The directors believe that the bad debt provision as disclosed in note 12 
represents the Directors’ best estimate of the maximum exposure to credit risk at period-end. 
Fair value of financial instruments
Financial instruments are measured in accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 1. 
All Financial instruments are considered to be Level 3 with the exception of foreign currency 
forward contracts and options which are considered Level 2.  In the opinion of the Directors, 
the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are equal to their book values. 
Liquidity risk management
The Directors believe that the receivables are not impaired and that the owing companies have 
sufficient net assets to repay the balances.  Therefore the Directors believe that liquidity risk 
is minimal.
Capital risk management 
The Directors maintain detailed cash forecasts which are frequently revised to actuals to 
ensure that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet its requirements. 
Foreign currency financial assets and liabilities
Included within the above table are £4,667,000 (2016: £4,116,000) of assets and £984,000 (2016: 
£1,903,000) of liabilities relating to the overseas subsidiaries which have been translated in the 
consolidation at the period-end rate.  These balances are subject to movements in exchange 
rates, as shown in the statement of changes in equity.  The Directors do not believe the risk is 
significant enough to warrant hedging against the investments in overseas companies.
Also included within the above table are foreign currency denominated external trade payables 
and receivables of £613,681 (2016: £1,300,565) and £1,114,357 (2016: £903,916) respectively, 
relating to foreign entities.  The Group mitigates a significant amount of the exchange rate risk 
via purchases of forward foreign currency contracts.  
25. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Transactions between the company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been 
eliminated on consolidation.
The remuneration of the Directors, who are the key management personnel of the Group, is 
disclosed in note 4 and the Directors’ Remuneration Report.  In addition, Directors and key 
management participate in share schemes, further details of which can be found in note 27.
The Directors control 31,171,782 shares (2016: 31,011,102 shares) in Joules Group plc, which 
represents 35.6% (2016: 35.4%) of the issued share capital.  
26. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to 
ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during  
the period.
The acquisition of Joules Investments Holdings Limited by Joules Group plc on 26 May 2016 has 
been accounted for using reverse acquisition accounting principles.   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

27. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
Summary of movement in awards:
All share options were valued using the Black-Scholes model. Expected volatility was 
determined by management, using comparator volatility as a basis.  The expected life of the 
options was determined based on management’s best estimate. The expected dividend yield 
was based on the anticipated dividend policy of the Company over the expected life of the 
options.  The risk free rate of return input into the model was a zero coupon government 
bonds with a life in line with the expected life of the options.
26. EARNINGS PER SHARE (continued) 
The weighted average number of shares in issue for the current and prior year has therefore 
been stated to reflect the post-IPO share capital structure, this adjustment assumes the total 
shares issued during the IPO were in issue throughout the whole of the current and previous 
period presented. 
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in 
issue is further adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.  The 
Company has one category of potentially dilutive ordinary shares, being management shares 
not yet vested. 
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:
Number of shares
Number of shares
Earnings
Basic earnings/(loss) per share (pence)
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share (pence)
Earnings/(loss) for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share
Weighted number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share
Potentially dilutive share awards

-  27. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS (continued) 
The fair value of the total shares issued during the period, and measured as at issue date is 
£5,314,000.
The inputs into the model were as follows:
The Group recognised a total expense of £829,000 during the year (2016: Nil) relating to  
equity-settled share based payments, including employer’s National Insurance contributions of 
£92,000 (2016: Nil).
Executive Share Option Plan (“ESOP”)
The Group operated a share option scheme during the period for certain employees under 
the Executive Share Option Plan (“ESOP”).  The different options vest between two years and 
three years and have an exercise life between three and ten years from grant date.  All option 
schemes are subject to continued employment over the vesting period.
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
The Board approved Long Term Incentive Plan 2016 (‘LTIP 2016’) allows the grant of options 
to executive directors and senior management of the Group in the form of nil-cost options 
over ordinary shares in Joules Group plc.  The options are exercisable three years after the 
date of grant subject to achieving certain stretching targets.  For the Executive directors 
and members of the operating board, the target is based on an EPS target in the final year of 
the plan, ending May 2019.  For other senior management awards the target is based on the 
cumulative PBT over the three years to May 2019.  The calculation includes an assumption that 
10% of senior managers on the scheme would cease employment before vesting.  
Save As You Earn Scheme (“SAYE”)
Under the terms of the SAYE scheme, the Board grants options to purchase ordinary shares 
in the company to employees who enter into the HMRC-approved SAYE scheme for a term 
of three years.  Options are granted at up to 20% discount to the market price of the shares 
on the day proceeding the date of offer and are exercisable for a period of six months after 
completion of the SAYE contract.
28. DIVIDENDS
In the period an interim dividend of 0.60 pence per share was paid with a total value of 
£525,001. No dividends were declared or paid in the prior period.  The directors are proposing 
a final dividend of 1.20 pence per share with a total value of £1,050,008.  This dividend has not 
been accrued in the consolidated statement of financial position and will be put for approval 
at the AGM on 27 September 2017.  This would bring total dividends for the period to 1.8 pence 
per share with a total value of £1,575,009.
