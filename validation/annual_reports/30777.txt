Global network
Overview
As the only global provider of subcontract thermal processing 
services, Bodycote is able to offer significant advantages to its 
customers. Through an international network of plants, Bodycote 
can effectively utilise a wealth of knowledge, experience and 
specialist expertise to deliver quality service when and where it is 
needed.
The network operates from 187 facilities, with customers able 
to benefit from Bodycote’s comprehensive range of services 
from multiple locations. Customers know that if their business 
expands, Bodycote will have the capability to meet their needs. 
They recognise that if they were to broaden their manufacturing 
footprint, Bodycote would be able to assist them. They are 
aware that they can obtain the same process to the same quality 
standards from multiple locations.
Such a large network brings economies of scale, with technology 
developed at one location being available globally if the market 
requires it. Similarly, network utilisation is enhanced by using 
logistics to put customers’ work into the most effective facilities to 
meet their requirements.
The Bodycote network has a wealth of technical accreditations, 
some industry or customer specific, others more general. Individual 
operations concentrate on the accreditations suited to their market.

A. C. Quinn 
CBE
Chairman 
Chairman’s statement
“One of the key roles of the Chairman is to ensure that the Board 
members possess a range of complementary skills which are relevant to 
Bodycote’s business. I have spent time with all of my Board colleagues 
and am confident that I have joined a well-balanced Board that, in terms 
of governance, is functioning effectively. ”
A. C. Quinn  CBE
Chairman
I am pleased to be contributing to the annual report for the first 
time as Bodycote’s Chairman, having taken up the position on  
1 January 2018.
Overview
The Group delivered a good set of results for 2017 and I am  
very pleased that the management team, under the leadership  
of Stephen Harris, has been able to demonstrate the strength  
and strong market position of Bodycote’s business once again.
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 12.1p, an increase of 
12%, which will be paid on 1 June 2018, subject to shareholder 
approval at the 2018 Annual General Meeting (AGM). This brings 
the total ordinary dividend for 2017 to 17 .4p (2016: 15.8p) costing 
£33.1m, which represents a year-on-year increase of 10.1%. This 
increase in the level of dividend underscores the Board’s view of 
the Group’s excellent future earnings and cash flow potential. 
Furthermore, recognising the strong net cash position of the Group 
at year end, the Board is recommending a supplemental distribution 
by way of a special dividend, also payable on 1 June 2018, amounting 
to 25.0p per share, costing £47 .9m.
Board and governance
My predecessor, Alan Thomson, stepped down as Chairman at the 
end of 2017 . On behalf of the Board, and the Company as a whole, 
I thank Alan for his significant contribution to Bodycote during his 
ten years of Chairmanship and previously as a Non-Executive Board 
member. I think that it is fair to say that Bodycote has undergone 
a wholesale transformation during Alan’s tenure as Chairman and 
the development of the Group’s share price over that period is a 
testament to the progress that has been made.
One of the key roles of the Chairman is to ensure that the Board 
members possess a range of complementary skills which are 
relevant to Bodycote’s business. I have spent time with all of 
my Board colleagues and am confident that I have joined a 
well-balanced Board that, in terms of governance, is functioning 
effectively. 
06 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017 25695    19 March 2018 3:29 PM    Proof 7
The Board has been further strengthened by the appointment of 
Lili Chahbazi, who joined as a Non-Executive Director on 1 January 
2018. Lili is an experienced strategy consultant and, since 2008, a 
global partner in the London office of Bain & Company. Lili currently 
heads the oil & gas practice and consults to a range of international 
clients. Lili brings a wide range of experience in businesses 
including those in the engineering, aviation and transport industries. 
Another one of the key responsibilities of the Chairman is to 
promote effective governance across the Group, thus ensuring 
that we remain a successful and sustainable entity with good 
governance procedures practised across all 23 countries in 
which the Group operates. We are committed to conducting 
business responsibly. By maintaining high standards of corporate 
governance, we enhance performance underpinned by our business 
model. Our approach to governance is set by the Board, and our 
Executive Committee ensures that the approach is effectively 
implemented across the business. Effective and robust governance 
remains central to the ongoing success of the Group.
People
As part of my induction to the business, I have had the chance 
to visit a good number of facilities, as well as to engage with 
much of the Group’s senior executive management. I have been 
impressed by the commitment, knowledge and passion that I have 
experienced from employees across the business, and at all levels. 
I can see how the talented workforce creates a clear competitive 
advantage for Bodycote, which is so vital for the long-term success 
of the business.
Shareholders
During the year, as usual, meetings were undertaken with a 
number of Bodycote’s shareholders and positive feedback was 
received from them. I have already had the opportunity to meet 
some of our shareholders and look forward to meeting more of you 
during the coming year, as well as at this year’s AGM in May 2018. 
Summary
The Group is starting to show the results of the increased 
investment programme that has been ongoing for the last few 
years. This programme has been designed to generate superior 
growth in what until recently has been a weak macroeconomic 
environment. The results of these investments, together with the 
continued diligence in operational efficiency and a more benign 
macro environment all combined to deliver another good set of 
results for the Group in 2017 . Bodycote remains well placed to 
capitalise on the value generating investments available to it and 
the prospects for the Group are excellent. I am confident that in 
the coming years Bodycote will deliver an attractive return for our 
shareholders and commensurate reward for our employees.

Chief Executive’s review
“2017 has once again demonstrated the quality of Bodycote’s business. 
The Group’s revenue growth, combined with continued discipline on 
costs, helped lift headline operating profit by 24%. Return on sales 
increased to 18.0% from 16.6%. ”
S. C. Harris
Group Chief Executive
Overview
Bodycote reported revenue growth of 14.9% to £690.2m (2016: 
£600.6m), with revenue benefiting from foreign exchange translation 
gain. At constant currency, revenues grew 9.6%, including a 
contribution of 2.9% from acquisitions completed in 2016.
The following review reflects constant currency growth rates unless 
stated otherwise.
General industrial markets returned to growth after a multi-
year negative trend. Moreover, this growth was broad-based, 
with improvements in general industrial demand occurring in 
all of our served geographies. Group revenues generated from 
the general industrial sectors, which represent some 39% of 
our business, grew 10%, which was well above the growth in 
background demand. Of this growth, 4 percentage points came 
from acquisitions made in 2016. The remainder of the Group’s 
outperformance in general industrial versus the market came from 
the increased penetration of Specialist Technologies (which grew 
14% in this sector), as well as an element of some customer 
restocking. 
The decision we took to preserve the capacity at our T exas/Oklahoma 
facilities is being well rewarded, as we have also seen a reversal of 
the sharp declines that we had experienced in onshore oil & gas 
demand. Growth in onshore oil & gas saw a strong sequential increase 
in 2017 , driven predominantly by demand from unconventional drilling 
activity in the Permian Basin. In the rest of the energy sector, subsea 
revenues continued to decline and large-frame industrial gas turbines 
(IGT) are also in retreat following cutbacks at the original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs). It is worth noting, however, that requests for 
quotation in the subsea sector have picked up considerably. In total, 
revenues from the energy sector increased by 4%.
Civil aviation grew 6% with our UK operations continuing to add 
significant business. This increase will require new facilities to 
be built in 2018 in the UK in order to service forecast demand. 
North America also started to contribute to the growth in a more 
meaningful way as the build rate of LEAP engines continues to 
grow. Bodycote has a much stronger position on the LEAP series 
than it did on the previous CFM56, which is a testament to the 
success of the focused sales and investment programme that has 
been undertaken over the last decade. 
08 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017 25695    19 March 2018 3:29 PM    Proof 7
The automotive business saw growth of 14% with the majority 
of this increase coming from the car and light truck sector. This 
compares to background demand growth in Europe of low single 
digits and a slight decline in the USA. Our strong performance 
benefited from the contribution from the acquisitions made in 2016, 
together with the investments we have made in Emerging Markets 
and Specialist T echnologies. 
In our Specialist Technologies, we achieved double-digit revenue 
growth across our Specialty Stainless Steel Processes (S
3
P), low 
pressure carburising (LPC) and Corr-I-Dur
®
 (CiD) technologies. 
However, several factors dragged on overall sales growth during the 
year. The HIP Product Fabrication (HIP PF) and Surface Technology 
businesses are focused largely on oil & gas outside of the USA, 
with particular emphasis on subsea and these revenues continued 
to decline. In addition the weakness in IGT volumes resulted in a 
slowdown in the HIP Services business towards the end of the 
year. Also impacting our HIP Services business was an unplanned 
outage during the second half (which was fully resolved by year 
end). Forecast growth in all the Specialist Technologies looks strong. 
The five sites we acquired in 2016 are performing well. They  
are all Classical Heat Treatment sites within the AGI division and 
contributed £23.0m of revenue in 2017 , with return on sales in line 
with the Group. It is also worth highlighting that revenues at these 
facilities have accelerated since coming into the Group as a result 
of the benefits derived from being part of the Group’s network of 
facilities.
With careful cost discipline in the face of growing revenues,  
the Group’s headline operating profit grew 24% to £123.9m  
(26% growth in statutory operating profit to £119.4m) and the 
return on sales improved to 18.0% (2016: 16.6%). Once again, 
we increased our prices ahead of cost inflation. This is an area of 
heightened focus for the Group especially as we are entering a 
period of higher input cost inflation in some markets. It is worth 
noting, however, that Bodycote typically performs well in higher 
inflationary environments.
The Group’s strong profit improvement, coupled with a headline tax 
rate of 22.9% (2016: 27 .5%), increased basic headline earnings per 
share to 49.2p (2016: 37 .0p). Basic earnings per share increased to 
51 .0p from 35.2p.
The return on capital employed rose in the current year to 19.3% 
from 17 .1% in 2016. 
Free cash flow increased to £83.0m (2016: £60.5m) as a result 
of our improved profitability and in spite of increased capital 
expenditure to support the future growth of the business. Headline 
operating cash conversion was, once again, above 90%, yielding a 
net cash position at the end of the year of £39.6m (2016: £1 .1m).
Strategic progress
The Group’s strategy encompasses the drive for operational 
efficiency and improvement in return on sales; growth in markets 
with higher long term structural growth; the expansion of the 
Group’s footprint in rapid growth markets; the focus on revenue 
growth in Specialist Technologies; and growth through targeted 
acquisitions, where these are more attractive than investing in new 
facilities. The Group has a minimum 20% hurdle rate return when 
looking at investments.
During 2017 we made further progress against our strategy, 
delivering higher Group return on sales of 18.0%. We believe there 
is still the opportunity to further improve from both management 
led initiatives, particularly in our AGI division, and growth in our 
higher return Specialist Technologies. 
In 2017 we continued to invest in areas with superior growth 
potential, with a deliberate bias towards investments in rapid-
growth markets, Specialist Technologies, and long-cycle 
programmes, particularly in civil aviation: Emerging Markets 
revenues increased 26% to £54.1m, representing 8% of Group 
turnover, with growth in Mexico and China both above 40%. We 
will continue to invest to support the future of our business in these 
rapid growth markets. During the year, we commissioned several 
new LPC and S
3
P lines. In HIP Services we acquired the HIP assets 
from Doncasters Group Limited’s UK business and a new mega-HIP 
was ordered for Europe which will come online in 2018. Further 
new facilities are expected to be commissioned in 2018 for both 
Specialist Technologies and Classical Heat Treatment in our focus 
geographies and markets. The additional capacity that will come on 
stream in 2018 will add to our ability to deliver strong growth and 
superior return on sales over the coming years.
We also continue to look at acquisition and investment 
opportunities that will grow our business. These are traditionally 
small bolt-on facilities that can provide us with infills to our existing 
network. Where opportunities to buy such facilities do not exist, 
we will build new facilities; these obviously have a ramp-up period, 
but have the advantage of being designed exactly in line with the 
Group’s technology and operational efficiency focus. Since 2014 
we have invested £164m in both acquisitions and investment for 
growth in new and existing facilities, with revenues from the latter 
still ramping up as these plants typically take 3–5 years to reach full 
production. 
Organisation and people
Bodycote is a service business, and first-class service is delivered 
by passionate and professional people, who understand their 
customers’ needs and meet their demanding requirements time 
and time again. We will continue to invest in training and developing 
our employees to ensure that our talented workforce remains one 
of our competitive advantages.
Summary and outlook 
2017 has once again demonstrated the quality of Bodycote’s 
business. Strong growth was achieved through contributions 
from contract wins on automotive and aerospace programmes, 
excellent growth in Emerging Markets (where our investments are 
yielding good returns), and broad-based growth across the general 
industrial sectors, an element of which was due to some customer 
restocking.
The Group’s revenue growth, combined with continued discipline 
on costs, helped lift headline operating profit by 24%. Return on 
sales increased to 18.0% from 16.6%.
To ensure that the business continues to deliver good results, we 
will continue to focus on efficiency, maintaining price discipline 
in light of increasing inflation across many economies, and the 
execution of our successful strategy.
Our business, by its nature, has limited forward visibility, but we 
have entered the year with good momentum. Accordingly, and in 
spite of the foreign exchange headwind at current exchange rates, 
2018 has started in line with our expectations.

Component journeys
HIGH ROLLER – A COMPONENT JOURNEY
AEROSPACE BEARINGS
Ball and roller bearings are essential to high-precision 
rotary components in aircraft, and need to deliver 
exceptional durability and consistent performance 
despite changes in temperature and air pressure. 
Materials used are customised based on the end 
application, including high temperature, stainless steels 
and more exotic alloys, such as Inconel.
 Denotes the parts of the component journey undertaken by Bodycote.
BODYCOTE COMPONENT JOURNEYS
This is just one example of how Bodycote brings together the 
huge wealth of knowledge and expertise from across the Group 
to provide the vital engineering services our customers need.

Bearings are shaped 
and machined from 
rods of metal plates and 
wires. 
For the perfect shape and smooth 
finish, bearings are put through final 
lapping and polishing processes.
  The surface area to be heat 
treated is prepared – areas 
which are not to be heat treated 
are selectively masked with 
copper plating.
  The surface is hardened via a 
specialised nitriding process 
during which nitrogen is diffused 
into the surface to increase 
resistance to in-service stress 
and fatigue.
  After heat treatment, the 
masking is removed and 
the surface cleaned 
before inspection to 
ensure the part meets 
strict aerospace quality 
specifications.
End applications include landing gear, 
engine, control surfaces, and other parts  
or components.

INNER STRENGTH – A COMPONENT JOURNEY
MEDICAL IMPLANTS
The stress on a hip or knee joint when a person jumps 
off a chair is equal to around 100 tonnes per square inch. 
Our bones, effectively composites, absorb such stresses 
regularly and effectively for much of our lifetime. 
When joints fail, they are often replaced with metal alloy 
implants. These implants must be incredibly strong, 
biocompatible, and able to last the lifetime of the patient. 
A combination of heat treatment, hot isostatic pressing 
and coating makes this possible.
 Denotes the parts of the component journey undertaken by Bodycote.

Cobalt chromium alloy 
billets are investment cast 
to form implant shape.
  The castings are thermally 
sprayed with a biomedical 
coating to allow a bond to 
form between the implant 
and body tissue, promoting 
bone growth.
  The implants are then 
HIPed to eliminate porosity, 
improve fatigue life and 
enhance the bonding of 
the biocompatible coating.
  Solution and ageing 
heat treatment is used to 
strengthen the implant.
End application – joint replacement.

IN GEAR - A COMPONENT JOURNEY
IN GEAR – A COMPONENT JOURNEY
PINION GEAR
A pinion gear is a critical automotive component used 
in virtually all transmission units. During use, a vehicle 
places heavy demand on its transmission, requiring a 
fast and reliable response to the drive controls.
The gears require high strength and wear resistance 
in order to withstand the stresses applied to each gear 
during use. Bodycote’s heat treatment processes, 
in particular Low Pressure Carburising (LPC), enable 
modern transmissions to deliver high performance 
and seamless response, even reducing noise during 
gear changes.

The gears begin life 
as low alloy steel. 
The gears are assembled 
into the transmission unit.
  The gears are dimensionally 
measured before heat 
treatment to monitor and 
maintain repeatability of 
distortion. The gears are 
then heat treated using LPC 
to enhance functionality by 
adding a ‘case depth’ 
to provide strength and 
resistance to wear and tear.
  The gears are quenched using 
nitrogen gas to minimise part 
distortion, then tempered to 
relieve internal stresses.
The gears are machined 
to shape using a shaving 
or hobbing method.
  The gears are shot peened to add 
residual stress – this allows the parts 
to withstand more wear and tear. 
The gears are measured again after 
heat treatment to check any distortion 
is within limits.
   The parts are inspected and 
tested for surface hardness, 
core hardness and effective 
case depth.
End application – automobile.

Our technologies
Classical Heat T reatment Specialist T echnologies
A group of mature processes which are essential for treating all 
metal components. These tightly controlled processes condition 
the material properties including both the core properties and the 
surface characteristics.
A set of differentiated processes giving customers the ability to 
produce unique high value-adding products. 
 
HIP
Hot Isostatic Pressing Services (HIP)
Impact resistance and fatigue properties are extremely sensitive to 
small amounts of porosity. Through the simultaneous application 
of heat and pressure, the HIP process eliminates internal porosity, 
improving fatigue strength, tensile ductility and fracture toughness.
Surface 
hardness
What is it? The ability of a material to resist deformation, 
scratching and indentation under force. 
Why is it important? Improving a material’s hardness through 
heat treatment allows it to resist various types of wear.
HIP PF
Hot Isostatic Pressing Product Fabrication (HIP PF)
This method combines the HIP process with design and production 
expertise to create a component from metal powder. The flexibility 
of the HIP PF process means that combinations of materials can be 
used to give desired properties, enabling metallic compositions that 
are difficult or impossible to forge or cast.
T oughness
What is it? The ability of a material to absorb energy and 
plastically deform without fracture. 
Why is it important? Heat treatment can be used to strengthen 
the material and help improve its resistance to impact.
S
3
P
Specialty Stainless Steel Processes (S
3
P)
Steel is often chosen for its inherent corrosion resistance, but often requires 
hardening. Standard heat treatments will harden the steel, but can negatively 
impact the corrosion resistance. S
3
P technology uniquely hardens stainless 
steel, nickel-based alloys and cobalt-chromium alloys improving mechanical 
and wear properties without adversely affecting corrosion resistance.
Fatigue 
strength
What is it? The stress level at which component failure occurs 
when subjected to repeated stress cycles.
Why is it important? Part failure due to fatigue can have 
catastrophic consequences, particularly if the part is safety 
critical. Through heat treatment, a material’s fatigue strength is 
improved.
LPC
Low Pressure Carburising (LPC)
A case hardening process used to obtain a hardened surface and 
tough core, giving increased wear resistance and fatigue life, with 
minimal risk of treatment distortion. LPC is a clean process, carried 
out under vacuum, and is an environmentally friendly treatment.
Creep 
resistance
What is it? The measure of a material’s ability to resist high 
temperature deformation.
Why is it important? Some metals and alloys must operate 
at temperatures close to their melting point. Heat treatment 
enables them to perform at higher temperatures with little or no 
movement.
CiD
Corr-I-Dur
® 
(CiD)
A proprietary thermochemical treatment for the simultaneous 
improvement of corrosion and wear resistance through the 
generation of a nitride-oxide combination layer. Corr-I-Dur
®
 is an 
environmentally friendly alternative to the use of hard chromium, 
electroless nickel and other galvanic coatings.
Core ductility
What is it? The ability of a material to deform without breaking. 
Why is it important? In order to form or shape a complex 
component good ductility is required. Heat treatment is used to 
soften the material which makes it easy to work as part of the 
manufacturing process.
ST
Surface T echnology (ST)
ST incorporates specialised plasma spray, High Velocity Oxygen 
Fuel (HVOF) and thermo-chemically formed coatings to improve 
wear resistance, hardness and durability, and is able to surface 
engineer components designed to operate in the most demanding 
of industrial applications.
Below are a few examples of material properties obtained by 
heat treatment:

Efﬁcient 
and durable
16 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2016
Honeycomb, a structure borrowed from nature, provides an excellent strength to 
weight ratio when used in manufacturing applications. In aircraft engines, honeycomb 
seals are critical to the efﬁciency of gas ﬂow through the engine, and to providing a 
sacriﬁcial wear surface, protecting turbine blades as they respond to high operational
temperatures. This double role performed by the honeycomb seal results in better 
fuel efﬁciency and longer service life of turbine blades. To join the honeycomb seals, 
a form of metal joining, called brazing, is used. Bodycote has decades of experience 
providing this complex and specialised service.

The ADE Divisions
Bodycote has more than 180 facilities around the world which are 
organised into customer focused divisions; the ADE divisions and the 
AGI divisions. Our ADE customers tend to think and operate globally 
and our ADE divisions are organised globally as a result.
A large number of Bodycote’s multinational customers fall within 
our ADE divisions and Bodycote intends to continue to leverage 
its unique market position to increase revenues in the aerospace, 
defence and energy sectors. We have 63 facilities around the 
world including hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and surface technology 
facilities alongside our classical heat treatment plants.
The following review reflects constant currency growth rates unless 
stated otherwise.
Revenue in 2017 was £273.1m, an increase of 4.7% (8.8% at actual 
rates), including a contribution of 0.8 percentage points to the 
growth from new facility investments. Civil aviation growth was 
underpinned by a strong UK performance. It was also notable that 
growth in North American civil aviation revenues picked up through 
the year. The revenues from onshore oil & gas in North America 
increased sequentially through the year. These two factors helped 
the ADE divisions achieve revenue growth of 7 .2% in the second 
half of 2017 against 2.1% in the first half.
Headline operating profit
1
 was £64.2m, an increase of 11% (15% 
at actual rates), benefiting from positive operational leverage as 
revenues grew. Accordingly, return on sales improved to 23.5% 
(2016: 22.2%). Statutory operating profit grew to £62.7m (2016: 
£54.1m).
Net capital expenditure in 2017 was £32.1m (2016: £19.9m), 
representing 1 .5 times depreciation. In addition to the new mega-
HIP acquired for our European business, our new aerospace facility 
in Poland opened in 2017 and we commenced investment in a new 
UK facility to support our growing UK civil aviation business.
Return on capital employed increased to 21 .4% (2016: 19.7%), 
reflecting the improved profitability and careful management of  
the balance sheet.

The AGI Divisions
Bodycote has more than 180 facilities around the world which are 
organised into customer focused divisions; the ADE divisions and 
the AGI divisions. Our AGI customers include many multinational 
businesses which tend to operate on a regionally-focused basis, as 
well as numerous medium sized and smaller businesses, and all of 
which are important to Bodycote. Much of the business is locally 
oriented and the business is, therefore, organised on a regional basis.
Our extensive network of more than 120 AGI facilities enables 
the business to offer the widest range of technical capability and 
security of supply, while continuing to increase the proportion of 
technically differentiated services that it offers. Bodycote has a 
long and successful history of servicing this division’s wide-ranging 
customer base.
The following review reflects constant currency growth rates unless 
stated otherwise.
Revenue was £417 .1m, 13.1% ahead of the prior year (19.3% at 
actual rates), including a contribution of 2.1 percentage points to 
the growth from investments in new facilities and 5.0 percentage 
points from the plants acquired in 2016.
Growth in Western European revenues underpinned the divisions’ 
growth, with double-digit growth in its automotive revenues and 
solid growth in the General Industrial business.
Emerging Markets’ revenues also grew very strongly and now 
represent 13% of Bodycote’s AGI business. Mexico and China  
both achieved revenue growth above 40%.
Headline operating profit
1
 was £74.2m (2016: £58.5m), 20% ahead 
of the prior period (27% at actual rates). Return on sales expansion 
has been a focus for our AGI business over many years now, and at 
17 .8% we delivered return on sales improvement once again (2016: 
16.7%). Statutory operating profit grew to £71 .2m (2016: £54.9m).
Net capital expenditure was £37 .8m (2016: £37 .4m), representing  
1 .0 times depreciation. We are continuing to invest in the rapid 
growth Emerging Markets, with investments in Mexico, China, 
Turkey and Poland contributing the majority of the growth from  
new facilities. We also made further investment in S
3
P as the  
strong growth in demand for the technology requires us to  
continue to add more capacity. 
Return on capital employed increased to 17 .8% (2016: 15.2%), 
reflecting the strong improvement in profitability and is the highest 
return that we have seen since these divisions were created.

Group revenue was £690.2m, an increase of 14.9% at actual exchange rates, and 9.6% at constant currency. Acquisitions made in 2016 
contributed 2.9% of the constant currency growth, with new facilities contributing a further 1 .5%. 
Headline operating profit for the year increased by 24% to £123.9m (2016: £99.6m), and return on sales increased to 18.0% (2016:  
16.6%). Headline operating profit at constant currency increased by £18.0m, with the five acquired sites in 2016 contributing £3.0m to 
the improved headline operating profit. Price increases more than covered the increase in input costs. Statutory operating profit grew to 
£119.4m (2016: £94.5m).

while headline profit before tax increased 25% to £121 .5m (2016:

T ax 
The passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US in December 
2017 resulted in a significant £6.4m net one-off tax gain, as the 
Group’s US deferred tax liabilities were revalued as a result of the 
reduction in the US Federal corporate income tax rate. Accordingly, 
the Group’s tax rate is significantly lower, at 17 .0%. The Group’s 
headline tax rate for the year excludes this gain and is, therefore, 
somewhat higher at 22.9%.
The final impact of the changes from the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
are subject to a number of detailed provisions in the legislation and 
any implementation guidance issued by the Treasury Department 
and the IRS. Bodycote will continue to monitor any developments 
and give due consideration to the impact of any guidance, along 
with ongoing market interpretation and assessment on the 
accounting implications of this Act. 
Earnings per Share
The improved Group business performance drove basic headline 
earnings per share up to 49.2p (2016: 37 .0p), while basic earnings 
per share for the year increased to 51 .0p (2016: 35.2p).

Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
The return on capital employed rose in the current year to 19.3% 
from 17 .1% in 2016. This improvement was driven by the increase 
in the Group’s operating profit. Moreover, since 2014, the Group 
has invested £125m in growth investment projects, many of which 
are not yet fully mature and are not contributing as fully to Group 
returns as they will once they have all reached financial maturity. 
The Group continues to exert strong financial discipline in the area 
of capital expenditure as well as in the profit and loss account, 
applying stringent financial returns hurdles to all of its projects.

continues to demonstrate an impressive record of converting profit 
into cash. Consequently, free cash flow increased 37% to £83.0m 
and the Group ended 2017 with £39.6m of net cash (2016: £1 .1m).

Capital Expenditure
Net capital expenditure (capital expenditure less proceeds from 
asset disposals) for the year was £74.8m (2016: £63.1m). The 
multiple of net capital expenditure to depreciation was 1 .3 times 
(2016: 1 .1 times). The Group continues to invest in maintaining its 
assets to a high quality. More importantly with regard to future 
revenue growth of the business, half of the capital expenditure was 
on growth investment projects, including investment in incremental 
capacity for Specialist Technologies (notably HIP Services, S
3
P 
and LPC), expenditure on several new facilities, and investments 
in capacity and technology expansion in a number of existing 
locations.
Acquisitions
In December, Bodycote completed the acquisition of the HIP assets 
and vacuum furnaces from Doncasters Group Limited’s UK facility 
for consideration of £8.7m. 
Deferred consideration payments from acquisitions completed  
in 2016 increased the cash outflow on acquisitions to £14.2m in  
the year.
Dividend and Dividend Policy
The Group aims to pay ordinary dividends so that dividend 
cover will be at or above 2.0 times earnings. The Board may 
also recommend payment of a supplemental distribution to 
shareholders. The amount of any supplemental distribution will 
be assessed in light of the cash position of the Group, along with 
funding requirements for both organic growth and acquisitions.
The Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 12.1p 
(2016: 10.8p), bringing the total ordinary dividend to 17 .4p (2016: 
15.8p). In addition, in light of the Group’s strong balance sheet and 
year end net cash position, the Board has recommended a special 
dividend of 25.0p (2016: nil). If approved by shareholders, both  
the final ordinary dividend and the special dividend will be paid  
on 1 June 2018 to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 20 April 2018.
Borrowing Facilities
The Group is financed by a mix of cash flows from operations, 
short-term borrowings, long-term loans and finance leases. The 
Group’s funding policy aims to ensure continuity of finance at 
reasonable cost, based on committed and uncommitted facilities 
and loans from several sources over a spread of maturities.  
The Group continues to have access to committed facilities  
at competitive rates and therefore currently deems this to be  
the most effective means of long-term funding.
The total undrawn committed facility funding available to the 
Group at 31 December 2017 was £230.0m (2016: £225m). At 
31 December 2017 , the Group had the following drawings and

Post balance sheet events
There are no post balance sheet events that require disclosure  
in the financial statements.
Alternative performance measures
Bodycote uses alternative performance measures such as headline 
operating profit, headline earnings per share, headline profit before 
taxation, headline operating cash flow and free cash flow, together 
with current measures restated at constant currency, to allow the 
users of the financial statements to gain a clearer understanding of 
the underlying performance of the business, allowing the impact of 
restructuring and reorganisation activities and acquisition costs to 
be identified separately.
Going concern
In determining the basis of preparation for the Annual Report and 
the Group’s viability statement, the directors have considered the 
Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position. This includes 
an overview of the Group’s financial position, cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities.
The Group meets its working capital requirements through a 
combination of cash resources, committed and uncommitted 
facilities, and overdrafts. The overdrafts and uncommitted facilities 
are repayable on demand but the committed facilities are due 
for renewal as set out below. There is sufficient headroom in the 
committed facility covenants to assume that these facilities can be 
operated as contracted for the foreseeable future.
The committed facilities as at 31 December 2017 were as follows:
■ ■ £230m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 3 April 2022
The December 2017 weighted average life of the committed 
facilities was 4.3 years.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable 
potential changes in trading performance, show that the Group 
should be able to operate within the level of its current committed 
facilities.
The directors have reviewed forecasts and projections for the 
Group’s markets and services, assessing the committed facility and 
financial covenant headroom, central liquidity and the Group’s ability 
to access further funding. The directors also reviewed downside 
sensitivity analysis over the forecast period, thereby taking into 
account the uncertainties arising from the current economic 
environment. Following this review, the directors have formed a 
judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason the directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management and determining the Group’s risk appetite. The review of financial risk has been 
delegated to the Audit Committee. The Group’s risk framework, using a variety of top-down and bottom-up approaches, is used to identify, 
monitor and report risks. The risks are aggregated first at a divisional level and then at Group level. For each business critical risk, assurance 
activities have been documented in risk assurance maps and these are used to direct assurance activity including that of Internal Audit.
The Group Head of Risk is supported by the Risk and SHE Committee, which met three times during 2017 , attended by senior managers 
from each of the operating divisions and the Group Head of SHE. The Risk and SHE Committee assists the Group Head of Risk in identifying 
critical risks, embedding risk management and facilitating the implementation of risk management measures throughout the Group. The 
Group Head of Risk provides an update to the Audit Committee on the Group’s risk activities at every meeting and a comprehensive review 
of the Group’s business critical risks is presented to the Board in June and December. The Board concluded that an ongoing process of 
identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks has been in place throughout 2017 and a robust assessment of the 
principal risks had been undertaken.
The table below highlights the major risks that may affect Bodycote’s ability to deliver the strategy, as laid out on page 11 . These risks have 
been reviewed throughout the year and two new risks have been added since 2016; Environment and Capital Projects. The inclusion of 
the Environment risk reflects increasing regulatory intervention and a level of uncertainty in a number of jurisdictions in which Bodycote 
operates. The inclusion of the Capital Projects risk reflects the Group’s continued investments of significant amounts of capital to grow the 
business and these projects can be highly complex and rely upon factors outside the Group’s control. 
In determining the principal risks the Board once again considered the result of the 2016 referendum on the future of the UK’s membership 
in the European Union. The Board does not expect this will have a material impact on Bodycote as customers are served locally and cross-
border trading is minimal and this therefore remains as an element of the existing market risk.
Details of the Group’s financial risks (funding, foreign exchange, interest rate and counterparty risks), which are managed by the Group’s 
treasury function, are provided in note 18 to the financial statements. The mitigating activities described below will help to reduce the 
impact or likelihood of the major risk occurring, although the Board recognises that it will not be possible to eliminate these risks entirely. 
The Board recognises that there could be risks that may be unknown or that may be judged to be insignificant at present but may later 
prove to be significant. For this reason business continuity plans have been prepared for all plants to provide for situations where specific 
risks have the potential to severely impact the business.

Market and customer risks
Markets
Bodycote operates in 23 countries 
and a substantial amount of sales are 
closely linked to the economic cycle 
and the general macroeconomic 
environment. The result of the 
referendum on the future of the UK’s 
membership in the European Union 
is not expected to have a material 
transactional impact as customers  
are typically served locally and  
cross-border trading is minimal. 
Stable
The high proportion of short-term 
fixed costs in the business means 
that a drop in sales will have a 
significant impact on profitability. 
Sales in the markets served by the 
AGI businesses (69% of the total 
Group) tend to develop in line with 
or ahead of the economic cycle, 
whereas aerospace and defence 
sales (23%) tend to track behind the 
economic cycle. Sales to the energy 
sectors (8%) are closely linked to 
energy prices, which in turn can be 
affected by general economic activity. 
■ ■ Bodycote’s presence in 23 
countries across a wide variety 
of end-markets acts as a natural 
hedge to neutralise localised 
economic volatility.
■ ■ There is some short-term 
flexibility in the cost base e.g. 
by ensuring that a proportion of 
the workforce is employed on 
temporary contracts.
■ ■ Changes in customer demand on 
a local or a Group-wide level are 
responded to quickly.
Loss of key customers
Bodycote benefits from many  
long-term relationships with key 
customers and the damage to,  
or loss of, any of these relationships 
would be detrimental to the Group.
Stable
The loss of a key customer could 
adversely affect the Group’s financial 
results and the viability of one or 
more of Bodycote’s facilities.
■ ■ There is no significant customer 
dependency, with the Group’s top 
ten customers accounting for less 
than 17% of sales and the balance 
made up by many thousands of 
customers.
■ ■ There is a continued focus 
on customer service and 
quality processes to maintain 
excellent relationships with 
major customers. Key account 
management is in place 
and customer satisfaction is 
monitored.

Bodycote is committed to providing 
a safe work environment for its 
employees but Bodycote’s operations, 
if not properly managed, could have 
a significant impact on individual 
employees. Furthermore, poor safety 
and health practices could lead to 
disruption of business, financial 
penalties and loss of reputation.

Environment
Actual or potential environmental 
contamination could lead to health 
risks, disruption of business, financial 
costs and loss of reputation. 
Increasing
Bodycote is committed to providing 
the highest level of protection to 
the environment. Environmental 
regulators in many jurisdictions 
in which Bodycote operate can 
impose obligations on Bodycote to 
investigate potential contamination 
and remediate where required.
■ ■ Environmental procedures and 
measures in place conforming to 
ISO 14001 (2017: 87% of plants).
■ ■ Environmental due diligence of 
businesses for acquisition.
■ ■ Remediation of contaminated 
sites or additional emission

Service quality
The Bodycote brand is reliant on the 
repeatable delivery of parts to agreed 
specification to an agreed time.
Increasing
Deterioration in quality or service  
levels can cause serious long-term 
damage to Bodycote’s reputation 
with financial consequences such as 
the loss of a customer and the cost 
of damages or litigation. Work that 
is released into use which is not in 
compliance with specification could 
arise as a result of system or human 
failure.
The Automotive ISO technical 
specification 16949 has recently 
undergone major revision and is 
being replaced by IATF 16949 (IATF 
being the International Automotive 
Task Force). The new standard 
requires additional work, for example 
additional quality inspections. 
■ ■ Bodycote has stringent quality 
systems in place managed by 
qualified staff.
■ ■ Quality systems and processes 
operated at plant level with 
oversight by divisional quality 
teams.
■ ■ Where necessary, plants maintain 
industry relevant accreditations, 
such as ISO 9001, Nadcap and 
IATF 16949 .
■ ■ All plants subjected to internal 
and external quality audits and 
inspections at least once a year.
Major disruption at a facility
Bodycote’s business processes 
are inherently risky and there is a 
possibility that a major fire such 
as that suffered in 2016 at the 
Huntington Park facility (USA) or 
utility outage could lead to closure 
of a facility’s operation. In addition 
a number of sites are exposed to 
natural hazards, such as earthquakes, 
flooding and storms. 
Stable
Any significant incident at a site  
could result in the service to 
Bodycote’s customers from the 
affected site being disrupted.
■ ■ Bodycote has a global network 
of 187 facilities. These facilities 
create a framework to provide 
back-up capability for affected 
facilities.
■ ■ Business continuity plans are 
in place for all plants. These are 
updated and tested annually. This 
process has been subject to a 
Board risk deep dive in 2017 . 
■ ■ Independent insurer inspections 
to assess hazard and business 
interruption risks.
■ ■ Insurance cover, including 
business interruption cover.
■ ■ Scheduled equipment 
maintenance and inspections.
Capital projects
The Group invests capital in 
developing existing plants as well as 
into Greenfield developments and 
acquisitions. 
Increasing
Capital projects can be highly 
complex and rely on factors outside 
of the Group’s control. This may 
cause projects to be delivered late 
or at a higher cost than forecast. 
Market conditions may also change 
making a project less profitable than 
initially projected.
■ ■ There is a well established capital 
investment approval process 
that applies to all major capital 
projects.
■ ■ Project Management frameworks 
are in place to deliver projects on 
time and on cost.
■ ■ All major projects are subject to 
post implementation reviews.
■ ■ Capital project risk will be subject 
to Internal Audit review in 2018.

implementation of an ERP system.
Stable
Failure to protect the Group’s IT 
systems from cyber threats, or to 
maintain and upgrade the Group’s

Regulatory and legislative 
compliance
The global nature of Bodycote’s 
operations means that the Group 
has to comply with a wide range 
of local and international legislative 
requirements, including anti-bribery 
and anti-competition legislation, 
taxation legislation, employment  
law and import and export controls.
Stable
Failure to comply with legislation 
could lead to substantial financial 
penalties, disruption to business, 
diversion of management time, 
personal and corporate liability and 
loss of reputation.
■ ■ Business processes are supported 
by HR policies and the Group  
Code of Conduct alongside training 
and awareness programmes.

Viability statement 
In preparing this statement of viability, the directors have considered the prospects of the Group over the three year period immediately 
following the 2017 financial year. This longer term assessment process supports the Board’s statements on both viability, as set out  
below, and going concern (on page 24). A three year period was determined as it is a reasonable period over which the business could  
be restructured in the event that any material changes to demand for the Group’s services transpired. As a result, the Board determined 
that a period of longer than three years would not be meaningful for the purpose of concluding on longer term viability.
The forecast used considers metrics which enable assessment of the Group’s key performance indicators (including return on capital 
employed, headline earnings per share and headline operating cash flow) in addition to net debt, liquidity and financing requirements.
In conducting the review of the Group’s prospects the directors assessed the three year plan alongside the Group’s current position, the 
Group’s strategy and the principal risks facing the Group (all of which are detailed in the Strategic Report on pages 3 to 35). This assessment 
considered the impact of the principal risks on the business model and on future performance, liquidity and solvency and was mindful 
of the limited forward visibility that the Group has as it carries no order backlog. The directors’ viability assessment included a review of 
the sensitivity analysis performed on the three year plan, whereby the principal risks were applied to the plan in a number of diverging 
scenarios. The developed scenarios were designed to be plausible, yet severe. Examples of scenarios reviewed were:
■ ■ A decrease in forecast revenue of similar magnitude to the largest year-on-year decrease suffered in the last ten years.
■ ■ A 10% decrease in revenue, debtor days and sterling strengthening to reflect an economic downturn
In making this viability statement the directors considered the mitigating actions that are taken by the Group in the event that the principal 
risks of the company become realised. The directors also took into consideration the Group’s financial position at 31 December 2017 , with 
net cash of £40m, available committed facility headroom of £230m and a history of strong cash generation.
The directors have assessed the viability of the Group and, based on the procedures outlined above in addition to activities undertaken  
by the Board in its normal course of business, confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue  
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to 31 December 2020.

Our approach
Bodycote’s objective is to create superior shareholder returns 
through the provision of selected thermal processing services that 
are highly valued by our customers. We aim to achieve this in a safe 
working environment, while continually seeking to minimise the 
impact on the environment.
Bodycote is dedicated to improving the management of corporate 
responsibility issues and is implementing policies and initiatives to 
achieve this goal. The future success and growth of the Group is 
intrinsically linked to our ability to ensure the Group’s operations  
are sustainable and that we can nurture and develop our talent.
Our people
The strength of the Group primarily rests in its people and one of the 
key challenges for management is to ensure availability of appropriately 
qualified people to support its continued growth. Bodycote is fortunate 
to have a competent and committed international team that is well-
respected in technical and business circles. 
Bodycote invests in the training and development of its people both 
at local and Group level. At a local level the Group is committed 
to providing the appropriate skills and technical training which will 
allow its employees to operate effectively and safely in their roles 
and deliver excellent customer service. At Group level a number 
of initiatives are currently being rolled out to drive excellence in 
management.
A tool to develop further understanding and skill in the area of 
performance management is in place and is being used globally 
through the management population. Through communication of 
clear messages coupled with skills development, the organisation 
aims to raise the capability of its management population in 
driving performance. This initiative is backed by a performance 
management system which supports the process.
Bodycote’s employment policies are non-discriminatory, complying 
with all current legislation to engender equal opportunity irrespective 
of age, race, gender, ethnic origin, nationality, religion, health, 
disability, marital status, sexual preference, political or philosophical 
opinions or trade union membership. Harassment is not tolerated.
Female representation on our Board during 2017 was 17% (2016: 
17%) and at manager level it is 26% (2016: 25%). Females represent 
19% (2016: 18%) of our total workforce. As of 1 January 2018 we 
have increased female representation on the Board to 43%.

It is not just important what we do but how we do it and how 
we behave in our Company. How we operate as a Group and the 
behaviours that we expect from all our employees are expressed in 
our Core Values. Our values represent Bodycote and its people and 
our commitment to the Company and the business.
Our Core Values are straightforward and are as follows:
Honesty and T ransparency
We are honest and act with integrity. Trust stems from honesty 
and trust is at the heart of everything we engage in: our customers 
trust us to deliver what we say we will, our colleagues trust us 
to act in their best interests and our suppliers trust us to conduct 
business according to agreed terms. This is not something we take 
for granted. Bodycote lives by a culture of honest and transparent 
behaviour, which is at the core of all our business relationships.
Respect and Responsibility
We manage our business with respect, applying an ethical  
approach to our dealings with those we interact with.  
We respect our colleagues, who are all of the employees of 
Bodycote. Part of our respect for our colleagues is our commitment 
to safe and responsible behaviour and our fundamental belief that 
no-one should come to any harm at work. We show respect for 
our customers, our suppliers and our competitors. We respect 
the communities around us and behave as responsible corporate 
citizens by being compliant with the laws and regulations of the 
countries in which we do business and by ensuring that our effect 
on the environment is minimal. We believe in taking ownership for, 
and being mindful of the impact of, our actions.
Creating V alue
Creating value is the very essence of our business and needs  
to be the focus of our endeavours. We create value for our 
customers, our employees and our shareholders. The realities  
are harsh. If we do not create value for our customers then we 
have no reason for existence. If we do not create value for our 
employees there will be no-one to create value for our customers. 
Our shareholders rightfully require that we ultimately create value 
for them as they are the owners of the business.
Human rights
Bodycote’s human rights policy is consistent with the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Global Compact’s ten 
principles.
We prohibit forced, compulsory and underage labour and any 
form of discrimination based on age, race, gender, ethnic origin, 
nationality, religion, health, disability, marital status, sexual 
preference, political or philosophical opinions or trade union 
membership. Appropriate mechanisms are in place to minimise  
the potential for any contravention of these rules.
By publicly posting our human rights policy on www.bodycote.com, 
stakeholders worldwide can alert us to potential breaches of the 
policy. Our internal systems also support compliance with our policy 
and we have a robust Open Door Line for employees to report 
alleged violations of law and/or our policies on a confidential basis 
and in their own language. In the jurisdictions in which we employ a 
majority of our employees, there are laws applicable to many of the 
areas dealt with in our human rights policy.
The Modern Slavery Act
Bodycote plc has conducted a risk assessment on our supply 
chain using the UK Government’s published guidance entitled 
“Transparency in Supply Chains” . Suppliers, in those countries 
identified in Walk Free Foundation’s 2016 Global Slavery Index as 
being the most vulnerable to human rights issues in the supply 
chain, have been identified for further review and audit.
We have a Code of Conduct which sets out our policy on 
compliance with legislation, child labour, anti-slavery and human 
trafficking, and conditions of employment, health and safety and  
the environment.
The Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking statement was reviewed by 
our Board of Directors in September 2017 and was published on our 
website. The statement will be reviewed on an annual basis.
Customers and suppliers
Bodycote has no significant suppliers who are wholly dependent 
upon the Group’s business and has no significant suppliers on 
which the Group is dependent upon for a substantial part of its 
business. Suppliers are paid in line with contractual and legal 
obligations.
We endeavour to respond quickly to changing customer demand, 
to identify emerging needs and to improve service availability and 
quality. We stay close to our current and potential customers, 
building long-term relationships.
Community
Bodycote seeks to play a positive role in the local communities 
in which it operates by providing employment opportunities, 
and building goodwill and a reputation as a good neighbour and 
employer.
Responsible business ethics
All Bodycote personnel are expected to apply a high ethical standard, 
consistent with an international UK-listed company. Directors and 
employees are expected to ensure that their personal interests 
do not at any time conflict with those of Bodycote. Shareholder 
employees are advised of, and comply with, the share dealing code.
Bodycote has systems in place that are designed to ensure 
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and conformity 
with all relevant codes of business practice. Furthermore, Bodycote 
does not make political donations.
With regard to competition, Bodycote aims to win business in a 
differentiated high-value manner. The Group does not employ unfair 
trading methods and it competes vigorously but fairly within the 
requirements of applicable laws. Employees are prohibited from 
either giving or receiving any inducements.
Our Open Door Policy has been translated into all languages used 
throughout the Group. The policy allows employees to report their 
concern confidentially, verbally or in writing, to an independent 
third party provider, ensuring anonymity. Reports are transcribed 
and sent to the Group Head of Risk, who then determines the 
appropriate steps for the matter to be addressed.
Online training courses in respect of Anti-Bribery and Competition 
Law have been designed and translated into the major languages 
used throughout the Group. All relevant employees have completed 
the interactive courses.

Corporate responsibility and sustainability continued
Operational SHE performance
Bodycote is committed to continual improvement in our safety, 
health and environmental performance (SHE). We are committed to 
complying with all local legislative requirements as a minimum and 
establishing consistent and robust best practices at all of our sites 
to deliver consistently high performance across all aspects of SHE 
management.
Safety and health
The nature of the Group’s operations is such that employees are 
inevitably exposed to hazards in the workplace. Bodycote aims to 
manage these hazards and thereby minimise risks to employees 
through the deployment of robust safety control systems and 
procedures, and seeks to establish these at all sites. 
Bodycote’s online incident reporting and SHE management tool has 
been operational since 2013. This has enabled more consistent and 
thorough reporting of workplace injuries, near misses and unsafe 
conditions. Following the implementation, there was an increase 
in the lost time injury rate frequency (LTI rate) in 2013 as sites 
were better able to record and report incidents. In 2017 , the LTI rate 
increased from 1 .5 to 1 .6. Bodycote continues to devote significant 
resource and management focus on safety with the number of 
“Opportunities for Improvement” (OFIs) reported by employees 
having increased by 47 .8% across the Group. This improvement 
demonstrates stronger engagement of employees in proactively 
raising safety issues and rectifying potential safety issues before 
they might lead to an injury. Accidents, though regrettable and 
unacceptable, represent learning opportunities. This is the reason 
that accurate reporting is an essential part of building a robust 
safety management system.
Accident frequency (lost time injury rate) 
Accident frequency is defined as the number of lost time accidents 
5 200,000 hours (approximately 100 man years), divided by the total 
number of employee hours worked.
In addition to encouraging the reporting of work related injuries, 
Bodycote has sought to encourage the reporting of near misses 
and unsafe conditions. This has worked well since the introduction 
of the new global incident reporting system in 2013 and a common 
near miss/unsafe condition reporting system at every operational 
site. This much improved reporting of incidents permits us to 
address hazards before injury occurs. As our database continues 
to develop we will be able to analyse and prioritise our safety 
action programmes more effectively. The most frequent cause of 
lost time incidents is related to manual handling of parts and lifting 
operations and has a number of underlying causes. This is currently 
the subject of a Group wide review and will be a focus for risk 
reduction activities over the next few years.
All reportable incidents and lost time injuries are reviewed during 
executive management meetings and Board meetings. In addition, 
the executive management team reviews incidents which did not 
result in injury but were considered to have been serious or to 
have had a high potential impact. All serious incidents and high 
potential incidents are also reviewed by the Group SHE Committee 
and are cascaded within the business as appropriate to ensure that 
preventive actions are taken. This system was further strengthened 
in 2015 with actions being tracked via the online incident 
management system.
Environment
A proactive approach to improving energy efficiency means that 
Bodycote has implemented a variety of systems to reduce water 
and gas consumption, and to re-use heat energy. The ongoing effort 
to lessen the impact on the environment has resulted in Bodycote 
seeking ISO 14001 accreditation at all of its facilities.
At every stage where Bodycote is involved in the manufacturing 
cycle, our operational aim is to reduce the overall impact on the 
environment, not just in our own operations, but also those of 
our customers. Bodycote operates modern, efficient equipment, 
which is operated around the clock so as to optimise treatment 
processing cycles. Without Bodycote, many companies would be 
using older in-house technology and running their equipment at 
reduced capacity, both of which drain energy resources. Working 
with Bodycote enables our customers to commit more easily to 
carbon reduction initiatives.
Bodycote also reduces the carbon footprint of our customers’ 
activities by increasing the lifespan of their products, by improving 
metallurgical properties and by enhancing corrosion resistance. 
For example, surface treatment technology is widely used in the 
reclamation of damaged and worn components, offering a cost-
effective and energy-efficient alternative to the need to manufacture 
new replacement parts. The treated parts often last up to twenty 
times longer than the original.
Whilst thermal processing is an energy-intensive business, it is a 
vital part of the manufacturing supply chain and its use saves the 
energy it consumes many times over.

Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions resulting from fuel  
usage and the operation of facilities. Scope 2 emissions are indirect 
energy emissions resulting from purchased electricity, heat, steam 
or cooling for own use.
The financial control consolidation approach has been used to 
report the above data. This method aligns with the reporting 
scope in the financial statements. The Group collects electricity 
and natural gas usage information from each facility on a monthly 
basis. The Group then applies the International Energy Agency (IEA) 
published national carbon conversion factors to calculate the total 
tonnage of CO
2
e produced. Group operational management actively 
monitors their monthly CO
2
e emissions reported and the Group’s 
Executive Committee reviews the level of CO
2
e emissions on a 
monthly basis.
All entities and facilities under financial control are included within 
the disclosure. Emissions less than 1% of the Group’s total CO
2
e 
relating to fugitive emissions and owned vehicles are not significant 
and are excluded. As such there are no significant omissions from 
this disclosure.
ISO 14001 accredited facilities
Reducing the environmental impact of the Group’s activities is taken 
very seriously. Compliance with the requirements of ISO 14001 helps 
to minimise the risk of adverse environmental effects at Bodycote’s 
sites. At the end of 2017 , 87% of our operating facilities had achieved 
ISO 14001 accreditation (2016: 89%). The slight reduction is due to 
the closure of a number of existing certified sites and the acquisition 
and construction of new sites which have yet to attain ISO 14001 . 
Operational plants which have not yet received accreditation to the 
standard are working towards it.
Carbon footprint and water consumption 
The absolute energy usage increased by 5.8%. At constant 
exchange rates, it increased by 9.1%. 
The total CO
2
e emissions per £m sales in 2017 were 493.1 Te (2016: 
as previously reported 535.6 Te; normalised† 494.8 Te). 
The Group’s total CO
2
e emission data is based on Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions, as defined by the UK Government’s DEFRA, 
and data relating to this has been calculated to include country-
specific electricity conversion factors. In previous years this has 
been supplied by DEFRA directly. However, as of January 2017 
DEFRA no longer supplies these conversion factors for non-UK 
companies. This has now been sourced by the Group directly from 
the International Energy Agency (IEA). There are some significant 
differences in these conversion factors. As a result all previous 
years have now been restated using IEA conversion factors to 
ensure that year-on-year comparisons are consistent.
On a normalised† basis, water usage per £m sales decreased by 
4.3%. On a non-normalised basis, water usage per £m showed a 
decrease of 9.1%.
In 2015 our EU based operational sites reviewed their operations 
to ensure compliance with the Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/
EU. This Directive is transposed into local legislation and requires 
sites to monitor their energy usage and assess energy reduction 
opportunities which are in addition to the ongoing energy saving 
activities on sites. One mechanism for ensuring compliance is 
for sites to become certified to ISO 50001 Energy Management 
Systems Standard. This enables sites to measure energy usage 
consistently and target the most effective ways of reducing energy 
usage. Our sites in Germany, Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands 
are largely already certified and working on further energy 
management programmes.
Bodycote uses established systems to develop best practice 
at specific sites and across the wider Group. Examples of 2017 
projects undertaken across Bodycote sites are discussed below.
The continued replacement of traditional lighting with LED for 
environmental and improved safety has resulted in further CO
2
 
reductions. Our sites at Sprockhövel, Otterfing, Esslingen, Korntal, 
Wehingen, Gothenburg and Warsaw will benefit from projected 
total savings of 192.4Te CO
2
 annually. 
At the Lüdenscheid plant the second phase of a heat recovery 
project will save a further 171 .6Te CO
2
 each year in addition to the 
69.1Te from phase 1 . At Langenfeld 133.6Te CO
2
 savings will be 
achieved from new furnace insulation.
A new heat exchange system in Gothenburg for both cooling water 
and process ventilation has resulted in 10.6Te CO
2
 savings and 
means that no additional energy is required to heat the production 
area and the main offices. 
Meanwhile in Denmark our Ejby plant will reduce CO
2
 emissions 
by 60.3Te through the new air coolers. These replace evaporative 
water cooling towers and, in addition to the energy savings, 
eliminate the potential risk of Legionella and associated chemical 
treatment. 
In addition to process efficiency improvements some sites have 
upgraded the building fabric to improve energy efficiency. At our 
Haag site a project to replace windows and improve insulation 
resulted in a 10Te per annum saving of CO
2
 emissions.
Since 2013 Bodycote has submitted data on CO
2
 usage to the 
Carbon Disclosure Project, one of the leading carbon reporting and 
verification bodies. Each year the Company has improved its standing 
in the league tables and is now a “C” relative to general business 
groups and is rated significantly higher on verification of data.
Chlorinated solvent use
The use of chlorinated solvents in Bodycote’s thermal processing 
activities has been reduced in recent years as aqueous degreasing 
facilities have been introduced. In 2017 , the normalised† solvent use 
showed a further decrease of 8.0% compared with the previous year.

Corporate governance statement
Chairman’s message
Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to introduce the Group’s corporate governance report on behalf of our Board of Directors. The Corporate governance statement 
provides an insight into how the Board operated during the year and the key issues considered. We are committed to conducting business 
responsibly. By maintaining high standards of corporate governance we enhance performance underpinned by our business model. Our 
approach to governance is set by the Board and our Executive Committee ensures that the approach is effectively implemented across the 
business. Effective and robust governance remains central to the ongoing success of the Group.
The main Group-wide governance documents are our Core Values and the Code of Conduct, which set out the values and standards that 
we expect of our employees. These documents, together with our policies, govern how we conduct our business and set the standards 
that drive performance. Compliance training helps to enforce this. Board oversight, reviews and audits form part of the monitoring and 
supervision process. Risk processes are embedded and reviewed on an ongoing basis across the business. The important governance 
developments at Bodycote over the last year are detailed in the governance reporting section below.
My ambitions for the composition of the Board are to maintain, and where applicable, broaden the range of expertise, experience and 
diversity. The Board continues to ensure that effective succession plans are in place.
I encourage all shareholders to attend the AGM, which will be held at our Macclesfield head office on 30 May 2018. This event provides  
an excellent opportunity to meet the executive and independent non-executive directors.

Governance reporting
Board diversity
Bodycote is a global business with operations in 23 countries and diversity is an integral part of how we do business. The Nomination 
Committee considers diversity when making appointments to the Board, taking into account relevant skills, experience, knowledge, 
personality, ethnicity and gender. Our prime responsibility, however, is the strength of the Board and our overriding aim in any new 
appointment must always be to select the best candidate. The Nominations Committee also considers capability and capacity to commit 
the necessary time to the role in its recommendation to the Board. The intention is to appoint the most suitable qualified candidate to 
complement and balance the current skills, knowledge and experience of the Board and who will be best able to help lead the Company 
in its long-term strategy. The Nomination Committee is advised by international search companies, who have been briefed on our diversity 
policy and are required to reflect the policy in the long list submitted to the Committee.
We appointed A.C. Quinn on 1 January 2018 as part of our Board refreshment replacing A.M. Thomson, who retired on 31 December 2017 
as Chairman of the Board. L. Chahbazi was appointed Non-executive director effective 1 January 2018. The Board currently comprises two 
executive directors, four non-executive directors and a non-executive chairman.
As of 2018 female representation on our Board is 43%; 2017: 17% (2016: 17%). At manager level it is 26% (2016: 25%). Females represent 
19% (2016: 18%) of our total workforce. Whilst we are above the 33% by 2020 voluntary target recommended by the Hampton-Alexander 
review, we continue to believe it is difficult to set targets or timescales for increasing the proportion of women, or any other minority 
group, on our Board and do not propose to do so. We will increase female and/or other minority representation on the Board if appropriate 
candidates are available when Board vacancies arise.
The Corporate responsibility and sustainability report contains further details regarding the male and female representation within the 
Group, including Board representation. 
Board evaluation
Following the external Board Evaluation in 2015, the Board agreed to undertake an internal evaluation in 2017 . To ensure that all aspects 
of good governance are covered by the review, the Group Company Secretary distributed a tailored questionnaire to each member of the 
Board. Questions were framed under the following seven topics:
■ ■ Remit and objectives;
■ ■ Composition, training and resources;
■ ■ Corporate governance/risk management;
■ ■ Stakeholder engagement;
■ ■ Board meetings and visits;
■ ■ Board procedures and administration; and
■ ■ Evaluation and effectiveness.
At a meeting of the Nomination Committee in September 2017 , the directors assessed the conclusions reached and are in the process of 
implementing a number of recommendations. Additional emphasis will be placed on risk management, strategy and operational matters. 
The Board evaluation covered the activities of the main Board and each of its Committees. The Board is considered to be functional and 
working well. Arising from the exercise, the Board concluded that its focus should remain on divisional growth strategies, technology 
development, risk and sustainability as well as continued training. The overall conclusion is that the Board is performing well and high 
governance standards have been adopted. The Executive Committee is strongly challenged by the Board when appropriate.
As in previous years, the Chairman has assessed the performance of each Board member by conducting individual interviews and we can 
confirm that all directors continue to perform effectively and demonstrate commitment to their roles.
The Executive Directors Messrs S.C. Harris and D.Yates will be appraised in March 2018.
Led by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, the directors carried out an evaluation of the Chairman’s performance in September 
2017 . The Board was satisfied with the now retired Chairman’s commitment and performance.
Overboarding
At our AGM in 2017 , Bodycote received a high number of votes against the re-election of Eva Lindqvist. Eva has now had time to review 
her directorships and will not stand for re-election at three of her listed companies. RNS announcements will be made during Q1 2018 
confirming that Eva will not stand for re-election at the AGMs of Caverion Oy in March 2018, Assa Abloy AB in April 2018 and Alimak Holding 
in May 2018.
Following these changes, Eva Lindqvist will sit on five listed boards: Bodycote, another UK PLC and three Nordic Boards. Following a review 
of Eva’s time commitments and taking into account the reduced number of meeting of Nordic Boards, the Board is satisfied that Eva has 
sufficient scope to carry out her commitments even if these should be temporarily increased.

Corporate governance statement continued
Induction
All new directors are subject to a tailored induction programme covering a diverse range of topics including trading, investor relations, 
organisational and legal matters as well as visits to operational sites. They also meet all other directors and senior executives. This facilitates 
their understanding of the Group and the key drivers of business performance.
T raining
The Board receives training via ad hoc presentations and papers from advisers and the Group Company Secretary. External periodic training 
on important topics takes place and during the year the directors received training on Stakeholder engagement, FRC consultation on the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, FRC updates to the guidance on the Strategic Report and other areas of focus for 2017/18. Other opportunities 
for on-going development and support are:
■ ■ a programme of plant/site visits throughout the year;
■ ■ reviews with the Chairman to identify any training and development needs;
■ ■ advice on governance, relevant legislative changes affecting the business or their duties from the Company Secretary;
■ ■ access to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense; and
■ ■ participation in the training and guidance programme for boards and directors offered at the Deloitte Academy.
Succession planning
Succession planning ensures that appropriate senior executive leadership resources are in place to achieve Bodycote’s strategic objectives. 
The plans are reviewed annually by the Nomination Committee.
The Board further develops its knowledge and gains greater visibility of executive talent and management succession by visiting the 
Group’s sites and meeting with key talent and senior executives.

Corporate governance statement continued
Compliance reporting
In respect of the financial year 2017 , Bodycote’s obligation under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules is to prepare a corporate 
governance statement with reference to the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the FRC in April 2016 (“the Code”). 
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2017 , Bodycote has complied with the provisions of the Code with the exception of provisions 
E.1 .1 . Regarding E.1 .1, the Board has, in recent years, taken the view that generally it is the responsibility of the Group Chief Executive and 
the Chief Financial Officer to manage relationships with institutional investors. The Chairman also meets institutional investors to discuss 
overall strategy, governance and any concerns that shareholders may have. Only where these more usual channels of communication 
have failed would the Board expect the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (SID) or other non-executive directors to become 
involved, notwithstanding that the Code specifies attendance of the SID at meetings with major shareholders. The SID has contacted major 
shareholders and offered to facilitate meetings with them should they have any concerns they wish to discuss. Regular feedback from 
the Group’s advisers on investor meetings and results presentations is circulated to all directors. During the year the Chairman met with 
shareholders to discuss governance matters.
Apart from these distinct areas, Bodycote was in compliance with the provisions of the 2016 Code throughout 2017 .
Operation of the Code
Taken together with the Report of the Audit Committee, the Report of the Nomination Committee and the Board report on remuneration 
presented on pages 48 to 75, this statement explains how Bodycote has applied the principles of good corporate governance as set out in 
the Code.
Leadership
The Board is responsible to shareholders for good corporate governance, setting the Group’s strategic objectives, values and standards,  
and ensuring the necessary resources are in place to achieve the objectives.
The Board met on nine occasions during 2017 , including a specific meeting to review and update the Group’s long-term strategy. The Board 
of Directors comprises seven members, of whom five are non-executive directors and two are executive directors, led by the Group’s part-
time Non-Executive Chairman, A.C. Quinn, who also chairs the Nomination Committee. The Group Chief Executive is S.C. Harris and the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is I.B. Duncan, who also chairs the Audit Committee. E. Lindqvist is Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee. P . Larmon and L. Chahbazi are non-executive directors. Brief biographical details of all directors are given on pages 36 to 37 . 
During the year the Board visited a number of UK and overseas facilities, including sites in France and the USA. Such events involved 
meetings with local management and the unit workforce to understand more clearly technical and operational performance in countries 
where Bodycote has a significant presence.
Matters reserved for the Board were reviewed during the year and updated where required. Certain defined powers and issues reserved  
for the Board to decide are, inter alia:
■ ■ Strategy;
■ ■ Approval of financial statements and circulars;
■ ■ Capital projects, acquisitions and disposals;
■ ■ Annual budgets;
■ ■ Directors’ appointments, service agreements, remuneration and succession planning;
■ ■ Policies for financial statements, treasury, safety, health and environment, donations;
■ ■ Committees’ terms of reference;
■ ■ Board and committee chairmen and membership;
■ ■ Investments;
■ ■ Equity and bank financing;
■ ■ Internal control and risk management;
■ ■ Corporate governance;
■ ■ Key external and internal appointments; and
■ ■ Employee share incentives and pension arrangements.
42 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017 25695    19 March 2018 3:29 PM    Proof 7
In advance of Board meetings, directors are supplied with up-to-date information regarding the trading performance of each operating 
division and sub-division, in addition to the Group’s overall financial position and its achievement against prior year results, budgets and 
forecasts. They are also supplied with the latest available information on safety, health and environmental and risk management issues and 
details of the safety and health performance of the Group, and each division, in terms of severity and frequency rates for accidents at work. 
Senior management from across the Group and advisers attend some of the meetings to provide updates. The exposure to members of 
senior management from across the Group helps enhance the Board’s understanding of the business, the implementation of strategy and 
the changing dynamics of the markets in which the Group operates.
Where required, a director may seek independent professional advice, the cost of which is reimbursed by the Group. All directors have 
access to the Group Company Secretary and they may also address specific issues with the SID. In accordance with the Articles of 
Association, all newly appointed directors must submit themselves for election. All directors stand for yearly re-election. Non-executive 
directors, including the Chairman, are appointed for fixed terms not exceeding three years from the date of first election by shareholders, 
after which the appointment may be extended by mutual agreement. A statement of the directors’ responsibilities is set out on page 76. 
The Board also operates three committees. These are the Nomination Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee. 
All non-executive directors serve on each Board Committee.
In accordance with the recommendations of the Code, Board members serve for a period of six years, which will only be extended in 
certain circumstances. If letters of appointment are extended beyond six years, the fixed term is reduced to one year.
In order that necessary actions can be taken promptly, a finance sub-committee, comprising the Chairman (or failing her, any other non-
executive director), the Senior Independent Director, the Group Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer operates between the dates 
of scheduled Board meetings and is authorised to make decisions, within limits defined by the Board, in respect of certain finance, treasury, 
tax or investment matters.

All directors, attended the maximum number of Board, Audit and Nomination Committee meetings that they were scheduled to attend. P . 
Larmon did not attend one Remuneration Committee due to an unpredictable diary clash. In addition, non-members Messrs A.M. Thomson, 
S.C. Harris, D.Yates attended by invitation some parts of the meetings of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
Proposals for re-election
The Board decided, in line with the Code, that all directors will retire annually and, other than in the case of any director who has decided to 
stand down from the Board, will offer themselves for re-election at the AGM. Accordingly, S.C. Harris, E. Lindqvist, P . Larmon, I.B. Duncan 
and D. Yates will stand for re-election at the AGM in May 2018. Having been appointed since the last AGM, A.C. Quinn and L. Chahbazi will 
stand for election.
The Board recommends to shareholders that they re-elect (or elect) all the directors. In accordance with the recommendations of the Code, 
Board members will serve for a period of six years which may be extended in certain circumstances.
The performance of each director was evaluated as indicated above and the Board confirms in respect of each that their performance 
continues to be effective and that each continues to demonstrate commitment to his or her respective role.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls and risk management policies and has an ongoing responsibility for 
reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board has applied Principle C.2 
of the Code by establishing a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks, including risks 
arising out of Bodycote’s corporate and social engagement. The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management systems. It is based principally on reviewing reports from management and from Internal Audit 
(IA) to consider whether any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied or indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The Audit 
Committee assists the Board in discharging these review responsibilities.
44 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017 25695    19 March 2018 3:29 PM    Proof 7
The Board believes that the Group maintains an effective system of internal controls which is in accordance with the FRC’s guidance 
entitled ‘Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors’ (formerly referred to as the Turnbull Report guidance) and, in the view of the 
Board, no significant deficiencies have been identified in the system. The system was in operation throughout 2017 and continues to 
operate up to the date of the approval of this report. Key elements of the Group’s system of internal control are as follows:
■ ■ The Group prepares a comprehensive annual budget which is closely monitored and updated quarterly. The Group’s authority matrix  
was reviewed and updated during 2017 and this clearly sets out authority limits for those with delegated responsibility and specifies 
what can only be decided with central approval.
■ ■ The Board, with the assistance of EY , who provide co-sourced IA services, monitors the Group’s internal financial control system. IA 
reviews are conducted on the basis of a risk based plan approved annually by the Audit Committee. This includes regular visits to each 
division, shared service centres and plants. The findings and recommendations from IA are reported on a regular basis to the Executive 
and Audit Committees.
■ ■ An annual internal control self-assessment, with management certification, is undertaken by every Bodycote site. The assessment 
covers the effectiveness of key financial and compliance controls and was revised at the start of 2017 . The results are validated by IA 
through spot checks and are reported to the Executive and Audit Committees.
■ ■ Group Core Values and Group Policies (including the Code of Conduct, Group Authority Matrix and Finance Policies) are documented  
and are available to all employees via the Group’s intranet system. 
■ ■ The Chief Financial Officer, Group Financial Controller, President and Vice President of Finance for each division sign a letter of 
representation annually. This is to confirm the adequacy of their systems of internal controls, their compliance with Group Core Values 
and Group Policies, relevant laws and regulations, and that they have reported any control weaknesses and actual, or attempted, frauds 
or thefts through the Group’s assurance processes. 
■ ■ A Group-wide risk register and assurance map is maintained throughout the year to identify the Group’s key strategic and operational 
risks. Any changes to these risks during the year are promptly reported to the Executive Committee and the Board.
During 2017 , in compliance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, management performed a specific assessment of its risk management processes 
for the purpose of this Annual Report. Management’s assessment, which has been reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board, included 
a review of the Group’s key strategic and operational risks. The review was based on work performed by the Group Head of Risk and the 
Group’s Risk and SHE Committee (by means of workshops, interviews, investigations and by reviewing departmental or divisional risk 
registers). These risks have been reviewed throughout the year and two new risks have been added since 2016, Environmental and Capital 
Projects. Further information regarding the ways in which the principal business risks and uncertainties affecting the Group are managed is 
shown on pages 25 to 29. 
Investor relations
The Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer regularly talk with and meet institutional investors, both individually and collectively, 
and this has enabled institutional investors to increase their understanding of the Group’s strategy and operating performance. In addition, 
internet users are able to view up-to-date news on the Group and its share price via the Bodycote website at www.bodycote.com. Users 
of the website can access recent announcements and copies of results presentations and can enrol to hear live presentations. On a 
regular basis, Bodycote’s financial advisers, corporate brokers and financial public relations consultants provide the directors with opinion 
surveys from analysts and investing institutions following visits and meetings with the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer. 
The Chairman and SID are available to discuss any issues not resolved by the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer. On specific 
issues, such as the review of remuneration packages, the Group has sought, and will continue to seek, the views of leading investors.

Directors’ report
The directors are pleased to submit their report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 .
The Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the Chief Financial Officer’s report and all the information contained on pages 36  
to 75 together comprise the Directors’ report for the year ended 31 December 2017 .
Strategic report
The Strategic report is provided on pages 3 to 35 of this Annual Report. This is a review of the development of the Group’s businesses, 
the financial performance during the year ended 31 December 2017 , key performance indicators and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group. The Strategic report has been prepared solely to assist the shareholders in assessing the Group’s strategies 
and the potential of those strategies. It should not be relied on by any other party for any other purpose. Forward-looking statements have 
been made by the directors in good faith using information available up to the date of this report and such statements should be regarded 
with caution because of the inherent uncertainties in economic trends and business risks. Since the end of the financial year no important 
events affecting the business of the Group have occurred.
Dividends
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 12.1p (2016: 10.8p) bringing the total ordinary dividend to 17 .4p per share (2016: 15.8p). If 
approved by shareholders, the final dividend of 12.1p per share will be paid on 1 June 2018 to all shareholders on the register at the close  
of business on 20 April 2018. A special dividend of 25.0p has also been proposed and will be subject to shareholder approval. If approved, it 
will be paid on 1 June 2018.
Share capital
The Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 31 December 2017 was £33.1m. No shares were issued during the year. At the AGM 
on 17 May 2017 the shareholders authorised the Company to purchase up to 22,046,468 of its own shares. This authority expires at the 
conclusion of the forthcoming AGM to be held on 30 May 2018, at which time a further authority will be sought from shareholders.
Capital structure
Details of the issued share capital are shown in note 22. The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which carries no right to fixed 
income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company. There are no specific restrictions on the size of a 
holding nor on the transfer of shares, both of which are governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing 
legislation. The directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or on voting rights. Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 26 and shares held by the Bodycote 
Employee Benefit Trust abstain from voting and waive dividend rights. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. The appointment and replacement of directors is governed by the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act and related legislation. The Articles of Association may be amended  
by a special resolution of shareholders. The powers of the directors are described in the Corporate governance statement on page 42. 
Under the Articles of Association the Company has authority to issue ordinary shares with a nominal value of £11,023,234.
There are also a number of other agreements that take effect, alter, crystallise or terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid such as commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease agreements, employment contracts and 
employee share plans. None of these are considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as 
a whole, and the directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and themselves or employees that provide for 
compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid except where specifically mentioned in this report.
Directors
The current directors and their biographical details are listed on page 36 to 37 and all served throughout the year. A.M. Thomson retired 
as Chairman and Non-Executive Director as of 31 December 2017 and was replaced by A.C. Quinn as of 1 January 2018. A further Non-
Executive Director, L. Chahbazi was appointed effective 1 January 2018. Under the Articles of Association of the Company each director 
must retire from office and stand for re-election by shareholders as a minimum at every third AGM in order to continue to serve as a 
director. However, in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code and to further increase accountability, all directors retired at the AGM 
in 2017 and stood for re-election by the shareholders. Going forward all directors will retire at the AGM and will stand for re-election by the 
shareholders, if they wish to continue to serve as directors of the Company. Accordingly, those directors retiring and offering themselves 
for re-election at the 2018 AGM are S.C. Harris, I.B. Duncan, E. Lindqvist, P . Larmon and D. Yates. Since A.C. Quinn and L. Chahbazi were 
appointed after the AGM in 2017 , both will stand for election at the AGM in May 2018. The service agreements for Messrs S.C. Harris 
and D. Yates are terminable by 12 months’ notice. The remaining directors do not have a service agreement with the Company and their 
appointments are terminable by six months’ notice.
Directors’ interests in contracts and shares
Details of the executive directors’ service contracts and details of the directors’ interests in the Company’s shares and share incentive 
plans are shown in the Board report on remuneration on pages 54 to 75. No director has had any dealings in any shares or options in the 
Company since 31 December 2017 . Qualifying third party indemnity provision (as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) has 
remained in force for the directors for the year ended 31 December 2017 and, as at the date of this report, remains in force for the benefit 
of the current directors in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may incur (or have incurred) to third parties in the course of 
their duties. Apart from these exceptions, none of the directors had a material interest in any contract of significance in relation to the 
Company and its subsidiaries at any time during the financial year.

Potential conflicts of interest
During 2008 the duties owed by directors to a company were codified and extended by the Companies Act 2006 so that directors not 
only had to declare actual conflicts of interests in transactions as they arose, but also had a duty to avoid such conflicts whether real 
or potential. Potential conflicts of interest could arise where a single director owes a fiduciary duty to more than one organisation (a 
“Situational Conflict”) which typically will be the case where a director holds directorships in more than one company. In order to ensure 
that each director was complying with the duties, each director provided the Company with a formal declaration to disclose what Situational 
Conflicts affected him or her. The Board reviewed the declarations and approved the existence of each declared Situational Conflict up 
until September 2019 and permitted each affected director to attend and vote at Bodycote directors’ meetings, on the basis that each such 
director continued to keep Bodycote’s information confidential, and provided overall that such authorisation remained appropriate and in the 
interests of shareholders. Where such authorisation becomes inappropriate or not in the interests of Bodycote shareholders, the Chairman 
or the Nomination Committee can revoke an authorisation. No such revocations have been made.
Employment
The Group recognises the value that can be added to its future profitability and strength by the efforts of employees. The commitment of 
employees to excel is key to the Group’s continued success. Through their attendance at or participation in strategy, production, safety and 
health meetings at site level, employees are kept up to date with the performance and progress of the Group, the contribution to the Group 
made by their site, and are advised of safety and health issues. Under the Group’s Open Door Line employees’ concerns can be voiced over 
the phone on an anonymous basis in the local language. Approximately 3,600 Bodycote employees are connected to the Bodycote intranet, 
which improves knowledge of Group activities, and assists greatly with technology exchange and co-ordination. It is the Group’s policy to 
give full and fair consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities, 
and to encourage the training and career development of all personnel employed by the Group, including disabled persons. Should an 
employee become disabled, the Group, where practicable, will seek to continue the employment and arrange appropriate training.  
An equal opportunities policy is in operation in the Group.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Details of greenhouse gas emissions are included within the Corporate responsibility and sustainability section of this report. 
Donations
There were no political contributions in 2016 or 2017 .
Shareholders
An analysis of the Company’s shareholders and the shares in issue at 21 February 2018 together with details of the interests of major 
shareholders in voting shares notified to the Company pursuant to chapter 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules are given on 
page 143.
Auditor
In accordance with the provisions of section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution for the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor 
is to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Each person who is a director at the date of approval of this Annual Report 
confirms that:
■ ■ so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
■ ■ each director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a director to make himself or herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This statement is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Annual General Meeting
The 2018 Annual General Meeting will be held on 30 May 2018 in accordance with the notice being sent to shareholders with this report.

Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to introduce the Nomination Committee report for 2017 . The Committee’s key objective is to support the Board in fulfilling 
its responsibilities to ensure there is a formal, rigorous and transparent process for the appointment of new directors to the Board and to 
ensure that effective succession planning processes are in place across the Group. 
This was a busy year for the Committee. In addition to its main responsibilities, the Committee oversaw the process of appointing a new 
Chairman and a new Non-Executive Director. Alan Thomson, Chairman, retired on 31 December 2017 after more than nine years of service.  
Lili Chahbazi was appointed Non-executive director on 1 January 2018 at the same time as I took over as Chairman from Alan. The 
Committee will continue to focus on ensuring that the present and future composition of the Board is appropriate for the delivery of  
the Group’s strategy and that all relevant UK Corporate Governance Code requirements continue to be met.
A. C. Quinn
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
Role of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is a sub-committee 
of the Board, whose principal purpose is to advise 
on the appointment and, if necessary, dismissal 
of executive and non-executive directors. The 
Committee’s terms of reference, which are listed on 
the Group’s website, include all matters required by 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”). 
Further information on the Code can be found on 
the Financial Reporting Council’s website www.
frc.org.uk. The terms of reference are reviewed 
annually by the Group Company Secretary and the 
Chairman, and any changes are then referred to the 
Board for approval. No changes were made to the 
terms of reference during the year. 
Composition of the  
Nomination Committee
As recommended by the Code, the Chairman of 
the Board acts as the Chairman of the Committee 
whose members also comprise the directors listed 
above. The Chairman cannot chair the Committee 
when it is dealing with either the succession to 
the Chairmanship of the Group or the review 
of his or her own performance. Only members 
of the Committee have the right to attend the 
Committee meetings. Other individuals and external 
advisers may be invited to attend for all, or part of, 
any meeting when it is appropriate. The quorum 
necessary for the transaction of business is two.
The Group Company Secretary is secretary to the 
Committee.
The Committee has the authority to seek any 
information that is required, from any officer or 
employee of the Company or its subsidiaries. 
In connection with its duties, the Committee is 
authorised by the Board to take such independent 
advice (including legal or other professional advice, 
at the Group’s expense) as it considers necessary, 
including requests for information from, or 
commissioning investigations by, external advisers.

Director appointment policy and progress
The Committee has developed a formal rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors. Prior to making any 
appointment, the Committee, having evaluated the skills, experience and diversity of the Board, will determine the qualities and experience 
they seek and will then prepare a detailed description of the role with a view to appointing the most appropriate candidate. The Committee 
will use open advertising or the services of independent external advisers to facilitate the search.
A long list of candidates will be drawn up, from which an appropriate number will be selected for interview. Upon completion the 
Committee will recommend to the Board the appointment of the preferred candidate.
Board succession planning
Upon the retirement of A.M. Thomson on 31 December 2017 , he was replaced by A.C. Quinn as Chairman as of 1 January 2018. The 
recruitment process was led by the Senior Independent Director, I.B. Duncan. Ian was advised by international search consultancy Zygos 
in the process of identifying suitably qualified individuals. Lili Chahbazi joined the Board as a non-executive director on 1 January 2018 
and A.M. Thomson was advised by international search consultancy Russell Reynolds. Neither Zygos nor Russell Reynolds have other 
connections to Bodycote plc. 
Main activities of the Nomination Committee
In 2017 the Committee formally met seven times and reviewed the composition and skills 
of the Board, with a view to considering the current and future skills and experience that the 
Board might require.
The Committee discussed succession planning and Board diversity, and reviewed the 
performance of the Group Chief Executive and other senior executives. In particular, the need  
to broaden the Board membership with respect to gender, ethnicity and age was discussed. The 
Committee has sought to ensure that appointments are of the best candidates to promote the 
success of the Company and are based on merit, with due regard for the benefits of diversity 
on the Board. Further information concerning Board diversity can be found on page 39 as part of 
the corporate governance report. We are pleased to report that as of 1 January 2018 the female 
representation on the Board has risen to 43% compared to 17% in 2017 .
The Committee considered and authorised the potential conflicts of interest which might 
arise where a director has fiduciary responsibilities in respect of other organisations. The 
Committee concluded that no inappropriate conflicts of interest exist. The Committee also 
assigned the Chairman to review and agree with the Group Chief Executive his personal 
objectives for the forthcoming year.
Following the external Board evaluation in 2015, the Board agreed to undertake an internal 
evaluation during 2017 . Further details of the review can be found in the Corporate Governance 
section of the Annual Report. Recommendations arising from the 2017 Board evaluation are in 
the process of being addressed.
In our 2017 AGM results announcement we stated that Eva Lindqvist had confirmed to 
reduce her number of directorships with listed companies. Consequently, Eva will not stand 
for re-election at three listed companies: Caverion Oy in March 2018, Assa Abloy AB in April 
2018 and Alimak Holding in May 2018. This will reduce Eva’s other directorships to five. In our 
view, this enables Eva to allocate sufficient time to Bodycote to discharge her responsibilities 
effectively.
In December 2017 the Nomination Committee reviewed the Board’s size and composition, the frequency of the process for Board and 
Committee meetings, and best practice for dealing with Board issues including drawing up a training and/or induction programme for 
the directors. The terms of reference of the Committee were reviewed in conjunction with the Model Terms of Reference issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. The biographical details of the current directors can be found on pages 36 and 37 . The 
Committee, having reviewed their independence and contribution to Board matters, confirms that the performance of each of the directors 
standing for re-election at this year’s AGM continues to be effective and demonstrates commitment to their roles, including independence 
of judgement and time commitment for Board and Committee meetings. Accordingly the Committee has recommended to the Board that 
all current directors of the Company be proposed for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. 
As Chairman of the Committee, I will be available at the AGM in May 2018 to answer questions relating to the work of the Committee.

Introduction
The Committee has continued to focus on the integrity of Bodycote’s financial reporting, risk management and internal controls and on 
the quality of the external and internal audit processes. The Committee will continue to keep our activities under review as the regulatory 
environment changes.
Membership
The members of the Audit Committee are all independent non-executive directors. Their biographical details are shown on pages 36 to 37 
and their remuneration on page 59. The Group Company Secretary is the secretary to the Audit Committee. 
I.B. Duncan is Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Board considers that I.B. Duncan has recent and relevant financial experience. He 
qualified as a Chartered Accountant with Deloitte & Touche, served as a plc Finance Director (Royal Mail Holdings plc 2006-2010) and has 
chaired the Audit Committee of several other publicly listed companies. 
Other members of the Committee have significant and widespread experience in both executive and non-executive capacities in 
multinational industrial companies. Accordingly, all members of the Audit Committee are considered to have competence relevant to their 
duties.
Objective
The Committee’s objective is to provide effective governance over the Group’s financial reporting, including the adequacy of related disclosures, 
the management and oversight of the Group’s systems of internal control, financial risks and the performance of internal audit and the 
appointment and performance of the external auditor.
Committee meetings
The Audit Committee met four times during 2017 and in March 2018 and all members attended all the meetings. The Committee Chairman 
also invited the Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Group Financial Controller and Group Head of Risk (who is 
responsible for internal audit) to attend all meetings. Other executives from the Group were also invited, as appropriate, to attend certain 
meetings to provide a deeper level of insight into key issues. The Committee Chairman also invited the external auditor, Deloitte LLP 
(“Deloitte”), to every meeting. 
I.B. Duncan also held preparatory meetings separately with Deloitte, the Group Financial Controller and the Group Head of Risk prior 
to Committee meetings to review their reports and discuss issues in detail. Both the external and internal auditors met with the Audit 
Committee without the executives present.

Main activities of the Committee during the year
As part of the process of working with the Board to carry out its responsibilities and to maximise effectiveness, meetings of the Committee 
generally take place just prior to Board meetings.
At its meetings, the Committee focused on the following main areas:
Financial reporting 
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial reporting has been to review, with management and the external auditor,  
the appropriateness of the interim and annual financial statements concentrating on, amongst other matters:
■ ■ the quality and acceptability of accounting policies and practices;
■ ■ the application and impact of significant judgements or matters where there was significant discussion with the external auditor;
■ ■ the clarity of disclosures and compliance with Financial Reporting Standards; and
■ ■ whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s strategy, business model and performance.
Reports from management were considered on significant matters, including in respect of litigation, treasury and tax matters and also 
reports from the external auditor on the outcome of their work. The Committee challenged both management and Deloitte to ensure that 
the scope of the audit was appropriate and that Deloitte had applied the necessary level of professional scepticism in their work. 
Areas of focus
The areas of focus considered by the Committee in relation to the 2017 Annual Report included the following:
■ ■ Impairment of goodwill. The Committee challenged the future forecast underlying the value in use calculation, and the assumptions, 
particularly the discount rate and growth factors, used in the discounted cash flow calculations for each cash generating unit, the 
sensitivity analysis applied and the projected future cash flows used to support the carrying values of the goodwill. Details of sensitivity 
analysis applied to key assumptions used in the impairment review are set out in note 11 to the Financial Statements on page 108. The 
Committee has concluded that no impairment charge is required in the year.
■ ■ Restructuring, reorganisation and environmental provisions. The Committee received reports, including from professional advisers, and 
challenged the basis and completeness of the assumptions used to calculate the provisions and the appropriateness of disclosures in 
the Report. The Committee discussed with management the key judgements behind provisions, taking note of the range of possible 
outcomes, and agreed with their recommendations.
■ ■ Taxation. A number of judgements are involved in calculating tax provisions and the level of deferred tax assets to be recognised. The 
Committee reviewed associated risks and challenged management’s assessment concerning the Group’s key tax risks, noting the  
work of the OECD in respect of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), and management’s forecast of the future taxable profits of  
the relevant businesses.
■ ■ Viability Statement. The Committee challenged the validity of the assumptions used in the preparation of the three year strategic plan, 
used as the basis of the assessment of the longer-term viability of the Group, in particular considering the Group’s forecast for profits 
and cash generation, its liquidity position, available borrowing facilities and covenant compliance. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken  
to consider the impact of certain risks and to understand the impact of changes to all key variables.
■ ■ Going concern. The Committee challenged the validity of the going concern assumption used in the preparation of the Annual Report, 
in particular considering the Group’s forecast for profits and cash generation, its liquidity position, available borrowing facilities and 
covenant compliance. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to understand the impact of changes to key variables.
■ ■ Pension liabilities. Management took external professional advice in determining pension liabilities. The Committee challenged the 
assumptions used, particularly in respect of inflation, the discount rate, life expectancy and the application of IFRIC 14 to the UK pension 
scheme, by considering current norms and the sensitivity of the reported liability to changes in the assumptions.
Risk management
The Committee reviewed a report at each meeting from the Group Head of Risk who has primary responsibility for developing the Group’s 
risk management framework. The Committee reviewed changes to the principal risks and mitigating actions identified by management. The 
Committee also received quarterly reports on issues raised via the Open Door Line (an external independent service where employees may 
report matters of concern) and assessed both how such calls are dealt with and whether there was any indication of material risk. During 2017 
there were 15 Open Door Cases, all of which were investigated and closed during the year, with appropriate action taken where necessary.
Internal control
At each meeting the Committee considered and challenged reports from the internal auditors on the effectiveness of internal controls. 
The Committee also performed an annual review of the Group’s internal control processes and considers the system to be effective and in 
accordance with the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting as issued by the FRC 
(September 2014).
Internal audit
The internal audit plan for 2018 was presented to the Committee in October 2017 and accepted following discussions and challenge as to 
the scope and areas of focus. At each meeting the Group Head of Risk presented a report to the Committee on the status of internal audit 
plans for the current year, points arising from audits completed and follow up action plans to address areas of weakness. The status of 
these actions is monitored closely by the Committee until they are completed. The Committee also received reports on actual or suspected 
frauds and thefts by third parties and employees. None had any material financial impact on the Group and, where necessary, systems and 
procedures were altered to minimise the risk of recurrence.

External audit
At the May and October meetings the external auditor presented their audit plans for the interim review and year-end audit respectively. The 
Committee considered and challenged both the scope and materiality to be applied to the Group audit and its components. The Committee 
considered carefully the scope in respect of smaller and more remote locations and noted that the majority of local audits are undertaken 
by Deloitte.
T raining
Updates were presented to the Committee on new accounting developments and any changes in corporate governance requirements that 
may affect the Group. Committee members also attended training briefings by accounting firms and other advisers.
Overview
The Committee examined the 2017 Annual Report and was specifically tasked by the Board to advise it on whether the 2017 Annual Report 
is fair, balanced and understandable. The Committee did this by satisfying itself that there was a robust process of review and challenge to 
ensure balance and consistency. In doing so the Committee examined these processes, which included the allocation of responsibility for 
the preparation of certain sections of the Annual Report to individuals in the head office team and a second person taking responsibility for 
the review process of each section of the Annual Report. Additional reviews were carried out by internal and external personnel including  
an independent legal review.
The Committee also reviewed the Annual Report. Taken as a whole, in the light of their knowledge of the Group and its performance, the 
outcome of the activities described above and based on robust discussion with both management and the external auditor, the Committee 
has concluded that it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
strategy, business model, position and performance, and reported to the Board accordingly.
External audit
Appointment
The Committee considers the re-appointment of the external auditor each year and as part of this process considers the independence of 
the auditor and the effectiveness of the external audit process. Having reviewed the performance of Deloitte in 2017 , the Committee has 
decided to recommend to the Board that Deloitte be reappointed for the 2018 audit and a resolution to this effect will be put to the 2018 
AGM. The Committee reviewed and agreed the fee for 2017 .
The external auditor is required to change the lead partner every five years and other partners periodically in order to protect independence 
and objectivity and provide fresh challenge to the Group. Mr M. Mullins has been lead partner since 2015.
Deloitte has been the Group’s auditor for 16 years.
In accordance with the transition arrangements of the Competition and Markets Authority Audit order, the Group has until 2023 to hold  
a competitive tender for external audit services; it is the intention of the Group to hold a competitive tender, at a time which coincides  
with the next change of the lead audit partner, as the committee believes that the audit partner’s knowledge of the business contributes  
to the quality of the audit process.
The Group complies with the provisions of the “Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation Order 2014” .
Independence
The independence of the external auditor has been confirmed by Deloitte every half year and was last confirmed in March 2018. The 
Committee considered Deloitte’s presentation and confirmed that it considered the auditor to be independent.
Significant controls surrounding the financial reporting process
The Group operates under a system of internal controls which have been developed and refined over time to meet its needs and the risks 
to which it is exposed. This includes: 
■ ■ preparation of the Strategic Plan; 
■ ■ comprehensive budgeting process with an annual budget which is approved by the Board; 
■ ■ quarterly review and revision of financial forecasts for the year; 
■ ■ monthly monitoring of financial performance; 
■ ■ recruitment of suitably qualified staff for the Group’s administrative offices, shared services centres and regional accounting centres;
■ ■ provision of appropriate IT and reporting systems; and 
■ ■ appropriate delegation of authority to operational management. 
Delegations and other Group corporate and financial policies are maintained on the Group intranet. An annual representation letter from all 
business unit Presidents and Vice Presidents of Finance, with regard to the financial reporting process and the veracity of the information 
they have submitted, is provided to the Committee.

Effectiveness of the external audit process
The Committee has adopted a formal framework for the review of the effectiveness of the external audit process and audit quality which 
includes the following aspects:
■ ■ assessment of the engagement partner, other partners and the audit team;
■ ■ audit approach and scope, including identification of risk areas;
■ ■ execution of the audit;
■ ■ interaction with management;
■ ■ communication with and support to the Audit Committee;
■ ■ insights, management letter points, added value and reports; and 
■ ■ independence, objectivity and scepticism.
An assessment questionnaire was completed by each member of the Committee, the Chief Financial Officer and other senior finance 
executives. The feedback from the process is considered by the Audit Committee and provided to the external auditor and management. 
The full formal questionnaire is completed every three years with key areas being completed every year.
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of management in the external audit process by considering timely identification and resolution 
of areas of accounting judgement, the quality and timeliness of papers analysing those judgements and other documents provided for 
review by the external auditor and the Committee.
The Committee considered the FRC Audit Quality Review Team report on Deloitte LLP dated June 2017 . If the audit is selected for quality 
review, the Committee understands that any resulting reports will be sent to the Committee by the FRC. After considering the above 
matters, the Committee felt that the external audit had been effective.
Non-audit services 
The external auditor may be invited to provide services where their position as auditor renders them best placed to undertake the work. 
Financial due diligence, taxation, internal audit, and actuarial services are not typically contracted to the external auditor. No contracts in excess 
of £20,000 can be awarded to the external auditor without prior approval from the Chairman of the Committee or, in his absence, another 
member of the Committee. Non-audit fees paid to the auditor are shown in note 3 on page 104 and amounted to 11% of the audit fee.
The review of the Group’s Interim report was the only significant non-audit engagement undertaken by the external auditor. Given the 
external auditor’s detailed knowledge of the Group, the Audit Committee believes that it is in the interests of the Group that the external 
auditor performs this review.
Internal audit
The internal audit programme is managed by the Group Head of Risk and provides independent assurance over the key financial processes 
and controls in operation across the Group. The Group has engaged Ernst & Young LLP (”EY”) to provide certain internal audit services. The 
Committee reviewed and approved the annual internal audit plan before the start of the financial year and considered it appropriate to retain 
EY as an internal audit service provider. The plan takes account of the Group’s strategic objectives and risks and provides the degree of 
coverage deemed appropriate by the Committee.
Additional assurance has been obtained through control self-assessment. Internal auditors have received self-certification from every 
plant and shared service centre that internal controls have been complied with and noting any non-compliance. A summary of results is 
presented to the Committee. The accuracy of returns is monitored by Internal Audit by verification visits to a random sample of sites.
The effectiveness of internal audit is reviewed and discussed annually with the Group Head of Risk and the EY engagement partner. 
An assessment questionnaire was completed by each member of the Committee, the Chief Financial Officer and other senior finance 
executives. The views of senior operational management have also been canvassed. The review takes into account the views of directors 
and senior management on matters such as independence, proficiency, resourcing and audit strategy, planning and methodology. On the 
appointment of a new engagement partner the Committee assesses the experience and expertise of the partner and other senior staff 
members. Audit quality is assured through a detailed review of each report being carried out by the Group Head of Risk, and a summary of 
each report’s findings being reviewed by the Audit Committee. The review confirmed that the internal audit function was independent and 
objective and remained an effective element of the Group’s corporate governance framework.
Committee evaluation
The Committee’s activities formed part of an internal review of Board effectiveness which was undertaken in July and August 2017 and 
approved by the Board in September 2017 . There were no material deficiencies noted in the review and directors indicated a high level of 
satisfaction with the work of the Committee. Based on this, and as a result of the work done during the year, the Committee has concluded 
that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference and carried out its responsibilities effectively.

Chair’s letter
As Chair of the Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) and on behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to present our Board 
report on remuneration for the 2017 financial year, in line with the requirements of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013.
Structure of report
This year we have restructured our report to support greater transparency and ease of use. We have included a new ‘at a glance’ section 
presenting the key outcomes for 2017 , and have brought our ‘implementation of policy in 2018’ section to the front of the report to make  
it easier for our readers to see our intended approach in 2018. The main body of the report includes the following sections:
■ ■ Section A: This describes how the existing policy, approved at the 2016 AGM, was implemented in 2017;
■ ■ Section B: This summarises the remuneration policy of the Board with regard to the remuneration of the directors. The full remuneration 
policy, as approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2016, is also available on our website in the 2015 Annual Report at  
www.bodycote.com/en/investors/reports-and-results/2015.aspx
Wider workforce considerations and approach to remuneration
Our approach to remuneration emphasises simplicity, with strong alignment to our strategic priorities. We recognise that the emerging 
governance environment places an increased importance on consideration of pay and conditions in the wider workforce. Following the 
anticipated release of revisions to the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Committee will review its approach to considering wider 
workforce reward, and how the views of employees and other stakeholders input to our decisions.
Business performance and incentive outcomes for 2017
Bodycote has performed strongly through 2017 , with a top line revenue growth of 9.6% at constant currencies. The Group’s general 
industrial markets performed particularly strongly, with a return to growth after a multi-year negative trend.
Annual bonus
Improved profitability alongside tight controls on working capital and a focus on higher value added businesses have enabled us to deliver  
a headline operating profit of £123.9m (an increase of 24% on 2016) together with a headline operating cash flow of £111 .7m. Our bonus  
is based on these metrics, and therefore performance was above maximum under the profit measure and under the cash flow measure. 
The annual bonus is also, in part, based upon the achievement of personal objectives which relate to the strategic focus of the Company  
such as growth in emerging markets and Specialist Technologies, against which the CEO performed at 84% of maximum, and the CFO at 
70%. 
Overall the bonus therefore paid out at 97 .9% of maximum for the CEO and 96.1% of maximum for the CFO, of which 35% and 23% for 
the CEO and the CFO respectively, will be deferred into shares for three years, in line with our approved policy for bonus deferral.
Long term incentive
The Company’s principal long term incentive, the Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP) is based on performance against return on capital employed 
(ROCE) and earnings per share (EPS) targets over a three year period. Our ongoing focus on operating efficiency, margins, and targeted 
investments in high growth markets has supported earnings development over the three year period despite the challenging environment. 
Strong returns have also been delivered, helped by the focus on capital investment in specialist markets and performance was achieved at 
48.2% of maximum.
The 2014 Co-Investment Plan (CIP) is based on absolute total shareholder returns growth, and the TSR CAGR value of 5.4% we have 
delivered over the three year performance period is reflected in a vesting under this plan of 54.2%. No awards have been made under the 
CIP since 2015, and so this is the penultimate vesting for this plan.
Note that David Landless, our former Finance Director, will receive pay-outs from these incentives pro-rated for the proportion of the 
performance period for which he was in the role.

Application of the policy for 2018
The Committee continues to operate within the Remuneration Policy agreed at the 2016 AGM. We set out below a brief overview of how 
the policy will be applied in the year ahead:
■ ■ Base salaries: An increase of 2.9% will be applied to the base salaries of the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer with 
effect from 1 January 2018, in line with inflation. 
■ ■ Benefits and pension: There will be no changes to benefits and pension during 2018.
■ ■ Annual bonus: The maximum bonus opportunity remains 200% of salary for the CEO and 150% of salary for the CFO, with 35% of any 
bonus paid being deferred in shares for three years following conclusion of our transitional deferral arrangements. The measures and 
weightings used have been reviewed and we believe a bonus consisting of 77% headline operating profit, 10% headline operating cash 
management and 13% personal objectives continues to enable the annual bonus to be aligned to the Company’s strategy and ensures 
our executives are focussed on delivery of improved profitability and control on working capital.
■ ■ Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP): Award levels will remain 175% of salary for Executive Directors. Similarly, measures and weightings 
have been reviewed and we believe the equal focus on returns and earnings is strongly aligned with our strategic priorities. The growth 
of our business and our ability to deliver strong and sustainable returns to investors is based on delivery of an effective deployment of 
capital in rapid growth areas and bolt-on acquisitions. ROCE and EPS metrics will ensure strong alignment between these strategic 
goals and the reward of our executives over the longer term. 
Non-Executive Director changes
On 30 March 2017 , Alan Thomson informed the Board of his intention to retire as Chairman and on 31 October 2017 we announced the 
appointment of Anne Quinn CBE as Non-Executive Chairman with effect from 1 January 2018. Alan Thomson stepped down as Chairman 
and retired as a director on 31 December 2017 . As of 1 January 2018 we have appointed an additional Non-Executive Director, Lili Chahbazi.
At the March 2017 meeting of the Remuneration Committee, it was agreed that the fee paid to the Non-Executive Chairman would 
be increased from its 2016 level of £169,125 to £200,000. In determining the appropriate fee level the Committee considered market 
benchmarking against the FTSE 250 and other companies of comparable size and complexity in line with our approved policy set out 
in Section B of this report. The Committee sought to ensure the revised fee was sufficiently competitive to support the attraction and 
retention of a Chairman of suitably high calibre and experience to support our leadership as our Company continues to evolve. The fee 
agreed as of 1 January 2018 for the new Non-Executive Chairman, Anne Quinn, was £225,000.
I trust the information presented in this report enables our shareholders to understand both how we have operated our remuneration policy 
over the year and the rationale for our decision making. We remain fully committed to continuing an open and transparent dialogue with our 
shareholders. I would welcome your views on the content of this report or any other items you would like to discuss and I look forward to 
meeting you and answering any questions you may have at the AGM.

The 2017 annual bonus was based on three elements – headline operating profit, headline cash management and personal objectives.

Legacy Co-Investment Plan (CIP)
Until 2015 Executive Directors were invited annually to purchase shares up to 40% of basic salary (net of tax) against which performance 
based matching shares are granted on a 1:1 basis. CIP awards are subject to an absolute TSR target. No further awards will be made under 
this plan. The CIP awards made in 2014 had a three-year performance period ending on 30 April 2017 . The absolute TSR performance targets 
applicable to this award are set out below. 
Absolute TSR performance target Vesting level
4% CAGR + CPI 50% (0.5:1 match)
10% CAGR + CPI 100% (1:1 match)
Over the three-year period, the Group achieved absolute annual TSR growth of 5.4%, reflecting the value we have delivered to our 
shareholders over this period. This performance resulted in a vesting of 54.2% under the plan. The number and value of shares which 
vested for S.C. Harris is set out on page 61 . As D.F . Landless is no longer an Executive Director, vesting under this plan to him is set out 
under payments to past directors.
Shareholding requirements
Executive Directors and other senior executives are expected, within five years of appointment, to build up a shareholding in the Company. 
For the purposes of this requirement, only beneficially-owned shares and the value of deferred shares under the annual bonus will be 
counted. The table below sets out the minimum shareholding requirements, as a percentage of salary, for the Chief Executive and for the 
Chief Financial Officer, noting that Mr Yates has reached his holding requirement.

Element of pay Implementation for 2018
T otal salary Base salaries are reviewed on an annual basis.
S.C. Harris will receive a salary of £541,923 in 2018, an increase of 2.9% (2017: £526,650).
D. Yates will receive a salary of £391,020 in 2018, an increase of 2.9% (2017: £380,000).
Note that Non-Executive Director fees will next be reviewed at the March 2018 meeting of the Committee, and the 
outcome of this review will be disclosed in the following years’ report.
Pension and benefits No changes proposed. 
Executive Directors receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension at a rate of 25% of base salary.
Annual bonus No change to maximum opportunity: 200% of base salary for CEO, 150% of base salary for CFO.
The performance measures and their relative weightings also remain unchanged: 77% operating profit, 10% 
operating cash management and 13% personal objectives.
The Committee reviews the performance measures and targets on an annual basis to ensure that they remain 
appropriately aligned to the overall business strategy but do not encourage excessive risk taking. 
The Committee has determined that performance targets will not be disclosed on a prospective basis for reasons of 
commercial sensitivity, but will be disclosed on a retrospective basis in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration 
to the extent that the Committee determines that the measures are no longer commercially sensitive.
Bodycote Incentive 
Plan (BIP)
No change to maximum opportunity: 175% of base salary for Executive Directors.
The performance measures and their relative weightings also remain unchanged: 50% ROCE and 50% headline EPS.
The targets for the 2018 BIP awards are disclosed below and ensure that the Committee are able to deliver upper 
quartile reward for upper quartile performance.

Illustration of application of remuneration policy for 2018
The remuneration package for the Executive Directors is designed to provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
performance-related components. The Committee is satisfied that the composition and structure of the remuneration package is 
appropriate, clearly supports the Company’s strategic ambitions and does not incentivise inappropriate risk taking. This is reviewed on an 
annual basis. The composition and value of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages should they achieve below, at or above target 
performance are set out in the charts below.

Incentive outcomes for 2017
Annual performance related bonus 
£
The table below provides the details of the annual bonus awards received in respect of the Group and individual performances in the 2017 
financial year.
The annual bonus potential for the period to 31 December 2017 for Executive Directors was split 77% in respect of Group headline 
operating profit, 10% on Group headline operating cash flow and 13% on personal strategic objectives. These performance conditions 
and their respective weightings reflected the Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation should be linked both to the overall 
performance of the Group and to those areas of the business that the relevant individual can directly influence. 
Stretching targets were set in the context of the challenging market conditions we faced and the investments that were planned in the year. 
Following strong performance in 2017 , the bonus paid out at 97 .9% for the CEO and 96.1% for the CFO, 35% and 23% of the award will be 
deferred in shares, for the CEO and the CFO respectively. The performance targets and actual performance are set out below.

weighting for 2017 , and are unchanged on those used in 2016.
The Committee assessed the performance of the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer against their personal objectives. 
For the CEO these included targets relating to safety, focus on driving growth in emerging markets and in Specialist Technologies, 
implementation of sales strategy, and maintaining market capitalisation. For the CFO targets included implementation of major IT and 
finance process projects. The Committee concluded that personal strategic objectives were achieved at a level of 84% of the maximum 
award for the CEO. The CFO achieved 70% of maximum. 
Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP) 
BIP awards made in 2015 had a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2017 , after which they will vest immediately, with 
50% of the award subject to satisfaction of a ROCE target and 50% subject to the headline earnings per share (EPS) target. 
Over this period our share price has increased by 41%, demonstrating the strength of the returns we have made to shareholders. The 
threshold and maximum targets along with the vesting schedule are set out in the tables below.

If headline EPS at the end of the performance period was below 41 .8p, then no awards will vest. Over the period, ROCE was 19.8% and the 
headline EPS figure for the year was 49.2p.

Legacy Co-Investment Plan (CIP)
As described in Section B: Directors’ Remuneration Policy, CIP awards are subject to an absolute TSR target. Executive Directors were 
invited to purchase shares up to 40% of basic salary (net of tax) against which performance based matching shares are granted on a 1:1 
basis. The CIP awards made in 2014 had a three-year performance period ending on 30 April 2017 , and vested on 31 May 2017 . The absolute 
TSR performance targets applicable to this award are set out below. 
Absolute TSR performance target Vesting level
4% CAGR + CPI 50% (0.5:1 match)
10% CAGR + CPI 100% (1:1 match)
Over the three-year period, the Group achieved absolute annual TSR growth of 5.4%. This strong return to shareholders over the period is 
reflected in the vesting of 54.2% under the CIP . Note that awards are no longer made under the CIP .
The number of shares which vested for S.C. Harris is set out below. As D.F Landless is no longer an Executive Director, vesting under this 
plan to him is set out under payments to past directors.
Scheme interests awarded in the financial year
CIP awards granted during the year
No awards were made under the CIP – the final award was made in 2015 with vesting occurring in May 2018. This plan no longer features in 
the Company’s policy.
BIP awards granted during the year
Awards consisting of conditional shares were granted to both Executive Directors, equivalent in value to 175% of their base salaries on 18 
May 2017 , and will vest after three years in March 2020. The performance period will end on 31 December 2019. Details of the awards are 
set out below. Awards are subject to continued employment and the achievement of ROCE and headline EPS growth performance targets, 
as summarised in the table below. 
The Committee has reviewed the performance targets and these have been revised appropriately to ensure that they remain stretching 
targets which underpin the Group’s objectives. Our long term targets reflect the continued challenges in the wider commercial environment 
but the improved growth we expect to see following our emphasis on operational efficiency and the expansion of our footprint in rapid 
growth territories.

If headline EPS at the end of the performance period is below 27 .0p, then no awards will vest. The Committee has decided that the 
ROCE figure of 23% is a robust aspiration for the Group in view of our expected programme of investments, recognising the potential for 
unintended consequences in terms of short-term capital underinvestment for the business. Dividend equivalents are payable in respect of 
those shares that vest.

Non-Executive Director fees were increased for 2017 based on market benchmarking against Non-Executive Director fees in the FTSE 250 
and other companies of similar size and complexity in line with the Policy set out in Section B of this report.
The Chairman fee for Alan Thomson was increased by 18%. In determining the appropriate fee level the Committee considered market 
benchmarking against the FTSE 250 and other companies of comparable size and complexity in line with our approved policy set out in 
Section B of this report.
* At the 2016 AGM Ian Duncan was appointed Senior Independent Director (SID). His fee for 2016 therefore represents a pro-rated fee covering SID 
responsibilities for 7 months of 2016. The 9% increase shown above represents the difference between this pro-rated fee and the total annual fee including 
the SID role for 2017 . His annualised fee was increased by 3% in line with the Company’s other Non-Executive Directors.
At 31 December 2017 the aggregate annual fee for all Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, was £390,035, which is below the 
maximum aggregate fee allowed by the Company’s Articles of Association of £500,000 p.a.
Board changes in 2017
Payments for loss of office
No payments for loss of office were made in the year. David Landless resigned as an Executive Director as of 1 January 2017 . The 
Remuneration Committee determined that Mr Landless would be treated as a good leaver, and all payments made to Mr Landless were 
within the approved loss of office policy set out in Section B. 
Payments to past directors 
In March 2017 David Landless received a bonus payment relating to the year ending 31 December 2016 amounting to £66,128. This was in 
line with our approved policy and related to his full year of service in 2016, but was paid to Mr Landless in 2017 . 
Under a consultancy agreement following cessation, David Landless agreed to be available to the Company during January and February 
2017 to support Dominique Yates and Stephen Harris through this transitional period and received a fee of £6,000 in exchange for his 
services during the period. No other cash payments were made to Mr Landless.
In June 2017 David Landless received dividend equivalents in connection with the pro-rated vesting of the 2014 CIP amounting to £3,386.
David’s 2015 Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP) and Co-Investment Plan (CIP) awards are to be pro-rated to his leaving date and are subject to 
achievement of performance conditions at the end of the three year performance period. The 2016 BIP award has lapsed. No CIP awards 
were made in 2016 or 2017 . 
2014 CIP (vested on 31 May 2017)
Over the three-year period, the Group achieved absolute TSR growth of 5.4%. This performance resulted in the TSR targets being achieved 
at a level of 54.2%. This meant that the number of pro-rated shares which vested for D.F . Landless was 4,497 at a share price of £7 .78 at the 
date of vesting on 31 May 2017 .
2015 BIP (to vest on 12 March 2018)

Directors’ shareholdings
As described in Section B: Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Board operates a shareholding retention policy under which Executive 
Directors and other senior executives are expected, within five years of appointment, to build up a shareholding in the Company. For the 
purposes of this requirement, only beneficially-owned shares and the net of tax value of deferred shares under the annual bonus (as they 
are not subject to further performance conditions) will be counted. 
The shareholding requirement for the CEO is 200% of salary and for the CFO is 150% of salary.
The interests in ordinary shares of directors and their connected persons as at 31 December 2017 , including any interests awarded under 
the annual bonus, CIP or BIP , are presented below along with whether Executive Directors have met the shareholding guidelines. We note 
that shares under the annual bonus and the BIP are conditional on continued employment until vesting. 
As at 12 March 2018, the interests of the directors were unchanged from those at 31 December 2017 .

Advisers to the Committee
The Committee was advised by PwC during 2017 on remuneration matters including providing advice on matters under consideration by the 
Committee, updates on good practice, legislative requirements and market practice. PwC were appointed by the Remuneration Committee 
in July 2015 following a competitive tender process. PwC’s fees for the year, based on the quantity and complexity of the work undertaken, 
amounted to £44,000. PwC also undertakes tax and accounting work for the Company. PwC is a founding member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Code 
of Conduct can be found at remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the advice provided on 
executive remuneration is objective and independent, and that no conflict of interest arises as a result of these services. The Committee 
reviews the objectivity and independence of the advice it receives from PwC at a private meeting each year. Legal advice was provided by 
Eversheds and fees amounted to £0.1m. All fees are based on the quantity and complexity of work undertaken.
The Committee also received assistance from the Group Chief Executive and Group Company Secretary, although they do not participate 
in discussions relating to the setting of their own remuneration. The Committee in particular consulted with the Group Chief Executive and 
received recommendations from him in respect of his direct reports.

Section B: Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
Remuneration Policy
Bodycote’s Executive Remuneration Policy is to attract and motivate our senior executive team to execute our strategy and deliver value to 
our shareholders while ensuring the Group pays no more than is necessary.
In order to ensure continued alignment between remuneration and the evolving strategic direction of our business, a revised policy was 
approved by our shareholders at the AGM in May 2016. This policy, applicable from the date of the 2016 AGM, is set out below.
Discretion
The Committee has discretion in several areas of policy as set out in this report. The Committee may also exercise operational and 
administrative discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules. In addition, the Committee 
has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, 
disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.
Executive Remuneration Policy
The table below sets out the key components of Executive Directors’ pay packages, including why they are used and how they are operated 
in practice. 
Current Remuneration Policy table
Element and how 
it supports our 
strategy Operation of the element

opportunity under the 
element Performance measures
Base salary
To award competitive 
salaries to attract 
and retain the talent 
required to execute 
the strategy while 
ensuring the Group 
pays no more than is 
necessary.
Base salaries for Executive Directors are 
typically reviewed annually (or more frequently 
if specific circumstances necessitate this) by 
the Committee in December each year.
Salary levels are set and reviewed taking into 
account a number of factors including:
■ ■ Role, experience and performance of the 
executive.
■ ■ The Company’s guidelines for salaries for all 
employees in the Group for the forthcoming 
year.
■ ■ The competitiveness of total remuneration 
assessed against FTSE 250 companies 
and other companies of similar size and 
complexity, as appropriate.
Whilst the Committee 
has not set a maximum 
level of salary, ordinarily, 
salary increases will 
not exceed the average 
increase awarded to 
other Group employees.
Increases may be 
above this level in 
certain exceptional 
circumstances, which 
may, for example, 
include:
■ ■ Increase in scope or 
responsibility.
■ ■ A new Executive 
Director who is being 
moved to market 
positioning over time.
None.

Benefits
Provides market-
competitive benefits at 
an appropriate cost.
The Company provides a range of cash 
benefits and benefits in kind to Executive 
Directors in line with market practice. 
These include the provision of company car 
(or allowance), private medical insurance, 
short- and long-term sick pay and death in 
service cover. This will also extend to the 
reimbursement of taxable work-related 
expenses, such as travel and relocation. 
The provision of other benefits payable to 
an Executive Director is reviewed by the 
Committee on an annual basis to ensure 
appropriateness in terms of the type and level 
of benefits provided.
The Company provides a long-term savings 
vehicle into which the Executive Directors 
may elect to waive a proportion of pension 
allowance.
In the case of non-UK executives, the 
Committee may consider providing additional 
allowances in line with relevant market 
practice.
The Committee has not 
set a maximum level of 
benefit, given that the 
cost of certain benefits 
will depend on the 
individual’s particular 
circumstances. However 
benefits will be set at 
an appropriate level 
against market practice 
and needs for specific 
roles and individual 
circumstances.
None.
Pension
Provides a market-
competitive benefit 
in order to attract the 
talent required to 
execute the strategy 
and provide a market-
competitive level of 
provision for post-
retirement income.
The Group operates a defined contribution 
scheme. Executive Directors are provided 
with a contribution to this scheme or a cash 
allowance of equivalent value. Base salary is 
the only pensionable element of remuneration.
The same general approach applies to all 
employees, although contribution levels vary 
by seniority.
Company contribution (or 
cash equivalent) of up to 
30% of salary.
None.

Annual bonus
To incentivise delivery 
of corporate strategy

and reward delivery of 
superior performance. 
The deferred 
portion of the bonus 
supports longer-term 
shareholder alignment.
The level of bonus paid each year is 
determined by the Committee after the year 
end based on performance against targets.
A portion of the annual bonus is paid in cash 
shortly after the financial year end with the 
remaining portion deferred for three years in 
Bodycote shares (see details below). Vesting 
of the deferred shares is not subject to further 
performance conditions (please see the 2016 
AGM Notice for a summary of the Plan). 
Dividend equivalents are payable in respect of 
the shares which vest.
From 2018 onwards, 35% of any bonus 
earned is deferred into shares for three years, 
conditional on continued employment until 
vesting date.
Transitional treatment applies to deferral for 
2016 and 2017 . For 2016, any bonus earned 
over 130% of base salary is deferred into 
shares. 
For 2017 , 15% of any bonus paid up to a value 
of 130% of base salary is deferred, with 
bonus earned over 130% also deferred in full. 
The deferral above 130% of salary would be 
capped so that no more than 35% of the total 
bonus is deferred.
Malus provisions apply for the duration of the 
performance period and to shares held under 
deferral.
Clawback provisions apply to cash amounts 
paid for three years following payment. 
Malus and/or clawback may be applied in the 
following scenarios:
■ ■ Discovery of a material misstatement 
resulting in an adjustment in the audited 
accounts of the Group or any Group 
Company;
■ ■ The assessment of any performance 
condition or condition was based on error, 
or inaccurate or misleading information; 
■ ■ The discovery that any information used 
to determine the cash payment under the 
bonus or the number of shares subject to 
deferral was based on error, or inaccurate 
or misleading information; or
■ ■ Action or conduct of a participant which 
amounts to fraud or gross misconduct. 
The Committee believes that the rules of the 
Plan provide sufficient powers to enforce 
malus and clawback where required.
The maximum potential 
is 200% of base salary 
for the CEO and 150% 
of base salary for the 
CFO and other Executive 
Directors.
At the threshold 
performance level there 
will normally be no 
more than 30% vesting. 
Awards commence 
vesting progressively 
from this point with 
maximum performance 
resulting in awards 
vesting in full.
The Committee considers the 
performance conditions selected for the 
annual bonus to appropriately support 
the Company’s strategic objectives and 
provide a balance between generating 
profit and cash to enable the Group to 
pay a dividend, reward its employees 
and make future investments; and 
achieve other strategic goals to drive 
long-term sustainable return.
The weighting of the measures and 
specific targets are reviewed on an 
annual basis to ensure alignment to 
strategy and are set to be in line with 
budget. Information on measures and 
weights that will apply for specific years 
will be included in the relevant year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
At least 70% of the bonus will be 
based on the achievement of Group 
financial targets.
The Committee retains discretion 
in exceptional circumstances to 
change performance measures and 
targets and the weightings attached 
to performance measures part-way 
through a performance year if there is 
a significant and material event which 
causes the Committee to believe the 
original measures, weightings and 
targets are no longer appropriate. 
Discretion may also be exercised in cases 
where the Committee believe that the 
bonus outcome is not a fair and accurate 
reflection of business performance. The 
exercise of this discretion may result in 
a downward or upward movement in 
the amount of bonus earned resulting 
from the application of the performance 
measures.
Any adjustments or discretion 
applied by the Committee will be 
fully disclosed in the following year’s 
Remuneration Report.
The Committee is of the opinion that 
given the commercial sensitivity arising 
in relation to the detailed financial 
targets used for the annual bonus, 
disclosing precise targets for the annual 
bonus plan in advance would not be in 
shareholder interests. Actual targets, 
performance achieved and awards 
made will be published at the end of the 
performance periods so shareholders 
can fully assess the basis for any pay-
outs under the annual bonus.

The measures for Executive Directors 
are:
■ ■ 50% ROCE
■ ■ 50% headline EPS
In addition, the vesting of awards may 
only occur if headline EPS is above a 
defined hurdle level.
The Committee considers these 
performance conditions selected for 
the BIP to currently appropriately 
underpin the Company’s strategic 
objectives. Due to the nature 
of the Company’s activities the 
Committee consider ROCE to provide 
shareholders with an appropriate 
measure of how well the Company 
is performing and is being managed, 
while EPS provides a measure of the 
level of value created for shareholders. 
ROCE and EPS are our top two KPIs 
as shown on page 16 of the Annual 
Report.
The Committee may adjust the 
performance measures attaching to 
awards and the weighting of these 
measures if it feels this will create 
greater alignment with business and 
strategic priorities. 
A significant change to the measures 
used would only be adopted following 
consultation with major shareholders.
The targets for the performance 
measures are reviewed on an annual 
basis to ensure alignment to strategy

Notes to the Remuneration Policy table
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that they are not 
in line with the policy set out on pages 66 to 75 where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the policy came into effect or (ii) 
at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company. For these purposes “payments” include the Committee satisfying 
awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment being “agreed” at the time the award is 
granted.
Executive Directors’ remuneration is reviewed annually and takes into account a number of factors. The Company adopts a policy of 
positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not require the Company to pay any 
more than is necessary. Senior and high performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within the organisation are invited to 
participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, which are similar to those offered to the Executive Directors to ensure 
reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.

Maximum opportunity under the 
element Performance measures
Fees for Non-Executive 
Directors
To attract NEDs who 
have a broad range 
of experience and 
skills to oversee the 
implementation of our 
strategy.
The fees for the non-executives are 
determined by the Chairman and the 
Group Chief Executive.
The fee for the Chairman is reviewed 
by the Board in the absence of the 
Chairman. 
The Chairman and non-executive fees 
are reviewed on an annual basis. When 
reviewing fees, the primary source 
of comparative market data is FTSE 
250 companies and other companies 
of similar size and complexity, as 
appropriate. 
The fees for the Chairman and non-
executives are set at a level that will 
attract individuals with the necessary 
experience and ability to make a 
significant contribution to the Group’s 
affairs. The fees reflect the time 
commitment and responsibilities of the 
roles. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors are not entitled to any 
pension or other employment benefits 
or to participate in any incentive 
scheme.
Appropriate benefits may be provided 
to non-executives and the Chairman 
from time to time. The Company will 
pay reasonable expenses incurred 
by the Non-Executive Directors and 
Chairman and may settle any tax 
incurred in relation to these.
Fees for Non-Executive Directors for 
the following year are set out in the 
statement of implementation of policy 
on page 57 .
The Company’s policy is that the 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
receive a fixed fee for their services 
as members of the Board and its 
Committees. The fee structure may 
also include additional fees for chairing 
a Board Committee and/or further 
responsibilities (for example, Senior 
Independent Directorship). 
In line with the Articles of Association, 
accumulative total fees for Non-
Executive Directors are capped at 
£500,000 p.a.
None
Fees retained for external Non-Executive directorships
To broaden the experience of Executive Directors, they may hold positions in other companies as Non-Executive Directors provided that 
permission is sought in advance. Any external appointment must not conflict with the directors’ duties and commitments to Bodycote plc. 
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Company adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not 
require the Company to pay any more than is necessary. Senior and high-performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within 
the organisation are invited to participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, similar to the Executive Directors to ensure 
reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when formulating Executive Director pay policy. However, it does take into 
account information provided by the Human Resources function on pay and conditions across the Company, and considers these as part of 
its discussions and decision making, along with feedback from employee satisfaction surveys.
In formulating Executive Director pay policy, the Committee receives information on all employee pay conditions throughout the Group. The 
Committee does not use any remuneration comparison metrics.
We recognise the Government’s recent commentary in this area, and will ensure that our approach to consideration of employee views and 
pay and conditions across the Company reflect appropriate legislative and corporate governance requirements.

Board report on remuneration continued
Statement of consideration of shareholders’ views
The Committee always welcomes the views of shareholders in respect of pay policy as well as those views expressed on behalf of 
shareholders by their respective proxy advisers. The Committee documents all remuneration related comments made at the Company’s 
AGM and feedback received during consultation with shareholders throughout the year. Any feedback received is fully considered by the 
Committee.
In developing the proposed Remuneration Policy for 2016 and beyond the Remuneration Committee engaged extensively with the 
Company’s key shareholders and their representative bodies. Through this process the Remuneration Committee took on board the 
feedback received and refined the proposed Remuneration Policy as appropriate to ensure it meets the expectations of our shareholders. 
Approach to recruitment remuneration
When recruiting new Executive Directors, the Company’s policy is to pay what is necessary to attract individuals with the skills and 
experience appropriate to the role to be filled, taking into account remuneration across the Group, including other senior executives, and 
that offered by other FTSE 250 companies and other companies of similar size and complexity. New Executive Directors will generally be 
appointed on remuneration packages with the same structure and pay elements as described in the pay policy table on pages 66 to 70. 
Each element of remuneration to be included in the package offered to a new director would be considered separately and collectively in 
this context.
Component Policy
General The Company’s policy is to pay what is necessary to attract individuals with the skills and experience 
appropriate to the role to be filled.
The initial notice period may be longer than the Company’s one year policy (up to a maximum of two years). 
However, this will reduce by one month for every month served, until the Company’s policy position is reached.
Base salary Base salary levels will be set at an appropriate level to recruit the best candidate in consideration of the new 
recruit’s existing salary, location, skills and experience and expected contribution to the new role, the current 
salaries of other Executive Directors in the Company and current market levels for the role.
Other benefits Other benefits will be considered in light of the provision in place for the other Executive Director(s). If it is in 
the best interests of the Company and shareholders, the Committee may consider providing additional benefits, 
potentially including relocation costs, tax equalisation or advisers’ fees.
Pension Pension will be considered in light of the retirement arrangements which are in place for the other Executive 
Director(s) with a contribution level considered by the Committee to be appropriate in light of the new recruit’s 
package as a whole, market practice at the time and on a broadly equivalent basis to existing provisions for 
other executives.
Annual bonus Normal awards will be made under the annual bonus plan in line with the Remuneration Policy. The Executive 
Director may be invited to participate in the bonus on a pro-rated basis in the first year of appointment.
Long-term incentives Normal awards will be made under the BIP in line with the Remuneration Policy. The Executive Director may be 
invited to participate in ‘in flight’ BIP awards on a pro-rated basis when appointed.
The Company is required to set out the maximum amount of variable pay which could be paid to a new director 
in respect of his/her recruitment. In order to provide the Company with sufficient flexibility in a recruitment 
scenario, the Committee has set this figure as 450% of base salary. This covers the maximum annual bonus 
and the maximum face value of any long-term incentive awards. This level of variable pay would only be 
available in exceptional circumstances, and in order to achieve such a level of variable pay, stretching targets 
would need to be met. For the avoidance of doubt, this 450% variable pay limit excludes the value of any 
“buyout” payments or awards associated with forfeited awards.
Replacement awards For an external appointment, although there are no plans to offer additional cash and/or share-based payments 
on recruitment, the Committee reserves the right to do so when it considers this to be in the best interests of 
the Company and shareholders. Such payments may take into account remuneration relinquished when leaving 
the former employer and would reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attached 
to that remuneration. Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment. The 
Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to “buyout” awards which will be forfeited on 
leaving the previous employer. Our approach to this is to carry out a detailed review of the awards which the 
individual will lose and calculate the estimated value of them. In doing so, we will consider the vesting period, 
the option exercise period if applicable, whether the awards are cash or share based, performance related or 
not, the Company’s recent performance and payout levels and any other factors we consider appropriate. If 
a buyout award is to be made, the structure and level will be carefully designed and will generally reflect and 
replicate the previous awards as accurately as possible. We will make the award subject to appropriate malus 
and clawback provisions in the event that the individual resigns or is summarily terminated within a certain 
timeframe. An explanation will be provided at the time of recruitment of why a buyout award has been granted.
Internal promotions For internal promotions any commitments made prior to appointment may continue to be honoured as the 
executive is transitioned to the new remuneration arrangements.

Shareholders will be informed of any director appointment and the individual’s remuneration arrangements as soon as practicable following 
the appointment via an announcement to the regulatory news services.
Fee levels for a new Chairman or new Non-Executive Directors will be determined in accordance with the policy set out on page 71 .

The Non-Executive Directors of the Company (including the Chairman) do not have service contracts. The Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed by letters of appointment. Each independent Non-Executive Director’s term of office runs for a maximum three year period. 
The initial terms of the Non-Executive Directors’ positions are subject to their re-election by the Company’s shareholders at the next AGM 
and to re-election at any subsequent AGM at which the Non-Executive Directors stand for re-election. 
All directors will be put forward for re-election by shareholders on an annual basis.
T ermination remuneration policy
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors have service contracts with a one-year notice period and terminable by one year’s notice 
by the employer at any time, and by payment of one year’s basic salary and other fixed benefits in lieu of notice by the employer. All future 
appointments to the Board will comply with this requirement. This section of the report has been revised to reflect the service contract of 
Dominique Yates, Group CFO, which operates under different terms to that of the CEO and the former FD. 
The Committee will honour Executive Directors’ contractual entitlements. Service contracts do not contain liquidated damages clauses. 
If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. There are 
no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement. There is no 
agreement between the Company and its Executive Directors or employees, providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
that occurs because of a takeover bid.

Component Policy
Compensation for loss 
of office in service 
contracts
Currently, under the terms of the Chief Executive’s contract, the Company may at its choice, in lieu of giving 
notice, terminate an Executive Director’s service contract by making a payment equivalent to; one year’s annual 
base salary, 25% of base salary in respect of all other remuneration and benefits (other than annual bonus and 
incentives) and annual bonus equal to the average bonus paid up to three years prior to the date of notice.
Under the terms of the Chief Financial Officers’ contract, the contract is terminable by one year’s notice by the 
employer at any time, and by payment of one year’s basic salary and other fixed benefits in lieu of notice by the 
employer.
T reatment of cash 
element of the bonus 
under Plan rules
If termination is by way of death, injury, illness, disability, redundancy, retirement or any other circumstances 
the Committee determines (a “good leaver”), the level of bonus will be measured at the bonus measurement 
date. Bonus will normally be pro-rated for the period worked during the financial year. The Committee retains 
the discretion:
■ ■ to determine that an executive is a good leaver. It is the Committee’s intention to only use this discretion in 
circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders;
■ ■ not to pro-rate the bonus to time. The Committee’s policy is that it will pro-rate bonus for time. It is the 
Committee’s intention to use its discretion to not pro-rate in circumstances where there is an appropriate 
business case which will be explained in full to shareholders.
Under all other circumstances no bonus will be earned on cessation of employment (other than set out above in 
the legacy arrangements for current Executive Directors). 
T reatment of unvested 
deferred bonus awards 
under Plan rules
If termination is by way of death, injury, illness, disability, redundancy, retirement or any other circumstances 
the Committee determines (a “good leaver”), deferred shares may be released to the participant at the normal 
vesting date.
Under all other circumstances unvested awards will lapse on cessation of employment. 
The Committee has the following elements of discretion:
■ ■ to determine that an executive is a good leaver. It is the Committee’s intention to only use this discretion in 
circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders;
■ ■ to vest deferred shares at the end of the original deferral period or at the date of cessation. The Committee’s 
policy is that shares will vest on the original date of vesting. The Committee will make this determination 
depending on the type of good leaver reason resulting in the cessation.
T reatment of unvested 
BIP 2016, BIP 2006 and 
CIP awards 
On cessation of employment, awards under the BIP and CIP will lapse in full, unless the Committee determines 
that the individual is a good leaver (see above for definition). In instances where the Committee determines that 
awards should not lapse in full, awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date, pro-rated for time served 
and subject to the achievement of the original performance conditions.
The Committee has the following elements of discretion:
■ ■ to determine that an executive is a good leaver. It is the Committee’s intention to only use this discretion in 
circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders;
■ ■ to measure performance over the original performance period or at the date of cessation. The Committee 
will make this determination depending on the type of good leaver reason resulting in the cessation; and
■ ■ to pro-rate the maximum number of shares to the time from the date of grant to the date of cessation. The 
Committee’ s policy is that it will pro-rate awards for time. It is the Committee’ s intention to use discretion to not pro-
rate in circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders.
Exercise of discretion In the event that an Executive Director leaves the Company, the Committee’s policy for exit payments is to 
consider the reasons for cessation and consequently whether any exit payments other than those contractually 
required are warranted.
Further, in the event of a compromise or settlement agreement, the Committee may agree payments it 
considers reasonable in settlement of legal claims. This may include an entitlement to compensation in 
respect of their statutory rights under employment protection legislation in the UK or in other jurisdictions. The 
Committee may also include in such payments reasonable reimbursement of professional fees in connection 
with such agreements.
Change of control Our policy is not to have a change in control clause in Executive Directors’ service contracts. Neither S.C. Harris 
nor D. Yates’ contract have a change of control clause. To the extent that executive contracts are renewed, 
or new appointments made, the Committee will continue to adopt a policy of not having change of control 
clauses in service contracts. In any case, legally appropriate factors would be taken into account to mitigate 
any compensation payment, covering basic salary, annual incentives and benefits, which may arise on the 
termination of employment of any Executive Director, other than payments made on a change in control or for 
payments in lieu of notice. 
On change of control the awards under the Company’s incentive plans will generally vest subject to 
performance and time apportionment as determined by the Committee and in accordance with the rules of the 
relevant Plan.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
Responsibility of directors for the preparation of the Annual Report and financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), including FRS 101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework” . Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
■ ■ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
■ ■ make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
■ ■ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
■ ■ properly select and apply accounting policies;
■ ■ present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
■ ■ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
■ ■ make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report and financial statements
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
■ ■ the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
■ ■ the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face; and
■ ■ the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors on 6 March 2018 and is signed on its behalf by:

To the Members of Bodycote plc
Opinion on financial statements of Bodycote plc
Opinion
In our opinion:
■ ■ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2017 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
■ ■ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
■ ■ the Parent Company Financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” and;
■ ■ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Bodycote plc (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise:
■ ■ the Consolidated Income Statement;
■ ■ the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;
■ ■ the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Financial Position;
■ ■ the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement;
■ ■ the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity;
■ ■ the Group and Company Accounting Policies;
■ ■ the related notes 1 to 29 to the Group financial statements; and
■ ■ the relates notes 1 to 12 to the Parent Company financial statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
■ ■ Impairment of goodwill and intangible fixed assets in Europe ST
■ ■ Taxation accounting – valuation of certain tax structure provisions
■ ■ Pensions – UK defined benefit scheme liability assumptions
■ ■ Revenue recognition – manual adjustments to revenue
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with  and any key audit matters which are the same 
as the prior year identified with .
Materiality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was £5.6 million which was determined on the 
basis of 5% of expected pre-tax profit.
Scoping As a consequence of the audit scope determined, we achieved coverage of approximately 73% of revenue, 78% 
of profit before tax and 79% of net assets.
Significant changes  
in our approach
Our approach is consistent with the previous year with the exception of the removal of the completeness and 
accuracy of environmental provisions as a key audit matter for the 2017 audit report, and the addition of the 
potential fraud risk in relation to revenue recognition, as outlined in further detail below.

To the Members of Bodycote plc
Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern
■ ■ We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 24 to the financial statements 
about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties 
to the group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
■ ■ We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention 
to in relation to that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the 
statement is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material 
to report, add or draw attention to in respect 
of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were 
consistent with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the 
knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required to state whether 
we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
■ ■ the disclosures on pages 25-29 that describe the principal risks and explain how they 
are being managed or mitigated;
■ ■ the directors’ confirmation on page 76 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
■ ■ the directors’ explanation on page 24 as to how they have assessed the prospects 
of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the 
prospects of the Group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with 
our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material 
to report, add or draw attention to in respect 
of these matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we 
identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
In 2017 we no longer consider the completeness and accuracy of environmental remediation provisions to be a key audit matter. This 
assessment is based on the stable nature of the site portfolio and associated environmental obligations across the Group, and support 
provided by third-party environmental specialist valuation reports.
We have included a new key audit matter for 2017 in relation to the fraud risk in revenue recognition, focused on the risk of manual 
adjustments made to revenue, which has been included following consideration of the nature of revenue transactions recorded by the 
Group and the typical sales cycle for services provided, as described further within the Key Audit Matter below. 
We have also refined our key audit matter in relation to impairment to focus on intangible fixed assets (including goodwill) balances for the 
Europe ST cash generating unit (“CGU”), as opposed to tangible and intangible fixed assets across the whole business.

Impairment of intangible fixed assets (including goodwill) 
Key audit matter 
description
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
The Group has a significant non-current asset base relating to intangible assets (including goodwill) of £201 .0m (2016: 
£206.7m) as shown in notes 11 and 12. Our risk assessment procedures have pinpointed our key audit matter with 
regards to impairment to focus on the Europe ST CGU (which has £12.6m of goodwill allocated (2016: £12.6m)), due 
to the continued adverse performance related to the oil and gas markets served by this CGU.
Performing an impairment review of the non-current assets within this CGU requires the exercise of judgement 
regarding future growth rates, discount rates and sensitivity assumptions, as described in note 11, and is included as 
an area of focus in the Report of the Audit Committee.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
We challenged the assumptions used in the impairment model for intangible assets within the Europe ST CGU. As 
part of our procedures we:
■ ■ We challenged the assumptions used in the impairment model for intangible assets within the Europe ST CGU. 
As part of our procedures we:
■ ■ considered the appropriateness of the growth rate assumptions by comparing them to historical trading 
performance and World Bank historical GDP data for the markets served by Europe ST , and reviewing and 
challenging management’s budget for 2018; 
■ ■ considered the impact of the sensitivities performed by management in assessing whether they reflect a 
reasonable possible change scenario; and
■ ■ assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions concerning the discount rate applied by engaging our internal 
valuation specialists to review the inputs used to determine the discount rate applied by comparing them against 
external market data.
Key observations
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
Based on the procedures performed, no impairment was noted and we have concluded that the assumptions in the 
impairment model are appropriate.
T axation – valuation of certain tax structure provisions  
Key audit matter 
description
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
The tax risk concerns the judgements and estimates applied in the determination of provisions for liabilities attributed 
to specific uncertain tax positions linked to the Group’s corporate arrangements as described as an area of focus in 
the Report of the Audit Committee.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
In conjunction with our taxation audit specialists, we have assessed the assumptions and judgements concerning 
the adequacy of certain tax structure provisions by challenging management’s assumptions, reviewing the available 
correspondence from the various tax authorities and drawing on the experience of our taxation specialists in respect 
of similar situations.
Key observations
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
From the work performed above we are satisfied that the provisions held on the balance sheet for certain tax 
structure positions are reasonable.
Pensions – UK defined benefit scheme liability assumptions  
Key audit matter 
description
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
This risk concerns the appropriateness of the actuarial assumptions applied in calculating the Group’s UK defined 
benefit scheme liability of £109.9m (2016: £126.6m) within the net UK defined benefit surplus of £2.4m (2016: liability 
of £3.6m) as shown in note 28. The valuation of the Group’s IAS 19 liability involves significant judgement in the 
choice of discount rate used and in the key sources of estimation uncertainty in particular in relation to the discount 
rate assumptions, as described in the Group’s accounting policies, and is included as an area of focus in the Report of 
the Audit Committee.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
We have assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions underpinning the valuation of the scheme liabilities. 
Specifically we challenged the discount rate, inflation and mortality assumptions applied in the calculation by using 
our internal pension specialists to benchmark the assumptions applied against comparable third party data and 
assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions in the context of the Group’s own position. 
Key observations
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
From the work performed we are satisfied that the assumptions applied in respect of the valuation of the Group’s IAS 
19 UK defined benefit scheme liabilities are reasonable. We consider the assumptions to be towards the prudent end 
of our benchmarked range.

Revenue recognition - manual adjustments to revenue  
Key audit matter 
description
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
When assessing the potential risk of fraud in relation to revenue recognition, we have considered the nature of the 
automated and manual transactions recorded across the Group, considering the typical sales cycle for the services 
provided by the Group as described in the Group’s accounting policies, and have determined that the key audit matter 
in relation to fraud is pinpointed to the risk of inappropriate manual adjustments being recorded in revenue.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
We have profiled the population of journal entries made throughout the year in order to identify manual adjustments 
made to revenue and have tested the identified population to validate their authenticity and commercial substance.
Key observations
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
From the work performed we have not noted any manual adjustments to revenue that we would not expect in the 
usual course of business, or that cannot be supported.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of 
a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Group materiality £5.6 million (2016: £4.8 million) £4.5 million (2016: £3.6 million)
Basis for determining 
materiality
5% of expected pre-tax profit (2016: 5% of pre-tax 
profit)
The parent company materiality represents 1% (2016: 
1%) of equity which is capped at 80% (2016: 80%) of 
Group materiality.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
Pre-tax profit is determined to be the most stable 
basis of underlying business performance.   
As a non-trading parent company, equity is the key 
driver of the company.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.28 million (2016: £0.20 
million) for the group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also 
report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
Based on this assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work relating to twelve components across nine core 
locations, being USA, UK, France, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Turkey, and Mexico. Components within China, 
Italy and Poland were removed from Group scope as part of our risk assessment process to pinpoint our focus and attention to material 
components where the key audit matters and judgements affecting the Group financial statements are expected. The parent company is 
located in the UK and audited directly by the Group audit team.
As a consequence of the audit scope determined, we achieved coverage of approximately 73% (2016: 86%) of revenue, 78% (2016: 92%) 
of profit before tax and 79% (2016: 90%) of net assets.  Our audit work at each location was executed at levels of materiality applicable to 
each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality.  Component materiality, excluding the Parent Company, ranged from £1 .5m 
to £2.8m (2016: £0.5m to £2.5m). 
The Group audit team continued to follow a program of planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the Group audit 
team visits each of the significant finance function locations included as full scope for the Group audit at least once every three years. 
During the year, senior members of the Group audit team have visited the US, UK, France and the Czech Shared Service Centre.
In years when we do not visit a significant component we include the component audit team in our team briefing, discuss their risk 
assessment, attend close meetings by conference call and review documentation of the findings from their work.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit 
or audit of specified account balances.

Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement 
of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
■ ■ Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
■ ■ Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
■ ■ Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the directors’ 
statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.10R (2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of these 
matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
■ ■ the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
■ ■ the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and of the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
■ ■ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
■ ■ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
■ ■ the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of these 
matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of 
directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited is 
not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of these 
matters..

Other matters
Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the Board of Directors in 2002 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ending 31 December 2003 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement 
including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is 15 years, covering the years ending 31 December 2003 to 31 December 
2017 ..
Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the audit committee
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Group accounting policies
Year ended 31 December 2017
Basis of accounting
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The 
financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of EU IAS Regulation as adopted for use in the EU.
The Group has adopted Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB (IFRIC). Individual standards and interpretations have to be adopted by the 
European Commission (EC) and the process leads to a delay between the issue and adoption of new standards and in some cases 
amendment by the EC.
International Financial Reporting Standards are subject to ongoing amendment by the IASB and subsequent endorsement by the EC and 
are therefore subject to change.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, with the exception of accounting for certain financial instruments. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies 
adopted are set out below.
Going concern
The directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis  
of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Chief Financial Officer’s report on page 24.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling 
shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially 
be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the 
non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even 
if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying 
amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the 
subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration 
paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate 
of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the 
assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained 
earnings) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investment 
retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent 
accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the costs on initial recognition of an 
investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are  
discussed below.
T axation
The Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Provisions for corporation tax contingencies require the directors to estimate the 
level of corporation tax that will be payable based upon the interpretation of applicable tax legislation on a country-by-country basis and 
an assessment of the likely outcome of any open tax computations. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the 
amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current tax provision, deferred tax provisions and income statement in 
the period in which such determination is made. Please refer to note 19 on page 117 for further details.

Group accounting policies continued
Year ended 31 December 2017
Retirement benefit schemes
Accounting for retirement benefit schemes under IAS 19 (revised) requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance 
with actuarial assumptions. The discount rate applied in the calculation of scheme liabilities is a key source of estimation uncertainty for the 
Group. Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of retirement benefit schemes are set out on page 92 and see note 28 on page 
123 for further details.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the course of preparing the financial statements, no judgements have been made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies, other than those involving estimations (above), that have had a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through 
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest 
in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are 
recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment. 
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in profit and loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in 
the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision is made 
for impairment.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) 
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill 
is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. If after restatement, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of 
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be 
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis. An impairment 
loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on 
disposal. Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject 
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is 
not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.

Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. 
Revenue is recognised on the completion of services rendered.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying 
amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholder’s rights to receive payment have been established.
Other operating income represents scrap sales, rents receivable and other operating income.
The Group as lessee
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as  
a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:
■ ■ exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see page 95); and
■ ■ exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor 
likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation) which are recognised initially in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the net investment.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate 
significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of 
transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their 
intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
Government grants
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit and loss over the 
expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs, goodwill impairment, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and after the 
post-tax share of results of associates but before investment income and finance costs.

Exceptional items
The Group considers exceptional items to be those which derive from events or transactions which are significant for separate disclosure 
by virtue of their size or incidence in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding of the Group’s financial performance. These items 
include, but are not limited to, acquisition costs, impairment charges, reorganisation costs and profits and losses on disposal of subsidiaries 
and other one off items which meet this definition; this included the impact of the US Tax Reform in the current year.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the 
contributions. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes 
where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations 
being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling 
(if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit 
to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recorded in the statement of comprehensive 
income is not recycled. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period of scheme amendment. Net interest  
is calculated by applying a discount rate to the defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are split into three categories:
■ ■ current service cost, past-service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements;
■ ■ net interest expense or income; and 
■ ■ remeasurement.
The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit costs within cost of sales and administrative expenses (see note 3) in its 
consolidated income statement. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past-service cost.
Net-interest expense or income is recognised within finance costs (see note 7).
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated balance sheet represents the deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined 
benefit schemes. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form  
of refunds from the schemes or reductions in future contributions to the schemes.
A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefit 
and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs.
T axation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year or tax assessment adjustments made to prior years. Taxable profit differs 
from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such 
investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to 
utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based 
on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in other comprehensive income. 
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets 
and liabilities on a net basis.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction, less their residual values, 
over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold property over the period of the lease
Fixtures and fittings 10%–20%
Plant and machinery 5%–20%
Motor vehicles 20%–33%
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, plus appropriate borrowing costs, less any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition 
is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as 
incurred.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. 
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for  
in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
■ ■ deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in 
accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits respectively; and
■ ■ liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are measured in 
accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at 
fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of these assets is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases:
Software 10%–33%
Non-compete agreements 20%–33%
Customer relationships 7%–10%
Amortisation is recognised within administration expenses.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for trade receivables, which do not carry any 
interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement 
using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated 
future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
Objective evidence of impairment could include:
■ ■ significant financial difficulty of the customer or counterparty; or
■ ■ default or delinquency in payments.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as 
observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward exchange contracts, 
to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities and the financing of those activities. The Group does not use derivative 
financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on 
the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair value on the balance sheet date. Changes 
in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement are recognised immediately in the income statement. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a 
non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 
12 months.
Hedge accounting
The Group uses foreign currency debt and cross currency swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in the underlying net assets of overseas 
operations arising from foreign exchange rate movements.
The Group maintains documentation of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument at the inception of a hedging 
transaction together with the risk management objective and the strategy underlying the designated hedge. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in 
offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment 
hedges.
Note 18 sets out the details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes.
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together 
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line of the income statement 
relating to the hedged item.
Cash flow hedge
Cash flow hedging matches the cash flows of hedged items against the corresponding cash flow of the derivative. The effective part of any 
gain or loss on the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the hedged item is accounted for in accordance 
with the policy for that financial instrument. Any ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred 
to net profit or loss for the period.
Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. To the extent the hedge is effective, 
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging and translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement and is included in other operating expenses.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement in the event that the foreign operation is disposed of.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, when it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation and the effect of the adjustment is material in relation to the financial statements, its carrying 
amount is the present value of those cash flows.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected 
to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-
settled employee benefits reserve.

General information
Bodycote plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of the registered office is given  
on page 37 .
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are included within the Group’s Strategic report.
Information on the Group’s objectives, policies and processes are included within the Group’s Strategic report.
Items included in the financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the functional 
and presentation currency of the Parent. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in the Foreign Currencies 
accounting policy on page 91 .
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted:
■ ■ Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
The above interpretations and revised standards have not had any material impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements or 
the disclosures required. 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been endorsed by the EU):
■ ■ IFRS 9 Financial instruments
■ ■ IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
■ ■ Clarifications to IFRS 15 Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 
■ ■ IFRS 16 Leases
■ ■ Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions
■ ■ IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration 
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods, except in the case of IFRS 16, as described below:
■ ■ IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2018 and will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments. This standard covers 
the classification, measurement, impairment and de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities together with a new hedge 
accounting model. The Group does not expect the transition to this standard to have a material impact on the financial statements.
■ ■ IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2018 and will replace IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue. This 
standard requires the separation of performance obligations within contracts with customers and the contractual value to be allocated to 
each of the performance obligations. Revenue is then recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied. Retrospective application 
in the comparative year ending 31 December 2017 is optional; however the Group does not expect to undertake this option. An initial 
assessment has been performed and it is not anticipated that transition to IFRS 15 will have a material impact on the Group.
■ ■ IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2019, subject to EU endorsement, and will replace IAS 17 Leases. This 
standard requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases, unless the lease term is 12 months or less, or the underlying 
asset is low value. As at 31 December 2017 , the Group holds a significant number of operating leases which currently, under IAS 17 , are 
expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term. Depending on the choice of methodology permitted under IFRS 16, the Group may 
be obliged to reflect the impact of IFRS 16 in the comparative figures for 2018 in its accounts for the year ending 31 December 2019. The 
group will conclude on its choice of methodology during the current year. An initial assessment has been performed and it is anticipated 
that transition to IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the value of lease assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated balance 
sheet. The Group will continue to monitor the impact until the transition date, providing further quantitative and qualitative measures as 
progress is made on implementation planning.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable financial estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed.

1. Alternative performance measures (APMs)
Bodycote uses various APMs, in addition to those reported under IFRS, as management believe these measures enable users of 
the financial statements to assess the underlying trading performance of the business. The APMs used include headline operating 
profit, headline profit before taxation, EBITDA, headline EBITDA, headline earnings per share (EPS), headline operating cash flow, 
free cash flow, net cash and return on capital employed (ROCE). These measures reflect the underlying performance of the business 
as they exclude the impact of amortisation of acquired intangible assets and exceptional items. The Group also uses revenue growth 
percentages adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange movements, where appropriate, also to better represent the underlying 
performance of the business. The measures described above are also used in the targeting process for executive and management 
annual bonuses (headline operating profit, operating cash-flow) and share schemes (headline operating profit, headline operating cash 
flow, ROCE, headline EPS).
The constant exchange rate comparison uses the current year reported segmental information, stated in the relevant functional 
currency, and translates the results into its presentational currency using the prior year’s monthly exchange rates.
APMs are defined and reconciled to the IFRS statutory measure as follows:

2. Business and geographical segments
The Group has 187 locations across the world serving a range of market sectors with various thermal processing services. The range 
and type of services offered is common to all market sectors.
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the segmentation of Group activity reflects the way the Group is managed by the 
chief operating decision maker, being the Group Chief Executive, who on a monthly basis reviews the operating performance of six 
operating segments, split between the Aerospace, Defence & Energy (ADE) and Automotive & General Industrial (AGI) business areas, 
as follows:
■ ■ ADE – Western Europe;
■ ■ ADE – North America;
■ ■ ADE – Emerging markets;
■ ■ AGI – Western Europe;
■ ■ AGI – North America; and
■ ■ AGI – Emerging markets.
The split of operating segments by geography reflects the divisional reporting structure of the Group.
In accordance with the aggregation criteria of IFRS 8, the operating segments are aggregated into the Group’s two key business areas, 
ADE and AGI, the split being driven by customer behaviour and requirements. Customers in the ADE segment tend to operate and 
purchase more globally and have long supply chains, while customers in the AGI segment tend to purchase more locally and have 
shorter supply chains.
Bodycote plants do not exclusively supply services to customers of a given market sector. Allocations of plants between ADE and AGI 
is therefore derived by reference to the preponderance of markets served.

The Group has chosen to use a weighted average country tax rate rather than the UK tax rate for the reconciliation of the charge 
for the year to the profit before taxation per the consolidated income statement. The Group operates in several jurisdictions, many 
of which have a tax rate in excess of the UK tax rate. As such, a weighted average country tax rate is believed to provide the most 
meaningful information to the users of the financial statements. The appropriate tax rate for this comparison is 30.09% (2016: 32.36%).
As part of the calculation of the tax charge, the Group recognises a number of tax risk provisions in respect of ongoing tax inquiries 
and in recognition of the multinational tax environment that Bodycote operates in where the nature of the tax positions that are taken 
is often complex and subject to change.
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit before taxation per the consolidated income statement as follows:

  The Group is externally financed by a mix of cash flows from operations, short-term borrowings, long-term loans and finance leases. Internally, operating 
subsidiaries are predominantly financed via intercompany loans. The charge includes provisions based on management’s estimation of tax risk.

  2017 prior year adjustments in current and deferred tax relate to changes in assumptions and outcomes in relation to overseas tax credits and other 
claims, whilst the 2016 adjustments mainly relate to changes in overseas pensions assumptions.

During the year a £0.4m hindsight adjustment was made to a 2016 acquisition. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the business units that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination. After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the Group’s cash 
generating units, which are summarised in the following operating segments:
2017 
£m 
2016
£m
ADE:
 Western Europe 27 .0 26.8 
 North America 47 .5 49.0 
AGI:
 Western Europe 24.1 23.1 
 North America 52.5 55.9 
 Emerging markets 6.5 6.1 
157 .6 160.9 
The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for those 
calculations are the discount rates and growth rates in respect of future cash flows. Management estimates discount rates using 
pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units. 
This rate is risk adjusted, for specific countries, where the Group perceives a risk premium is appropriate. The rates used to discount 
the forecast cash flows for cash generating units are between 11 .7% (2016: 13.4%) and 12.7% (2016: 14.4%). The recoverable amount 
is the sum of the discounted cash flows as forecast for the coming five years, together with a further estimate of cash flows in 
perpetuity.
The forecast sales in the initial 5 years reflect management’s expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic 
cycle. This is based on the approved 2018 budget and a growth rate of up to 3% year on year. The expected profit margin reflects 
management’s experience of each cash generating unit’s profitability at the forecast level of sales. As outlined in the Business 
review, these forecasts take into account the current and expected economic environment both in respect of geography and market 
sectors. Annual growth in cash flows after five years are in the range 2.4% to 5.4% depending on the geographical region of the cash 
generating unit and are based on historical weighted average growth in GDP in the respective geographies.

11. Goodwill (continued)
If the goodwill allocated to a cash generating unit represents more than 15% of the Group’s total goodwill carrying value, the cash 
generating unit is considered to be individually significant. The Group considers the North America ADE Heat Treatment and North 
America AGI Heat Treatment cash generating units to be significant cash generating units. The long term growth rates applied to cash 
flows after five years and the rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for these significant cash generating units are shown 
below:

 North America ADE Heat Treatment 47 .5 2.9 11.7
 North America AGI Heat Treatment 52.5 2.9 11.7 
The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions applied to the value in use calculations for each cash generating 
unit. The separate sensitivity scenarios analysed include reduction in the forecast sales of 20% to 50% in the first year of the forecast 
and reduction of the long-term revenue growth assumptions of 50% to 100% from year five of the cash flows.
The Directors do not consider that there are any reasonable possible sensitivities for the business that could arise in the next 12 
months that could result in a material impairment charge being recognised.
The Board has concluded that no impairment charge is required in 2017 .

Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on 
previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. 
Further disclosure of the Group’s financial instrument risk management activities is set out in note 18.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £29.2m (2016: £21 .9m) which are past due at 
the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts 
are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average credit terms offered to customers is 36 days, with a range from 14 days to 67 days.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the quality of the trade receivable from the 
date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being 
large and unrelated. Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for 
doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a gross balance of £6.6m (2016: £10.2m). 
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of 
the expected proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

of £230m. This unsecured facility commenced on 3 April 2017 and matures on 3 April 2022. The multi-currency drawings under this 
facility carry an interest rate of between 0.90% and 1 .75% above LIBOR (the applicable margin at 31 December 2017 was 0.90%).
At 31 December 2017 the Group had available £230.0m (2016: £225.0m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.

Forward foreign exchange contracts 3.0 – 4.4 0.1 
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge material future transactions and cash flows. The Group uses foreign currency forward 
contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures. The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Group’s 
principal markets. The unrecognised gains and losses were not significant in either 2017 or 2016.
In accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instrument: Disclosures, the Group’s financial instruments are considered to be classified as 
level 2 instruments. Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

18. Derivative financial instruments continued
Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities 
of the contracts.
The Group’s interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings (fair value risk) and floating rate borrowings (cash flow 
risk). From time to time the Group will use interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements within 
Group policy. However, at the balance sheet date, the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.

Financial risk management
The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and 
counterparty risk. Treasury activities have the objective of minimising risk and treasury operations are conducted within a framework of 
policies and guidelines reviewed and authorised by the Board.  
The Group uses a number of derivative instruments that are transacted, for risk management purposes only, by specialist treasury 
personnel. The use of financial instruments, including derivatives, is permitted when approved by the Board, where the effect is to 
minimise risk for the Group. Speculative trading of derivatives or other financial instruments is not permitted. There has been no 
significant change during the financial year, or since the end of the year, to the types or scope of financial risks faced by the Group.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group might not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. 
Liquidity risk arises as a result of mismatches between cash inflows and outflows from the business. This risk is monitored on a 
centralised basis through regular cash flow forecasting, a three-year rolling strategic plan, an annual budget agreed by the Board each 
December and a quarterly re-forecast undertaken during the financial year. To mitigate the risk, the resulting forecast net debt/cash 
is measured against the liquidity headroom policy which, at the current net debt/cash levels, requires committed facilities (plus term 
loans in excess of one year) to exceed net debt by 50% (minimum facilities of £75m).
As at 31 December 2017 , the Group had a revolving credit committed borrowing facility of £230.0m (2016: £230.0m) which, together 
with net cash of £39.6m (2016: £1 .1m), resulted in available funds of £269.6m (2016: £231 .1m). The Group also uses uncommitted 
short-term bank facilities to manage short-term liquidity but these facilities are excluded from the liquidity headroom policy. The Group 
manages longer-term liquidity through its committed bank facilities and will, if appropriate, raise funds on capital markets.
As at 31 December 2017 the Group’s principal committed bank facility of £230.0m had a maturity date of 3 April 2022 (4.3 years to 
maturity) and had drawings of £nil (2016: £5.0m).
Cash management pooling, netting and concentration techniques are used to minimise borrowings. As at 31 December 2017 , the 
Group had gross cash of £41 .0m (2016: £12.0m).

18. Derivative financial instruments continued
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk arises on borrowings and cash balances (and derivative liabilities and assets) which are at floating interest rates. 
Changes in interest rates could have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the Group’s net profit. Under the Group’s interest 
rate management policy, the interest rates on each of the Group’s major currency monetary assets and liabilities are managed to 
achieve the desired mix of fixed and variable rates for each major net currency exposure. The major interest rate risk is to UK rates but 
exposures also exist to rates in the USA, Europe and Sweden. Measurement of this interest rate risk and its potential volatility to the 
Group’s reported financial performance is undertaken on a monthly basis and the Board uses this information to determine, from time 
to time, an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates.
As at 31 December 2017 , 0% of gross debt and 0% of gross cash were at fixed rates (2016: 0% of gross debt, 0% of gross cash).
Currency risk 
Bodycote has operations in 23 countries and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange translation risk when the profits and net assets 
of these entities are consolidated into the Group accounts.
92% of the Group’s sales are in currencies other than sterling (EUR 40%, USD 34% and SEK 6%). Cumulatively over the year, sterling 
rates moved such that the sales for the year were £32.1m higher than if sales had been translated at the rates prevailing in 2016.
It is Group policy not to hedge exposure for the translation of reported profits.
The Group’s balance sheet translation policy is not to actively hedge currency net assets. However, where appropriate, the Group 
will still match centrally held currency borrowings to the net assets. The Group principally borrows in sterling but also maintains debt 
in US Dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona, consistent with the location of the Group’s assets. The Group recognises foreign exchange 
movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances. 
Transaction foreign exchange exposures arise when entities within the Group enter into contracts to pay or receive funds in a currency 
different from the functional currency of the entity concerned. It has been Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions 
in foreign currencies when a commitment arises, usually through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. Even though 
approximately 92% of the Group’s sales are generated outside the UK, the nature of the business is such that cross border sales and 
purchases are limited and immaterial for the Group.
Market risk sensitivity analysis 
To represent management’s best estimate of a reasonable range of potential outcomes, the Group has measured the estimated charge 
to the income statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% (100 basis points) in market interest rates 
or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the applicable rates as at 31 December 2017 , for all 
financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant. This analysis is for illustrative purposes only. The sensitivity analysis 
excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations.
Interest rate sensitivity 
The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:
■ ■ changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments;
■ ■ c hanges in mark et interest rates only af f ect the income st atement in relation to financial instr uments with fix ed interest if these are                      
recognised at their fair value; and
■ ■ changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
Under these assumptions, a one percentage point fall or rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group has variable 
net cash or net borrowings at 31 December 2017 would reduce or increase profit before tax by approximately £0.4m (2016: £0.1m 
decrease). There is no significant impact on equity in the current or previous year.
Currency sensitivity 
Taking the 2017 sales by currency, a 10% weakening/strengthening in the 2017 cumulative average rates for all currencies versus 
sterling would have given rise to a +£70.9m/-£62.7m movement in sales respectively. The impact on headline operating profit is 
affected by the mix of losses and profits in the various currencies.  However, taking the 2017 operating profit mix, a 10% weakening/
strengthening in 2017 cumulative average rates for all currencies would have given rise to a +£14.0m/-£11 .2m movement in headline 
operating profit.
Counterparty risk 
Counterparty risk encompasses settlement risk on derivative financial instruments and money market contracts and credit risk on cash, 
time deposits and money market funds. The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings (where 
applicable) and through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure there is no significant concentration of credit 
risk. Group policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A-/A3 or better. However, 
acquired businesses occasionally have dealings with banks with lower credit ratings. Business with such banks is moved as soon as 
practicable.

Other deferred tax assets relate to provisions recognised in the financial statements that are not yet deductible for tax purposes, in 
particular in relation to restructuring charges, share-based payments and local profit differences that are expected to reverse over time.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £35.6m (2016: £46.3m) available for offset against future profits. A 
deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £7 .3m (2016: £14.0m) of such losses, based on management forecasts of future 
taxable profits against which the assets can be recovered in the relevant jurisdictions. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in 
respect of the remaining £28.3m (2016: £32.3m) of such losses where there remains uncertainty over the timing of utilisation relating 
to future profitability. The majority of losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
A deferred tax liability of £0.5m (2016: £nil) relating to the temporary differences on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries has 
been recognised as the Group believes it is probable that these temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. Temporary 
differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.

The restructuring provision materially relates to the costs associated with the closure of a number of Heat Treatment sites announced 
in 2015 and the restructuring of the Canadian operations announced in 2016.
The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, 
or in other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required. This provision is reviewed annually and is separated into 
restructuring environmental and environmental to identify separately environmental provisions relating to the restructuring programme 
from those arising in the ordinary course of business.
The majority of cash outflows in respect of these liabilities are expected to occur within five years.
Whilst the Group’s use of chlorinated solvents and other hazardous chemicals continues to reduce, the Group remains exposed to 
contingent liabilities in respect of environmental remediation liabilities. In particular, the Group could be subjected to regulatory or 
legislative requirements to remediate sites in the future. However, it is not possible at this time to determine whether and to what 
extent any liabilities exist, other than for those recognised above. Therefore no provision is recognised in relation to these items.

23. Acquisition of businesses
On 20 December 2017 , Bodycote acquired the thermal processing assets (including hot isostatic pressing vessels and vacuum 
furnaces) in Blaenavon, South Wales from Doncasters Group Limited for £8.7m. As part of the acquisition, Bodycote entered into a 
long term agreement to provide Doncasters Group with their HIP and Heat Treatment requirements in the United Kingdom and the 
associated employees involved with the thermal processing assets have transferred to Bodycote. Therefore, the transaction was 
treated as a business combination and with the consideration being assigned to the fair value of the thermal processing assets. This is 
the only transaction during 2017 .
In the prior year acquisitions were made to strengthen the Group’s network and to enhance the process offering in Canada, USA and 
Germany. 
The transactions have been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and are summarised below:

Fair value of net assets acquired:

Total consideration 8.7

Cash consideration 8.7 
Prior year acquisitions had £6.5m of accrued consideration of which £5.5m has been paid in the current year. The remaining is expected 
to be paid in the next 12 months. During the year an adjustment was made to acquisitions completed in 2016. The adjustments are 
outlined in the table below:
2017
£m
Fair value adjustment
Property, plant and equipment (0.6)
Trade and other receivables (0.4)
Trade and other payables (0.1)
Deferred tax liabilities 0.7 
Goodwill (0.4)
Acquisition-related costs (reported in exceptional items in note 5) amounted to £nil (2016: £0.6m).
The acquired businesses contributed £nil revenue and £nil operating profit for the period between the dates of acquisition and the 
balance sheet date due to the fact the acquisition was so close to year end. 
If the acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue would have been £693.5m and Group 
headline operating profit attributable to equity holders of the parent, stated prior to Group management charges, would have been 
£124.0m.

26. Share-based payments 
Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP)
The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote 
shares up to a maximum of 175% of base salary. Vesting of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year 
period.
Fifty per cent of the award is subject to a return on capital employed (ROCE) performance condition and 50% of the award is subject to 
an earnings per share (EPS) performance condition.
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest.
The number of outstanding share awards is as follows:
BIP

The Group recognised a total charge to the income statement of £7 .8m (2016: £0.5m) related to equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions.
The Group previously operated a Co-investment plan (CIP) which closed in 2016. This closed for share awards in 2016 and currently 
29,858 shares are outstanding.

28. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for employees in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Canada 
and the United States of America. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control 
of trustees. Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions payable by 
the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
The Group’s employees in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy and the Netherlands are members of state-managed retirement benefit 
schemes operated by the governments of each country. The relevant subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of 
payroll costs to the retirement benefit schemes to fund the benefits. The only obligation of the Group with respect to these retirement 
benefit schemes is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of £6.7m (2016: £6.2m) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates 
specified in the rules of the plans. As at 31 December 2017 contributions of £0.2m (2016: £0.2m) due in respect of the current 
reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operated a number of pension schemes and provided leaving service benefits to certain employees during the year. The 
defined benefit obligation less fair value of assets at the end of the year and total expense recognised in the income statement are 
summarised below as follows:

UK Scheme
The Group sponsors the Bodycote UK Pension Scheme (‘the Scheme’) which is a funded defined benefit arrangement for certain UK 
employees, and pays out pensions at retirement based on service, final pensionable pay and price inflation. The Scheme is funded by 
the Group and current employee members. The Scheme exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate 
risk and market (investment) risk.  
The Scheme operates under UK trust law and the trust is a separate legal entity from the Group. The Scheme is governed by a board 
of trustees, composed of two member representatives, two employer representatives and one independent trustee. The trustees 
are required by law to act in the best interests of scheme members and are responsible for setting certain policies (e.g. investment, 
funding) together with the Group.
Funding of the Scheme is based on a separate actuarial valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from the 
assumptions above. Funding requirements are formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of Contributions and 
Recovery Plan agreed between the Trustees and the Group. The actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 6 April 2017 was completed by 
a qualified independent actuary and the results of this have been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2017 .
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been £0.7m, comprising £0.3m in respect of benefit accrual and 
£0.4m in respect of deficit recovery and ongoing expenses.
It is the policy of the Group to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside of the profit and loss 
account and in Other Comprehensive Income.
As the Group does not have an unconditional right to a return of any surplus in the Scheme under the wording of the Scheme Rules, 
the additional reporting requirements of IFRIC14 apply. As the Scheme is in surplus as at 31 December 2017 a restriction must be 
applied to the balance sheet. The surplus recognised on the balance sheet has been restricted to £2.4m. No further liabilities need 
to be recognised at 31 December 2017 as the Group is not committed to paying any further deficit reduction contributions under the 
current Schedule of Contributions.

equities, diversified growth funds, absolute return bonds and direct lending, and 35% to ‘liability-matching’ asset classes, namely 
Liability Driven Investment (‘LDI’). The LDI portion of assets has been put in place to reduce interest rate and inflation risk.

The Group operates schemes in the USA and continental Europe. 
During the year the two schemes in the USA were merged. This has been recognised as a settlement of the assets and liabilities in the 
Metallurgical scheme with an offsetting past service credit and cost in the non-Meterallurgical scheme. Overall there is no net impact

29. Contingent liabilities
The international tax environment has received increased attention and seen rapid change over recent years, both at a US and 
European level, and by international bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Against this 
backdrop, Bodycote has been monitoring developments and continues to engage transparently with the tax authorities in the countries 
where we operate. In October 2017 , the European Commission opened a state aid investigation into the Group Financing Exemption 
in the UK controlled foreign company rules. The Group Financing Exemption was introduced in legislation by the British government 
in 2013. In common with other UK-based international companies whose arrangements are in line with current UK CFC legislation, 
Bodycote may be affected by the outcome of this investigation. If the preliminary findings of the European Commission’s investigation 
into the UK legislation are upheld, we calculate the maximum potential liability to be approximately £15m. Based on a current 
assessment, Bodycote believes that no provision is required in respect of this matter.

Company accounting policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 
101) and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention and in accordance with applicable law. The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied 
consistently throughout the year and the preceding year in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Company’s 
financial statements. In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate profit and loss account dealing with the 
results of the Company has not been presented.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of a cash flow statement, presentation of comparative 
information in respect of certain assets, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets, business combinations, discontinued operations 
and related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements.
Going concern
The directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Chief Financial Officer’s Report on page 24.
Investments
Investments are held at cost less provision for impairment, if any.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period.
Pension costs
The Company participates in a final salary defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom which is funded by the payment of 
contributions to a separately administered trust fund. This is a defined benefit plan which shares the risks between entities under common 
control. For further details, see note 11 .
There is no contractual arrangement or policy for charging the net benefit cost between the entities who participate in this scheme. The 
Company is considered to be the entity that is legally the sponsoring employer of this scheme. As such, the Company recognises the net 
defined benefit cost and the retirement benefit obligation as per the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits, as described in further 
detail in the accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements on page 92. 
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is the contributions 
payable in the year.
Leases
Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, 
are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives. The capital elements 
of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period 
of the lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding. Hire purchase transactions are dealt 
with similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives.
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The Company as lessor
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net investment in the leases. 
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Company’s net investment 
outstanding in respect of the leases.

T angible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line 
basis, to reduce the carrying value to the estimated residual value at the point of sale, at the following annual rates:
Fixtures and fittings 10% to 20%
Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of amortisation and any provision for impairment. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line 
basis over their estimated useful lives, at the following annual rates:
Software  10% to 33%
T axation
Current UK corporation tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can 
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing 
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 Related Party Transactions not to disclose transactions or balances 
with wholly-owned entities of the Group.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at  
fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original 
estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding 
adjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve.
Critical judgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty
In the course of preparing the Company’s financial statements, no judgement or key source of estimation uncertainty have been identified.
