Chairman’s statement
  
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Caroline Connellan joined Brooks 
Macdonald as Chief Executive in 
April succeeding Chris Macdonald, 
who remains on the board in a 
non‑executive capacity. Caroline 
brings more than 20 years’ 
experience in the financial services 
industry, most recently as Head of UK 
Premier and Wealth at HSBC. She 
joins the group at an exciting point in 
its development.
Our discretionary funds under 
management grew substantially 
during the year, surpassing the 
significant milestone of £10bn in April 
2017 and reaching £10.5bn as at 
30 June 2017 (2016: £8.3bn), an 
increase of 25.9%. This compares to a 
10.5% increase in the FTSE UK Private 
Investor Balanced Index and 
represents a combination of 
investment performance (14.5%) and 
continued organic growth (11.5%).
Underlying profit before tax for the 
year was £18.4m (2016: £15.5m), an 
increase of 18.6% on the previous 
year, representing an underlying 
profit margin of 20.1% (2016: 19.1%). 
Underlying earnings per share also 
increased by 31.7% to 115.76p (2016: 
87 .92p). Statutory profit before tax for 
the year fell by 49.3% to £8.0m (2016: 
£15.9m), predominantly due to the 
decision to deal proactively with 
certain legacy matters arising from 
the former Spearpoint business, as 
explained in the Chief Executive’s 
Review. We have announced the 
sale of Braemar Estates, our 
property management division, 
which will enable us to focus on our 
core businesses. 
The board has recommended a final 
dividend of 26.0p (2016: 23.0p) which, 
subject to approval by shareholders, 
will result in total dividends for the 
year of 41.0p (2016: 35.0p). This 
represents an increase of 17 .1% on the 
previous year and reaffirms the 
board’s confidence in the strength of 
the business and our commitment 
to a progressive dividend policy. 
The final dividend will be paid on 
27 October 2017 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 
29 September 2017 .
Richard Spencer and Simon 
Wombwell are not seeking re-election 
to the board at this year’s AGM, 
although both will continue as key 
members of the Group Executive 
Committee, as Chief Investment 
Officer and Head of UK Distribution 
respectively. This will reduce the 
board to nine, made up of five 
non-executive directors and four 
executive directors, a board 
composition in line with current 
corporate governance practice.
The financial services industry is 
going through an unprecedented 
period of regulatory change, which 
will have a profound impact on 
businesses throughout the sector. 
We recognise the demands this places 
on the business and consequently 
will be increasing investment in 
regulatory and risk management 
capabilities as outlined in the Chief 
Executive’s Review below. This will 
provide a strong foundation, 
positioning the business for future 
growth.
The result of the EU referendum in 
2016 and the subsequent UK General 
Election in June 2017 have begun to 
impact on the UK’s macroeconomic 
outlook and uncertainty surrounding 
the nature of the UK’s future 
relationship with the EU will persist 
over the next eighteen months as 
negotiations with the EU continue. 
We have already seen a fall in 
consumer spending. These factors, 
combined with the global geopolitical 
risks that have recently begun to 
weigh on market sentiment, cause us 
to remain cautious in our external 
outlook. Nevertheless, the Group is 
well-positioned to weather any 
turbulence, with a strong balance 
sheet (net cash £32.2m (2016: 
£19.5m)). We are confident that the 
Group will continue to prosper and 
deliver high standards of service to 
our clients as well as value for our 
shareholders through our investment 
to support future growth.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Caroline Connellan Chief Executive
Introduction
Having taken over as Chief Executive 
of Brooks Macdonald in April 2017 , 
I am delighted to present my first 
report covering a year when we have 
continued to deliver strong 
underlying Group performance, 
although statutory profit has fallen 
principally as a result of the 
previously announced provision for 
legacy matters . As a result of the hard 
work and dedication of all our staff 
under Chris Macdonald’s prior 
leadership, I have joined a business 
that is well positioned in the market 
and I intend to build on this 
strong foundation .
Since my arrival I have had the 
opportunity to visit each of our offices, 
meeting many of the advisers we 
partner with as well as spending time 
with our people, listening and learning 
about the business first-hand . I have 
been particularly impressed by our 
culture with its strong emphasis on 
client relationships and service . This 
has been fundamental to our growth 
to date and it will remain central to our 
success going forward . I would like to 
thank everyone at Brooks Macdonald 
for making me feel welcome and Chris 
for his support during the handover .
Discretionary fund management is 
our core business and we will be 
looking for opportunities to grow it 
further, including enhancing our 
offering and service levels, as well as 
continuing to adapt – given the fast 
changing external environment – to 
retain our strong market position . We 
have already announced additional 
investment in our regulatory and risk 
management capabilities to build a 
stronger platform both now and for 
delivering sustainable growth in the 
future . Pursuing greater efficiency in 
the business is another of my priorities 
in order to continue to improve our 
margins . This focus on our core 
offering and our drive to improve 
margins has also led to the agreed sale 
of Braemar Estates, our property 
management business, expected to 
complete by the calendar year end .
Growth in funds under 
management and 
underlying profit
A conducive market environment for 
risk assets continued through the year 
with interest rates across the 
developed world at highly 
accommodative levels and inflation 
subdued . There were bouts of 
volatility stemming from political risk 
including the negotiations around 
Brexit, and the UK, US and French 
elections, although any equity market 
sell-off was short lived . Bond returns 
were more mixed with the US Federal 
Reserve’s decision to increase 
US interest rates weighing on 
sentiment . Within the UK, equities with 
As we continue to invest in the Group, I look forward 
to building on our success to date and positioning the 
business to deliver growth into the future.  04  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chief Executive’s review
 continued
Growth in funds continued
international earnings benefitted from 
sterling weakness whilst those with a 
domestic focus underperformed as 
real wages fell . With heightened 
valuations across equity markets, 
geo-political risks and central banks 
tapering asset purchases, we reduced 
our overweight position in equities 
and rebalanced client portfolios 
accordingly . Within the non-equity 
space we have reduced our bond 
holdings given the uncertainty over 
future interest rate levels and central 
bank policies . 
Against this backdrop, the Group 
maintained momentum throughout 
the financial year, achieving annual 
growth in our discretionary funds 
under management (“FUM”) of 25 . 9%, 
to stand at £10 .5bn at 30 June 2017 
(2016: £8 . 3bn) . Of the £2 . 2bn increase, 
£1 . 0bn (11 .5%) was net new business 
and £1 . 2bn (14 .5%) was investment 
performance . As a comparison, the 
FTSE UK Private Investor Balanced 
Index increased by 10 .5% over 
the year .
Underlying profit before tax for the 
year was £18 . 4m (2016: £15 .5m), an 
increase of 18 . 6% on the previous 
year, representing an underlying 
profit margin of 20 . 1% (2016: 19 . 1%) . 
Underlying earnings per share also 
increased by 31 . 7% to 115 . 76p (2016: 
87 . 92p) . While this is a strong result for 
the underlying business, statutory 
profit before tax for the year fell by 
49 . 3% to £8 . 0m (2016: £15 . 9m) 
predominantly due to the provision 
for legacy matters detailed below, as 
well as amortisation and an 
impairment to the goodwill recorded 
for the Levitas business, although the 
latter is more than offset by a 
reduction in deferred consideration . 
A full reconciliation of underlying and 
statutory profit can be found in the 
Strategic Report, and segmental 
information on underlying and 
statutory profit is given in note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements .
Review of business 
performance and development
UK Investment Management 
continues to be our largest and most 
profitable segment . We have 
maintained strong new business 
flows, largely driven by our close 
relationships with advisers . We 
remain confident in the growth 
opportunity and believe there 
continues to be significant scope to 
increase the breadth and depth of our 
adviser relationships and benefit from 
the continuing trend of professional 
intermediaries outsourcing 
investment management .
We continue to add value through our 
centralised investment process, with 
portfolios across all risk mandates 
achieving above-benchmark returns 
according to Asset Risk Consultants 
(ARC) private client indices over one, 
three and five year periods . In 
November we were, for the second 
consecutive year, awarded the 
prestigious industry Gold Standard 
Award for service in discretionary 
fund management and we were once 
again proud to receive five star ratings 
from Defaqto for each of the main 
discretionary offerings: our Bespoke 
Portfolio Service (“BPS”), direct 
Managed Portfolio Service (“MPS”) 
and our platform MPS . We were 
successful at the Citywire Regional 
Star Awards in 2017 , with professional 
advisers voting for our Leamington 
Spa and Tunbridge Wells offices as 
winners of their respective 
geographical categories . We thank 
our adviser partners for their 
continued support .
Our UK BPS, a premium and fully 
personalised offering to private 
clients, charities and pension funds 
now represents £6 .5bn (62 . 3% of FUM) 
and remains our principal offering . 
The pension opportunity, in particular 
Self-Invested Personal Pensions 
(“SIPPs”), continues to be significant, 
as does the growth of ISAs and our 
AIM Portfolio Service . We expect to 
be able to offer Lifetime ISAs to 
clients shortly .
Our UK MPS, consisting of ten 
portfolios with distinct risk profiles 
and objectives, is available to those 
investing smaller amounts and allows 
our investment management 
capabilities to be accessed by a wider 
range of individuals through their 
financial advisers . Assets now exceed 
£1 . 2bn (11 . 6% of FUM), held either 
directly with us or through a platform . 
Our MPS proposition has seen rapid 
growth throughout the year, a trend 
that we expect to continue as the 
popularity of model multi-asset 
portfolios continues to grow .
As a Group, we have maintained the 
focus on our Strategic Alliances which 
form a major part of our approach to 
the adviser market . We are pleased 
that we have completed two further 
Strategic Alliances, including our first 
international partnership with Abacus 
Financial Consultants based in the 
UAE . In the UK, we were co-founders 
of the DFM Alliance, a joint initiative 
with other leading discretionary fund 
managers offering advisers a platform 
for improving client outcomes 
through information, education and 
collaboration . We have also continued 
to invest in our geographic footprint of 
offices across the UK to deliver high 
service levels to our local adviser 
partners and I am delighted to confirm 
that we opened a new office in Cardiff 
in July 2017 , allowing us to access new 
growth opportunities in a region we 
have not previously been able to 
serve fully .
Our Funds business passed the £1bn 
milestone of FUM, enjoying its most 
successful year to date and generating 
a profit for the first time . It remains our 
intention to complete the previously 
announced move of the Funds 
business into Investment 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
C O NT I N U E D   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  05
Chief Executive’s review
 continued
Review of business continued
Management this financial year, subject 
to regulatory approval . The IFSL Brooks 
Macdonald Defensive Capital Fund, 
within the targeted absolute return 
sector, celebrated an impressive 
seventh anniversary year, with FUM 
reaching £393m as at 30 June 2017 
(2016: £223m) and now over £425m . 
The fund received several positive 
ratings in 2017 , including an Elite Rating 
by FundCalibre and Five Crowns by 
Financial Express (FE) Crown Fund 
Ratings based on its performance . Our 
Multi-Asset Funds also saw significant 
growth during the year . Earlier this 
year, the partners of North Row Capital 
LLP, in which the Group held a 60% 
stake, decided to terminate the fund, 
resulting in an impairment loss of 
£0 . 2m (2016: £0 . 4m) .
Our International business based in 
the Channel Islands delivered good 
growth, with discretionary FUM 
increasing by 13 . 4% from £1 . 3bn to 
£1 .5bn over the past year and having 
doubled since acquisition in 2012 . 
Whilst we have seen local professional 
intermediary relationships impacted to 
some extent by the legacy matters 
referred to below, the successful 
restructuring of BM Retirement 
Services International (“BMRSI”) to a 
restricted financial planning business 
in the Channel Islands, the expansion 
of our distribution efforts to include 
international advisers and our work to 
build business flow from South Africa 
have all borne fruit this past year . 
We have now largely completed the 
move away from advisory work and 
our discretionary fund management 
offering has performed well, winning 
the award for Best International 
Discretionary Fund Manager at the 
International Fund and Product 
Awards . Together with the actions we 
are taking to deal proactively with the 
legacy matters, we start the coming 
year in a stronger position .
Financial Planning also had a strong 
year, driven in part by a number of 
one-off pension advice opportunities, 
generating record revenue and profits . 
We continue to focus on delivering a 
comprehensive independent financial 
planning service to private clients and 
on seeking new opportunities to 
support future growth .
Sale of our Property 
Management business
We recently completed a review of 
Braemar Estates and have taken the 
decision to sell the business, enabling 
us to focus more closely on our core 
offerings . This will allow us to operate 
with a more streamlined business and 
will contribute over time to improved 
margins . We exchanged contracts on 
20 September 2017 and on completion 
of the sale, which is expected by the 
calendar year end, the Group’s property 
management division will cease to 
exist . Investment management of the 
Ground Rents Income Fund will be 
retained by Funds .
In the financial year completed, 
Braemar Estates represented 3 . 2% of 
the Group’s revenue (£2 . 9m), 0 . 7% of its 
underlying profit (£126,000), 1 . 4% of its 
statutory profit (£112,000) and -0 . 6% of 
its net assets (Braemar has net liabilities 
of £0 .5m) . The sale price is £1 . 9m, with 
an initial 50% to be paid on completion 
and the remainder deferred, payable 
over a two-year period from the 
completion date .
Legacy matters arising from the 
former Spearpoint business
As announced in July, following a 
detailed review, we decided to deal 
proactively with certain legacy matters 
arising from the former Spearpoint 
business which we acquired in 2012 . 
These matters relate to a number of 
discretionary portfolios formerly 
managed by Spearpoint, now managed 
by our International business, and a 
Dublin-based fund, for which 
Spearpoint acted as investment 
manager . While we accept no legal 
liability, we have a deep commitment to 
treating customers fairly and seeking 
to protect our clients’ best interests . 
We believe that by taking this action it 
will assist us in building stronger 
relationships with professional 
intermediaries in the Channel Islands 
and their clients . We are now in contact 
with the relevant parties . We anticipate 
that this action will cost £6 .5m and 
have made a provision for it 
accordingly . As this is an exceptional 
cost it is not included in our underlying 
profit for the year . 
Investment in our infrastructure
Our IT system development was 
delivered as planned at the end of 
June 2017 . This involved the migration 
of data from two legacy systems in the 
Channel Islands on to a common 
platform shared with our UK portfolio 
management business . As part of this 
process we consolidated our two back 
office functions into one, based in the 
City of London, to serve all clients of 
the Group moving forwards . As a 
consequence, our Guernsey-based 
back office will close in September, 
resulting in the redundancy of the 
impacted staff . The redundancy costs 
were provided for in the financial year 
completed . Some further post 
migration work remains, which will 
complete by the calendar year end .
We are continuing to review the 
opportunity to align and simplify 
processes and take further actions to 
deliver economies of scale as the Group 
grows . We will continue to invest 
further in our infrastructure to support 
our investment teams, to enhance 
our service to clients and to facilitate 
the ease of interactions with the 
intermediaries we work with, as well 
as delivering broader efficiencies . 
The appointment of a Chief Operating 
Officer will be an important step in 
ensuring we can grow our business 
materially and sustainably, whilst 
pursuing greater efficiency and 
progressively improving our margins .

Chief Executive’s review

Investing in our risk 
management framework
The investment management industry 
is currently experiencing a period of 
significant regulatory change and the 
Group has been preparing for the 
introduction of MiFID II, Senior 
Managers and Certification Regime 
(“SMCR”) and the General Data 
Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), 
amongst other changes . Extension of 
the SMCR to investment firms is 
expected in 2018, with the Group 
included within the ‘Enhanced Regime’ 
as we are now categorised as a 
significant investment firm for 
prudential purposes under FCA rules . 
This categorisation has also increased 
the regulatory reporting requirements 
for the Group more broadly .
Given this context and to position 
the business for future growth, it is 
important that we now invest more 
broadly in our regulatory and risk 
management capabilities . We 
announced in July an increase in our 
capabilities, including the appointment 
of a Chief Risk Officer, to provide the 
support needed to our investment 
teams and ensure that we can continue 
to meet and exceed the expectations of 
our clients and regulators, as well as the 
aforementioned plan to appoint a Chief 
Operating Officer . This will result in a 
much stronger platform for delivering 
sustainable growth in the future . 
These investments are expected 
to result in additional operating 
expenditure of approximately £4m 
in the next financial year, of which 
approximately £2m will recur in 
subsequent years .
Outlook
As we continue to invest in the Group, 
I look forward to building on our 
success to date and positioning the 
business to deliver growth into the 
future . To achieve this, our principal 
focus will be on delivering value for our 
clients and partners through enhancing 
the services we provide, improving 
business efficiency and continuing to 
adapt to the fast changing competitive 
and regulatory environment .
During the financial year we have seen 
further consolidation across the sector 
given the need for investment in 
technology and in response to 
regulatory changes . We expect this to 
continue as companies seek scale and 
cost savings . We strongly believe in our 
future as an independent discretionary 
fund manager and will continue to look 
at acquisition opportunities when they 
arise, to complement our organic 
growth plans .
We have started our new financial 
year with positive momentum and 
we look forward with confidence 
notwithstanding our relative caution 
around markets and client sentiment .
I would like to reiterate my thanks to 
everyone at Brooks Macdonald for their 
welcome, and for their hard work and 
commitment to the business .

staff costs, 30 . 8% (2016: 27 . 2%) were variable costs . We have continued to invest in our IT systems across all parts of the 
Group, to support our investment teams and to enhance the service offered to our clients . At the end of the year we delivered 
our large IT project to provide a common portfolio management platform across both the UK and Channel Islands, involving 
the migration of data from two legacy systems . The new system will provide increased consistency and capacity across the 
Group and with the planned closure of our Guernsey-based back office in September 2017 it will enable us to deliver further 
operational efficiencies . Some additional post migration work remains to be completed over the course of the next financial 
year and we will continue to take additional action to align and simplify processes so that we benefit from further economies 
of scale .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  09

Operating costs  continued
We continue to operate in an increasingly regulated environment and we have again strengthened our legal, risk and 
compliance departments by additional recruitment over the last financial year . In 2017 , we saw the costs of the levy paid to 
the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) stabilise at £0 .5m (2016: £0 .5m) .
Net financial income and gains
When the Group makes an acquisition it typically structures the deal whereby there are deferred payments to the vendors 
over a number of years against pre-agreed funds under management targets . Where these targets change due to unpredictable 
variables such as new business, client retention and market movements then the value of the deferred consideration changes 
and these fair value adjustments are made through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income . 
During the year one of the original FUM targets for Levitas was not achieved, resulting in a reduction in the amount payable 
to the vendors of the business . Accordingly, as more fully explained in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, there 
was a fair value reduction of £2 . 2m (2016: £3 . 6m) resulting in a gain to consolidated income . As well as a reduction in the 
deferred consideration payable, this lower level of FUM has resulted in an impairment charge of £2 . 0m to the carrying value 
of goodwill in respect of Levitas as detailed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements .
As disclosed more fully in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the partners of North Row Capital LLP, in which 
the Group held a 60% interest, decided to terminate the fund resulting in an impairment loss of £0 . 2m (2016: £0 . 4m) .
Included in the total net financial income and gains for the year is both the fair value reduction for Levitas and the impairment 
charge to goodwill, together with other financial income, costs and the Group’s share of joint venture results as detailed on the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the accompanying notes .
Underlying profit before tax 
Underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share are non GAAP alternative performance measures, considered 
by the board to be a better reflection of true business performance than looking at the Group’s results on a statutory basis only . 
These measures are widely used by research analysts covering the Company . Underlying results exclude expenditure falling 
into the categories explained below and a full reconciliation between underlying profit and the profit attributable to 
shareholders is provided in the following table .

Amortisation of intangible assets (note 13)
As explained in notes 2(d) and 2(m), client relationship intangible assets and contracts acquired with fund managers are 
created in the course of acquiring funds under management . The total amortisation charge for the year of £3 . 9m 
(2016: £2 . 6m) associated with these and other intangible assets has been excluded from underlying profit as the directors 
consider these costs can distort the results of a particular period . During the year the Group completed a large software 
project in order to provide a more fully integrated investment management system covering both the onshore and offshore 
businesses, with an improved client portal and client relationship management system . This resulted in an increase in the 
software amortisation charge of £1 . 2m as part of the overall increase in amortisation of intangible assets for the year of £1 . 3m .

Finance cost and changes in fair value of deferred consideration
When the Group makes acquisitions of both corporate entities and teams of fund managers in the course of acquiring funds 
under management the typical structure of the acquisition, in order to continue to incentivise and motivate the vendors, is to 
make deferred payments over a period of time based on the retention and growth in funds under management . The initial 
estimated fair value of the deferred payments will be based on future projections of funds under management and where the 
actual payment is different from the original estimates then charges or credits will be made in arriving at the profit before tax . 
The directors consider that the effect of these changes to the original projected payments can distort the results of a 
particular period and have therefore excluded them from underlying profit . 
Initial estimates of the deferred cash payments are recognised in the financial statements at their present value based on an 
inherent rate of implied interest . The difference between the discounted present value of deferred consideration and the 
estimated future cash payment is recognised as a charge over the duration of the deferral period in arriving at profit before 
tax . The directors consider that this charge, which is a non-cash item, can distort the results of a particular period and have 
therefore excluded the charge from underlying profit .
Impairment in carrying value of goodwill
As explained in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment based on the 
carrying value of the asset compared to its expected recoverable amount . As a result of a lower level of FUM in Levitas, 
resulting in reduction in the deferred consideration as detailed above, there has been an impairment to the carrying value of 
£2 . 0m due to a reduction in the estimated value-in-use of the business . The directors consider that this charge, which is a 
non-cash item, can distort the results of a particular period and have therefore excluded the charge from underlying profit .
Exceptional costs of resolving legacy matters 
As detailed in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements we have decided to deal with two legacy matters arising from 
the former Spearpoint business in the Channel Islands which we acquired in 2012 . These matters relate to the investment 
management of a number of discretionary client portfolios and a Dublin-based fund and we have decided to make a 
provision of £6 .5m in order to resolve them . The board consider that this is an exceptional item relating to historic matters 
and its impact on statutory profit does not give a true reflection of the underlying performance of the Group .
Cash resources and regulatory capital
The Group is cash generative and, as detailed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, there was an increase in cash 
resources at the year end of £12 . 7m to £32 . 2m (2016: £19 .5m) . The Group had no borrowings at 30 June 2017 (2016: £nil) .
As required under Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules and those of both Jersey and Guernsey Financial Services 
Commissions we perform a regular Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Adjusted Net Liquid Asset 
(ANLA) calculation which includes performing a range of stress tests to determine the appropriate level of regulatory capital 
and liquidity that the Group needs to hold . Surplus levels of capital are forecast taking into account investment requirements 
and proposed dividends to ensure that appropriate buffers are maintained . The Group’s Pillar 3 disclosures are published 
annually on our website (www . brooksmacdonald . com) .
Segmental review
The Group reports its results in four key operating segments: Investment Management; Financial Planning; Funds and 
Property Management; and International . 
Investment management 
The UK based investment management service continues to remain the core part of the Group contributing 71 . 7% 
(2016: 72 . 1%) of the Group revenue . Investment Management principally provides discretionary investment management to 
private investors, pension funds, charities and trusts through BPS and MPS . Despite considerable changes within the industry 
and volatility within the financial markets we have continued to grow FUM as shown in the table on page 8 .

Segmental review continued
Financial planning
The Financial Planning business continues to deliver both fee based financial advice to high net-worth families, and 
employee benefit consultancy to small and medium sized employers throughout the UK . The division remains a major 
introducer of new investment management funds to the investment management part of the Group and it was the growth in 
this area which was the major contributor to the 19% increase in revenue and the profit for the year of £0 . 3m compared to the 
previous year’s loss of £0 . 1m . 
Funds and property management
The funds business continues to grow in scale with total FUM increased by 45 . 6% to £1,159m (2016: £796m) at 30 June 2017 . 
This growth was achieved organically through net new investment across the range of funds with the Defensive Capital Fund 
now over £400m FUM .
The Property Management business had another improved year with an increase in revenue of 16 . 4% over the previous year 
and reported a profit for the year compared to breakeven in 2016 . 
International
The business saw an increase of FUM during the year of 13 . 4% to £1 .5bn (2016: £1 . 3bn) with new business from a number of 
sources and the first strategic alliance with an overseas introducer in Dubai together with increased flows from South Africa . 
Revenue in the year increased by 8 . 4% although increased legal costs continuing to deal with some legacy matters and the 
closure costs of £0 . 3m associated with the transfer of the operations department from Guernsey to London have resulted in 
a fall in underlying profit to £0 .5m (2016: £0 . 8m) . 
Following the results of a review we have decided to deal proactively with certain legacy matters where the former 
Spearpoint business acted as investment manager to a number of discretionary clients and to a Dublin based fund . As well as 
these issues consuming management time, the Group was incurring associated costs, so in order to treat our clients fairly and 
to protect their best interests we have made a provision during the year of £6 .5m in order to resolve these matters, resulting in 
a statutory loss before tax for the year of £6 . 6m (2016: £0 . 4m profit) . 
Since the acquisition of the Channel Islands business discretionary FUM have grown from £0 . 6bn to over £1 .5bn at 30 June 
2017 and following the satisfactory resolution of the former Spearpoint matters the board believes that the business will see 
an increase in profit in the next financial year .
Group and consolidation adjustments
The costs charged through this segment represent the costs of running the Group’s parent company, including the costs of 
the board members, the costs of running the plc and other central costs which are not directly related to the trading segments 
of the Group . 
Consolidation adjustments, impairment of goodwill, amortisation of client relationship intangible assets and changes in the 
fair value of deferred consideration in respect of the Company’s assets are included within this segment .
Corporate governance
The board’s primary focus is to ensure the business is successful in the long-term for the benefit of our shareholders and other 
stakeholders . The board had eight meetings during the year and met informally on a number of occasions . As part of the 
preparation for each board meeting written papers are prepared on the progress of the each part of the Group together with 
updates on the progress of agreed strategic initiatives . 
The board includes the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman and three other non-executive directors . It considers Colin Harris, 
the Senior Independent Director, Diane Seymour-Williams and Richard Price to be independent . Biographies of each of the 
directors are available on the Brooks Macdonald Group website (www . brooksmacdonald . com) .

The board is supported in its work by four committees: the Audit Committee; the Nominations Committee; the Remuneration 
Committee; and the Risk and Compliance Committee . The detailed terms of reference of each of the committees are also 
available on the Brooks Macdonald Group website . Commentary on the work of each of the committees is set out below .
Audit Committee
The key responsibilities of the Audit Committee are:
• to review the Group’s accounting procedures and internal financial controls;
• to review the reporting of financial and other information to the shareholders of the Company and to monitor the integrity of 
the financial statements;
• to review the effectiveness of the external audit process and the independence and objectivity of the external auditors; and
• to report to the board on how it has discharged its responsibilities .
The membership of the committee comprises Richard Price (Chairman), Christopher Knight and Colin Harris . The board is 
satisfied that all members of the committee have recent and relevant financial experience . In addition, committee meetings 
are normally attended by the Group Chief Executive, the Finance Director and by representatives of the external auditors by 
way of invitation . The committee meets with representatives of the external auditors without management present at least 
once a year .
The committee met five times during the year with meetings structured around the financial calendar of the Company . 
The committee considered the significant financial and audit issues, the judgements made in connection with the financial 
statements and reviewed the narrative within the Annual Report and Accounts and the Half Yearly Financial Report . 
Specifically, the committee discussed the provision of £6 .5m for the exceptional costs relating to the resolution of legacy 
matters in the International business summarised in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements and the impairment 
charge of £2 . 0m in respect of the carrying value of the Levitas cash generating unit as disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated 
financial statements .
The committee also agreed the audit fee shown in note 7 to the financial statements and reviewed the audit engagement letter .
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee was established as a committee of the board on 13 March 2017 with Christopher Knight as 
Chairman and the Company’s three non-executive directors, Colin Harris, Diane Seymour-Williams and Richard Price, as 
members . Chris Macdonald was appointed a member of the committee on 11 April 2017 on his retirement as Chief Executive 
and his becoming a non-executive director . Since then the committee has met on one occasion .
The terms of reference have been approved by the Group board and will be reviewed regularly . Responsibilities of the 
committee include evaluating the effectiveness of the Group board taking into consideration its structure, size and 
composition (including the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity) and for making recommendations to the Group board 
with regard to any changes . It is also responsible for succession planning for directors and other senior executives, taking into 
account the challenges and opportunities facing the Group, and the skills and expertise needed on the board in the future . An 
important part of this is to consider the diversity of the Group board and senior management in all respects, including gender . 
Prior to the formal establishment of the committee the same group of non-executive directors (excluding Chris Macdonald) 
were responsible for planning for the appointment of a successor to Chris Macdonald as Chief Executive . The planning 
process involved consideration of the role and of the experience and attributes the role required, the appointment of 
recruitment consultants, the assessment of and interviews with internal and external candidates, leading to the decision in 
October 2016 to appoint Caroline Connellan as the next Chief Executive .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  13

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Diane Seymour-Williams (Chair), Christopher Knight and Colin Harris . The 
committee, following consultation with the Chief Executive, determines the specific remuneration packages for each 
executive director and certain senior executives including base salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives, benefits and 
terms of employment . The committee met on six occasions during the year and is wholly responsible for determining the 
remuneration of the Chief Executive and senior risk and compliance staff . The committee is also responsible for setting the 
broad parameters for the annual base salary review for all staff across the Group and reviews all awards made under the 
long-term incentive schemes .
Remuneration policy
Brooks Macdonald recognises the importance of its directors and employees to the success of the Group and consequently 
the remuneration policy is designed to be market competitive in order to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre individuals . 
The committee has reviewed the numerous regulatory changes and guidelines to ensure that the remuneration policies 
across the business are compliant where appropriate . External third party data is used to validate rather than to benchmark 
the total reward .
The remuneration policy, which applies to directors and employees of the Group, is based on the following key principles:
• designed to encourage the retention of staff through deferred variable compensation, where appropriate; 
• to ensure a market competitive balanced package of benefits;
• inclusion of both annual and long term elements;
• fair for both the director/employee and the Company with some element of discretion;
• differentiation by merit and performance;
• an emphasis on variable, performance driven remuneration bonus payments funded from retained profits;
• compliant with financial services rules and regulations; 
• alignment with shareholders’ interests with significant long term equity participation; and 
• clarity, transparency and fairness of process .
The current remuneration package for an executive director has four main elements: basic salary and benefits, profit related 
bonus, long-term equity based incentives and pension . The total reward is designed to include a balance of fixed and variable 
pay with an element of deferral . 14  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Notes to the single total figure of remuneration for each director table
Salary and fees
Basic salary is paid monthly in cash through payroll determined by the committee and any changes are implemented from 
1 July each year or when an individual changes position or responsibility . In deciding appropriate levels the committee 
considers salaries throughout the Group and information on comparable companies of a similar size and complexity 
provided by advisers to the committee . The views of the Chief Executive are taken into consideration when setting the salary 
of other directors . The base salaries of executive directors were increased on 1 July 2016 by a total of 2 . 0% compared to an 
overall average increase for all employees of 3 . 7% .
Non-executive directors’ fees
The non-executive directors’ fees were similarly reviewed and increased with the approval of the executive board members 
to reflect their additional responsibilities and commitments as the Group grows .
The Chairman’s fee was increased from £92,000 to £115,000 on 1 October 2016 and the basic non-executive director’s fee was 
increased from £42,000 to £46,000 on 1 October 2016 . Non-executive directors also receive an additional responsibility fee of 
£4,000 per annum in recognition of their chairing a committee . Colin Harris receives an additional fee of £10,000 for being the 
Senior Independent Director .
Chris Macdonald was appointed to the board as an additional non-executive director on 11 April 2017 and receives an annual 
fee of £75,000 for his services .
Taxable benefits 
Benefits are provided to the directors to complement the remuneration package and may include, for example private 
medical insurance for directors and their dependants, death in service cover, critical illness and permanent health insurance, 
annual medicals, Save As You Earn scheme, and the provision of interest free season ticket loans .
Taxable benefits are the provision of private medical insurance for the executives and their dependants and the provision of 
interest free season ticket loans as disclosed in note 34 to the consolidated financial statements .
Annual bonus
Awards to executive directors and some other senior employees of the Group of profit related bonuses are made from a pool 
of profits of 5-15% of the Group pre-tax profit after the payment of all bonuses to all other staff .
The committee determines the overall size of the pool based on the performance of the Group against a number of key 
performance indicators including the growth in profits, the movement in funds under management, various internal client 
service metrics and the performance against budget of each of the operating divisions . 
The total payment to executive directors in respect of the year ended 30 June 2017 , including the amounts deferred into 
shares but excluding Chris Macdonald who resigned during the year, represents 10 . 1% (2016: 8 . 8%) of Group pre-tax profit . 
The total bonus payment to all senior employees who participate in this scheme is 15 . 6% (2016: 12 . 2%) .
Awards to individual executive directors are determined by the committee following objectives and measures proposed 
by chief executive, taking into account a number of financial and non-financial factors . These are intended to give a broad 
assessment of the annual performance objectives of each director, including the results of the business, investment 
performance, net new business, management of risks facing the Group and cost control within each individual’s area 
of responsibility . 
The Remuneration Committee has decided that 20% of the bonus awarded will be made in shares deferred for a period of 
three years under a Long Term Incentive Scheme (“LTIS”) . In addition, directors may choose to defer a further amount of any 
bonus awarded, up to a maximum of 20%, making 40% in total, into shares under the LTIS .  16  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Long Term Incentive Scheme
The Remuneration Committee has made additional awards under the LTIS to certain executive directors and senior 
employees . The additional awards are subject to the same performance and other conditions as those applying to the 
deferred profit related bonus share options .
The LTIS awards reported are the historic awards vesting at the end of the three year cycle valued using the share price on 
the date of the vesting . In addition to the deferred element of the annual bonus described above the executive directors are 
awarded rights to acquire ordinary shares . The scheme has performance conditions attached to the deferred award, 
requiring a minimum growth in the diluted earnings per share of the Group of 2% per annum above the increase in the 
Retail Price Index (“RPI”) over the three year period .
In the case of a ‘bad’ leaver, all unvested awards will normally lapse . A ‘bad’ leaver is a director who leaves other than on 
retirement, redundancy, due to ill health or on the sale of the business unless the committee determines otherwise .
The committee may seek the recovery of awards at any time before the vesting of awards (malus) or within three years of 
vesting (clawback) if it determines that the financial results of the Company were materially misstated, if the Group is subject 
to a material adverse event (for example regulatory censure) or if an error was made in the calculation of the awards .
The Group established an employee benefit trust (“EBT”) on 3 December 2010 in order to acquire ordinary shares in the 
Company in connection with the deferred share element of the profit related bonus under the LTIS as detailed above . The EBT 
is also used for other long-term awards to members of the board and senior employees of the Group .
Pension related benefits
Executive directors may participate in the pension arrangements of the Group or receive cash in lieu of pension . The Group’s 
contributions in respect of executive directors are currently 15% of base salary .

Sharesave Scheme
All directors are entitled to take part in the HMRC approved Brooks Macdonald Group Sharesave Scheme on the same terms 
as all other employees . Annual invitations to participate in the scheme, which commences each year on 1 June, are sent to 
directors and option grants are made at 80% of the closing mid market price on the day of the offer . 
Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (“EMI”) 
The Brooks Macdonald Group Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (EMI) was adopted by the shareholders of the 
Company on 11 February 2005 . 
Options granted can be exercised if there has been an increase in the diluted earnings per share of the Company of at least 2% 
per annum more than the increase in the RPI over the period of three financial years starting with the financial year in which 
the date of grant falls and ending with the financial year in which the third anniversary of the date of grant falls .
Options may not normally be exercised before the third anniversary of the date of the grant and expire on the tenth 
anniversary of the grant . Due to the increase in the size of the Company it is no longer eligible under HMRC rules to grant 
options under this EMI scheme and the last options were awarded to directors of the group board under this scheme on 
17 October 2007 .
Company Share Option Plan (“CSOP”)
Following discussions regarding remuneration structures and incentives schemes for senior employees and directors the 
Company decided to set up a CSOP which was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting on 17 October 2013 
and by HMRC on 21 November 2013 .
The scheme is a discretionary scheme whereby employees or directors are granted an option to purchase the Company’s 
shares in the future at a price set on the date of the grant . The maximum award under the terms of the scheme for an 
individual at any one time is a total market value of £30,000 . There are performance conditions attaching to the scheme 
similar to those in place for the EMI Scheme above whereby there must be an increase in the diluted earnings per share of 
the Company of 2% more than the increase in the RPI over the three years starting with the financial year in which the 
option is granted .
Dilution
Not more than 15% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company (adjusted for bonus and rights issues) will be issued 
for all EMI and share incentive schemes operated by the Company in any ten year rolling period . The Company satisfies the 
various equity-based schemes it operates using a combination of market purchased, newly issued and treasury shares .
Service contracts for executive directors
The Company has service contracts with its executive directors with a notice period of 12 months and it is Company policy 
that such contracts should not normally contain periods of more than 12 months .
External appointments
Executive directors are encouraged to take on external appointments as non-executive directors but are discouraged from 
taking more than one other position given the time commitment . Prior approval of any new appointment is required by the 
board with any fees in excess of £15,000 per annum paid to the Company .
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors have a letter of appointment rather than contracts of employment . The executive directors are 
responsible for determining the fees of the non-executive directors who do not receive pension or other benefits from the 
Group and do not participate in any Group incentive schemes .

Plans for 2017/18
The committee has reviewed the remuneration policy in relation to senior executive directors, including those on the Group 
board during the year and have sought external advice from New Bridge Street, a part of AON . In particular, consideration 
was given to how well the existing policy was linked with strategy; the alignment of management interests with those of 
shareholders; and quanta . The committee consulted with major shareholders on a new remuneration structure and policy 
for these senior executive directors . This review and consultation occurred at a time when there were considerable 
developments in the debate amongst shareholders and their representatives, government and advisory bodies . As a result of 
feedback and in recognition of the ongoing industry debate, the committee resolved to introduce changes to the annual 
bonus arrangements with effect for the 2017/18 financial year and, during the course of that year, to review further the 
arrangements for an equity based long-term incentive scheme to replace the current Long Term Incentive Scheme . 
The overriding objectives remain for the policy to be linked to the Group’s strategy, aligned with shareholders’ interests with 
significant long term equity participation with both annual and long term elements and to be compliant with the relevant FCA 
regulations and other guidance . The scheme will be aligned with the board’s appetite for risk and aims to be fair for both 
employee and Company with due regard to market competitiveness, whilst retaining some element of discretion .
The changes agreed by the committee in relation to the annual bonus for senior executive directors are:
• The existing uncapped profit-sharing arrangement is replaced with a bonus structure under which participants have a defined 
maximum opportunity, set as a percentage of salary, which will not exceed 150% of salary for any executive .
• The bonus will be based on the following three measures in 201 7 /18:
• Underlying profit before tax (40%);
• Net organic growth in funds under management (20%); and
• Personal/strategic objectives (40%) .
• It is expected that the personal/strategic weighting is reduced in future years but, for 201 7 /18, a higher weighting is appropriate 
as the new CEO undertakes a thorough review of the business and its strategy, begins to implement it and as the Group prepares 
for the challenges resulting from MiFID II . The actual targets and objectives are commercially sensitive and therefore will not be 
disclosed in advance; however, the committee will seek to report the targets in next year’s report and provide commentary on 
how any bonus was arrived at .
• For financial metrics, a sliding scale of targets will be set around the budget for the year and account will be taken of market 
consensus .
• One third of any bonus earned will be deferred in shares for 2 years .
• Robust malus and clawback provisions will apply to any bonus earned, including the deferred element .
The committee has also considered the obligations of the Group under CRD IV to comply with the Remuneration Code 
under the FCA SYSC 19A Handbook . In accordance with the FCA’s guidance, the Group has dis-applied certain remuneration 
provisions relating to variable pay on the grounds of proportionality . These are the provisions known as the ‘pay-out process’ 
rules .

Risk and Compliance Committee
The Group’s risk management framework is designed to ensure risks are identified, managed and reported effectively at 
every level . At business-unit level, first-line systems and controls are employed to ensure business activities are conducted in 
compliance with internal policies and procedures . First-line supervision teams carry out monitoring of business activities on 
a day-to-day basis . In the second line of defence, an independent compliance monitoring function carries out further checks 
independent of the business . Output from both first and second line monitoring is reported to the relevant management 
committee and management information is reported to the business-level risk committees, the Executive Risk Management 
Committee, and the Risk and Compliance committee through the Group’s escalation policy . The risk function works with 
each business unit and central functions to implement a programme of risk and control self assessments to improve the 
identification and understanding of risk in the first line . Identified risks at each business unit are tracked in a business-level 
risk register and used as the basis for a consolidated risk register that provides the Risk and Compliance Committee with an 
overview of the key risks across the organisation . 
The membership of the Risk and Compliance Committee comprises: Colin Harris (Chair), Christopher Knight, Richard Price 
and Diane Seymour-Williams . Business managers and representatives from the legal, risk and compliance functions attend 
committee meetings as necessary to report on monitoring output, the results of risk and control assessments, key regulatory 
changes and developments, as well as changes to the risk register . The Risk and Compliance Committee is principally 
responsible for monitoring identified risks and the effectiveness of mitigating action, keeping risk assessment processes 
under review, reviewing the impact of key regulatory changes on the Group, assessing material breaches of risk limits and 
regulations as well as reviewing client complaints .
The Risk and Compliance Committee met on two occasions during the year ended 30 June 2017 .
The Group’s risk management framework is subject to ongoing review . The Group has been investing to meet the 
requirements of key regulatory changes, such as MiFID II, the General Data Protection Regulation and the Senior Managers & 
Certification Regime, and will continue to do so in the coming year . As a priority, the Group will be focusing on enhancing its 
risk management framework and increasing its capabilities with the appointment of a Chief Risk Officer .
The principal risks identified as having a potential material impact on the Group are detailed below, together with the 
principal means of mitigation .
Financial risks
The Group’s principal financial risks relate to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk and the measures and policies for the 
management of those risks are set out in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements . Further details on capital 
management processes can be found in note 32 .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  23
Strategic report
 continued
Risk and Compliance Committee continued
Non-financial risks
The significant non-financial risks faced by the Group have been reviewed by the committee, which believes they remain 
broadly the same as in previous years and are as follows:
Reputational risk
Impact
The Group has a growing reputation as a provider of high 
quality investment and wealth management services . 
There is a risk that significant damage to reputation could 
lead to the loss of existing clients as well as impacting on the 
ability to attract new clients, which would lead to a fall in 
financial income . Such risk could arise from events such as 
poor investment performance, poor client service or 
regulatory censure .
Mitigation 
This risk is minimised by ensuring the Group maintains a 
culture of high ethical and professional standards whilst 
focussing on delivering a first class service to all of our 
clients and intermediaries . The Group maintains separate, 
independent risk and compliance departments, which 
ensures conformity with the regulations of its key regulators, 
as well as relevant statutes, in all of our dealings with 
our clients .
Regulatory risk
Impact
The sector in which the Group operates is heavily regulated 
and any breach of regulations could lead to fines or 
disciplinary action against the Group or its staff . Through 
the business activities of its subsidiaries the Group is 
exposed to regulatory risks including those associated with 
the provision of investment and financial advice, the holding 
and custody of client money and assets, the suitability of its 
investment portfolios and financial crime .
Mitigation 
The Group monitors compliance with existing law and 
regulations and keeps abreast of future changes to assess the 
likely business impact and to ensure that the Group has 
sufficient resources to implement any necessary changes . 
The Group continued to invest in its Risk and Compliance 
functions during the year and is committed to further adding 
to the capabilities of these functions, in order to meet the 
challenges posed by future regulatory changes such as 
MIFID II, GDPR, etc .
People risk
Impact
Our business is dependent on client relationships with our 
staff . Operating in a competitive market there is a risk of loss 
of existing clients due to poor performance or service, a 
failure to respond to changes in the market place, or the loss 
of key investment professionals . The retention of staff who 
are not investment professionals e . g . those in Group and 
central functions is also a risk for the organisation .
Mitigation 
To minimise this risk, the Group continues to invest in its 
employees and monitors developments in the marketplace 
in which it operates to ensure that the Group continues to 
offer a wide range of services . Recruitment policies are 
designed to attract high quality staff and the Group regularly 
reviews and validates its remuneration packages and 
contractual arrangements and motivation is measured 
through a sentiment index . Structured training is provided 
by the Group’s learning & development team .
Cyber and data security risk
Impact
The Group holds approximately 40,000 client records in its 
systems containing personal data and financial data related 
to the Group’s clients . The Group represents a target for 
hackers and is at significant risk of attack .
Mitigation
The Group’s systems employ firewalls and other 
technological security features to prevent unauthorised 
access . User identification and password details are required 
in order to access the Group’s network and systems . 
Individual user access is restricted to specific areas of the 
network relevant to the user’s job role . As such, any access 
would be likely to be limited to specific areas of the network . 
Regular technological security checks are undertaken to 
validate the access rights of existing users . The IT system is 
duplicated in two remote data centres and data is carried 
over dark fibre connections . Data records are updated to 
provide a recovery point objective of one hour and a 
recovery time objective of one hour . 24  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report

Risk and Compliance Committee continued
Non-financial risks continued
Outsourcing risk
Impact
Where key systems are provided by outsourced providers, 
there is a risk of failure of the outsourcing partners or 
external suppliers . There are further risks in the on-boarding 
of outsourcing partners and ongoing support from them . 
The Group’s most significant outsourcing risk relates to its IT 
network infrastructure, which is provided by an outsourced 
service provider . 
Mitigation
Due diligence takes place prior to the commencement of any 
outsourcing or supplier relationship, to maintain a robust 
procurement process and good contract governance . We 
keep our key outsourcing partners under review and have in 
place procedures to regularly assess the performance of 
such suppliers as well as identifying suitable and viable 
alternatives . The Company has required that its outsourced 
IT services provider agrees contracts with third-party 
services providers that would allow for contracts to be 
novated immediately to Brooks Macdonald in the event of a 
business failure of the outsourced service provider .
Operational risk
Impact
There is a risk that the Group suffers a loss of business 
resulting from inadequate systems or controls, failed 
internal processes or human error .
Mitigation
The Group’s risk-management framework comprises 
ongoing monitoring, the application of detective and 
preventative controls and reporting of operational incidents 
by both the first and second line teams . The risk function 
works with businesses to conduct risk and control 
assessments, and external auditors and third party 
consultancies provide further ad hoc assurance .
Portfolio mandate risk
Impact
There is a risk that the Group breaches its investment 
mandates, agreed limits, investment objectives or client 
specified restrictions and benchmarks for its discretionary 
investment management clients . 
Mitigation
The Group uses a centralised investment proposition though 
which asset allocation is determined for a range of risk 
profiles . Investment managers have some flexibility within 
the asset allocation model but are monitored to ensure 
individual portfolios do not fall outside the broad asset 
allocation model . Portfolios are also monitored by a 
dedicated team using specialist portfolio risk management 
tools to ensure individual portfolios do not fall outside the 
permitted asset allocation model .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  25
Report of the directors
  
The directors present herewith 
their annual report, together with 
the audited financial statements of 
the Group for the year ended 
30 June 2017 .
Results and dividends
The profit before taxation for the year 
ended 30 June 2017 was £8,044,000 
(2016: £15,856,000) and the profit after 
taxation was £5,814,000 (2016: 
£12,739,000) .
The Company paid an interim 
dividend during the year of 15p 
(2016: 12 . 0p) per share . The directors 
recommend a final dividend of 26 . 0p 
(2016: 23 . 0p) per share . This results in 
total dividends for the year of 41 . 0p 
(2016: 35 . 0p) per ordinary share . 
These dividends amount to a total 
distribution to shareholders of 
£5,545,000 (2016: £4,715,000) in 
the year .
Retirement and re-appointment 
of directors
All of the directors of the Group board 
will retire by rotation at the annual 
general meeting and are eligible to 
nominate themselves for re-election . 
Richard Spencer and Simon 
Wombwell will not be seeking 
re-election to the board .
Directors’ indemnities 
The Company has made qualifying 
third party indemnity provisions 
for the benefit of its directors and 
these remain in force at the date of 
the report .
Employment policies 
Employees are encouraged to identify 
and become involved with the 
financial performance of the Group 
and are rewarded by involvement in 
profit sharing arrangements . 
Employees also have the opportunity 
to participate in the Group’s share 
incentive plans .
The Group considers that 
communication with our employees 
is very important and indeed vital for 
the success of the Group . Employees 
are informed of important issues by 
electronic mail and seminars .
The Group considers that regular 
training is extremely important . This is 
achieved by the provision of in-house 
and external training courses and the 
training team provide a number of 
continuing professional development 
activities . All members of staff are 
encouraged to report their specific 
training needs to their line managers, 
which are then co-ordinated through 
the central Learning and Development 
department .
The Group operates a graduate 
training scheme in respect of its 
trainee investment fund managers 
and financial planning consultants .
The Group is an equal opportunities 
employer . All job applicants and 
employees are treated fairly and on 
merit, regardless of their race, gender, 
marital status, age, disability, religious 
belief or sexual orientation . 
Applications from disabled persons 
are always considered and where 
employees become disabled efforts 
are made to continue their 
employment within the Group by 
providing training and the supply of 
equipment if necessary so that they 
are able to continue their role . 
All members of staff have the option 
to take an interest free annual season 
ticket loan . To retain the Group’s 
employees and to improve staff 
morale, the Group recognises the need 
for employees to have an appropriate

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
  
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations .
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year . Under that law the 
directors have prepared the Group 
and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union . Under company law 
the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Company and Group for 
that period . In preparing these 
financial statements, the directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and 
IFRSs issued by IASB have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business .
The directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation . They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities .
The directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website . Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions .
The directors consider that the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for 
shareholders to assess a company’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy .
 
Each of the directors, whose names 
and functions are listed in the Report 
of the Directors confirm that, to the 
best of their knowledge:
• the Group and Company financial 
statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the 
Group; and
• the Strategic Report and the Report 
of the Directors include a fair review 
of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with 
a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces .

TO THE MEMBERS OF BROOKS MACDONALD GROUP PLC
 
Report on the audit of the 
financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Brooks Macdonald 
Group plc’s group financial statements 
and company financial statements 
(the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state 
of the group’s and of the company’s 
affairs as at 30 June 201 7 and of the 
group’s profit, and the group’s and 
company’s cash flows for the year 
then ended;
• have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and, as 
regards the company’s financial 
statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 .
We have audited the financial 
statements, included within the 
Annual Report and Accounts (the 
“Annual Report”), which comprise: 
the group and parent company 
statements of financial position as at 
30 June 2017 , the group statement of 
comprehensive income, the group 
and parent company statements of 
cash flows, and the group and parent 
company statements of changes in 
equity for the year then ended; and 
the notes to the financial statements, 
which include a description of the 
significant accounting policies .
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in 
accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs 
(UK)”) and applicable law . Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are 
further described in the Auditors’ 
responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements section of our 
report . We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion .
Independence
We remained independent of the 
group in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the 
UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, as applicable to listed 
entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements .
Our audit approach
Overview
• Overall group materiality: £727 ,000 (2016: £778,000), based on 5% of profit before tax, adjusted by 
the provision for resolving legacy matters .
• Overall company materiality: £502,000 (2016: £432,000), based on 1 % of net assets .
• The group has four business segments, Investment Management, Financial Planning, Funds and 
Property Management, and International, consisting of 21 legal entities operating in the UK and 
Channel Islands .
• We audited the complete financial information of three legal entities, due to their size and specific 
scope on a further three legal entities .
• Taken together, our audit work accounted for more than 84% of group revenues and 97% of group 
profit before tax and 81 % of group total assets .
• Valuation of Levitas goodwill and related deferred consideration
• Completeness of the provision for resolving legacy matters
• Recognition of investment management fee revenue   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  31

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF BROOKS MACDONALD GROUP PLC | 
C O NT I N U E D
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we 
determined materiality and assessed 
the risks of material misstatement in 
the financial statements . In particular, 
we looked at where the directors 
made subjective judgements, for 
example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering 
future events that are inherently 
uncertain . As in all of our audits we 
also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal 
controls, including evaluating 
whether there was evidence of bias by 
the directors that represented a risk of 
material misstatement due to fraud .
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters 
that, in the auditors’ professional 
judgement, were of most significance 
in the audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the 
most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the 
auditors, including those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit 
strategy; the allocation of resources in 
the audit; and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team . These matters, 
and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, 
were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters . 
This is not a complete list of all risks 
identified by our audit .

financial statements continued 32  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Valuation of Levitas goodwill and related deferred 
consideration
Refer to note 2 Principal accounting policies, note 13 Intangible 
assets and note 21 Deferred consideration.
The valuation of the Levitas Investment Management 
Limited (‘Levitas’) cash generating unit requires 
management to make a number of significant judgements 
which may materially affect the valuation, such as 
forecasted funds under management (‘FUM’), and related 
cash-flows, discount and growth rates, in order to calculate 
the ‘value in use’ . Forecasted FUM also drives 
management’s fair valuation of deferred consideration 
payable, initially recognised at the time of acquisition .
The Levitas goodwill represents £9 . 3m of the group’s 
intangible assets after recognising a £2 . 0m impairment loss 
during the year . The deferred consideration at the balance 
sheet date was £3 . 4m, with a gain of £2 . 2m recognised 
during the year in relation to the decrease in fair value .
The size of the balances and the significant degree of 
judgement involved in the group’s valuations makes this a 
key audit matter .
We obtained management’s impairment review of the 
Levitas goodwill and performed the following:
• We evaluated management’s valuation methodology 
against the requirements in IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’ .
• We obtained the 5-year forecasted FUM and related 
revenues and expenses that were board approved and 
challenged the drivers of the forecasted FUM and 
considered the accuracy of management’s forecasting 
process, with reference to historic results .
• We tested and challenged the reasonableness of key 
assumptions including the discount rate and long term 
growth rates using available market information .
• We tested management’s sensitivity analysis to determine 
the impact of changes in the key assumptions .
• We evaluated the appropriateness of the impairment 
disclosures included in the group financial statements .
We performed the following procedures over management’s 
deferred consideration fair valuation:
• We agreed the basis of the calculation to the contractual 
terms and evaluated management’s valuation methodology 
against the requirements in IFRS 13 ‘Fair value’ .
• We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s 
calculation, agreed the FUM at the 201 7 contractual 
measurement date to the external administrator statement 
and agreed cash payments during the year to bank 
statements .
• We agreed forecasted FUM up to the final contractual 
measurement date (November 2018) to management’s 
forecasted FUM which we tested as part the goodwill 
impairment testing .
• We reviewed the disclosures made in the financial 
statements to determine their adequacy .
Based on the work performed above, management’s 
impairment review and deferred consideration valuation 
approaches are reasonable .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  33
Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Brooks Macdonald Group plc | continued
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Completeness of the provision for legacy matters
Refer to note 2 Principal accounting policies and note 24 
Provisions.
The group recognised a provision of £6 .5m in relation to 
legacy matters in the International business . The size of the 
provision makes this a key audit matter .
Management is required to make estimates in respect of the 
completeness of the provision in accordance with IAS 37 
‘provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’ .
We performed the following procedures in relation to the 
completeness of the provision for legacy matters:
• We understood the nature of the legacy matters and 
assessed management’s accounting treatment in line with 
the IAS 37 conditions to recognise a provision .  
• We understood from management and board members 
the rationale for estimating the amount of provision to be 
recognised .
• We evaluated the methodology used, and the supporting 
evidence to calculate the provision . 
• We read correspondence with legal advisors, consultants 
and regulators, as well as the group’s press releases, for 
any matters which we were not previously made aware 
of and which could indicate that the provision may not 
be complete . 
• We reviewed the disclosures made in the financial 
statements to determine their adequacy .
On the basis of the procedures performed the provision 
recognised appears reasonable .
  
Recognition of investment management fee income 
Refer to note 2 Principal accounting policies and note 4 
Revenue.
Investment management fee income is generated by the 
Brooks Macdonald Asset Management Limited (‘BMAM’) 
and Brooks Macdonald Asset Management (International) 
Limited (‘BMI’) entities and is included within portfolio 
management fee income in the notes to the financial 
statements . The investment management fee income 
component represents 57% of the group’s £91 . 7m total 
revenue . This is a key audit matter due to its size and the 
significant audit effort involved in testing this revenue 
stream .
The fees are calculated by applying each client’s fee rate to 
their FUM . The calculation is largely automated, however 
there are a number of inherent risks including the 
interpretation and manual input of key contractual terms 
and the completeness and valuation of funds under 
management, which could result in errors .
We performed the following procedures in relation to 
investment management fee income:
• We understood and evaluated the design and 
implementation of key controls, including relevant 
Information Technology (IT) controls, in place around the 
investment management fee process .
• We tested IT general controls over the BMAM portfolio 
management system and relevant automated controls over 
the mathematical accuracy of the investment management 
fee calculation and the pricing data feed used to value FUM .
• For BMI, we tested the accuracy of fees, by recalculating the 
fee for a sample of clients .
For both BMAM and BMI:
• We agreed, for a sample, fee rates input into the systems to 
client contracts .
• We tested a sample of management’s FUM reconciliations to 
external custodians .
• We tested the valuation of a sample of assets against 
independent market prices .
• We reconciled the fees calculated by the portfolio 
management systems to the general ledger postings and 
investigated material differences . 
Our testing did not identify any evidence of material 
misstatement . 34  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Brooks Macdonald Group plc | continued
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the company to communicate in our report .
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and 
the industry in which the group operates . 
The group is composed of the company, incorporated in the UK, and subsidiary entities in the UK and Channel Islands . The 
group’s accounting process is structured around a centralised finance function in the UK . 
In establishing the overall approach to the audit of the group, we considered our assessment of the risk of material 
misstatement . We determined that three entities (Brooks Macdonald group plc, Brooks Macdonald Asset Management 
Limited and Brooks Macdonald Asset Management (International) Limited) generated significant activities or balances to the 
results of the group through the consideration of various factors such as their contribution to the group’s profit before tax and 
to provide sufficient evidence over each line item in the group’s financial statements . We supplemented this with additional 
testing over certain balances (such as cash, property, plant and equipment and trade and other receivables and payables) 
which were recognised within entities not fully in scope of the group audit . Taken together, our audit work accounted for 
more than 84% of group revenues and 97% of group profit before tax and 81% of group total assets . 
We determined the audit work that needed to be performed by us, as the group engagement team, or by local PwC network 
firms . Where the work was performed by a local audit team, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the 
audit work to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion 
on the group financial statements as a whole . In connection with this year’s audit the group team met with the local Channel 
Islands audit team leader and held regular discussions with the team throughout the audit process .
The group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of group items, including valuation of goodwill and 
intangibles, share based payments, expense recharges and the provision for resolving legacy matters were audited by the 
group engagement team .
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality . We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality . 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole .
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
  Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £727,000 (2016: £778,000) . £502,000 (2016: £432,000) .
   
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax, adjusted for the 
provision for resolving legacy matters .
1% of net assets .
   
Rationale for benchmark applied We have adjusted profit before tax for 
the provision for resolving legacy 
matters of £6 .5m, which we consider to 
be an exceptional and non-recurring 
item . Due to its size, this item distorts 
the basis of the calculation .
1% of net assets is a commonly used 
industry benchmark for holding entities 
such as the company .
   
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality . 
Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality .
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £36,000 
(group audit) (2016: £39,000) and £25,000 (company audit) (2016: £22,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts 
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  35

Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when: 
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or 
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the group’s and company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue .
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s and 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern .
Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our 
auditors’ report thereon . The directors are responsible for the other information . Our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon . 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated . If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information . If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact . We have nothing to report based 
on these responsibilities .
With respect to the Strategic Report and Report of the Directors, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the 
UK Companies Act 2006 have been included .
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to 
report certain opinions and matters as described below .
Strategic Report and Report of the Directors
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Report of the Directors for the year ended 30 June 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements . 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Report of the Directors . 36  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Independent auditors’ report

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 27 , the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view . The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error .
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so .
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion . Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists . Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements .
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www .frc . org . uk/auditorsresponsibilities . This description forms part of our auditors’ report .
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose . We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing .
Other required reporting
Opinion
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns .
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility .

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOW
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017
    Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  41
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 30 June 2017 
1. General information
Brooks Macdonald Group plc (“the Company”) is the parent company of a group of companies (”the Group”), which offers a 
range of investment management services and related professional advice to private high net worth individuals, charities 
and trusts . The Group also provides financial planning as well as offshore fund management and administration services and 
acts as fund manager to regulated OEICs, providing specialist funds in the property and structured return sectors and 
managing property assets on behalf of these funds and other clients .
The Company is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 
2006 and listed on AIM . The address of its registered office is 72 Welbeck Street, London, W1G 0AY .
2. Principal accounting policies
The general accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below . These policies have 
been applied consistently to all years presented, unless otherwise stated .
a) Basis of preparation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations, as adopted by the European Union and the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS . The financial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of available for sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss such that they are measured at their fair value .
At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future . Accordingly, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements .
b) Basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements are a consolidation of the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries . The 
underlying financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent 
accounting policies . Subsidiaries and structured entities are all entities controlled by the Company, deemed to exist where 
the Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity . The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included from the date on 
which control is transferred to the Group to the date that control ceases .
All intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are eliminated on consolidation .
The Group has disclosed all of its subsidiary undertakings in note 41 of the parent company’s financial statements . 
c) Changes in accounting policies
The Group’s accounting policies that have been applied in preparing these financial statements are consistent with those 
disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2016, except as explained below .
New accounting standards, amendments and interpretations adopted in the period
In the year ended 30 June 2017 , the Group did not adopt any new standards or amendments issued by the IASB or 
interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) that have had a material impact on the consolidated 
financial statements .

†
  
†
  Not yet endorsed for use in the EU
The impact of these changes is currently being reviewed and there is no intention to early adopt .
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
IFRS 15 could change how and when revenue is recognised . The primary impact is expected to be around the recognition of 
performance fees . Under IFRS 15, the Group will be required to make an assessment as to whether the work performed to 
earn such fees constitutes the transfer of services and, therefore, fulfils any performance obligation(s) . If so, these fees can be 
recognised when charged; if not, the fees can only be recognised in the period the services are provided . 
The Group currently recognises these when the probability of meeting the performance criteria is virtually certain . Some 
client agreements may need to be amended to ensure that any performance criteria are fully documented, but based upon a 
preliminary assessment the Group does not expect a material change to the recognition of its revenue arising from these 
revenue streams . 
The Group is still in the process of making an impact assessment and as yet any further impact has not been quantified .

2. Principal accounting policies continued
c) Changes in accounting policies continued
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
IFRS 9 changes the classification and measurement of financial assets . Financial assets will be classified into one of three 
categories: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVOCI) . The held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale categories available under IAS 39 have been 
removed . In addition, the classification criteria for allocating financial assets between categories are different under IFRS 9 . 
There is no material change to the classification of financial liabilities .
The Group does not expect the new classification bases to have a material impact on its financial assets . Those currently 
carried at amortised cost (including cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables) will continue to be classified as 
such . Some of the Group’s available for sale assets may be reclassified as FVTPL under IFRS 9 where the Group does not 
collect all contractual cash flows . Other available for sale assets comprise preference share holdings and these will likely be 
classified as FVOCI as the Group’s intention is to collect all contractual cash flows, being solely payments of principal and 
interest .
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
IFRS 16 will require the recognition of a right-of-use asset and associated lease liability for the office premises that are leased 
by the Group . The asset would be depreciated over the lease term and the liability would accrue interest, resulting in a 
front-loaded expense profile . 
This accounting treatment contrasts with the current treatment for operating leases, where no asset or liability is recognised 
and the lease payments are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the 
term of the lease . The total cost of the lease over the lease term is expected to be unchanged under the new standard .
d) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial information requires the use of assumptions, estimates and judgements about future conditions . 
Use of currently available information and application of judgement are inherent in the formation of estimates . Actual results 
in the future may differ from those reported . In this regard, the directors believe that the accounting policies where 
judgement is necessarily applied are those that relate to the measurement of intangible assets, deferred consideration, the 
estimation of the fair value of share-based payments and client compensation provisions .
The underlying assumptions made are reviewed on an ongoing basis . Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised only if the revision affects both current and future periods .
Further information about key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty are set out below .
Intangible assets
The Group has acquired client relationships and the associated investment management contracts as part of business 
combinations, through separate purchase or with newly employed teams of fund managers (as described in note 13) . In 
assessing the fair value of these assets the Group has estimated their finite life based on information about the typical length 
of existing client relationships . Contracts acquired with fund managers and acquired client relationship contracts are 
amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 20 years .
Goodwill recognised as part of a business combination is reviewed annually for impairment, or when a change in 
circumstances indicates that it might be impaired . The recoverable amounts of cash generating units are determined by 
value in use calculations, which require the use of estimates to derive the projected future cash flows attributable to each unit . 
Details of the more significant assumptions are given in note 13 .
Deferred consideration
As described in note 21, the Group has a deferred consideration balance in respect of the acquisition of Levitas Investment 
Management Services Limited in July 2014 . Deferred consideration is recognised at its fair value, being an estimate of the 
amount that will ultimately be payable in future periods . This has been calculated allowing for estimated growth in the 
acquired funds, discounted by the estimated cost of capital .

for the year ended 30 June 2017 | continued
2. Principal accounting policies continued
d) Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
Share-based payments
The Group operates various share-based payment schemes in respect of services received from certain employees . 
Estimating the fair value of these share-based payments requires the Group to apply an appropriate valuation model and 
determine the inputs to that model (note 28) . The charge to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in respect 
of share-based payments is calculated using assumptions about the number of eligible employees that will leave the Group 
and the number of employees that will satisfy the relevant performance conditions . These estimates are reviewed regularly .
Provisions 
The Group may receive complaints from clients in relation to the services provided . Complaints are assessed on a 
case-by-case basis and provisions are made where it is judged to be likely that compensation will be paid . The accounting 
policy for provisions and contingent liabilities is outlined in note 2(p) .
e) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed and described separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide 
further understanding of the underlying financial performance of the Group . These include material items of income or 
expense that are shown separately due to the significance of their nature and amount .
f) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method . The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair 
value of the aggregate amount of the consideration transferred at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any 
minority interest . Acquisition costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year 
of acquisition .
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification 
and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions at the 
acquisition date . If the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the Group’s previously held equity 
interest is re-measured at the acquisition date and the difference is credited or charged to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income . Identifiable assets and liabilities assumed on acquisition are recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position at their fair value at the date of acquisition .
Any contingent consideration to be paid by the Group to the vendor is recognised at its fair value at the acquisition date . 
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in accordance with IAS 39 in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over the acquired company’s net 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed . If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets acquired, 
the difference is recognised as a gain on a bargain purchase in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
Impairment
Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life are tested annually for impairment . For the purposes of 
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units that 
are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquisition are assigned 
to those units . The carrying amount of each cash generating unit is compared to its recoverable amount, which is determined 
using a discounted future cash flow model .
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or 
loss on disposal of the operation . Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the 
operation disposed of and the portion of the cash generating unit retained .

judgements   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  45
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

g) Fees, commissions and interest
Portfolio management fees and financial services commission
Portfolio management and other advisory and custody services are billed in arrears but are recognised over the period the 
service is provided . Fees are calculated on the basis of a percentage of the value of the portfolio over the period . Dealing 
charges are levied at the time a deal is placed for a client . Fees are only recognised when the fee amount can be estimated 
reliably and it is probable that the fee will be receivable . Amounts are shown net of rebates paid to significant investors .
Performance fees are earned from some clients when contractually agreed performance levels are exceeded within specified 
performance measurement periods . They are only recognised, at the end of these performance periods, when a reliable 
estimate of the fee can be made and it virtually certain that it will be received .
Advisory fees
Advisory fees are charged to clients using an hourly rate or by a fixed fee arrangement and are recognised over the period the 
service is provided . Commissions receivable and payable are accounted for in the period in which they are earned .
Fund management fees
Where amounts due are conditional on the successful completion of fund raising for investment vehicles, revenue is 
recognised where, in the opinion of the directors, there is reasonable certainty that sufficient funds have been raised to enable 
the successful operation of that investment vehicle . Amounts due on an annual basis for the management of third party 
investment vehicles are recognised on a time apportioned basis .
Property management fees
Property management fees are charged using a fixed fee agreement . Fees are recognised over the contractual period .
Interest
Interest receivable is recognised on an accruals basis .
h) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash comprises cash in hand and call deposits held with banks . Cash equivalents comprise short-term, highly liquid 
investments, with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition .
i) Share-based payments
Equity-settled schemes 
The Group engages in equity-settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain 
employees . The fair value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options on 
the grant date . This cost is then recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the vesting period, 
with a corresponding credit to equity .
The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of 
the option, the current share price, the risk free rate of interest, the expected volatility of the Company’s share price over the 
life of the award and other relevant factors .
j) Segmental reporting 
The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Group 
board of directors, which is the Group’s chief operating decision maker . 
k) Fiduciary activities 
The Group commonly acts as trustee and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf 
of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions . These assets and income arising thereon are excluded 
from these financial statements, as they are not assets of the Group .
The Group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the client money rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority . Such monies and the corresponding liability to clients are not included within the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position as the Group is not beneficially entitled thereto .

l) Property, plant and equipment 
All property, plant and equipment is included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at historical cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment . Costs include the original purchase cost of the asset and the costs attributable to 
bringing the asset into a working condition for its intended use .
Provision is made for depreciation to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset, using a straight line 
method, over its expected useful life as follows:
   
Fixtures and fittings 3 to 6 . 67 years
   
Equipment 5 years
   
Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease
   
Motor vehicles 4 years
   
The assets’ residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 
period . Gains and losses arising on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount . These are 
included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income . 
m) Intangible assets
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (4 to 20 years) .
Acquired client relationship contracts and contracts acquired with fund managers
Intangible assets are recognised where client relationship contracts are either separately acquired or acquired with 
investment managers who are employed by the Group . These are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently amortised 
on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic life . Separately acquired client relationship contracts are 
amortised over 15 to 20 years and those acquired with investment managers over 5 years . Both types of intangible asset are 
reviewed annually to determine whether there exists an indicator of impairment or an indicator that the assumed useful 
economic life has changed .
Computer software
Costs incurred on internally developed computer software are initially recognised at cost and when the software is available 
for use, the costs are amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of four years . Initial research costs and 
planning prior to a decision to proceed with development of software are recognised in the statement of profit and loss 
when incurred . 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising as part of a business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the fair value of the 
consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the separately identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at date of acquisition . In accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, goodwill is 
not amortised but is reviewed annually for impairment and is therefore stated at cost less any provision for impairment of 
value . Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and is not 
subsequently reversed . Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the 
entity sold . On acquisition, any goodwill acquired is allocated to cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing . 
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised 
directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
n) Investments in joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest and is jointly controlled by the Group and one or 
more third parties under a contractual agreement . Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are 
initially recognised at cost in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and subsequently adjusted to reflect changes 
in the Group’s share of the net assets of the entities . The Group’s share of the results of joint ventures is included in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  47
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 30 June 2017 | continued
If the Group’s share of the losses of a joint venture equals or exceeds its investment, the Group does not recognise further 
losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture .
o) Financial investments 
The Group classifies financial assets in the following categories: fair value through profit or loss; available for sale; loans and 
receivables; and held-to-maturity . The classification is determined by management on initial recognition of the financial 
asset, which depends on the purpose for which it was acquired .
Fair value through profit or loss
Financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit or loss if they are either held for trading or specifically 
designated in this category on initial recognition . Assets in this category are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently re-measured, with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value being recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income .
Available for sale
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either specifically designated in this category or are not 
classified in any of the other categories . They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or 
management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period . Available for sale financial assets are 
initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently revalued based on the current bid prices of the assets as quoted in 
active markets . Changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, through the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity, with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income . The cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recycled to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income when an available for sale financial asset is derecognised or impaired .
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market . 
They are included in current assets except where they have maturities of more than 12 months after the end of the reporting 
period, in which case they are classified as non-current assets . The Group’s loans and receivables are recognised within ‘trade 
and other receivables’ .
Held-to-maturity
Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinate payments and fixed maturities 
that the Group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity . Held-to-maturity financial assets are 
measured at amortised cost .
p) Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, where it is probable that it will 
result in an outflow of economic benefits and can be reliably estimated . Provisions are measured at the present value of the 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation .
Where the outflow is not probable or cannot be reliably measured, the potential obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability 
in the financial statements . 
Insurance recoveries relating to legal fees are recognised when, and only when, it is virtually certain that reimbursement will 
be received if the corresponding obligation is settled . Reimbursements received are disclosed net in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income and gross in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position .
Client compensation 
Complaints are assessed on a case-by-case basis and provisions for compensation are made where it is judged necessary .

q) Foreign currency translation
The Group’s functional and presentational currency is the Pound Sterling . Foreign currency transactions are translated using 
the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date . At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the prevailing rates on that date . Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from settlement of such transactions and from the translation of period-end monetary assets and liabilities are 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
r) Retirement benefit costs
Contributions in respect of the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as they fall due .
s) Taxation 
Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax . Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable 
income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable 
in respect of previous years .
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Group’s financial statements . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled based on tax rates (and 
laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date .
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised .
t) Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are initially recognised and subsequently measured at the original invoice amount less an allowance for 
any amounts that are expected to be uncollectable . Doubtful debts are provided for when the collection of the full amount is 
no longer probable, whilst bad debts are immediately written off when identified .
u) Trade payables 
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from 
suppliers . These are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within 12 months or less (or in the normal operating 
cycle of the business if longer) . Otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position .
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method .
v) Operating lease payments 
Rent payments due under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a 
straight line basis over the term of the lease . Where leases include lease incentives such as rent-free periods, the benefit of 
these incentives is recognised over the lease term as a reduction in the rental expense .
w) Financial instruments 
The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial 
liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement . Financial instruments are 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at fair value when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  49

x) Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”)
The Company provides finance to an EBT to purchase the Company’s shares on the open market in order to meet its 
obligation to provide shares when an employee exercises certain options or awards made under the Group’s share-based 
payment schemes . The administration and finance costs connected with the EBT are charged to the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income . The cost of the shares held by the EBT is deducted from equity . A transfer is made between other 
reserves and retained earnings over the vesting periods of the related share options or awards to reflect the ultimate 
proceeds receivable from employees on exercise . The trustees have waived their rights to receive dividends on the shares .
The EBT is considered to be a Structured Entity, as defined in note 35 . In substance, the activities of the trust are being 
conducted on behalf of the Group according to its specific business needs, in order to obtain benefits from its operation . On 
this basis, the assets held by the trust are consolidated into the Group’s financial statements .
y) Share capital
Ordinary share capital is classified as equity . Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds .
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares) the consideration paid, including any directly 
incremental costs (i . e . net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the 
shares are cancelled or reissued . Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received (net of 
any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects) is included within equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders . 
z) Dividend distribution
The dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the 
period in which the dividend is authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company . Final dividends are recognised 
when approved by the Company’s shareholders at the annual general meeting and interim dividends are recognised 
when paid .

3. Segmental information
For management purposes the Group’s activities are organised into four operating divisions: Investment Management, 
Financial Planning, Funds and Property Management and International . The Group’s other activity, offering nominee and 
custody services to clients, is included within Investment management . These divisions are the basis on which the Group 
reports its primary segmental information to the Group board of directors, which is the Group’s chief operating decision 
maker . In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, disclosures are required to reflect the information which the board of 
directors uses internally for evaluating the performance of its operating segments and allocating resources to those 
segments . The information presented in this note is consistent with the presentation for internal reporting .
Revenues and expenses are allocated to the business segment that originated the transaction . Revenues and expenses that 
are not directly originated by a particular business segment are reported as Group and consolidation adjustments . Sales 
between segments are carried out at arm’s length . Centrally incurred expenses are allocated to business segments on an 
appropriate pro-rata basis . Segmental assets and liabilities comprise operating assets and liabilities, those being the majority 
of the balance sheet .

Research and development tax credit (433)  –
Effect of change in tax rate on deferred tax (126)  (334)  
    
Income tax expense 2,230 3,117
    
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions .
The tax on the Group’s profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the time apportioned tax 
rate applicable to profits of the consolidated entities in the UK as follows: 
2017
£’000
2016 
£’000
Profit before taxation 8,044 15,856
    
Profit multiplied by the standard rate of tax in the UK of 19 . 75% (2016: 20 . 00%) 1,590 3,171
Tax effect of:
– Lower tax rates in other countries in which the Group operates – (77)
– Overseas tax losses not available for UK tax purposes 955 –
– Disallowable expenses 149 238
– Impairment charges 424 143
– Non-taxable income (433) (472)
– Losses utilised (no deferred tax thereon) (63) –
– Research and development tax credit (433) –
– Change in rate of Corporation Tax applicable to deferred tax (126) (334)
– Under provision in prior years 167 448
    
Tax charge for the year 2,230 3,117
    
Non-taxable income includes the gain from changes in fair value of deferred consideration .
During the year, the Group made a claim for research and development tax relief in relation to qualifying expenditure on 
software development incurred in the years ended 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2015 . This resulted in a reduction in the 
Corporation Tax liabilities in the respective years, and a repayment of £433,000 (2016: £nil) from HMRC . The Group will 
consider whether claims can also be made for qualifying expenditure incurred in the year ended 30 June 2016 and thereafter 
in due course . 56  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

10. Taxation continued
The deferred tax credits for the year arise from:
2017
£’000
2016
£’000
Share option reserve 194 (185)  
Accelerated capital allowances 84 35
Amortisation of acquired client relationship contracts 409 409
Unused overseas trading losses 339 –
    
Deferred tax credits 1,026 259
    
On 1 April 2017 , the standard rate of Corporation Tax in the UK was reduced to 19% . As a result the effective rate of 
Corporation Tax applied to the taxable profit for the year ended 30 June 2017 is 19 . 75% (2016: 20 . 00%) .
In addition to the change in the rate of UK Corporation Tax disclosed above, the Finance (No . 2) Act 2015, which was 
substantively enacted in October 2015, will further reduce the main rate to 17% in 2020 . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
calculated at the rate that is expected to be in force when the temporary differences unwind, but limited to the extent that 
such rates have been substantively enacted . The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is therefore 
17% (2016: 18%) and will be reviewed in future years subject to new legislation .
11. Earnings per share
The directors believe that underlying earnings per share provide a truer reflection of the Group’s performance in the year . 
Underlying earnings per share are calculated based on ‘underlying earnings’, which is defined as earnings before finance 
costs of deferred consideration, changes in the fair value of deferred consideration, goodwill impairment, amortisation of 
intangible assets and the exceptional costs of resolving legacy matters . The tax effect of these adjustments has also been 
considered .
Earnings for the year used to calculate earnings per share as reported in these consolidated financial statements were 
as follows:
2017 
 £’000  
2016  
£’000
Reported earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 5,814 12,739
Goodwill impairment (note 13) 1,986 –
Finance cost of deferred consideration (note 21) 263 577
Changes in fair value of deferred consideration (note 21) (2,230)  (3,571)  
Amortisation of intangible assets (note 13) 3,863 2,674
Exceptional costs of resolving legacy matters (note 24) 6,500 –
Tax impact of adjustments (525)  (556)  
    
Underlying earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 15,671 11,863
    
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue throughout the year . Diluted earnings per share represents the basic earnings per share adjusted 
for the effect of dilutive potential shares issuable on exercise of employee share options under the Group’s share-based 
payment schemes, weighted for the relevant period .

The interim dividend of 15 . 0p (2016: 12 . 0p) per share was paid on 21 April 2017 .
A final dividend for the year ended 30 June 2017 of 26 . 0p (2016: 23 . 0p) per share was declared by the board of directors on 
20 September 2017 and is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Company’s annual general meeting . It will be paid on 
27 October 2017 to shareholders who are on the register at the close of business on 29 September 2017 . In accordance with 
IAS 10 ‘Events After the Reporting Period’, the aggregate amount of the proposed dividend expected to be paid out of retained 
earnings is not recognised as a liability in these financial statements .

a) Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units (“CGUs”) that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination . The carrying amount of goodwill at 30 June 2017 comprises £3,550,000 
in respect of the Braemar Group Limited (“Braemar”) CGU, £21,243,000 in respect of the Brooks Macdonald Asset 
Management (International) Limited, Brooks Macdonald Retirement Services (International) Limited and DPZ (collectively 
“Brooks Macdonald International”) CGU and £9,227 ,000 in respect of the Levitas Investment Management Services Limited 
(“Levitas”) CGU .
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and its recoverability has been assessed at 30 June 2017 by comparing the 
carrying amount of the CGUs to their expected recoverable amount, estimated on a value-in-use basis . The value-in-use of 
each CGU has been calculated using pre-tax discounted cash flow projections based on the most recent budgets approved by 
the relevant subsidiary company boards of directors, covering a period of five years . Cash flows are then extrapolated beyond 
the forecast period using an expected long-term growth rate .
Based on a value-in-use calculation, the recoverable amount of the Levitas CGU at 30 June 2017 was £9,319,000 . This was 
lower than the carrying amount of the CGU, reflecting both a reduction in forecast funds under management growth and an 
increase in the discount rate applied, indicating that it should be impaired . An impairment loss of £1,986,000 (2016: £nil) has 
been recognised against the goodwill attributable to the CGU and is shown in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income within other gains and losses .    Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  59

13. Intangible assets continued
a) Goodwill continued
The key underlying assumptions of the calculation are the discount rate, the growth in funds under management of the Levitas 
funds and the long-term growth rate of the business . A pre-tax discount rate of 10% (2016: 8%) has been used, based on the 
Group’s assessment of the risk-free rate of interest and specific risks pertaining to Levitas . Annual funds under management 
growth rates of between 5% and 18% are forecast in the next five financial years, the period covered by the most recent 
forecasts, which reflect historic actual growth and planned management activities, which are considered to be achievable 
given current market and industry trends . A 2% long-term growth rate is applied to cash flows beyond the forecast period and 
is considered prudent in the context of the long-term average growth rate for the funds industry in which the CGU operates . 
Reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions and the impact of these changes on the calculated recoverable amount 
are:
•  A 1 % change in the pre-tax discount rate would result in a £1,041,000 change in the recoverable amount .
•  A 10% change in the forecast funds under management would result in a £630,000 change in the recoverable amount .
•  A 0 .5% change in the long-term average growth rate would result in a £489,000 change in the recoverable amount .
As the Levitas CGU has been impaired in the year, any future adverse change in any of the key assumptions would cause the 
CGU’s carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount, and an additional impairment would then be recognised .
Based on a value-in-use calculation, the recoverable amount of the Brooks Macdonald International CGU at 30 June 2017 was 
£42,043,000, indicating that there is no impairment . The key underlying assumptions of the calculation are the discount rate, 
the short-term growth in earnings and the long-term growth rate of the business . A pre-tax discount rate of 10% has been used, 
based on the Group’s assessment of the risk-free rate of interest and specific risks relating to Brooks Macdonald International . 
Annual earnings growth rates of between 18% and 48% are forecast over the next five financial years, the period covered by 
the most recent forecasts, which reflect historic actual growth and planned management actions and are considered to be 
achievable given current market and industry trends . The 2% long-term growth rate applied is considered prudent in the 
context of the long-term average growth rate for the funds, investment management and financial planning industries in 
which the CGU operates .
The key assumptions inherent in the value-in-use calculations for the Braemar CGU were a pre-tax discount rate of 11%, 
annual revenue growth rates ranging from 10% to 28% and a long-term growth rate of 2% . 
Headroom exists in the calculations of the respective recoverable amounts of the Brooks Macdonald International and 
Braemar CGUs over the carrying amounts of the goodwill allocated to them . On this basis, the directors have concluded that 
there is no impairment . The directors consider that no reasonably foreseeable change in any of the key assumptions would 
result in an impairment of goodwill, given the margin by which the estimated recoverable amounts of the CGUs exceed the 
carrying amounts of the goodwill allocated to each .
b) Computer software
Computer software costs are amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of four years . Costs incurred on 
internally developed computer software are initially recognised at cost and when the software is available for use, the costs 
are amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of four years . 
c) Acquired client relationship contracts
This asset represents the fair value of future benefits accruing to the Group from acquired client relationship contracts . The 
amortisation of client relationships is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line 
basis over their estimated useful lives (15 to 20 years) .
d) Contracts acquired with fund managers
This asset represents the fair value of the future benefits accruing to the Group from contracts acquired with fund managers . 
Payments made to acquire such contracts are stated at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life 
of five years . 60  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

At 1 July 2016, the Group held investments of 1,426,793 . 64 class B ordinary shares, representing an interest of 10 . 88% in 
Braemar Group PCC Limited Student Accommodation Cell (“Student Accommodation fund”); 750,000 zero dividend 
preference shares in GLI Finance Limited (“GLIF”), an AIM-listed company incorporated in Guernsey; and 500,000 
redeemable preference shares in an unlisted company incorporated in the UK .
The Student Accommodation Fund was promoted by Brooks Macdonald Funds Limited, a subsidiary of the Company . In May 
2016 the shareholders of the fund approved a resolution to sell the underlying property portfolio of the fund to a third party 
and in the year ended 30 June 2017 the shares were compulsorily redeemed by the fund . A gain of £13,000 was realised on 
receipt of the final redemption monies of £484,000 . During the year, the Group also disposed of its holding in GLIF at a market 
value of £735,000, realising a loss of £9,000 . The net gain of £4,000 has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income for the year ended 30 June 2017 within realised gain on investments (note 5) .    Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  61

15. Available for sale financial assets continued
In addition, accumulated losses of £6,000 in respect of GLIF were realised upon disposal and the revaluation reserve was 
recycled through Other Comprehensive Income .
During the year ended 30 June 2017 , the Group acquired an offshore bond at a cost of £5,000 . A revaluation gain due to a 
change in the fair market value of the bond of £3,000 was recognised within Other Comprehensive Income .
The Group also converted an existing loan of £150,000, issued by Brooks Macdonald Asset Management (International) 
Limited to a third party, into redeemable preference share capital during the year . The loan was previously included within 
trade and other receivables as a non-current asset and has been reclassified as an available for sale financial asset . The 
preference shares carry an entitlement to a fixed preferential dividend at a rate of 8% per annum .
In the year ended 30 June 2016 an impairment loss of £311,000 was recognised in relation to the investment in the Student 
Accommodation Fund, reflecting the permanent diminution in the net asset value of the fund . No impairment losses were 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income during the year ended 30 June 2017 .
The table below provides an analysis of the financial instruments that, subsequent to initial recognition, are measured at fair 
value . These are grouped into the following levels within the fair value hierarchy, based on the degree to which the inputs 
used to determine the fair value are observable:
• Level 1 – derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;
• Level 2 – derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly; 
and  
• Level 3 – derived from inputs that are not based on observable market data .

16. Investment in joint venture 
Brooks Macdonald Funds Limited, a subsidiary of Brooks Macdonald Group plc, holds a 60% interest in North Row Capital 
LLP, a UK Limited Liability Partnership . The Group has joint control over the partnership, with the remaining interest owned 
by two individual partners who developed the investment approach behind the IFSL North Row Liquid Property Fund . The 
fund was launched in February 2014 and offers investors liquid exposure to global real estate markets .

At end of year – 207
    
During the year ended 30 June 2017 , the carrying amount of the Group’s investment in North Row Capital LLP has been 
further reduced to an estimated recoverable amount of £nil by recognising an impairment loss of £163,000 (2016: £400,000) 
against the investment in joint venture . The expense is included within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income . The impairment arose as the forecast future cash flows from the partnership were 
estimated to accumulate slower than originally anticipated and as a result the Group will not realise a return on its investment 
in the joint venture .
The partners decided to terminate the fund and the application was approved by the FCA on 17 March 2017 . Clients were 
informed on 24 March 2017 . Dealing within the Fund was suspended on 25 April 2017 and the final report and financial 
statements for the Fund are to be prepared by 30 September 2017 .
17 . Deferred income tax

21. Deferred consideration
Deferred consideration is split between non-current liabilities (see below) and provisions within current liabilities (note 24) to 
the extent that it is due for payment within one year of the reporting date . It reflects the directors’ best estimate of amounts 
payable in the future in respect of certain client relationships and subsidiary undertakings that were acquired by the Group . 
Deferred consideration is measured at its fair value based on discounted expected future cash flows . The movements in the 
total deferred consideration balance during the year were as follows:

No additions to deferred consideration were recognised in the year . Payments totalling £1,580,000 (2016: £3,901,000) 
were made during the year to the vendors of Levitas . Full details of the Levitas acquisition are disclosed in note 13 of the 
2015 Annual Report and Accounts .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  65

21. Deferred consideration continued
A total reduction in the fair value of deferred consideration of £2,230,000 (2016: £3,571,000) was recognised during the year, 
all in respect of Levitas (2016: £3,343,000), with a corresponding gain recognised within other gains and losses in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income . The amount payable is based on the incremental growth in FUM of the 
TM Levitas funds, measured at annual intervals . As forecast growth was not achieved during year, the FUM forecast was 
subsequently revised and the estimated future deferred consideration payments reduced accordingly . Adjustments made in 
the year ended 30 June 2016 also included a reduction in the fair value of the deferred consideration attributable to DPZ by 
£225,000 and to JPAM by £3,000, to the amount of the final payments made to the vendors . The deferred consideration 
relating to these acquisitions was fully paid as at 30 June 2016 .
Deferred consideration is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, as defined in note 15 .
Amounts falling due after more than one year from the reporting date are presented in non-current liabilities as shown below:

representing deferred consideration payable in respect of the acquisition of Levitas, was transferred to provisions within 
current liabilities . A range of final outcomes for the expected total deferred consideration payable cannot be estimated as the 
future value of the funds under management is dependent on several unpredictable variables, including client retention and 
market movements .

24. Provisions continued
a) Client compensation
Client compensation provisions relate to the potential liability arising from client complaints against the Group . Complaints 
are assessed on a case by case basis and provisions for compensation are made where judged necessary . The amount 
recognised within provisions for client compensation represents management’s best estimate of the potential liability . The 
timing of the corresponding outflows is uncertain as these are made as and when claims arise .
b) Exceptional costs of resolving legacy matters
Following a review into legacy matters arising from the former Spearpoint business, which was acquired by the Group in 
2012, a provision of £6,500,000 (2016: £nil) was recognised for costs of resolving these including associated expenses . These 
matters relate to a number of discretionary portfolios formerly managed by Spearpoint, now managed by Brooks Macdonald 
Asset Management (International) Limited, and a Dublin-based fund, for which Spearpoint acted as investment manager .
c) Deferred consideration
Deferred consideration has been included within provisions as a current liability to the extent that it is due for payment 
within one year of the reporting date . The amount outstanding at 30 June 2017 was £1,664,000 (2016: £1,641,000) and relates 
entirely to the Levitas acquisition . The amount of deferred consideration included within provisions is due to be settled in 
November 2017 . Subsequent annual payments will be made in November of each year until the final payment in November 
2020, with the final amount being calculated in November 2018 . 
An amount of £1,603,000 (2016: £1,307 ,000) was transferred from non-current liabilities, representing payments made 
during the year and provisions for amounts falling due within one year of the reporting date . Provisions of £1,580,000 (2016: 
£3,901,000) were utilised during the year on payment of £1,580,000 to the vendors of Levitas (2016: £1,247 ,000 to the 
vendors of Levitas; £524,000 to the vendor of JPAM; and £2,130,000 to the vendors of DPZ) . 
d) FSCS levy
Following confirmation by the FSCS in April 2017 of its final industry levy for 2017/18, the Group has made a provision of 
£621,000 (2016: £470,000) for its estimated share . This includes a supplementary levy of £100,000 that is likely to be raised in 
January 2018 .

28. Equity-settled share-based payments
All share options granted to employees under the Group’s equity-settled share-based payment schemes are valued using a 
Black Scholes model, based on the market price of the Company’s shares at the grant date and annualised volatility of up to 
50%, covering the period to the end of the contractual life . Volatility has been estimated on the basis of the Company’s 
historical share price subsequent to flotation . The risk-free annual rate of interest is deemed to be the yield on a gilt edged 
security with a maturity term of 3 years, ranging from 0 . 17% to 2 . 00% .
For options granted during the year, the Black Scholes model was based on the market price of the Company’s shares at each 
respective grant date and volatility of 26% to 27% with a dividend yield of 1 . 77% to 1 . 79%, an expected vesting period of three 
years and a risk-free annual rate of interest of between 0 . 17% and 0 . 34% .
The share options issued under the various equity-settled share-based payment schemes have been valued at prices ranging 
from £2 . 31 to £16 . 33 per share . The charge to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year in respect of 
these was £1,237 ,000 (2016: £943,000) . The weighted average remaining contractual life of all equity-settled share-based 
payment schemes at 30 June 2017 was 1 . 32 years (2016: 1 . 48 years) . The weighted average share price of all options 
exercised during the year was £10 . 45 (2016: £17 . 71) . The total charge to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income for the year for all share-based payment schemes was £1,465,000 (2016: £1,027 ,000) .

£30,000 per recipient . The performance conditions attached to the scheme require an increase in the diluted earnings per 
share of the Company of 2% more than the increase in the RPI over the three years starting with the financial year in which 
the option is granted .

31. Financial risk management
The Group has identified the financial risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures as part of a 
formal structure for managing risk, including establishing risk lines, reporting lines, mandates and other control procedures . 
The structure is reviewed regularly . The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes .
a) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when 
they fall due .
The primary objective of the Group’s treasury policy is to manage short-term liquidity requirements and to ensure that the 
Group maintains a surplus of immediately realisable assets over its liabilities, such that all known and potential cash 
obligations can be met .
The table below shows the cash inflows and outflows from the Group under non-derivative financial assets and liabilities,

31. Financial risk management continued
b) Market risk
Interest rate risk
The Group may elect to invest surplus cash balances in short-term cash deposits with maturity dates not exceeding three 
months . Consequently, the Group has a limited exposure to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing level of 
market interest rates .
A 1% fall in the average monthly interest rate receivable on the Group’s cash and cash equivalents would have the impact of 
reducing interest receivable and therefore profit before taxation by £322,000 (2016: £195,000) . An increase of 1% would have 
an equal and opposite effect .
Foreign exchange risk
The Group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign currency risk and therefore no analysis of foreign 
exchange risk is provided .
Price risk
Price risk is the risk that the fair value of the future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in 
market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk) . The Group is exposed to price risk through its 
holdings of equity securities and other financial assets, which are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position (notes 15 and 19) . A 1% fall in the value of these financial instruments would have the impact of reducing 
total comprehensive income by £18,000 (2016: £27 ,000) and profit before tax by £12,000 (2016: £10,000) . An increase of 1% 
would have an equal and opposite effect .
c) Credit risk
The Group may elect to invest surplus cash balances in highly liquid money market instruments with maturity dates not 
exceeding three months . The difference between the fair value and the net book value of these instruments is not material . To 
reduce the risk of a counterparty default, the Group deposits the rest of its funds in approved, high quality banks . At 30 June 
2017 there was no significant concentration of credit risk in any particular counterparty (2016: none) .
Assets exposed to credit risk recognised on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position total £32,183,000 
(2016: £19,478,000), being the Group’s total cash and cash equivalents .
Trade receivables with a carrying amount of £1,723,000 (2016: £5,939,000) are neither past due nor impaired . Trade 
receivables have no external credit rating as they relate to individual clients, although the value of investments held in each 
individual client’s portfolio is always in excess of the total value of the receivable . All trade receivables fall due within three 
months (2016: three months) .

32. Capital management
Capital is defined as the total of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves of the Company . Total 
capital at 30 June 2017 was £85,706,000 (2016: £83,008,000) . Regulatory capital is derived from the Group Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), which is a requirement of the Capital Requirements Directive . The ICAAP draws on 
the Group’s risk management process which is embedded within the individual businesses, function heads and executive 
committees within the Group . 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to comply with the capital requirements set by the Financial Conduct 
Authority, to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a strong capital base to support the development of 
the business .
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored daily by the Group’s management . The Group’s 2017 ICAAP 
will be approved in October 2017 . There have been no capital requirement breaches during the year . Brooks Macdonald 
Group plc’s Pillar III disclosure is presented on our website at www . brooksmacdonald . com .
33. Guarantees and contingent liabilities
A claim for unspecified losses has been made by a client against Brooks Macdonald Financial Consulting Limited, a 
subsidiary of the Group, in relation to alleged negligent financial advice . The claimant has not yet advised the quantum of 
their claim so it is not possible to reliably estimate the potential impact of a ruling in their favour . There remains significant 
uncertainty surrounding the claim and the Group’s legal advice indicates that it is not probable that the claim will be upheld, 
therefore no provision for any liability has been recognised at this stage .
Brooks Macdonald Asset Management Limited, a subsidiary company of the Group, has an agreement with the Royal Bank of 
Scotland plc to guarantee settlement for trading with CREST stock on behalf of clients . The Group holds client assets to fund 
such trading activity .
Additional levies by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme may give rise to further obligations based on the Group’s 
income in the current or previous years . Nevertheless, the ultimate cost to the Group of these levies remains uncertain and is 
dependent upon future claims resulting from institutional failures .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  77

35. Interest in unconsolidated structured entities 
Structured entities are those entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in 
deciding who has control, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities 
are directed by means of contractual arrangements . The Group’s interests in consolidated and unconsolidated structured 
entities are described below .
The only consolidated structured entity is the Brooks Macdonald Group Employee Benefit Trust, details of which are given in 
note 26 .
The Group has interests in structured entities as a result of contractual arrangements arising from the management of assets 
on behalf of its clients . Assets under management within the Funds and property management segment include those 
managed within structured entities . These structured entities consist of unitised vehicles such as Open Ended Investment 
Companies (OEICs) which entitle investors to a percentage of the vehicle’s net asset value . The structured entities are 
financed by the purchase of units or shares by investors . As fund manager, the Group does not guarantee returns on its funds 
or commit to financially support its funds . Where external finance is raised, the Group does not provide a guarantee for the 
repayment of any borrowings . The business activity of all structured entities, in which the Group has an interest, is the 
management of assets in order to maximise investment returns for investors from capital appreciation and/or investment 
income . The Group earns a management fee from its structured entities, based on a percentage of the entity’s net asset value . 
The main risk the Group faces from its interest in FUM managed on behalf of external investors is the loss of fee income as a 
result of the withdrawal of funds by clients . Outflows from funds are dependent on market sentiment, asset performance and 
investor considerations . The assets under management of unconsolidated structured entities total £1,034m (2016: £625m) . 
Included in revenue on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is management fee income of £4,463,000 
(2016: £3,027 ,000) from unconsolidated structured entities managed by the Group .
36. Events since the end of the year
Since the end of the financial year, the Group has agreed to dispose of the entire share capital of two subsidiary companies, 
Braemar Estates (Residential) Limited and Braemar Facilities Management Limited, to Rendall & Rittner Limited . The disposal 
exchanged on 20 September 2017 and is expected to complete on 1 December 2017 . Consideration will comprise an initial 
amount payable on completion plus a deferred amount payable over a two-year period from the completion date .
Braemar Estates (Residential) Limited provides property management and advisory services and its subsidiary, Braemar 
Facilities Management Limited, provides on-site management services to some of the units managed by its parent . Both 
subsidiaries are included within the Funds and Property Management reporting segment (see note 3) .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  |  79

Notes to the company financial statements
for the year ended 30 June 2017 
37 . Principal accounting policies
General information
Brooks Macdonald Group plc (“the Company”) is the parent company of a group of companies . The Company is a public 
limited company, incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 and listed on AIM . The 
address of its registered office is 72 Welbeck Street, London, W1G 0AY .
Statement of compliance 
The individual financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 and have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union . 
Developments in reporting standards and interpretations 
Developments in reporting standards and interpretations are set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements . The 
principal accounting policies adopted are set out below:
a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of investments such that 
they are measured at their fair value .
At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future . Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements . As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Company has elected not to present its own Statement of Comprehensive Income for the financial year .
b) Investments in subsidiary companies
Where the Company has investments in subsidiary companies; whereby one entity (the “subsidiary”) is controlled by another 
entity (the “parent”), the investments are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provision for impairment . The carrying values 
of investments in subsidiary companies are reviewed annually to determine whether any indicator of impairment exists . 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed .
c) Subsidiary company guarantees and contingent liabilities
As required by section 479C of the Companies Act, the Company guarantees all outstanding liabilities to which its unaudited 
subsidiary companies are subject at the end of the financial year . Where the outflow is not probable or cannot be reliably 
measured, the potential obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability in the financial statements .
d) Retirement benefit costs
Contributions in respect of the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme are recognised in the Income Statement as they 
fall due .
e) Employee Benefit Trust
Where the Company holds its own equity shares through an Employee Benefit Trust these shares are shown as a reduction in 
shareholders’ equity . Any consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown as a reduction in 
the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds . No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of these shares .
38. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty 
The critical accounting judgement and key source of estimation and uncertainty arise from the calculation and valuation of 
deferred consideration in relation to the Company’s acquisition of Levitas Investment Management Services Limited in July 
2014 . This is described in note 37(b) to the Company financial statements .

Brooks Macdonald Group plc reported profit after tax for the year ended 30 June 2017 of £3,976,000 (2016: £8,859,000) . 
Auditors’ remuneration is disclosed in note 7 of the consolidated financial statements . The average monthly number of

statements .

During the year, the Company recognised an impairment in relation to a subsidiary company, Levitas Investment 
Management Services Limited . Based on a value-in-use calculation, the recoverable amount of the Levitas CGU at 30 June 
2017 was £9,319,000 . This falls short of the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in Levitas Investment 
Management Services Limited and reflects both the reduction in forecast funds under management growth and an increase 
in the discount rate, indicating that it should be impaired . An impairment loss of £1,986,000 (2016: £nil) has been recognised 
against the investment in subsidiary . 
In the year ended 30 June 2016, the Company invested £250,000 in the ordinary share capital of Brooks Macdonald 
Retirement Services (International) Limited . The capital contribution relating to share-based payments reflects the share 
options granted by the Company to employees of its subsidiary undertakings .
