I am delighted to report that our proposed full year dividend is
15.1 pence per share, 27% higher than last year, moving to a
two-thirds pay out ratio a year earlier than we had previously
announced. We expect to increase the dividend, taking into
account our earnings growth, cash generation and our ongoing
investment needs. In addition, because of the ﬁnancial strength
of the company we are introducing a new £2.5 billion share buy
back programme which we expect to be completed by
31 March 2009.
BUSINESS PROGRESS
We continued to implement our strategy for proﬁtable growth.
New wave revenue now accounts for 36% of our total business.
We are a major player in the global networked IT services
market, meeting the needs of our customers around the world.
In the UK, we have around 11 million broadband lines over
which we are able to offer all our customers – consumer, SME,
corporate and wholesale – a more accessible, faster and richer
broadband experience.
................................................................................................................................................
We are committed to
operating in an ethical,
sustainable and socially
responsible way
................................................................................................................................................
OUR WIDER RESPONSIBILITIES
I am extremely proud of the fact that, for the sixth consecutive
year, BT was the highest placed telecommunications company in
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We are committed to
operating in an ethical, sustainable and socially responsible way,
and to having a positive impact on all those communities whose
lives we touch.
As the corporate social responsibility agenda evolves, so does
our strategy. We are, for example, increasingly emphasising
three new priorities:
s tackling climate change. We are committed to cutting our
CO
2
emissions by 80% from 1996 levels by 2016 and to
helping customers and suppliers cut theirs through the more
effective use of communications technology. The fact that our
Chief Executive, Ben Verwaayen, is chairing the CBI’s climate
change task force indicates how seriously we take this issue.
s enabling sustainable economic growth. We are increasingly
integrating sustainability in all our business processes.
s helping to build a more inclusive society. We are looking at
the ways in which communications technology can help to
build a fairer, more inclusive society.
PENSIONS
Investment performance on assets in the BT Pension Scheme
(BTPS) was very good, with year end value at a record
£38 billion. During the year, BT and the trustees of BTPS agreed
the triennial funding of the scheme. Under a new and more
conservative actuarial methodology, the deﬁcit at 31 December
2005 was calculated as £3.4 billion.
BT has agreed to make deﬁcit payments equivalent to
£280 million a year for ten years, with the ﬁrst three years’
instalments paid up front – £840 million was paid into the
scheme by 30 April 2007. I believe this is a fair and prudent
deal for pensioners and shareholders, and demonstrates that
your company stands fully behind its pension obligations.
YOUR BOARD
I will be stepping down as Chairman in the autumn after more
than six challenging and fascinating years with BT. Sir Mike Rake
will take over as your next Chairman in September. Mike is
currently chairman of KPMG International; he has demonstrated
outstanding leadership of this major global organisation during a
time of turbulence and change. He will bring extensive
international experience to BT as it continues to position itself as
a truly global company.
Overview
Chairman’s message
4 BT Group plc Annual Report & Form 20-F
The 2007 ﬁnancial year was a very good one for your company
– our results once again were excellent. Revenue grew by 4%
and earnings per share before speciﬁc items grew by 16% to
22.7 pence. We continued to invest in technologies, networks
and systems that will, we believe, transform our customers’ lives
and businesses, along with their experience of dealing with BT.

A number of changes to the Board have occurred since I last
wrote to you. Sir Anthony Greener stepped down as Deputy
Chairman and from the Board on 30 September 2006 after six
years and I would like to thank him for his very signiﬁcant
contribution to the development of our strategy. His successor is
Maarten van den Bergh, who has been a non-executive director
since September 2000. Maarten, who prior to his retirement was
president of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company, also chairs
the Remuneration Committee and is our senior independent
director. And I’d like to welcome two new directors, Deborah
Lathen and Franc ¸ois Barrault. Deborah, who is president of
Washington-based Lathen Consulting, joined the Board as a
non-executive director in February 2007. She brings strong US
business and policy experience to BT, including as a previous
chief of the Cable Services Bureau at the US Federal
Communications Commission. Franc ¸ois joined the Board on
24 April 2007 as Chief Executive BT Global Services (in which
role he succeeds Andy Green who became CEO of Group
Strategy and Operations). As President of BT International,
Franc ¸ois established a record of exceptional growth in BT’s
operations outside the UK.

DELIVERING OUR PLAN
I would like to thank shareholders and customers for their
conﬁdence in our strategy and the loyalty they have shown in
the past six years.
I’d also like to thank our Chief Executive, Ben Verwaayen, the
other members of the Board – both executive and non-
executive – and all BT people for their efforts and unwavering
support. If I cannot entirely resist the temptation to look back
over the past six years, it is because that is the best way of
acknowledging what they have achieved.
Back in 2001 your company’s net debt had risen to nearly
£30 billion. In response, in May 2001, your Board put in place
an action plan to reduce debt, manage costs and enhance our
abilities to serve our customers even more effectively. That plan
has been delivered.
Debt was brought under control by a combination of the
largest ever rights issue in UK corporate history and the disposal
of a number of businesses including Yell (our international
directories and e-commerce business) and our interests in Japan
and Spain. O2 (previously Cellnet) was demerged and Concert
(our international joint venture with AT&T) was unwound. These
structural changes have provided commercial and ﬁnancial
ﬂexibility for the group and our debt in recent years has reduced
to sustainable levels.
We have rigorously managed our costs, taking a disciplined
approach to eliminating waste and duplication, wherever
possible using our own technology to become more cost
effective.
During that period, new technologies have given customers
access to a range of services – high-speed broadband, ﬁxed-
mobile convergence and next-generation TV – that have
transformed their idea of what is possible. Our efforts in UK
broadband and in global networked IT service have been very
successful.
LOOKING FORWARD
Looking ahead, your company is positioned for success. With a
new Chairman and an experienced CEO at the helm, and a
workforce experienced in the business of transformation, the
signs are very positive. It has been a privilege to be involved
with BT’s journey to this point; I shall, of course, continue to
follow its future progress with great interest and pleasure.

KEEPING BT AHEAD OF THE GAME
BT is barely recognisable as the company it was ﬁve years ago.
Five years ago, we were primarily a UK lines and calls
business; today we are offering communications possibilities
that no one had even thought of back then to customers in
170 countries.
Possibilities that really do enable them to lead fuller lives and
run more proﬁtable, innovative businesses.
In a very short time, we’ve gone from a narrowband,
ﬁxed-line communications business, to a broadband company
harnessing the power of modern networks to help our customers
communicate anywhere, any time, using whatever devices they
happen to choose.
We’ve brought levels of choice and control to our customers
at home, at work, or out and about, that would once have
seemed impossible.
................................................................................................................................................
Helping some of the
world’s largest companies
and organisations serve
their customers around
the world
................................................................................................................................................
Who would have thought ﬁve years ago that BT would be
offering next-generation digital TV over broadband? Our BT
Vision service enables customers to watch what they want when
they want – without having to pay a monthly subscription.
Who would have thought that our customers would have
been beneﬁting from intelligent, seamless ﬁxed/mobile
communications – like BT Fusion – at home, at work or in
between – chatting, swapping data, surﬁng the internet, doing
business?
Who would have thought that we would be helping some of
the world’s largest companies and organisations do business and
serve their customers around the world? Who would have
thought that geography would be history and time irrelevant?
But the thing about transformation, however radical and
however successful, is that there is no end point. No moment
at which you can sit back and think ‘job done’.
Even when we hit ﬁve million broadband connections in 2005
– more than a year ahead of schedule – there was no time to
take it easy. Today, that number is around 11 million and
climbing.
Our broadband success sums up the type of company BT
is becoming. A company that goes the extra mile, that rallies
behind its goals, that ﬁnds ways of meeting its customers’
needs – locally, nationally, internationally and globally.
FROM OUR TIME TO YOUR TIME
Nothing is more important than offering a great customer
experience ﬁrst time, every time. It differentiates BT from the
competition; it is what the BT brand stands for.
Excellent customer service can only be delivered in ‘customer
time’ – the time that customers want. Quite rightly, customers
have no interest in, or patience with, ‘our time’ – the time it
takes our systems to make it happen.
Meeting customers’ needs in customer time is vital to proving
that we understand them, share their priorities and enthusiasms,
and really do put them ﬁrst.
This type of ‘real-time’ customer experience is best delivered
by software. In the future, BT’s services will increasingly be
based on software – designed, delivered and updated remotely
by computers over broadband networks. These services will be
faster, more innovative, reliable and simpler to use – often
delivered by the push of a button.
These software-driven, networked IT services will be delivered
over our global twenty-ﬁrst century broadband network.
We have set ourselves the target of becoming number one for
customer service within two years. To ensure that we continue
to think and act in customer time, two measures will apply
throughout the company and keep everyone focused. First, we
will measure how successfully we get things ‘right ﬁrst time’.
Second, we will measure the improvements we make in the
‘cycle time’ – the time between the start and end of any
customer experience.
Overview
Chief Executive’s statement
BT has been capturing the imaginations of customers,
shareholders, analysts, suppliers and employees around the
world. We’ve done this by embracing change. By demonstrating
not only that we can thrive on it, but that we can help our
customers thrive on it as well. We’ve done it by proving that
when it comes to modern communications, the possibilities really
are endless. And we’ve done it by being a company that is driven
by its customers, shifting power and choice to them.

BT Group plc Annual Report & Form 20-F 7
OPEN ORGANISATION, OPEN MINDS
It is vital that BT is an ‘open business’ with an open mind.
We are open to new ideas and new ways of doing things.
We are working with suppliers, industry partners and others with
a single, compelling objective – to get the best possible services
to our customers around the world as quickly as possible.
Customers don’t care about whether any given service was
designed by W, manufactured by X, delivered by Y and billed
for by Z. They care about what it can do for them – whether it
makes life easier or a business more proﬁtable.
CITIZENS OF A GLOBAL VILLAGE
All our customers – private individuals, families and large
corporations – are increasingly thinking and behaving like global
citizens. They want the world on their PC, laptop, or hand held
device. And they want to be able to organise themselves and do
business, build markets and win customers as and where it suits
them.
................................................................................................................................................
A truly global software-
driven services company
................................................................................................................................................
And meeting their global needs means ensuring that we really
do understand them, that we really can get inside their heads.
For consumer customers, global communication means being
able to keep in touch and access information whether they are
in York or New York, Mumbai or Rome.
For modern organisations, global communication means the
opportunity to take advantage of the best resources and talents
wherever they are located.
We aim to become a truly global software-driven services
company, with a great global brand, helping our customers get
the best from globalisation.
It’s a fantastic opportunity and one that BT is seizing with
both hands.
In recent years, we’ve acquired a reputation for winning and
delivering complex, large-scale networked IT services contracts.
Our extensive global network enables us to serve customers
in all the world’s key commercial centres – either directly or
through partnership arrangements.
Major contracts in the 2007 ﬁnancial year included a deal
with Dutch electronics giant, Philips, to provide data, voice,
conferencing and mobile services in Europe, the Middle East
and Africa, and a deal with PepsiCo to manage a portfolio of
advanced services covering more than 900 locations in over
60 countries.
Our services are helping organisations meet the needs of their
own customers wherever they may be.
THE RIGHT PEOPLE FOR THE RIGHT JOB
Strategies and plans cannot, of themselves, deliver the kind of
transformation that BT is experiencing and that we are going to
have to accelerate in the future. Only people can do that.
That’s why it’s so important that our workforce is just as
much a global community as our customers.
Our customers are a cross section of society – they encompass
a huge range of nationalities, as well as social, cultural, political
and personal orientations. In order to reﬂect that diversity, we
are recruiting the brightest and the best from around the world.
BT people have already shown what they are capable of; and
there’s a lot more where that came from.
The job of every person who works for BT is what it always
was: to ensure that everything they do every day is done for all
our customers around the world. Only now, they have to do it
quicker than ever before, in more innovative ways than ever
before and more seamlessly than ever before.
I have no doubt whatever that they will do just that.

INTRODUCTION TO THE BUSINESS REVIEW
BT is one of the world’s leading providers of communications
solutions and services operating in 170 countries.
We are committed to increasing shareholder value by
transforming the customer experience through service
excellence, by the effective management of our strong brand, by
exploiting our large-scale networks and by delivering exciting
new services to our existing customer base. We aim to ﬁnd new
and mutually rewarding ways of engaging with around 18
million customers to capitalise on the possibilities of
convergence, to offer global reach combined with the service
values associated with local delivery, and to continue to provide
innovative services and solutions.
Our principal activities include:
r networked IT services
r local, national and international telecommunications services
r broadband and internet products and services
r converged ﬁxed/mobile products and services.
We have had ISO 9001 certiﬁcation (the international quality
management system standard) for most of our operations in the
UK and worldwide since 1994.
Our policy is to achieve best practice in our standards of
business integrity in all our operations, in line with our published
statement of business practice – The Way We Work – and we
are committed to enhancing our positive impact on society
through leadership in corporate social responsibility and by
doing business in a sustainable way.
OUR OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE
BT has four customer-focused lines of business: BT Global
Services, BT Retail, BT Wholesale and Openreach.
BT Retail, BT Wholesale and Openreach operate mainly within
the UK, where BT is the largest communications services
provider to the residential and business markets, supplying a
wide range of communications products and services, including
voice, data, internet and multimedia services, and offering a
comprehensive range of managed and packaged communications
solutions.
BT Global Services provides a range of products and services,
including communications, networked IT and consultancy
services to address the needs of major corporations,
governments and multi-site global organisations.
In April 2007, we announced a new structure, which includes
two new business units and is designed to enable us to deliver
faster, more resilient and cost-effective services to customers
wherever they are. With effect from 1 July 2007, BT Design will
be responsible for the design and development of the platforms,
systems and processes which will support our services; BT
Operate will be responsible for their deployment and operation.
Around 20,000 BT employees – from design, operations, IT and
networks – will move into these new units. We believe that
these changes will keep BT ahead of the game.

OUR STRATEGY
Our strategy is to:
r pursue proﬁtable growth in new wave markets
r defend our traditional business
r transform our networks, systems and services for the
twenty-ﬁrst century
r create long-term partnerships with our customers.
The successful delivery of this strategy depends on the
commitment of all BT people and our continued ability to
manage their development and reward them.
For the 2007 ﬁnancial year, the KPIs (key performance
indicators) against which we measured the success of our
strategy were earnings per share before speciﬁc items (see
Earnings per share on page 42), free cash ﬂow (see Financing
on page 43) and customer satisfaction (see Improving customer
satisfaction and service on page 18). From the 2008 ﬁnancial
year, customer service replaces customer satisfaction as a KPI.
Pursue proﬁtable growth in new wave markets
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, 36% of our revenue was from new
wave activities – primarily networked IT services, broadband and

Broadband at the heart of BT
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we continued our drive to enhance
the awareness, availability and attractiveness of broadband. At
31 March 2007, we had 10.7 million broadband lines including
LLU (local loop unbundling). In the highly competitive retail
market, our market share of consumer and business DSL (digital
subscriber line) and LLU broadband connections in the UK was
34%. With 3.7 million broadband connections including PlusNet,
we are now the UK’s most popular broadband retailer (including
cable).
Create convergent mobility solutions
In a convergent world, individuals and businesses increasingly
need to connect and communicate wherever they happen to be,
using whatever device they choose, and we offer a range of
mobility services in both the consumer and business markets.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, group mobility revenues were
£294 million. The emphasis was increasingly on new services
that give customers the best of ﬁxed and the best of mobile
communications, either combined in a single handset or bundled
together in a compelling offer. At 31 March 2007, we had a
total of 314,000 mobile connections in the UK (both GSM and
our new, intelligent ﬁxed/mobile service, BT Fusion). In addition,
we manage around 100,000 connections on behalf of large
enterprise customers, the majority of which are outside the UK.
The number of customer minutes on BT Openzone (our public
wireless broadband service) grew by 60% in the 2007 ﬁnancial
year compared with the previous year.
Defend our traditional business
Although we continue to face challenges in our traditional
markets as a result of competition, a shift in our customers’
buying patterns and a tough regulatory regime, we aim to
defend our traditional business – mainly calls and lines – while
offering customers new, next-generation services.

Active voice customer (customers who generate voice revenue)
losses in the 2007 ﬁnancial year were the lowest for more than
three years in spite of intense competition from other providers
packaging calls with broadband. This reduced rate of loss was
driven by a range of price reductions and by encouraging
customers to sign up for our innovative pricing packages.
Transform our networks, systems and services
for the twenty-ﬁrst century
Our strategy is to build innovative and versatile networks that
will be a platform for rapid delivery of new services and
simultaneously transform the customer experience and enable us
to operate ever more cost effectively. Our 21CN (twenty-ﬁrst
century network), for example, is helping to deﬁne
communications networks for the future and we are investing in
an innovative ﬂexible systems infrastructure throughout BT.
Our UK network
BT has the most comprehensive ﬁxed-line communications
network in the UK, with around 5,600 exchanges, more than
700 local and 100 trunk processor units, more than 120 million
kilometres of copper wire and more than nine million kilometres
of optical ﬁbre, and the most extensive IP backbone network in
the UK. The network services we provide include frame relay,
ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) and IPVPN (internet protocol
virtual private network).
Our global reach
We have one of the broadest IP-enabled networks in Europe
and our network-based services extend to and across North and
South America and the Asia Paciﬁc region.
At 31 March 2007, our ﬂagship MPLS (multi-protocol label
switching) network service provided coverage and support to
over 100 countries from more than 1,300 points of presence.
Our MPLS revenue grew by 31% during the 2007 ﬁnancial year
to £556 million.
Global customer service is provided via service and network
management centres around the world, 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.
Create long-term partnerships with our customers
We believe that our relationships with our customers are key
particularly in a market experiencing major transformation.
Understanding customers’ needs and responding to them
ﬂexibly, comprehensively and with insight is critical in helping to
differentiate us from our competitors. That is why we aim to put
the customer at the heart of everything we do – strengthening
that relationship and building trust and delivering what we
promise. This is encouraging customers to move from short-term
contracts based on individual transactions, to longer-term
arrangements under which they sign up for packages of services.
OUTLOOK
Our performance underpins our conﬁdence that we can continue
to grow revenue, EBITDA before speciﬁc items, earnings per
share before speciﬁc items, and dividends over the coming year.
We are conﬁdent in our ability to improve shareholder returns
and accelerate the strategic transformation of the business. In
addition, taking into account the group’s net debt level and
strong cash ﬂow generation, we have decided to introduce a
new £2.5 billion share buy back programme, while increasing
dividends and investing in the growth of the business. We
expect this buy back programme to be completed by 31 March
2009. We seek to maintain a solid investment grade credit
rating and will continue to invest for the future and, with an
efﬁcient balance sheet, further enhance shareholder value.

LINES OF BUSINESS
BT Global Services
BT Global Services’ target market is the top 10,000 multi-site
organisations, both overseas and in the UK, including major
companies with signiﬁcant global requirements, together with
large organisations in target local markets.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, BT Global Services revenue
increased by 4% to £9,106 million. New wave and non-UK
revenue increased by 8% and traditional revenue declined by
9%. New wave and non-UK revenue accounted for 79% of total
revenue, compared with 76% in the 2006 ﬁnancial year.
The continued migration of our customers from traditional
voice and data services to networked IT services and managed
solutions enables us to build closer, high-value relationships with
these customers, helping them to manage their businesses more
effectively and gain competitive advantage in their markets.
Such relationships will, we believe, deliver long-term, proﬁtable
revenue, more than offsetting the decline in our traditional
business revenue.
As well as local, national and international communications
services and higher-value broadband and internet products and
services, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of networked IT
services focused on messaging and conferencing, CRM,
convergence, outsourcing and security. We also offer
consultancy services to help organisations understand network
performance, operate their networks and applications efﬁciently
and transform their businesses.
Our extensive global communications network and strong
partnerships enable us to serve customers in the key commercial
centres around the world using a combination of direct sales and
services capabilities and strategic partners.
BT Global Services is an increasingly global operation.
Although it currently generates most of its revenue in the UK,
the US and Western Europe, we are anticipating strong growth
in the Asia Paciﬁc region, particularly in India where, in the
2007 ﬁnancial year, we obtained both national and international
long-distance licences through our venture, BT Telecom India.
Markets in Japan and China will also become increasingly
important. In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, BT Global Services
experienced particularly strong revenue growth of over 30% in
the Asia Paciﬁc region.
The revenue growth that we have experienced in Italy in recent
years is a good illustration of the success of our global strategy.
Thanks to a mix of both organic and inorganic growth, we are now
one of the main competitors in the Italian business market.
Networked IT services
In recent years, we have developed a track record of winning
and delivering complex, large-scale networked IT services
contracts for large business customers and other organisations –
including the public and government sectors – around the world.
We have shown that we have the experience and expertise to
help our customers succeed in a world in which business
applications are increasingly being networked and networks are
seen as increasingly vital to productivity and competitive
advantage.
BT is proving to be a world leader in delivering networked IT
services through, for example, our work for the NHS National
Programme for Information Technology, which is helping to
transform the lives of doctors, nurses and patients across
England by delivering new computer systems and services to
improve the way patient information is stored and accessed.
In January 2007, N3 – the national broadband network that
we are building for the NHS – reached 18,000 connections in
England, two months ahead of schedule. We are also more than
two-thirds of the way to completing the Scottish N3 network.
These networks provide NHS professionals with fast and secure
access to health applications, enabling them, for example, to
obtain patient records and images rapidly and reliably at
signiﬁcantly lower cost. At the end of March 2007, the N3
network was voice-enabled, which will further reduce the cost
of telephony services and bring enhanced communications
between NHS sites.
In London, where we are implementing new IT systems for
the NHS across the capital, we have delivered capability to over
50% of trusts and completed our rollout of picture archiving
communications systems to 21 trusts. These systems enable
images such as X-rays and scans to be stored, displayed,
transmitted and archived electronically rather than being printed
onto ﬁlm, and will bring considerable beneﬁts to both patients
and NHS staff.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we also completed the most
complex and challenging software upgrades so far on the
national database and messaging service known as the Spine,
creating the infrastructure and software to support the rollout of
the NHS Summary Care Record Service, which will give
healthcare staff faster, easier access to reliable information
about patients.
In August 2006, we began the deployment of one of the
world’s largest IP converged private networks for the
Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), under an agreement
signed in December 2005. The DWP is one of BT’s three largest
central government clients and the contract – which runs until
March 2011 – is worth £740 million over its lifetime.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we secured networked IT services
orders (in the UK and around the world) worth £5.2 billion. This
included the following signiﬁcant contracts:
Date Contract
May 2006 We were awarded a three-year extension to our existing
outsourcing contract with Unilever. The deal, which is
worth around an additional £270 million, means that we
will continue to deliver voice, data and mobile services
globally to Unilever until 2012.
July 2006 We reached agreement with Dutch electronics giant
Philips on a ﬁve-year contract to provide a fully managed
solution for data, voice, conferencing and mobile
communications services in over 40 countries in EMEA
(Europe, the Middle East and Africa). We will manage
Philips’ MPLS-based data transport services within EMEA,
together with voice services, managed mobility and
certain metropolitan area networks, in addition to
providing global data access services, including security
services and ﬁrewalls, IP address management and
conferencing services.
September
2006
We signed a seven-year managed services agreement with
PepsiCo Inc to provide and manage an integrated
portfolio of data, LAN (local area network), security,
conferencing, remote access and internet services to
support the IT requirements of PepsiCo’s international
division. Under the terms of the contract – which covers
more than 900 locations in over 60 countries – BT will
migrate these services to a state-of-the-art, high-speed,
IP-based global MPLS infrastructure.
October
2006
We announced a contract with Alliance & Leicester to
transform its telecommunications infrastructure into a
single, fully managed, converged network for both voice
and data communications.

deliver additional beneﬁts across a range of council
services. This new deal increases the lifetime value of the
contract to more than £825 million.
February

We announced that we were signing a strategic
agreement with Credit Suisse, worth over £575 million,
to provide a broad package of mobile and internet
technologies and advanced connectivity services which
will enhance its operating efﬁciency as an integrated
global bank. The contract is initially for ﬁve years and will
be delivered in partnership with Swisscom to address
requirements across Credit Suisse’s enterprise and ﬁnancial
trading environments, with an additional focus on jointly
creating service innovations.
March
2007
With our partner Liberata, we signed a deal to become
the private sector strategic partner to Sandwell
Metropolitan Borough Council in the West Midlands.
BT/Liberata will build a new regional business centre in
Sandwell to run a range of IT and core business services
for the council, attract new business to the borough and
create jobs. The contract is valued at almost £300 million
over 15 years.
We also continue to build relationships with key industry
players in order to enhance the abilities of all parties to deliver
networked IT services. Examples of such successes are:
October
2006
Capgemini transferred a substantial portion of its
European Networking Infrastructure Services (NIS)
operation to BT. As part of this, we have taken on
approximately 250 people employed in Europe and are
now responsible for providing NIS services to Capgemini
customers. The deal is for ten years.
November
2006
We were selected as a sub-contractor to Atos Origin to
deliver a managed network service for the Department
for Constitutional Affairs. The contract is worth
£96 million over seven years. As the network services
sub-contractor, we will be responsible for migrating three
existing networks to a single, secure, resilient MPLS
network.
February
2007
HP and BT announced that they had signed seven-year
outsourcing contracts with Anglo American worth in total
around US$450 million. Under the contracts, BT and HP
will jointly manage the company’s global voice services,
data centre operations and end-user workplace
environment. A core part of the agreements is a
transformation programme to create an integrated global
IT infrastructure to support Anglo American’s strategy for
growth.
Networked IT services revenue for BT Global Services for the
2007 ﬁnancial year was £4,048 million, an 8% increase
compared with the 2006 ﬁnancial year.
We continue to feature prominently in reviews of business
capabilities. Gartner, for example, publishes a quarterly
assessment of network service providers ranked by their ability
to execute and their completeness of vision. In the latest
Gartner’s assessment (Magic Quadrant Report of Pan-European
Network Service Providers), BT Global Services is ranked top for
both. ‘BT’s broad service portfolio, large presence and range of
engagement models make it a candidate for most types of
organisations with pan-European networking needs.’ According
to specialist researchers, Forrester, ‘There are only a handful of
international network operators that can provide complex ICT
solutions that include global WAN (wide area network) services.
BT stands ﬁrmly among them.’
BT Retail
In addition to serving consumer customers in the UK, BT Retail
also has responsibility for:
r small and medium-sized businesses in the UK
r BT’s activities in Ireland
r a number of discrete enterprises, such as BT Conferencing, BT
Directories and dabs.com.
Revenue in the 2007 ﬁnancial year was £8,414 million,
compared with £8,507 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year.
Revenue grew year on year in the ﬁnal two quarters of the
2007 ﬁnancial year – the ﬁrst time in four years.

At a time when convergent, new wave products and services
are radically reshaping the communications industry, customers
of all kinds have more choice than ever before. However, more
choice can also mean more complexity and more confusion and,
consequently, the possibility of customers missing out on the
beneﬁts. BT Retail aims to offer customers straightforward and
complete services that compete on value not price, backed by
levels of customer service that differentiate us from our
competitors. And this applies as much to traditional services such
as telephone calls as it does to new broadband and mobility
services.
Consumer customers
At 31 March 2007, we had more than 16.2 million UK consumer
customers with around 19.3 million residential customer lines
(voice, ISDN (integrated services digital network) and
broadband). In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, consumer revenue
declined by 3% to £5,124 million, primarily reﬂecting the impact
of CPS (carrier pre-selection) and WLR (wholesale line rental).
However, the rate of revenue decline has been slowing and
ARPU (average revenue per user) is strong.

In the consumer market we aim to provide customers with a
range of services that help them communicate more effectively,
access entertainment and manage their lives. By increasing
revenue from broadband, mobility and internet services, we
intend to reduce further our dependence on revenue and proﬁt
from traditional, ﬁxed-line voice services. We also aim to
maximise the returns from our traditional business and defend
market share vigorously, through service offerings backed by
innovative marketing and excellent quality of service.
New wave services for consumers
Consumer new wave revenue grew by 34% to £858 million
in the 2007 ﬁnancial year, driven principally by broadband.
Residential broadband customers increased by 32% to 2.8
million.
BT offers a family of broadband packages designed to meet
the diverse needs of our customers, simply and cost effectively
in a highly competitive market. We believe that the broadband
experience is about much more than having basic access to the
internet; customers want their broadband connection to offer
a range of exciting content and secure, robust services as
standard, without having to pay extra for these features.
In June 2006, we launched BT Total Broadband,a
comprehensive broadband package offering download speeds of
up to 8Mb and giving customers free internet voice calls, free
video calls and a suite of security software, all brought together
through the BT Home Hub. Customers have the choice of three
options and can enjoy ultra-fast download speeds and free
evening and weekend UK voice calls with our BT Broadband
Talk service.
BT Total Broadband also includes 250 free BT Openzone
Wi-Fi minutes a month, giving customers access to thousands of
BT Openzone hotspots. At 31 March 2007, 2.4 million of our
residential broadband customers had signed up for BT Total
Broadband, more than half of whom had opted for our premium
packages.
Combined with the BT Home Hub – a device that connects
wirelessly to PCs and other broadband devices – BT Total
Broadband enables customers to experience the full range
of broadband services at home or when out and about.
With the launch of BT Vision in December 2006, we are
helping to deﬁne next-generation television, which is made
possible by the convergence of digital broadcast TV and
broadband technology. Customers are now able to watch what
they want, when they want. BT Vision, which does not require
a regular monthly subscription, is the ﬁrst widely available TV
service of its kind. The service is delivered via a new set-top box
– the V-box – which contains a personal digital recorder able to
store up to 80 hours of content, and pause or rewind live TV.
In December 2006, we announced that BT Vision customers
will have access to live FA Premiership and Scottish Premier
League football from the beginning of the 2007/08 season.
Under an agreement with leading pay TV sports broadcaster,
Setanta, BT Vision will carry 46 live Premiership games a season.
The fact that BT Vision already had the rights to 242 ‘near live’
Premiership games means that 75% of all Premiership games will
be shown in full. Customers will also be able – via BT Vision’s
replay TV service – to access a selection of terrestrial
programmes released in the previous week. Other content deals
have been signed with a wide range of leading entertainment
companies, including Warner Brothers, Disney, Universal Pictures,
Dreamworks, Channel 4, HBO, BBC Worldwide, Paramount,
Warner Music Group, EMI, Universal Music, Sony, BMG and the
History Channel and the National Geographic Channel.
Convergent services for consumers
We are also playing a lead role in the development of internet
telephony or VolP (voice over IP). In January 2007, we achieved
the milestone of one million registered consumer customers for
our VoIP services – BT Broadband Talk and BT Softphone – six
months ahead of schedule. BT Broadband Talk enables
customers to make and receive broadband calls using an
ordinary phone; BT Softphone is for users making calls over their
PCs. Both services offer high-deﬁnition sound. At 31 March
2007, the two services had 1.4 million customers.
In the consumer mobility market our strategy is to build a
foundation for the delivery of ﬁxed/mobile convergent solutions.
BT Fusion (launched in June 2005) is the world’s ﬁrst
intelligent mobile service that switches calls to a BT broadband
line when the user is at home, offering customers the
convenience of mobile in combination with the cost and quality
advantages of a ﬁxed-line phone. BT Fusion brings with it a
range of mobile services including text and picture messaging. In
January 2007, we launched BT Fusion Wi-Fi handsets. Users of

this service can make calls at home or out and about at our BT
Openzone hotspots at substantially reduced cost.
Value-added services for consumers
Because we believe that customers want hassle-free access
to new services, we are increasingly offering a range of
value-added services designed to make their lives easier.
Essentially, these services cover three areas: support, security
and entertainment.
BT Home IT Advisor, for example, is a one-stop advice and
support service for broadband customers, giving them a single
point of contact with a team of highly trained advisors,
dedicated to providing comprehensive support for their PCs,
networks, applications and up to 20 devices. The service can
even create a ‘virtual engineer in the home’ by enabling an
advisor to access a customer’s computer remotely in order to
troubleshoot a problem. Customers can either choose to pay a
monthly fee and use the service as often as they like, or they
can select a pay-as-you-go option. At 31 March 2007, almost
40,000 customers were paying a monthly subscription to BT
Home IT Advisor.
The BT Home IT Visit service takes the principle of domestic
IT support a step further. Customers are offered a house visit
from a specialist BT engineer who can give advice and guidance
on a range of computer matters, from installing software to
setting up a wireless network or connecting digital devices such
as cameras and MP3 players.
Our computer security products include BT Net Protect, which
offers anti-virus and ﬁrewall security products and BT Digital
Vault, an online data back-up and storage facility.
Traditional services for consumers
We continued to develop the services we have traditionally
offered in order to make them more attractive to consumers.
In August 2006, following a widespread review of telephone
tariffs, we cut the prices of BT Together Options 2 and 3 by
almost one third. We also offered a year’s free UK evening and
weekend calls to all customers who signed up to one of these
options packages for 18 months. At 31 March 2007, three
million customers had signed up for BT Together Options 2 and
3, and 68% of consumer revenue was under contract. From
October 2006, we cut the cost of calling many non-geographic
numbers and since January 2007 have been offering all our
customers who opt for paperless billing a reduction in their
monthly rental.

At 31 March 2007, over seven million customers had signed
up for BT Privacy, a caller display service which enables
customers to preview incoming call numbers and ﬁlter out
unwanted calls – up 90% on the 2006 ﬁnancial year. All BT
Privacy customers can be added to the Telephone Preference
Service register which ﬁlters out most unsolicited marketing
calls.
At 31 March 2007, we had almost 500,000 customers
registered on BT Text – the text-to-speech service that enables
users to send and receive texts on their home landline phones.
Since autumn 2005, almost three million customers have
registered to have their Friends & Family calling circle
automatically updated to ensure that the numbers they dial
most frequently attract maximum discounts.
Business customers
At 31 March 2007, in the UK we had around 1.5 million
business customers, with around eight million exchange lines.
In the SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) market
(typically companies with up to 500 employees), our strategy is
to provide customers with converged IT and communications
services that help them to manage their businesses more simply
and efﬁciently. By providing innovative communications
solutions and new levels of support to our business customers,
we believe that we can help them to gain competitive
advantage in their markets.
Overall in the SME market during the 2007 ﬁnancial year,
revenue grew by 1% to £2,353 million. 29% of revenue was
from new wave activity, compared with 23% in the 2006
ﬁnancial year.
New wave and value-added services for business and major
corporate customers
Broadband is increasingly critical to the success of small and
medium-sized businesses and BT Business Broadband remained
the leading internet service provider for SMEs in the UK.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, broadband revenues in the
business sector grew by 14% and 48% of new business
broadband customers had contracts for a minimum of two years.
At the end of the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we had around 700,000
business broadband customers.
However, businesses need more than basic broadband access
– over 95% of our broadband sales are now made with value-
added services attached.
Our BT Business Broadband Voice service is demonstrating
the possibilities of VoIP for businesses. At 31 March 2007, we
were signing up around 2,000 new BT Business Broadband Voice
customers a week.
BT Business IT Support Manager enables business customers
who want help installing BT Business Broadband to book an
engineer to visit their premises and/or provide after-sales
support. At 31 March 2007, more than 23,000 PCs were
supported in this way.
BT Business IT Manager gives SME customers the equivalent
of their own IT manager at a fraction of the cost. Customers can
choose the level of service that suits their business, ranging from
advice over the phone or the remote running of software
applications to help with installing PCs and networks and
developing more complex, long-term solutions.
In January 2007, we launched BT Business Total Broadband,
a comprehensive broadband package designed speciﬁcally for
SMEs. In addition to download speeds of up to 8Mb, BT
Business Total Broadband customers get a free BT Broadband
Voice additional line offer, which gives capped UK and
international calls over the internet, and security software,
including anti-virus and ﬁrewall applications for all ofﬁce PCs. BT
Business Total Broadband offers Option 2 and 3 customers 250
free BT Openzone wireless minutes a month, along with the
Business Essentials package which is designed to make it easier
for SMEs to run their business. The package includes ten
Business Email Lite mailboxes, 20Mb of webspace and access to

BT Workspace Lite, which enables everyone in the business to
store, access and share information. Customers also have the
support of a free, dedicated helpdesk, 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.
Converged services for business and major corporate customers
In the mobility market, our strategy is to integrate traditional
ﬁxed, mobile and IP services to offer a single communications
solution to our customers – through commercial packaging and
through the exploitation of technological convergence. In
addition, we provide a range of managed mobile services to UK
and global customers who either outsource their mobile
communications entirely or rely on BT to provide speciﬁc
managed services.
During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we launched a number of
new services designed to integrate business and corporate
customers’ ﬁxed and mobile communications services, including
BT Fusion Wi-Fi for Business – a single mobile device, designed
for the SME market, which offers a two-way handover between
Wi-Fi and mobile telephony. The beneﬁts include high-speed
access to business applications, free access to all ﬁxed and
mobile messages stored in one place and cheaper call rates.
In April 2007, we launched BT Ofﬁce Anywhere, a service
that gives users the functions of a Windows PC but in a
smartphone small enough to ﬁt in the pocket. Because, unlike
other smartphones, it comes with VoIP, BT Ofﬁce Anywhere also
offers free hour-long internet phone calls to UK landlines, plus
capped calls to UK mobiles and international landlines from
BT Openzone Wi-Fi hotspots in the UK and Ireland, from home
and ofﬁce networks, and from around the globe wherever users
have access to a compatible wireless network.
Traditional services for business customers
At 31 March 2007, BT Business Plan had almost 600,000
locations, up 16% on the 2006 ﬁnancial year, and accounted for
57% of call revenues from business customers.
Customers of BT Business Plan (excluding the lite option) can
also sign up to receive BT Assurance Plus, free of charge. The
beneﬁts of BT Assurance Plus include: the ﬁxing of any problems
the next working day, including Saturday; a dedicated support
team and a Freefone fault reporting number; and the option of
call diversion to a mobile phone, another ﬁxed line or a
personalised mailbox.

Convergent services in the wider community
Increasingly, we are extending the power of convergent
broadband and mobile services out of the home and ofﬁce and
into the community more widely. BT Openzone is one of the
leading providers of Wi-Fi services in the UK and Ireland. We
operate our own network of high-quality sites, which include
hotspots at Thistle, Ramada Jarvis and Hilton hotels, main train
stations, British Airways lounges, BAA airports and RoadChef and
Welcome Break service stations – and offer more wholesale and
roaming connections than any other UK Wi-Fi network operator.
BT Openzone offers customers a high-speed, wireless broadband
connection over which they can access the internet to work, talk
or play. At 31 March 2007, our BT Openzone customers had
access to around 10,000 hotspots in key locations in the UK and
Ireland and more than 40,000 globally.
We are also leading the way in building ‘wireless cities’
throughout the UK, in order to ensure that local residents,
businesses, tourists and local government employees are always
best connected, wherever they are, whatever they happen to be
doing and whatever device they happen to be using. In May
2006, we announced the creation of our wireless cities
programme, which committed us to Wi-Fi enabling 12 cities by
the end of March 2007. We achieved this ahead of schedule.
In December 2006, Ofcom published a consultation document
setting out its proposals for the award of available wireless
spectrum at a frequency ideally suited to the provision of
wireless broadband services, including those outside the home
and ofﬁce. This award will be made through an auction which
could take place in late 2007. We believe it is important for the
UK that this spectrum is developed for wireless broadband
services and new applications, as is happening in many other
parts of the world.

Enterprises
BT Enterprises consists of six businesses – BT Conferencing, BT
Directories, BT Payphones, BT redcare (monitoring and tracking
facilities), BT Expedite (a specialist retail division offering store
integration solutions and services) and dabs.com – which build
on BT’s existing strengths to generate innovation and growth in
a range of communications-related markets. Revenues in the
2007 ﬁnancial year were £710 million, up 32% on the 2006
ﬁnancial year.
BT Conferencing, for example, is now the number one
conferencing service provider in Europe. It has 300,000
customers around the world for its comprehensive portfolio of
audio, video and internet conferencing services and products,
backed up by high quality service and support.
dabs.com, a leading internet-based retailer of IT and
technology products, is a key part of our strategy to strengthen
our online sales and services capabilities in both the consumer
and SME markets. (See Acquisitions and disposals in the 2007
ﬁnancial year on page 19) dabs.com has a product portfolio of
around 15,000 lines from the world’s leading manufacturers,
including HP, Canon, Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu Siemens, Microsoft
and BT. During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, revenue from dabs.com
grew by 18%.
BT Ireland
BT has a long track record in Ireland, North and South, where
we have successfully run two separate operating units for a
number of years. In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we merged these
two divisions to create BT Ireland – a single, integrated business
serving the whole of Ireland. Our vision for this business is to
become the leading provider of networked IT and converged IP
services on the island of Ireland. In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, BT
Ireland generated revenues of £738 million.
BT Ireland operates across four principal markets – consumer,
business, major business and wholesale – delivering innovative
broadband packages and complex IT services to customers, large
and small.

Report of the Directors Business Filename: 51384_03.3d Time: 15:17:13 Date: 19/05/07
Checksum: -371968872
BT Ireland was recently named as the second largest IT services
company on the island with a strong focus on managed and
converged solutions. In the ﬁnancial services sector, for example,
it supports 13 of the 16 largest Irish and international
companies.
BT Ireland also has a signiﬁcant wholesale business,
supporting other leading operators, ﬁxed and mobile. Further
growth comes from infrastructure and transmission solutions
including, for example, the build and management of
Hutchison’s 3G network in Ireland.
In the consumer and SME markets, we are positioned as one
of the leading players in Northern Ireland and one of the
leading alternative providers in the Republic of Ireland, offering
competitive broadband and added value services.
BT Wholesale
BT Wholesale is evolving into a leading provider of innovative
business solutions. Our 21CN programme is replacing the
existing network and will provide the platform to offer a
seamless customer experience. The 21CN will provide the
opportunity for our communications provider customers to
develop new and compelling consumer products.
In the UK wholesale market, we provide network services and
solutions to over 700 communications companies, including
ﬁxed and mobile network operators, ISPs (internet service
providers) and other service providers. We interconnect with
more than 180 other operators, as well as carrying transit trafﬁc
between telecommunications operators.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, revenue from our wholesale
activities increased by 3% to £7,584 million.
New wave revenue was £1,097 million, up 17% on the 2006
ﬁnancial year. This increase was driven by the continued growth
of broadband as well as a strong emphasis on building
innovative network solutions.
We have a long and successful tradition of delivering
network-based connectivity to the carrier and intermediate
telecommunications markets throughout the UK. We have a
number of agreements with service providers and mobile
operators to upgrade their IP capability. In addition, we have
used our expertise and geographic reach to provide bespoke
data housing solutions.
Deliver on broadband
At 31 March 2007, 5,558 exchanges had been upgraded,
making broadband available to more than 99.9% of the UK’s
homes and businesses. When, in April 2002, we ﬁrst set targets
for broadband penetration in the UK, there were under 150,000
DSL connections, and exchanges covering just 66% of the
population had been upgraded for broadband. Including cable
customers, over 50% of all UK homes subscribe to broadband.

LLU (Openreach)
We continue to look for commercially viable ways of bringing
broadband to those customers for whom availability remains an
issue. We continue, for example, to explore the feasibility of
installing broadband equipment at locations closer to the
customer than the BT exchange, as well as the possibility of
delivering broadband over existing ﬁbre cables. As a
demonstration of our commitment to delivering higher-speed
broadband to UK consumers, 74% of wholesale broadband lines
were at least 2Mb at 31 March 2007 compared with 59% a year
earlier.
We are now conducting in-house trials of broadband speeds
of up to 24Mb. By continually upgrading exchanges across the
UK to support this service, we are providing the UK market with
a stable, high-speed broadband service with the widest national
coverage in the world.
In addition, we have enhanced broadband line stability to
ensure that customers can run more bandwidth-hungry
applications, including video, gaming and music downloads, at
the same time as sending/receiving e-mails and surﬁng the
internet.
Managed network services
In September 2006, Vodafone UK signed an agreement with BT,
to buy DSL broadband and ﬁxed-voice capacity from us in a
move which gave it immediate nationwide coverage, rather than
installing its equipment in our exchanges.
By opting for the BT IPStream product, Vodafone UK is able
to provide a broadband service to its customers without the
need to invest in its own ﬁxed-line network. As part of this deal,
we are managing the service end-to-end and incorporating
functions such as customer service and billing operations.
Vodafone UK’s service, Vodafone at Home, was launched in
January 2007.
From May 2007, the charge for BT IPStream was reduced by
up to 9%, with a second round of price reductions planned for
January 2008. There will also be opportunities for further
savings for communications providers at high-density exchanges
– the current scheme, which covers 561 exchanges, will be
extended to 1,016. BT DataStream customers will also have
opportunities to beneﬁt from this enhanced rebate scheme.
Mobility for wholesale customers
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we saw continued growth in the UK
wholesale mobility arena – increasing the volume and value of
wireless-originated trafﬁc over our network.
Report of the Directors Business review

Checksum: 1718647740
A key element of our wholesale mobility offering is BT Movio,a
service that delivers digital broadcast television and radio to
mobile handsets over the DAB (digital audio broadcasting)
spectrum. The ﬁrst mobile operator to re-sell the BT Movio
service is Virgin Mobile.
Traditional services for wholesale customers
At the same time as growing our new wave business, we
continued to implement our strategy of defending our
traditional business – selling a wide range of capacity and call-
based products and services, including regulated interconnect
services and new, non-regulated products and services. We
maintained our focus on the cost reduction opportunities that
arise as our business changes.
Twenty-ﬁrst century network
We believe that our 21CN programme is the most ambitious
business transformation programme in the global
telecommunications industry today and one of the largest ever
investments by a private sector company in the UK’s
infrastructure.
An end-to-end, next-generation IP network, 21CN provides
the platform to transform the customer experience by ensuring
that the delivery of converged services is fast, efﬁcient and
highly cost effective. It will bring new voice, data, broadband
and multimedia services to businesses and homes quicker than
before, and give customers more control over the way they use
these services. And it will enable us to rationalise and transform
our services portfolio.
In November 2006, the ﬁrst customers, in the village of Wick,
near Cardiff, were moved onto the 21CN infrastructure for live
running. This was the ﬁrst stage of a rollout programme, which
anticipates that around 350,000 voice lines and around 80,000
broadband lines in South Wales will be moved onto 21CN by the
end of 2007. To achieve this milestone, we designed and built
the largest network testing facility in our history; rebuilt around
20% of the UK’s national telecommunications infrastructure;
installed 21CN equipment at more than 100 sites around the
UK; and laid more than 2,300 kilometres of ﬁbre optic cable.
We also invested more than 1,500 man-years in developing new
IT systems to support the new network.
During the 2008 ﬁnancial year, we plan to increase the pace
of investment and operational activity to prepare for the
national migration of customers to the new network. The plan is
that the full, national rollout of 21CN will be substantially
complete by the end of the 2011 ﬁnancial year.
We have also set up a 21CN global venture which will enable
us to market the experience we have acquired of designing,
building, testing and delivering networks on the scale of 21CN
to other network operators around the world. The services we
offer range from consultancy to design and build.
We are committed to building open, transparent and inclusive
relationships with the rest of the industry and launched
Consult21 in the 2005 ﬁnancial year in order to promote a
shared understanding of the 21CN vision and the progress we
are making towards it. Since then, many of our wholesale
customers have contributed on a regular basis to this major
industry consultation process.
Openreach
Openreach was established in January 2006. Following a
strategic review of the telecommunications market by Ofcom,
BT undertook to put responsibility for our access network in the
hands of one distinct organisation within the BT group that
would offer communications providers – including other BT lines
of business – fair, equal and open access to the crucial ﬁrst mile
of network and underpin the future development of the
industry.
Openreach now provides services to around 400
communications providers in the UK, connecting millions of end
users’ premises to their telecommunications networks by ﬁxed-
line local and backhaul connections.
At the heart of Openreach’s operations are the 20,000 ﬁeld
engineers who install, repair and upgrade lines, ensuring that
households, ofﬁces and other premises have reliable local access
to the telephony, internet and other services offered by their
communications providers.
For the 2007 ﬁnancial year, Openreach reported for the ﬁrst
time as a separate line of business. Revenues were
£5,177 million, driven by strong market volume growth, which
more than offset the impact of a price reduction for WLR
(wholesale line rental).
Equivalence Management Platform
The EMP (equivalence management platform) was established in
June 2006 and is the largest IT capability of its kind in the UK
telecommunications industry. The EMP is the transactional
platform that will underpin all Openreach’s interactions with
communications providers. It was designed to deliver service
with a greater degree of automation, processing up to 100,000
orders a day and with the capacity to carry out up to 60,000
line checks an hour.
Products
Wholesale Line Rental
WLR, which enables communications providers to offer
telephony services with their own brand over BT’s network,
currently generates around two-thirds of Openreach’s revenue.
We anticipate that this will decline as customers increasingly
migrate to LLU. In December 2006, Openreach achieved a
signiﬁcant milestone by placing the ﬁrst live order for its new
WLR capability, WLR3 (wholesale line rental analogue), on an
equivalent basis via the EMP.
At 31 March 2007, Openreach was providing more than 23
million WLR lines to BT lines of business and over 4.2 million to
other communications providers. Of the lines provided to other
communications providers, over 3.5 million were WLR analogue
lines (up 46% on the 2006 ﬁnancial year) and 689,000 were
WLR digital lines (up 52% on the 2006 ﬁnancial year).
Local Loop Unbundling
LLU, which enables communications providers to use the
Openreach lines connecting BT exchanges to end users’ premises
and to install their own equipment in those exchanges, is
another key Openreach product.
There are two types of unbundled line:
r a fully unbundled line gives other communications providers
the exclusive use of the copper line
r a shared access line only gives other communications
providers the use of the high-frequency channel used for
broadband – the line will also be used by the customer’s
ﬁxed-line voice provider.
In February 2007, we achieved the milestone of 1.5 million
non-BT communications providers’ unbundled lines, an increase
of 640% since Openreach was created. Combined with BT’s use
of unbundled lines, this brought the total to 10.7 million (BT
lines of business – 8.8 million; non-BT customers – 1.9 million)
in the UK as at 31 March 2007, with 21 communications

The 1.5 million line milestone was critical because, in Ofcom’s
view, it represented the appropriate level of competition to
enable BT to announce plans to reduce our wholesale broadband
prices – offering communications providers a cost-effective
alternative to LLU.
Ethernet
Openreach continues to develop a comprehensive portfolio of
Ethernet products to support backhaul and access services for
LLU operators and a growing number of other communications
providers.
Equivalence
The Undertakings completed in the 2007 ﬁnancial year included
some major product deliveries – the launch of LLU and Ethernet
products on an equivalent basis and the separation of
management information systems were the most signiﬁcant from
our customers’ point of view. Further Undertakings remain to be
implemented between now and 2010. (See BT’s Undertakings
under the Enterprise Act, on page 21)
Network investment and service performance
Service involves more than reactive provision and repair activity;
it also includes reinvigorating the access network infrastructure –
improving the health of the network leads to improved
reliability, enhanced service standards and reduced cost.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, Openreachinvestedsigniﬁcantlyin
the installation of new network components, focused on improving
the quality of individual workmanship and concentrated on
identifying and upgrading the worst performing parts of the
network. This led to a decrease in the number of access network
faults, while the number of high-bandwidth services provided
continued to increase.
Peaks in demand caused by serious weather incidents are now
resolved more rapidly than they used to be. Our rapid recovery
from the extensive damage caused by the January 2007 storms
is a good example of the advantages of the move to one distinct
organisation managing a fully integrated engineering workforce.
During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, around 150,000 network
joints were replaced or sealed and 9,000 network black-spots
were upgraded. We also removed or replaced 25,000 defective
telephone poles and renewed or upgraded 32,000 overhead
wires.
Focusing our repair activities on some of the main causes of
faults, we carried out more than 40,000 targeted improvements
to local networks.
Overall activity levels in exchanges rose by 70%, and by
31 March 2007, 655 exchanges had been prepared for 21CN.
Investing in recruitment, training and development
There was a major focus on talent acquisition and accelerated
development.
We recruited 1,100 ﬁeld engineers during the 2007 ﬁnancial
year and expect to recruit up to 400 modern apprentices in the
2008 ﬁnancial year.
We also invested more than £44 million in the training and
development of Openreach people. The Openreach Network
Health Academy trained around 1,250 managers, for example.
By the end of the 2008 ﬁnancial year, around 8,500 engineers
will be trained in fault prevention techniques and over 10,000
frame engineers will be accredited to carry out frames work. In
addition to such specialist technical training, Openreach’s
employees are required to complete mandatory training to
support the BT Code of Practice. There was a concerted drive to
ensure that Openreach people fully understood the behavioural
implications of compliance.
TRANSFORMING OUR COSTS
We remain focused on ﬁnancial discipline and on delivering
efﬁciency programmes to generate sustainable cost savings.
We continue to benchmark ourselves against the best in the
industry. In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, efﬁciency programmes
delivered savings of over £500 million, enabling us to invest in
growing our new wave activities and increase our proﬁts.
A key area of focus has been enhancing the ways in which
customers can deal with BT, simultaneously saving costs and
improving customer service. Programmes have targeted the cost
of failure by, for example, minimising the number of times a
customer call is transferred before resolution and reducing the
amount of call waiting time through better call routing.
The number of transactions completed via bt.com rose by
more than 90% in the 2007 ﬁnancial year. And at 31 March
2007, we had over 2.8 million customers receiving e-bills – up
22% in the ﬁnancial year – over 900,000 of whom do not
receive a paper bill – a 90% increase on 31 March 2006.
We have also been reducing the complexity of our systems
and processes. (See IT Support on page 24)
Other programmes relate to innovative procurement and
sourcing and we continue to look at ways of streamlining our
organisation and eliminating duplication.
We also continued to reduce overheads such as
accommodation, using buildings more efﬁciently and introducing
ﬂexible working practices. In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we vacated
around 40 buildings and installed an additional 1,300 ﬂexible
workstations which can be shared by multiple users.
IMPROVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND SERVICE
Improving customer satisfaction remains a signiﬁcant challenge –
one that we need to rise to if we are to maintain long-term,
mutually rewarding relationships with our customers. This is why
our aim in the 2007 ﬁnancial year was to increase the number
of customers who are ‘very’ or ‘extremely’ satisﬁed with BT by
5%, at the same time as maintaining the improvements in
customer dissatisfaction levels we had achieved in previous
years.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, the average score for customers
who were ‘very’ or ‘extremely’ satisﬁed was around 3% higher
than in the 2006 ﬁnancial year; levels of dissatisfaction
remained the same.

Checksum: -109738161
Understanding what drives satisfaction is crucial to delivering
improvements that will sustain loyal relationships with our
customers. During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, for example, we
recruited additional call centre staff and improved our repair and
call handling performances. In addition, we launched a number
of new services, products and pricing changes designed to
improve customer perception of the value for money we offer
and how we account manage our relationships with them.
Much of our training and development activity remains
focused on removing any barriers to the delivery of excellent
customer service. Our core people engagement initiative, the
‘my customer’ programme, aims to enable all BT people to
deliver great customer service through teamwork.
Looking forward, we aim to drive further improvements
through a relentless focus on customer service measures
including ‘right ﬁrst time’ (keeping our promises) and ‘cycle
time’ (the speed at which we deliver service).
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
Acquisitions and disposals prior to the 2007
ﬁnancial year
The BT of today was largely created by a radical restructuring of
the company in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. This restructuring
involved the UK’s largest-ever rights issue (raising £5.9 billion),
the demerger of O2 (comprising BT’s wholly owned mobile
assets in Europe), the disposal of signiﬁcant non-core businesses
and assets, the unwinding of Concert (our joint venture with
AT&T) and the creation of customer-focused lines of business.
Our principal acquisition in the 2005 ﬁnancial year was
Infonet, one of the world’s leading providers of international
managed voice and data network services, for £520 million,
including acquisition costs. Excluding Infonet’s net cash balance,
the net value of the deal was £315 million. We also acquired
the 74% of Albacom that we did not already own for a total
acquisition cost of £131 million. Albacom (now BT Italia)
provides data transmission, voice and internet services to the
Italian business communications market.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we acquired Radianz, the leading
ﬁnancial services extranet provider, from Reuters for a total
consideration of £143 million. We also acquired Atlanet, a Fiat
subsidiary providing domestic telecommunications services to
Fiat and other non-Fiat business customers throughout Italy, for
approximatelyE80 million, further reinforcing our position in
the Italian market. During July and September 2005, the
conditions enabling BT to redeem the exchangeable bond over
our shares in LG Telecom were fulﬁlled. As a result, virtually all
the bondholders exercised their right to convert their bonds into
LG Telecom shares, enabling us to dispose of all our shares. The
transaction gave rise to a redemption gain of £27 million.
Acquisitions and disposals in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we completed a number of key
transactions:
Date Acquisition
April 2006 We acquired dabs.com, one of the UK’s leading online
retailers of IT and technology products.
August 2006 Tech Mahindra, a company in which we now own 35% of
the issued share capital, was listed on the Indian national
and Bombay stock exchanges, following an IPO (initial
public offering). We received proceeds of £25 million for
the sale of a 6% stake in the IPO. Tech Mahindra,
formally Mahindra BT, provides end-to-end IT services
and solutions to the telecoms industry. As at 31 March
2007, Tech Mahindra had a market capitalisation of
around £2 billion, valuing BT’s holding at around
£700 million.
October
2006
We acquired California-based Counterpane Internet
Security Inc. (Counterpane), a leading provider of
managed networked security services. Counterpane
monitors 550 networks worldwide for multinational and
Fortune 100 customers.
November
2006
We made a recommended cash offer for internet service
provider PlusNet plc, offering 210 pence per share,
valuing the company at approximately £67 million net
of cash. In January 2007, the offer was declared wholly
unconditional, and PlusNet was de-listed from the
Alternative Investment Market in February 2007.
Operating since 1997, PlusNet has nearly 200,000
broadband customers.
February
2007
We signed a conditional agreement to acquire
i2i Enterprise Pvt Ltd, a Mumbai-based enterprise
services company distributing BT Infonet products and
services to major Indian and multinational companies.
i2i is one of the most innovative providers of enterprise
telecommunications services in the fast-growing Indian
market.
March 2007 We acquired International Network Services Inc. (INS),
a leading global provider of IT consulting and software
solutions, based in California. The company has almost
900 employees in 12 countries and has served 75% of
Fortune 500 enterprises.
March 2007 We increased our stake in i.Net from 51% to 65.4%
through the purchase of a private stake and a voluntary
public offer, both at a price ofE52.30 per share. i.Net
is our Italian hosting and managed security subsidiary,
listed on the Italian stock exchange.
We also completed a number of smaller transactions in the
2007 ﬁnancial year, including: a joint venture with KDDI to
address the growing market for the provision of global managed
network services and global outsourcing services to organisations
headquartered in Japan; a venture with Jubilant Enpro, part of
the Jubilant Group, an Indian conglomerate, to apply for
national long-distance and international long-distance licences
in India; and the disposal of our full-time satellite broadcast
services assets to Arqiva.

Post-balance sheet acquisition
In April 2007, we entered into a conditional agreement to
acquire Comsat International – a leading provider of data
communication services for corporations and public sector
organisations in Latin America – through its parent company,
CI Holding Corporation. Comsat International employs more than
700 professionals with in-depth knowledge of Latin American
markets and provides services directly in 15 countries. It has a
track record in the delivery of complex projects and the
management of network solutions for enterprise, public sector
and carrier customers.
REGULATION, COMPETITION AND PRICES
BT operates in an increasingly competitive and dynamic
commercial environment, both in the UK and around the world.
The 2006 ﬁnancial year saw the most signiﬁcant change to
the UK regulatory regime since BT was privatised when, in
response to Ofcom’s strategic review of telecommunications,
we proposed a number of legally-binding Undertakings under
the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Enterprise Act). These Undertakings
were accepted by Ofcom and came into force in September
2005. (See BT’s Undertakings under the Enterprise Act on
page 21)
The Undertakings are intended to deliver clarity and certainty
to the UK telecommunications industry, with regulation focused
on the bottleneck parts of the network, and over time rolled
back elsewhere, to the beneﬁt of consumers and others in the
marketplace.
This is mainly being achieved through Openreach’s operations
– offering certain products and services to all communications
providers in the same way – and through other widespread
organisational and systems changes. Since the Undertakings
came into force, we have made good progress in delivering
our obligations.
Other regulatory highlights in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
included achieving deregulation in wholesale international
services markets, the ending of retail price controls and the
ending of our pricing commitments on wholesale calls. Ofcom
is currently carrying out a market review of the wholesale
broadband access market and is expected to carry out three
further market reviews in the 2008 ﬁnancial year. (See
Signiﬁcant market power conditions)
Regulation in the UK
UK regulation is conducted within a framework determined by
various EU (European Union) directives, regulations, and
recommendations. This framework is currently under review by
the European Commission and proposals for revised EU directives
are expected towards the end of the 2007 calendar year,
although they are unlikely to take effect in the UK before 2010.
Our policy is to comply fully with the regulatory framework in
which we operate, while competing fairly and vigorously within
the rules.
Ofcom
The Ofﬁce of Communications (Ofcom) was set up under the
Ofﬁce of Communications Act 2002 to provide a single, seamless
approach to regulating the entire communications market. Its
principal duties are to further the interests of citizens in relation
to communications matters and to further the interests of
consumers in relevant markets, where appropriate by promoting
competition.
Regulation takes the form of sets of conditions, mostly laid
down by Ofcom under the Communications Act 2003
(Communications Act), and directions under these conditions.
Some conditions apply to all providers of electronic
communications networks and services; others apply to
individual providers which are designated as having a USO
(universal service obligation) or, following a review of relevant
markets, are found to have SMP (signiﬁcant market power),
which is aligned with the competition law concept of
dominance.
Other more general types of obligations are set out in the
Communications Act.
Conditions applying to all providers of electronic
communications networks or services
General conditions
The general conditions made by Ofcom under the
Communications Act apply to all providers of electronic
communications networks or services. Although these conditions
are concerned primarily with consumer protection, they also
address issues such as general access and interconnection
obligations, standards, emergency planning and numbering.
A separate condition regulates the provision of premium rate
services.
Electronic Communications Code conditions
The Electronic Communications Code applies to communications
providers authorised to carry out streetworks and similar
activities for network provision. Its application is subject to
conditions made by the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry.
Other general obligations
Other general types of obligations contained in the
Communications Act include:
r the payment of administrative charges (broadly the equivalent
of licence fees under the old framework)
r the provision of information to Ofcom when required.
Conditions applying to BT speciﬁcally
Universal service obligation conditions
BT is the designated supplier of universal service for the UK,
excluding the Hull area where Kingston Communications is the
designated provider.
The services covered by the USO are deﬁned in an order
issued by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Our
primary obligation is to provide a single narrowband connection
to the ﬁxed telephone network – which, in addition to voice
services, must support functional internet access (dial-up) – to
anyone who reasonably requests it.
Signiﬁcant market power conditions
Ofcom is required by EU directives regularly to review relevant
markets and to determine whether any communications provider
has SMP in those markets. Where Ofcom ﬁnds that a provider
has SMP in a market, it must impose such additional conditions
as it considers appropriate, as speciﬁed in the Communications
Act. These may include obligations to meet reasonable requests
to supply certain services to other communications providers,
not to discriminate unduly and to notify price changes and
obligations relating to regulatory accounting. In some cases,
extra obligations such as price controls have also been imposed.
Following a number of market reviews by Ofcom, BT has been
deemed to have SMP in certain ﬁxed telecommunications
markets, including all or parts of the markets for: ﬁxed
narrowband retail services, ﬁxed narrowband wholesale exchange

lines, call origination and conveyance, wholesale broadband
access and wholesale local access.
During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, Ofcom determined that we no
longer have SMP in any of the wholesale international services
markets, and our pricing commitment on wholesale calls ended.
Ofcom is currently conducting a market review of wholesale
broadband access markets and is also planning to carry out
market reviews of the leased lines market, and ﬁxed narrowband
wholesale services and ﬁxed narrowband retail services, in the
2008 ﬁnancial year.
BT’s Undertakings under the Enterprise Act
The key Undertakings given by BT are to:
r establish Openreach
r deliver equivalence of input for key wholesale products, and
increased transparency for others
r introduce new rules on access to, and sharing of, certain
restricted information
r restrict the exercise of inﬂuence by other parts of BT on the
commercial policy of both Openreach and parts of BT
Wholesale
r ensure fair access and migration to our 21CN for other
communications providers
r publish and make available to all BT people a code of practice
explaining what they must do to comply with the
Undertakings
r create an Equality of Access Board to monitor, report and
advise on BT’s compliance with the Undertakings and the code
of practice. The EAB was established on 1 November 2005.
(The EAB Annual Report 2007 (which does not form part of
this report) is available online at www.bt.com/eabreport)
The Undertakings include a number of requirements –
some have speciﬁc dates for delivery and others are ongoing.
At 31 March 2007, we had met most of the relevant
requirements with a few exceptions, two of which the EAB
reported as ‘non-trivial’.
Competition
Competition and the UK economy
The growth of mobile telephony over the past decade has been
a major factor in shaping the UK’s telecommunications landscape
and VoIP has also taken off in the past two years. Mobile now
accounts for around 41% of total UK voice minutes. The mobile
and ﬁxed-line markets are currently treated as separate and
regulated differently.
Market share was previously modelled using data from
internal and external sources. For consistency with the external
market and compliance with our equivalence obligations, we are
reporting market shares based on the latest available information
reported by Ofcom, which is for the period ended 30 September
2006.
On this basis, BT’s share of the residential ﬁxed-voice calls
market (deﬁned as including local, national and international
minutes) declined to 53% for the quarter ended 30 September
2006, compared with 58% for the quarter ended 30 September
2005. CPS (carrier pre-selection) has been the main contributor
to the loss of share in the ﬁxed-voice market.
BT had 38% of the market for business ﬁxed-voice calls
(deﬁned as including local, national and international) for the
quarter ended 30 September 2006, compared with 39% for the
quarter ended 30 September 2005. We supplied around 71% of
exchange lines in the UK for the quarter ended 30 September
2006, compared with 78% for the quarter ended 30 September
2005, with cable operators being the primary alternative
providers.
Competition law
In addition to communications industry-speciﬁc regulation, BT is
subject to the competition law provisions of the Competition Act
1998 (the Competition Act) in the UK and of the European
Community Treaty. Breach of UK or EU rules could lead to ﬁnes
of up to 10% of a company’s worldwide revenue in its previous
ﬁnancial year and/or claims for damages in national courts. A
company may also be ordered to cease an infringing activity. We
are also subject to national competition rules in Europe and
elsewhere.
In 2004, Ofcom launched an investigation into allegations
that BT had abused a dominant position in relation to its pricing
of consumer broadband products. Ofcom sent BT three
statements of objection to which we responded, arguing that
our pricing does not amount to an abuse of dominance. Ofcom
is expected to issue a decision in 2007.
Pricing regulation
Following a review in 2006 of retail price controls covering
public-switched telephony services, Ofcom concluded that the
retail price control which ended on 31 March 2006 would not
be replaced. BT is therefore no longer subject to retail price
controls on these services. Other services continue to be subject
to price controls:
r Network charge control: We operate under interconnection
agreements with most other operators. Our charges for a
range of interconnect services are controlled by Ofcom, under
the NCC (network charge control) regime. These controls are
designed to ensure that our charges are reasonably derived
from costs, plus an appropriate return on capital employed.
Depending on the degree of competition, charges are cap-
controlled each year by RPI minus X for services Ofcom
considers unlikely to become competitive in the near future,
and safeguard cap-controlled (ie no increases above RPI) for
services likely to become competitive. (X is a number speciﬁc
to a particular market, indicating the permitted change in
controlled prices relative to the rate of inﬂation.) The current
NCC period began on 1 October 2005 and will last until
30 September 2009.
BT must notify Ofcom and other operators if it intends to
amend existing charges or offer new services.
r Partial private circuit charge control: PPCs (partial private
circuits) are leased lines that BT sells to other network
operators. On 1 October 2004, Ofcom introduced a PPC
charge control to replace the annual determinations
previously carried out by Oftel. The control is a four-year,
three-part RPI-X formula covering low and high bandwidth
services and equipment.
Ofcom is planning to carry out a review of the ﬁnancial
framework of Openreach, which will include looking at pricing
and costs. The review will start during 2007.

Non-UK regulation
BT must comply with the regulatory regimes in the countries in
which we operate and this can have a material impact on our
business.
European Union
Regulation in each country within the EU is conducted within
the regulatory framework determined by EU directives,
regulations and recommendations. The manner and speed with
which directives have been implemented vary from country to
country and national regulators are working together in the
European Regulators Group to introduce greater harmonisation
in their approach to the assessment of SMP and the imposition
of appropriate remedies.
BT does not have universal service obligations outside the UK,
although in certain member states we may be required to
contribute towards an industry fund to pay for the cost of
meeting universal service obligations in those countries.
Following the European Commission’s formal investigation
into the way the UK Government set BT’s property rates and
those paid by Kingston Communications, and whether the
Government complied with European Community Treaty rules on
state aid, the Commission concluded that no such state aid had
been granted. The Commission’s decision has now been
appealed, but we continue to believe that any allegation of state
aid is groundless, and that the appeal will not succeed.
Rest of the world
The vast majority of the markets in which we operate around
the world are regulated, and in most of these we have to meet
certain conditions and obtain licences or other authorisations.
The degree to which these markets are liberalised varies widely.
Our ability to compete fully in some countries is therefore
constrained.
We continue to press incumbent operators and their national
regulatory authorities around the world (including the EU) for
cost-related wholesale access to their networks where
appropriate.
Other signiﬁcant changes and issues
Wholesale broadband pricing
We have had discussions with Ofcom about how we might
ensure price-related protection for broadband consumers in
parts of the UK where wholesale broadband competition is less
likely to develop in the next few years. The aim is to balance our
need to be competitive in the wholesale broadband market
while recognising that emerging LLU operators require a period
of stability in order to establish a sustainable business. As a
result, we have agreed a series of detailed ceiling and ﬂoor
pricing commitments for certain mass market wholesale
broadband products – BT IPStream and the proposed Wholesale
Broadband Connect service. The commitment on price ﬂoors
ends on 1 July 2009, and on 31 December 2010 for price
ceilings.
Funds for liabilities
Under the terms of the Electronic Communications Code, an
electronic communications provider with apparatus on or in the
public highway is required to make ﬁnancial provision to cover
any damage caused by work it carries out, and for the removal
of its network in the event of liquidation or bankruptcy.
The conditions require the company to provide Ofcom
annually with a certiﬁcate that, in the opinion of its board of
directors, it has fulﬁlled its obligations to ensure the availability
of the required funds. This has been done by BT.
RELATIONSHIP WITH HM GOVERNMENT
The UK Government, collectively, is our largest customer, but
the provision of services to any one of its departments or
agencies does not comprise a material proportion of our
revenue. Except as described below, the commercial relationship
between BT as a supplier and the UK Government as customer
has been on a normal customer and supplier basis.
We can, however, be required by law to do certain things and
provide certain services for the UK Government. General
conditions made under the Communications Act require all
providers of public telephone networks and/or publicly available
telephone services, including BT, at the request of and in
consultation with the authorities, to make, and if necessary
implement, plans for the provision or restoration of services in
connection with disasters. The Civil Contingencies Act 2004
contains provisions enabling obligations to be imposed on
providers of public electronic communications networks,
including BT, in connection with civil contingency planning. In
addition, the Secretary of State has statutory powers to require
us to take certain actions in the interest of national security and
international relations.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
BT does not believe that there are any pending legal
proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the
ﬁnancial position or operations of the group.
There have been criminal proceedings in Italy against 21
defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with
the Italian UMTS (universal mobile telecommunications system)
auction. Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in
that auction process. On 20 July 2005, the former BT employee
was found not culpable of the fraud charge brought by the
Rome Public Prosecutor. All the other defendants were also
acquitted. The Public Prosecutor is in the process of appealing
the court’s decision. If the appeal is successful, BT could be held
liable, with others, for any damages. We have concluded that it
would not be appropriate to make a provision in respect of any
such claim.
RESOURCES
Corporate reputation and brand strength
BT has a strong, integrated brand that is widely recognised both
in the UK and around the world. According to global branding
organisation, Superbrands, BT has the fourth strongest brand in
the UK, up from twenty ﬁrst a year ago. Superbrands, which
publishes a list of the leading 500 brands in the UK, judges
companies on quality, reliability and distinction.
Our brand helps to shape our relationships with all our
stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, suppliers and
employees. It is vital that they all have a clear understanding of
what BT stands for, and that all their interactions with us
contribute to a consistently positive image of BT.
As a vital asset, the BT brand needs to be developed,
protected and managed with the same rigour that we bring to
other assets, both tangible and intangible. And as the world and
the markets in which we operate change, so our brand needs to
reﬂect this, becoming more conﬁdent, dynamic and forward
looking.
Our vision for BT is to be dedicated to helping customers
thrive in a changing world.
Our mission is to be the leader in delivering converged
networked services.
By ensuring that the services we offer customers are
consistently focused on meeting their needs, straightforward and

easy to use, we will help those customers succeed in their
business and personal lives.
We are committed to contributing positively to society and a sustainable future. 
This is part of the heart of BT.
Our brand values are implicit in our new advertising strap line –
Bringing it all together – which captures both what we can do
for customers (helping them make the most of the possibilities
of converged communications) and our commitment to acting as
a single BT team.
Motivating our people and living the BT values
At 31 March 2007, BT employed 106,204 people worldwide –
101,701 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa; 3,688 in the
Americas; and 815 in the Asia Paciﬁc region. Our commitment
to meeting our customers’ needs means that every one of these
employees has opportunities to develop innovative solutions,
generate new business, drive efﬁciencies and experience
personal growth.
Our aim is to create a team of high-performing, engaged and
motivated people who can make a difference for customers,
shareholders, the company and themselves. Only by living our
values will we deliver our strategy, keep our promises to our
customers, seize new opportunities in new markets and maximise
the return from our traditional business.
Motivating leaders
The quality of leadership in BT is key to the successful delivery
of our strategy for transformation and growth. We are focused
on ensuring that leaders at all levels understand what is
expected of them, have access to appropriate development
opportunities and are able to benchmark their performance
against that of their peers.
We have, for example, rigorously deﬁned the capabilities we
expect our leaders to exhibit and have introduced a 360 degree
feedback tool to help them measure their performance. In the
2007 ﬁnancial year, we conducted extensive research into the
capabilities of our leaders to support focused investment in their
development.
Engaging and motivating our people
Our annual employee attitude survey was conducted most
recently in February 2007 and attracted a 74% response rate
(over 78,000 responses). The survey generates around 5,000
feedback reports for managers and their teams across the
business, helping to promote effective team working.
Employees are kept informed about our business through a
wide range of communications channels, including our online
news service, bi-monthly newspaper, regular e-mail bulletins and
senior management webchats and webcast brieﬁngs.
We have a record of stable industrial relations and enjoy
generally constructive relationships with recognised unions in the
UK and works councils elsewhere in Europe. In the UK, we
recognise two main trade unions – the Communication Workers
Union and Connect. We hold regular meetings between
management, employee trade union representatives and other
groups of employees in order to ensure that their views are
taken into account in any decisions affecting employees’
interests. We also operate a pan-European works council (the
BTECC). Our Chief Executive and other senior executives have
regular meetings with the BTECC and other employee
representatives.
Rewarding and recognising achievement
We continued to provide our employees with opportunities to
acquire a stake in the company. Under the BT Employee Share
Investment Plan (ESIP), BT can provide free shares to employees
and employees can buy shares in BT from their pre-tax salaries.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, £25 million was allocated to
provide free shares to employees under the ESIP. Employees
outside the UK received the same award of shares where
practicable; otherwise, they will receive cash equivalent to the
value of the shares. This allocation of proﬁts was linked to the
achievement of corporate performance measures determined by
the Board. From the 2008 ﬁnancial year, the award of free
shares under the ESIP will be replaced by free BT Total
Broadband Option 3 for all BT employees in the UK.
Employees can also buy shares at a discount under our
savings-related share option plan.
More than 93% of eligible employees participate in one or
more of these plans.
Learning now and in the future
We believe that people, particularly at the start of their careers,
will increasingly want to work for companies that commit to the
long-term development of their employees.
Our successful company-wide re-accreditation to Investors in
People in February 2005, ﬁrst achieved in 1998, demonstrates
our continuing commitment to the effective alignment of our
communications, training and development with our business
strategy.
We have created a learning governance model to ensure our
learning and development objectives and practice align with the
key strategic objectives of the business. Senior learning and
development representatives form the Learning Council, a body
which provides strategic and operational guidance for the whole
of BT to ensure that all learning and development activity is co-
ordinated across all lines of business.
R2L (Route2learn), our web-based, group-wide learning
portal, is evidence of our continuing investment in lifelong
learning and education for all BT people. Providing all BT
employees with an extensive range of learning programmes and
facilities, it is one of the largest corporate learning management
systems in Europe.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, R2L delivered over 310,000 online
and 21,400 instructor-led completed courses.
Embedding ﬂexibility and diversity
The changing nature of the markets in which we operate, our
focus on cost leadership and our investment in new services all
shape our permanent workforce.
In the UK during the 2007 ﬁnancial year, 6,391 people joined
BT (2006: more than 6,600), natural attrition was running at 4%
(2006: 3%) and 2,151 people left BT under our voluntary leaver
packages (2006: 2,169).
The ability to support ﬂexibility and agile working practices is
a key beneﬁt of many of the products and services we offer
customers and is fundamental to our own employment practices.
Agile working is well established in our UK operations – where
around 10,400 employees work from home – and is increasingly
important in our global operations. In Budapest, for example,

Report of the Directors Business Filename: 51384_03.3d Time: 15:17:23 Date: 19/05/07
Checksum: -1692042328
the introduction of ﬂexible working arrangements eliminated the
need to acquire additional ofﬁce space.
We continue to work to create an inclusive working
environment in which employees can thrive regardless of their
race, sex, religion/beliefs, disability, marital or civil partnership
status, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender
expression or caring responsibilities.
Pensions
Most of our employees are members of the BT Pension Scheme
(a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme) or the BT Retirement Plan (a money
purchase scheme), both of which are controlled by independent
trustees. The BT Pension Scheme was closed to new members on
31 March 2001. The majority of new employees are eligible to
join the BT Retirement Plan. (See Pensions in the Financial
review on page 46)
Health and safety
The health and safety of our people is of paramount importance
and we continue to seek improvements by focusing on
behavioural change. In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we concentrated
our health promotion activities on mental well-being – impaired
mental health is our single greatest cause of lost time and
productivity. Our sickness absence rate rose slightly in the year,
in line with the CBI average – 2.43% of calendar days were lost
– but is 22% lower than four years ago. During the 2007
ﬁnancial year, we reduced our accident rate by 10% to 2.4 lost
time incidents per million working hours at 31 March 2007.
Research and development
The GCTO (Group Chief Technology Ofﬁce) sets and drives the
open innovation and technology strategy for BT. GCTO includes
a global technology intelligence scouting unit, teams focused on
innovative new wave service opportunities, an innovation
strategy and media team, strategic technology analysis units, a
network and systems architecture team and leading research and
venturing facilities in Adastral Park (England), Malaysia and the
USA.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we invested £1,119 million in R&D
(research and development) to support our drive for innovation.
This investment comprised capitalised software development
costs of £741 million and R&D operating costs of £378 million.
This compares with £870 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year,
which comprised £544 million of capitalised software
development costs and £326 million of R&D operating costs.
We continue to focus our innovation work on key areas which
support our business and technology strategies, ﬁling patent
applications for 162 new inventions in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
and maintaining a total worldwide portfolio of 8,150 patents
and applications.
We have successfully launched eight innovative, independent
start-up companies through the corporate venturing partnership
unit New Venture Partners, in which we are a limited partner.
Two further propositions are currently in incubation. These start-
ups generate value by launching innovative solutions as high-
technology businesses in the global marketplace.
IT support
Our dedicated IT professionals have a strong track record in the
development and delivery of systems and solutions and in
managing a secure and resilient infrastructure. In addition to the
work for 21CN, signiﬁcant systems development effort in the
2007 ﬁnancial year was focused on providing support for
Openreach’s operations. Speciﬁcally, our IT teams delivered the
EMP (equivalence management platform) that is helping
Openreach to serve its customers.
During the ﬁnancial year, we continued the radical
rationalisation of the BT systems estate through our One IT
programme, which aims to deliver year-on-year reductions in
base costs at the same time as improving speed to market and
enhancing the customer experience. In particular, the resources
of the One IT programme – people, processes and technology –
are focused on ensuring that customers have rapid access to the
products and services they want.
By eliminating duplication and outmoded systems, we have
closed down around 700 IT systems in BT in the past two
ﬁnancial years, just over 500 of them in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
alone.
We have invested in a three-year plan to develop an
innovative and ﬂexible systems architecture for BT, based on
‘re-usable capabilities’, and able to support a wide range of
applications. In the ﬁrst year of the programme, we launched
around 60 core components of this new architecture.
During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, around 3,000 of our IT
professionals moved to customer-facing roles working with BT
Global Services, 2,500 people received a range of skills training
to help meet future demand, bringing the two-year total to
7,500. In addition, we set up nine ‘professional communities’ –
an industry-wide, best practice way of organising professionals
according to their skills in order to maximise organisational
effectiveness and contribute to individual development.
Property
At 31 March 2007, we occupied approximately 6,500 properties
in the UK and approximately 1,500 properties in the rest of the
world.
The majority of these UK properties are owned by – and
leased back from – the Telereal Group, which is part of the
William Pears Group.
These properties mainly house exchange equipment and are
needed as part of our continuing activities. Other, general
purpose properties consist chieﬂy of ofﬁces, depots and
computer centres.
We anticipate that our changing working patterns will
continue to reduce property costs.
OUR COMMITMENT TO SOCIETY
Corporate social responsibility
Managing social, ethical and environmental issues in a way that
grows shareholder value, builds our brand and helps us and our
customers become more sustainable is very important to us.
This section, together with the broad statement on social,
environmental and ethical matters on page 69, conforms to the
Association of British Insurers’ disclosure guidelines on social
responsibility. More detailed information about our social, ethical
and environmental performance is available in our independently
veriﬁed 2007 Sustainability Report at www.bt.com/betterworld
We invest signiﬁcant resources in our CSR programmes and it
is vital that we continue to be forward looking and responsible
in our everyday operations and maintain our reputation for
excellence. For a number of years we have measured the link
between customer satisfaction and CSR performance. Customers
who believe that BT takes its responsibility to society seriously
are 49% more likely to be ‘very’ or ‘extremely’ satisﬁed with BT.
During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, BT was ranked as the top
telecommunications company in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index for the sixth year in a row. (The Dow Jones Sustainability
Indexes rank companies for their success in managing social,

ethical and environmental issues for competitive advantage.) We
also hold the Queen’s Award for Enterprise in recognition of our
contribution to sustainable development, and in the 2006/07
Business in the Community Corporate Responsibility,
Environment and Community indexes, BT is one of only four
companies out of 100 to score over 95% on all six dimensions.
We were also named for the ﬁrst time as the leading corporate
organisation for sustainability reporting in a survey published by
SustainAbility, in association with UNEP (United Nations
Environment Programme) and Standard & Poor’s.
CSR Strategy
During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, the implementation of our
revised CSR strategy, which was discussed and agreed by the
Board, was a top priority. There are four key strands to this
strategy: maintaining current momentum, tackling climate
change, enabling sustainable economic growth and enabling a
more inclusive society – all issues to which we believe we can
make a positive contribution.
Maintaining current momentum
CSR touches every part of our business – from the way we
interact with our customers, suppliers and partners, look after
our people, give back to communities and support charities such
as ChildLine and UNICEF, right through to our practical concern
for the environment.
We commit a minimum of 1% of our UK pre-tax proﬁts to
activities which support society. We provided a total of
£22 million designed to beneﬁt society in the 2007 ﬁnancial
year, of which £3 million was charitable donations. Our key
performance indicator for a number of years has been based on
our contribution. In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we added a new
indicator to measure the effectiveness of our investment.
Our community investment strategy aims to help individuals
and communities make a better world through improved
communications skills and technology. A key strand of this is our
Better World campaign which has brought together our
education programme (which provides free resources for
teachers, pupils and parents and in-school activities with drama
groups and BT volunteers, both in the UK and internationally)
and other activities for young people. To date, we have involved
over three million pupils at more than 12,000 schools.
ChildLine, a UK charity, receives 4,500 calls every day but
lack of funds means that many hundreds go unanswered. We are
working with ChildLine on a campaign to ensure that every
child’s call for help is answered. In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we
raised £2 million for ChildLine and also raised money for
There4Me, an online counselling service for children run by the
NSPCC. We also helped Comic Relief, Sport Relief and Children in
Need run successful telethons which raised over £80 million for
good causes around the globe.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, as part of our Better World
campaign, we launched our ﬁrst global development partnership
with UNICEF. Community projects to bring education, ICT
(information and communications technology) and
communications skills to disadvantaged children will initially
focus on South Africa, to be followed by Brazil and China in
subsequent years. BT is investing £1.5 million over three years
and this will be enhanced by fundraising activities by our
employees around the world.
We recognise that we have a responsibility to the environment
and we continue actively to manage our waste reduction and
recycling. During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we received an income
of £4.5 million from our recycling activities, offset against the
£5.2 million we spent managing our waste contracts, recycling
our waste and sending waste to landﬁll.

Tackling climate change
BT is currently responsible for over 0.7% of the UK’s total
electricity consumption so we are well placed to make a
signiﬁcant contribution by actively reducing our carbon
emissions. In fact, we have been actively managing our UK CO
2
emissions for a number of years – they are currently 60% below
their 1996 levels. However, given the scale of the climate
change challenge we face, we have committed to achieving an
80% reduction in CO
2
emissions from our 1996 baseline by
2016.
As we transform our business and increasingly provide
innovative new wave services, our energy consumption could
increase as a result, for example, of the growth in our data
centres. Consequently, we have conducted an audit of the
energy consumption of these data centres and are implementing

energy saving recommendations. We will also be helping and
encouraging our customers, employees and suppliers to play
their part and this includes encouraging our suppliers to develop
products that emit lower levels of carbon. And we have
launched a website to enable people to calculate their carbon
footprint – www.bt.com/climatechange
The renewal of our green energy contract until 2010 means
that approximately 50% of our electricity needs in the UK will
be met by renewable sources and 50% from combined heat and
power.

Our Chief Executive, Ben Verwaayen, chairs the CBI’s climate
change task force, which has been established to set the agenda
for business’s approach to climate change and will make wide-
ranging recommendations to the UK Government, the CBI and
businesses later in 2007.
Enabling sustainable economic growth
Enabling growth that beneﬁts society – in both the developed
and developing worlds – within environmental limits is a new
area of focus for BT. In the 2008 ﬁnancial year, we will be
integrating sustainability into our business processes such as
product and proposition development. As part of this
programme, we are also looking at the issue of obsolescence in
the ICT industry.
Enabling a more inclusive society
We believe that ICT has a role to play in creating a more
inclusive society, helping everyone get a fair chance. Work on
this part of our CSR strategy is at an early stage, but we are
looking at:
r what we need to do to build up our digital inclusion activities
in the UK to help even more people get online. For a number
of years, our key performance indicator for digital inclusion
related to levels of broadband penetration. As these now
stand at more than 99.9%, we have introduced a new target:
to reduce the number of digitally excluded people in the UK
from 36% to 32.4% (a reduction of 10%) in three years.
r involving less advantaged and minority groups in ICT-enabled
work
r which new markets/services give all members of society the
same freedom and opportunities to communicate
r helping the voluntary and charity sectors to become more
effective through the application of ICT
r working with partners and customers to release the power of
diversity within our supply chain.
We believe that an inclusive approach to product design is good
for customers and good for business. We are proud, for
example, of our reputation for developing products that can be
used by all our customers, regardless of age or ability. For
example, we offer a wide range of phones with accessible
features. Our Age and Disability Action team works to raise
awareness within BT of the importance of inclusive design in
services ranging from billing to broadband and has been working
with The Centre for Inclusive Technology and Design on the
development of a toolkit to help designers and others involved
in product development, and to produce a general guide for
inclusive design for businesses.
CSR Risks
For a number of years we have maintained a CSR risk register.
During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we continued to develop our
knowledge and understanding of our CSR risks. Our most
signiﬁcant CSR risks continue to be:
r breach of the code of business ethics
r climate change
r diversity
r health and safety
r outsourcing
r privacy
r supply chain working conditions.
Each of these risks has an owner and a mitigation strategy in
place. These risks are not regarded as material in relation to the
group and consequently are not included in Group risk factors.
CSR opportunities
The increasing importance of sustainability issues both inside and
outside BT is leading to a much greater focus on the
opportunities that CSR provides as well as the risks that need to
be managed. This is not only in relation to building competitive
advantage by growing our brand and reputation for CSR, but
also in terms of commercial marketplace opportunities.
We believe that ICT has a positive role to play as part of the
solution as individuals and organisations look for more
sustainable ways of communicating, working and living.
We are planning to offer our business customers a carbon
audit which will measure their carbon footprint and explore ways
in which the use of ICT can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Products such as remote working and teleconferencing, for
example, play an important part in creating sustainable
businesses.

GROUP RISK FACTORS
In common with all businesses, BT is affected by a number of
risk factors, not all of which are wholly within our control.
Although many of the risk factors inﬂuencing our performance
are macroeconomic and likely to affect the performance of
businesses generally, others are particular to our operations.
This section highlights some of those particular risks but it is
not intended to be an extensive analysis of all risks affecting the
business. Some risks may be unknown to us and other risks,
currently regarded as immaterial, could turn out to be material.
All of them have the potential to impact our business, revenue,
proﬁts, assets, liquidity and capital resources adversely.
They should also be considered in connection with the
statement on Internal control and risk management on page
71, the forward-looking statements in this document and the
Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements
on page 158.
Regulatory controls
If our activities are subject to signiﬁcant price and other
regulatory controls, our market share, competitive position and
future proﬁtability may be affected.
Most of BT’s wholesale ﬁxed-network activities in the UK are
subject to signiﬁcant regulatory controls. The controls regulate,
among other things, the prices we may charge for many of our
services and the extent to which we have to provide services to
our competitors. In recent years, the effect of these controls has
been to cause us to reduce our prices. We cannot assure our
shareholders that the regulatory authorities will not increase the
severity of the price controls, nor extend the services to which
controls apply (including any new services that we may offer in
the future), nor extend the services which we have to provide to
our competitors. These controls may adversely affect our market
share, the severity of competition and our future proﬁtability. In
response to Ofcom’s strategic review of telecommunications, we
proposed a number of legally binding Undertakings under the
Enterprise Act 2002. These Undertakings were accepted by
Ofcom and came into force in September 2005. In the case of a
breach of the Undertakings, Ofcom has the right to seek an
injunction through the courts or issue a direction. Third parties
who suffer losses as a result of the breach may also take action
against BT in the courts for damages. The timescales for
achievement of a number of the milestones in the Undertakings
are very challenging. Further details on the regulatory
framework in which BT operates can be found in Regulation,
competition and prices on page 20.
Competition in UK ﬁxed-network services
We face strong competition in UK ﬁxed-network services. Ofcom
considers that we have signiﬁcant market power in various parts
of the UK ﬁxed telecommunications market. In these areas
Ofcom can enforce obligations to meet reasonable requests to
supply services to other communications providers, not to
discriminate unduly, to notify price changes and in some cases it
can also impose extra obligations such as price controls.
Ofcom has promoted competition in the ﬁxed-network area
by measures including local loop unbundling, carrier
pre-selection (making it easier for BT customers to route some
or all of their calls over our competitors’ networks) and the
introduction of wholesale access products.
Reduction in our share of the ﬁxed-network market may lead to
a fall in our revenue and an adverse effect on proﬁtability.
Unlike our competitors, we continue to be obliged by the
current regulatory regime to provide certain services to
customers in the UK, whether or not such provision of service is
economic.
There is also competition for voice and data trafﬁc volumes
between ﬁxed-network operators and those operators offering
VoIP and mobile services.
The impact of all these factors may be to accelerate the
diversion of our more proﬁtable customers without being able to
reduce our costs commensurately, which may cause adverse
effects on our business, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition
and prospects.
Technological advances
Our continued success depends on our ability to exploit new
technology rapidly.
We operate in an industry with a recent history of rapid
technological changes and we expect this to continue – new
technologies and products will emerge, and existing technologies
and products will develop further.
We need continually to exploit next-generation technologies
in order to develop our existing and future services and
products.
However, we cannot predict the actual impact of these future
technological changes on our business or our ability to provide
competitive services.
For example, there is evidence of substitution by customers
using mobile phones for day-to-day voice calls in place of
making such calls over the ﬁxed network and of calls being
routed over the internet in place of the traditional switched
network.
If these trends accelerate, our ﬁxed-network assets may be
used uneconomically and our investment in these assets may not
be recovered through proﬁts on ﬁxed-network calls and line
rentals.
The complexity of the 21CN programme, and the risk that our
major suppliers fail to meet their obligations, may result in
delays to the delivery of the expected beneﬁts. Impairment
write-downs may be incurred and margins may decline if ﬁxed
costs cannot be reduced in line with falling revenue.
Transformation strategy
Our strategy for transformation includes the targeting of
signiﬁcant growth in new wave business areas. This may result in
changes to our products, services, markets and culture. If this
transformation strategy is unsuccessful there is a risk that future
revenue and proﬁtability will decline.
In particular, we have targeted signiﬁcant growth in new
business areas, such as networked IT services, broadband and
mobility. In view of the likely level of competition and
uncertainties regarding the level of economic activity, there can
be no certainty that we will meet our growth targets in these
areas, with a consequential impact on future revenue and
proﬁtability.
We have announced a new organisational structure to help
deliver faster, more resilient and more cost-effective services to
all our customers wherever they are. Failure to complete this
programme of organisational change may reduce our
competitiveness, with a consequential impact on our future
revenue and proﬁtability.

Major contracts
Our business may be adversely affected if we fail to perform on
major contracts.
We have entered into a number of complex and high-value
networked IT services contracts with customers. Our pricing, cost
and proﬁtability estimates for major contracts generally include
anticipated long-term cost savings that we expect to achieve
over the life of the contract.
These estimates are based on our best judgment of the
efﬁciencies we plan to deploy. Any increased costs, delays or
failures to achieve the anticipated savings could make these
contracts less proﬁtable or loss making, adversely impacting our
proﬁt margins.
In some cases, our products and services incorporate software
or system requirements from other suppliers or service providers.
Our ability to meet our commitments in a timely manner may
depend on the ability of these suppliers and service providers to
meet their obligations. Failure to manage and meet our
commitments under these contracts may lead to a reduction in
our future revenue, proﬁtability and cash generation.
Networks and systems failures
Our business depends on our ability to transfer substantial
volumes of data speedily and without interruption. Any
signiﬁcant failure or interruption of such data transfer as a result
of factors outside our control could have a material adverse
effect on the business and our results from operations, including
the deployment of 21CN. We have a business continuity strategy
in place, designed to deal with such catastrophic events
including, for example, major terrorist action, industrial action,
extreme computer virus attack, hurricane or ﬂooding. A failure
to deliver that strategy may result in a material loss and there
can be no assurance that material adverse events will not occur.
Pensions
Declining investment returns and longer life expectancy may
result in the cost of funding BT’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme becoming a signiﬁcant burden on our ﬁnancial
resources.
As a result of the triennial actuarial valuation of the BTPS at
31 December 2005, BT agreed to make annual deﬁciency
payments of £280 million over ten years. The ﬁrst three
instalments have been paid up front with £520 million paid in
the 2007 ﬁnancial year and a further £320 million was paid in
April 2007.
The results of future scheme valuations will be impacted by
the future performance of investment markets, interest and
inﬂation rates and the general trend towards longer life
expectancy, as well as regulatory changes, all of which are
outside our control.

INTRODUCTION TO THE FINANCIAL REVIEW
The ﬁnancial results for the 2007, 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial
years reﬂect the continued strong growth in new wave services
as we drive value from transforming the business. Our results
reﬂect the continuing transformation of our business operations
and markets in an environment where the pace of change is
accelerating. We are driving the change by providing our
customers with new technology and services with greater
capabilities and lower cost. The focus on delivering the strategy
continued and the group’s performance beneﬁted from the
growth in new wave activities, such as networked IT services and
broadband, and our continued cost efﬁciency programmes. Our
global networked IT services business has grown and our global
capabilities have been strengthened by the successful
acquisitions of INS and Counterpane in the 2007 ﬁnancial year,
Radianz and Atlanet in the 2006 ﬁnancial year and Infonet and
Albacom in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The acquisitions of PlusNet
and dabs.com in the 2007 ﬁnancial year have also strengthened
our online sales and service capabilities as well as helping us to
provide our customers with the most that broadband can offer.
In this Financial review the commentary is focused principally
on the trading results of BT Group before speciﬁc items, a non
GAAP measure. This is consistent with the way that ﬁnancial
performance is measured by management and we believe allows
a meaningful comparison to be made of the trading results of
the group during the period under review. The directors believe
that the presentation of the group’s results in this way is
relevant to an understanding of the group’s ﬁnancial
performance as speciﬁc items are signiﬁcant one-off or unusual
in nature and have little predictive value.
Speciﬁc items are therefore analysed and discussed separately
from the line of business results in this Financial review.
The commentary in this Financial review also discusses trading
results including and excluding the impact of acquisitions. In
discussing underlying performance (excluding the impact of
acquisitions) we exclude the results of the Albacom and Infonet
acquisitions made in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The acquisitions
made in the 2007 and 2006 ﬁnancial years do not have a
signiﬁcant impact on the group results for the year and hence
are not excluded.
The following table shows the summarised income statement
and includes a reconciliation of the key ﬁnancial performance
measures before and after speciﬁc items and is discussed further
in this Financial review. The operating results by line of business
are discussed in addition to the overall group results as we
believe the activities and markets they serve are distinct and this
analysis provides a greater degree of insight to investors.

GROUP RESULTS
Whilst driving the transformation of the business, the group has
continued to make progress in growing earnings per share
before speciﬁc items, which at 22.7 pence, was 16% higher than
the 2006 ﬁnancial year and 25% higher than the 2005 ﬁnancial
year.
Strong growth in new wave revenue continued, and at
£7,374 million new wave revenue was 17% higher than the
2006 ﬁnancial year. New wave revenue in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year was £6,282 million, 38% higher than the 2005 ﬁnancial
year. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions of Albacom and
Infonet in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, organic growth in new wave
revenue was 26% in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. New wave revenue
represented 36% of revenue in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
compared to 32% and 25% in the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial
years, respectively. New wave revenue is mainly generated from
networked IT services, broadband and mobility.

In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, the growth in new wave revenue of
17% more than offset the 3% decline in traditional revenue to
£12,849 million. The continued decline in traditional revenue
reﬂects regulatory intervention, competition and also
technological changes that we are using to drive customers from
traditional services to new wave services, such as broadband and
IPVPN. In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, the growth in new wave
revenue of 38% more than offset the 5% decline in traditional
revenue.
Given the nature of our new wave activities and their relative
immaturity, the proﬁt margins generated from these activities
are currently lower than those from the group’s mature
traditional products and service offerings. The adverse impact on
the group’s overall proﬁtability has been mitigated by the overall
growth in revenues and our cost efﬁciency programmes which
achieved savings of over £500 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year.
We expect to continue to pursue proﬁtable growth in new wave
markets, defend our traditional business and generate
sustainable cost savings.
The table below analyses revenue by customer segment.
Major corporate includes the external revenue of BT Global
Services’ major corporate customers. Business includes the
external revenue of BT Retail from small and medium sized
enterprises (SME) customers. Consumer includes the external
revenue of BT Retail from consumer customers. Wholesale

Major corporate (UK and international) revenue increased by 5%
to £7,244 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year driven by the
growth in new wave revenue. This reﬂects the continued
migration from traditional voice only services to networked IT
services contracts and broadband. New wave revenue increased
by 9% to £4,433 million and represented 61% of all major
corporate revenue compared to 59% and 51% in the 2006 and
2005 ﬁnancial years, respectively. Networked IT services contract
wins in the 2007 ﬁnancial year were £5.2 billion. We believe
these wins in the 2007 ﬁnancial year, combined with the
£5.4 billion of contracts won in the 2006 ﬁnancial year and the
£7.2 billion of contracts won in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, are
building the foundation for future revenue growth as we
increase the level of networked IT services provided to major
corporate customers.
Revenue from Business (smaller and medium sized enterprise)
customers in the 2007 ﬁnancial year increased by 1% to
£2,353 million, which compares with a decline of 5% in the
2006 ﬁnancial year. This improvement reﬂects the continued
focus on innovative pricing plans and propositions that are
designed to deliver value to our customer base by bringing
together IT, broadband and communication services. New wave
revenue in this segment increased by 24% to £677 million
driven mainly by the 20% growth during the year in the number
of BT Business Broadband customers to 579,000 at 31 March
2007. The expansion of the BT Business Plan portfolio continued
during the year with the number of locations increasing by 16%
to 598,000, offsetting some of the decline in traditional
revenue.
Consumer revenue in the 2007 ﬁnancial year was 3% lower at
£5,124 million, which compares with a 5% decline in the 2006
ﬁnancial year. New wave consumer revenue increased by 34% to
£858 million, driven primarily by growth in broadband.
Residential broadband connections increased by 32% to
2,758,000 at 31 March 2007. Traditional consumer revenue
declined by 8% in the year, reﬂecting the shift towards new
wave products.
After a period of sustained growth the proportion of
consumer revenue under contract was 68% (2006 – 67% and
2005 – 64%) as a result of the reductions in package prices
made during the year. There are now 15.1 million BT Together
customers, with more than 3 million customers choosing higher
value packages, BT Together Options 2 and 3. The underlying 12
months rolling average revenue per customer household (net of
mobile termination charges) of £262 in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
was 4% higher than the 2006 ﬁnancial year and 3% higher than
the 2005 ﬁnancial year. Increased penetration of broadband and
the growth of value added propositions have more than offset
the lower call revenues.
Wholesale (UK and global carrier) revenue in the 2007
ﬁnancial year increased by 10% to £5,485 million driven by WLR
and LLU. New wave revenue increased by 36% driven by the

continuing growth in broadband. Global carrier revenue
decreased by 3% in the 2007 ﬁnancial year.
In the UK, BT had 10.7 million wholesale broadband DSL and
LLU connections, including 1.9 million LLU lines, at 31 March
2007, an increase of 2.6 million connections in the year.
Group operating costs before speciﬁc items increased by 4%
to £17,746 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year. Our cost
efﬁciency programmes achieved savings of over £500 million in
the 2007 ﬁnancial year which enabled us to invest in growing
our new wave activities and increase our proﬁts. Total operating
costs of £17,915 million, including speciﬁc items, increased by
4% and 12% compared to the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years,
respectively.
Staff costs excluding leaver costs, increased by £243 million
to £5,076 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year due to the
additional staff required to grow the networked IT services
business and to service increased levels of activity in the
network. Leaver costs of £147 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
compared to £133 million and £166 million in the 2006 and
2005 ﬁnancial years, respectively. Payments to other
telecommunications operators in the 2007 ﬁnancial year were
£4,162 million, an increase of 3% mainly reﬂecting the impact
of higher volumes. Other operating costs before speciﬁc items in
the 2007 ﬁnancial year increased by 5% to £6,159 million. This
reﬂects the cost of investing in new wave activities and
supporting new networked IT services contracts.
BT’s share of associates’ and joint ventures’ post tax proﬁt
before speciﬁc items was £15 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year,
compared with proﬁts of £16 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year
and losses of £14 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. During the
2005 ﬁnancial year Albacom contributed post tax losses of
£22 million prior to becoming a subsidiary.
Net ﬁnance expense before speciﬁc items was £233 million
for the 2007 ﬁnancial year, an improvement of £239 million
against the 2006 ﬁnancial year following an improvement of
£127 million against the 2005 ﬁnancial year. This improvement
in both years was due to a number of factors including the net
ﬁnance income associated with the group’s deﬁned beneﬁt
pension obligation of £420 million, which was £166 million
higher than the 2006 ﬁnancial year, which in turn was
£56 million higher than the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The repayment
of maturing debt in the 2006 ﬁnancial year has also reduced net
ﬁnance expense in the 2007 ﬁnancial year. The reduction was
offset by a gain of £27 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year on
redemption of the group’s US dollar convertible bond. As well as
this gain in the 2006 ﬁnancial year, the improvement on the
2005 ﬁnancial year was due to the reduction in the level of net
debt.
The above factors resulted in the group achieving a proﬁt
before speciﬁc items and taxation of £2,495 million in the 2007
ﬁnancial year, an increase of 15%. In the 2006 ﬁnancial year,
the proﬁt before speciﬁc items and taxation of £2,177 million
was 5% higher than the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The improvement
in the 2007 ﬁnancial year reﬂects revenue growth, cost
efﬁciency savings and lower net ﬁnance expenses.
The taxation expense on the proﬁt before speciﬁc items for
the 2007 ﬁnancial year was £611 million, an effective rate of
24.5%, compared to 24.5% and 26.0% in the 2006 and 2005
ﬁnancial years, respectively. The effective tax rate reﬂects the
continued focus on tax efﬁciency within the group.
Basic earnings per share before speciﬁc items were 22.7 pence
for the 2007 ﬁnancial year, an increase of 16% from 19.5 pence
in the 2006 ﬁnancial year which compares to 18.1 pence in the
2005 ﬁnancial year.
LINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS FOR 2007 AND 2006
The following section provides a summary of the operating
results of the group for the 2007 and the 2006 ﬁnancial years
in relation to each line of business.
Impact of Openreach on segmental disclosure
Prior to the 2007 ﬁnancial year, the group was organised into
three primary segments: BT Global Services, BT Retail and BT
Wholesale. On 22 September 2005, BT entered into the
Undertakings with Ofcom as a result of which BT was required
to establish a new line of business and primary segment called
Openreach. Openreach was launched operationally on 21 January
2006 and is separately reported within BT’s results for the ﬁrst
time in the 2007 ﬁnancial year.
In accordance with the timetable set out in the Undertakings,
the group was required to facilitate the reporting of Openreach
as a separate line of business by the end of July 2006. This was
achieved and discrete ﬁnancial information has been presented
to senior management on the new business structure with
respect to periods from 1 April 2006 onwards.
Both IFRSs and US GAAP require segmental information to be
presented on a consistent basis for all years reported. In the
event of a restructuring of business segments, comparative
information is therefore required to be restated, unless this is
impracticable. The results for the 2006 ﬁnancial year have been
restated to reﬂect the separate reporting of Openreach as a new
business segment. These restatements also reﬂect the impact of
the new internal trading arrangements which have been
implemented due to the creation of Openreach. The results for
the 2005 ﬁnancial year, however, have not been restated as it is
impracticable to do so.
Some of the products and services that Openreach now sell
were previously provided by BT Wholesale, but in a different
form. As a result of the Undertakings, new ‘equivalent products’
which did not previously exist had to be created for both
external and internal customers. The changes required to capture
the separate reporting of these new products and services were
introduced during the 2006 ﬁnancial year and therefore actual
data was available to support the estimates and assumptions
required to restate the results for that year. The equivalent
products and services did not exist in the 2005 ﬁnancial year,
and therefore the level of estimation and extrapolation required
to restate the results for that year would have been too
signiﬁcant to provide sufﬁciently objective and reliable
information.
Furthermore, the fundamental level of reorganisation and
restructuring which occurred, combined with the fact that the
products previously sold by BT Wholesale no longer exist, mean
it is also impracticable to report the results for the current
ﬁnancial year on the old business segment structure.
In order to assist the reader in understanding the year on
year performance, additional disclosures have been included
below showing the previously reported segmental data for the
2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years in respect of the group’s three
primary businesses, prior to the creation of Openreach.
There is extensive trading between the lines of business and
their proﬁtability is dependent on the transfer price levels. For
regulated products and services those transfer prices are based
on market prices, whilst for other products and services the
transfer prices are agreed between the relevant lines of business
on an arm’s length basis.

The table below analyses the trading relationships between each
of the lines of business for the 2007 ﬁnancial year. The majority
of the internal trading is Openreach selling calls, access lines,
broadband connections and other network products to BT
Wholesale, BT Retail and BT Global Services. This trading
relationship also reﬂects the pass through of termination charges
on other telecommunication operators’ networks and the sale of
wholesale broadband ISP products. BT Retail also trades with BT
Wholesale, selling apparatus, operator assistance and directory
enquiries services and conferencing for onward sale to other
telecommunication operators. BT Global Services’ revenue with
BT Retail mainly reﬂects the sales of BT Global Services’ products
in the UK. BT Global Services trades with BT Wholesale mainly
for use of the IP/ATM network, International Direct Dial trafﬁc
and certain dial IP arrangements. BT Wholesale’s revenue with
BT Global Services reﬂects the use of the UK network
infrastructure for BT Global Services’ products.

The line of business results are presented and discussed before
speciﬁc items, for the reasons set out above, to provide a
meaningful comparison of the trading results between the
ﬁnancial years under review. Speciﬁc items are discussed
separately in a group context in this Financial review.
In addition to measuring ﬁnancial performance of the lines of
business based on the operating proﬁt before speciﬁc items,
management also measure the operating ﬁnancial performance
of the lines of business based upon the EBITDA before speciﬁc
items. EBITDA is deﬁned as the group proﬁt (loss) before
depreciation, amortisation, ﬁnance expense and taxation. This is
a non GAAP measure and therefore may not be directly
comparable to the EBITDA of other companies, as they may
deﬁne it differently. EBITDA excludes ﬁnance expense, taxation,
depreciation and amortisation, the latter two being non cash
items, from group operating proﬁt and is a common measure,
particularly in the telecommunications sector, used by investors
and analysts in evaluating the operating ﬁnancial performance of
companies.
EBITDA before speciﬁc items is considered to be a useful
measure of the group’s operating performance because it
reﬂects the underlying operating cash costs, by eliminating
depreciation and amortisation, and excludes signiﬁcant one off
or unusual items which have little predictive value. EBITDA is not
a direct measure of the group’s liquidity, which is shown by the
group’s cash ﬂow statement and needs to be considered in the
context of the group’s ﬁnancial commitments. A reconciliation of
EBITDA before speciﬁc items to group operating proﬁt (loss) by
line of business and for the group is provided in the table across
the page below. Trends in EBITDA before speciﬁc items are
discussed for each line of business in the following commentary.

New wave external revenue grew in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
driven primarily by networked IT services contracts, which
generated revenue of £4,048 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year,
an increase of 8%. Networked IT services contract wins were
£5.2 billion in the 2007 ﬁnancial year. We believe that these
wins, coupled with the £5.4 billion contracts won in the 2006
ﬁnancial year continue to build the foundation for future
revenue growth.
New wave revenue growth in BT Global Services is
underpinned by the strong order intake for networked IT services
contracts over recent years. Many of these contracts are
transformational for our customers and extend over a number of
years, often ﬁve years or more. Whilst we expect new wave
proﬁtability will improve and the proﬁts generated from
traditional products and services declines, our continued cost
efﬁciency programmes should underpin the overall growth in
proﬁtability.
Traditional external revenue, which includes the global carrier
business as well as voice and data revenue from major
corporates, declined by £40 million compared to the 2006
ﬁnancial year to £3,161 million. This reﬂects the migration to
IPVPNs sold to major corporate customers in the UK and further
reductions in dial IP due to broadband substitution in the UK.
However, the decline in traditional revenue was partly offset by
a 31% increase in Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
revenue to £556 million.
The increase in new wave revenue, together with lower
network and sales, general and administrative costs, has resulted
in an increase in EBITDA in the 2007 ﬁnancial year of 5% to
£968 million. Driving the cost reductions are initiatives such as
the sourcing of roles globally and the streamlining of customer
processes. Leaver costs of £52 million were incurred in the 2007
ﬁnancial year, compared with £49 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year. Depreciation and amortisation costs were £37 million
higher compared to the 2006 ﬁnancial year, reﬂecting the
increased investment in our global infrastructure and bringing
NHS London assets into use. Together, these factors have
contributed to an increase in operating proﬁt of 2% to
£293 million.
Capital expenditure for the 2007 ﬁnancial year was
£695 million, broadly ﬂat compared with the 2006 ﬁnancial year
reﬂecting the continued investment in global infrastructure to
expand our global reach capabilities and support our customers.

BT Retail’s results reﬂect the strategic shift towards growing new
wave products and services while defending traditional revenue
streams. Revenue from networked IT services, broadband
products and other new wave services all increased, whilst
traditional revenue was successfully defended through changes
in pricing structure, introduction of packages that beneﬁt
frequent and high value users and marketing campaigns aimed
at delivering key customer service promises. Following the
relaxation of the regulatory environment, we introduced our
biggest ever cuts to all inclusive call packages. In the consumer
market the prices of BT Together Options 2 and 3 were reduced
by almost one third. As at 31 March 2007, 15.1 million
consumer customers were on BT Together packages. In the SME
UK business market the focus remains on placing customers on
commitment packages whereby lower call prices are received for
annual committed spend. By 31 March 2007 there were
598,000 Business Plan sites, up 16% in the year. Cost
transformation programmes continued to successfully reduce the
cost base of the traditional business, allowing investment in new
wave products and services.
BT Retail’s revenue declined by 1% in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
to £8,414 million, an improvement on 2006. Growth in new
wave revenue of 31% in the 2007 ﬁnancial year continued to
reduce our dependence on traditional revenue. This decline was
driven by substitution to new wave services and competition.

Traditional revenue comprises calls made by customers on the BT
ﬁxed line network in the UK, analogue lines, equipment sales,
rentals and other voice products. Traditional revenue was 7%
lower in the 2007 ﬁnancial year driven by high levels of
migration to broadband which is reﬂected in a 15% fall in dial
up minutes over the year, a reduction in the overall ﬁxed to
ﬁxed calls market and general competitive pressure.
New wave revenue grew by 31% to £1,784 million in the
2007 ﬁnancial year, driven primarily by broadband, networked IT
services and other new wave services. New wave revenue
comprised 21% of BT Retail’s revenue in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
compared to 16% in the 2006 ﬁnancial year.
Broadband revenue grew by 30% to £946 million in the 2007
ﬁnancial year. The growth of broadband continues to accelerate
with net additions of 796,000 connections, a 30% market share
of total broadband DSL net additions. In addition the acquisition
of PlusNet in January 2007 added 195,000 connections at
31 March 2007 giving BT 3,659,000 retail broadband
connections, overtaking Virgin Media to become the UK’s
leading broadband provider by market share. Broadband is
increasingly critical to the success of SMEs and BT Business
broadband revenue continues to grow.
Revenue from networked IT services at £375 million increased
by 3% in the 2007 ﬁnancial year despite the closure of our
Home Computing business following the removal of the tax
relief available to our customers under this Government backed
initiative. Excluding Home Computing, the underlying growth in
networked IT services was 15% in the 2007 ﬁnancial year. As
SMEs become increasingly aware of the beneﬁts they can
achieve by converging their voice and data into one network,
BT Business has responded by developing tools, packages and
services that offer a simple and complete solution. The portfolio
includes IP infrastructure – WAN/LAN and IP telephony and also
Data Centre Services, Security, Applications and outsourcing. We
launched BT Business One Plan which combines ﬁxed, mobile
and broadband communications in October 2006 and over
18,000 plans had been sold as at 31 March 2007.
Mobility and other new wave revenues grew to £463 million
from £271 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year, driven by the
acquisition of dabs.com and advertising revenues from
Payphones and Directories. Revenue from dabs.com, an internet
and IT retailer acquired by the group in April 2006, increased by
18% since acquisition despite a very competitive PC market.
We have moved from focusing on pure mobile to converged
services and bundles of products. In January 2007 we launched
BT Fusion Wi-Fi handsets and we have recently set up Wi-Fi
zones in 12 UK city centres and are already seeing a signiﬁcant
increase in local authority support to expand further with
mobility applications and services that will beneﬁt businesses,
consumers and community services. BT Openzone, our public
wireless broadband service, grew usage by 60% compared to the
2006 ﬁnancial year.
BT Retail’s future new wave growth will come predominantly
from the mass market roll out of broadband, converged services,
BT Vision and networked IT services to SME customers. New
sales are generally bundled with free or subsidised hardware and
include upfront investment in marketing and customer
acquisitions. During the initial stages of roll-out proﬁtability is
impacted by these costs. Within BT Retail the potential impact
of growing new wave revenue on reported proﬁtability has been
more than offset by the defence of more proﬁtable traditional
revenues, through the combination of service and value and cost
management programmes.
BT Retail’s gross margin percentage increased by 1.7 percentage
points in the 2007 ﬁnancial year reﬂecting an increased focus
on margin management.
Gross margin is revenue less costs directly attributable to the
provision of the products and services reﬂected in revenue in the
period. Selling, general and administration costs are those costs
that are ancillary to the business processes of providing products
and services and are the general business operating costs. BT
Retail analyses its costs in this manner for management purposes
in common with other retail organisations and it has set target
savings for selling, general and administration expenses.
Cost transformation programmes in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
generated selling, general and administration cost savings of
£223 million. These savings were driven by cost reduction
programmes focused on elimination of failure, channel
effectiveness, overheads and removal of inefﬁciencies and
duplication. The majority of these initiatives were targeted at
people related costs, with signiﬁcant savings in billing, IT
operations and other support functions. These savings allowed
the business to invest in new wave activities such as BT Vision
and dabs.com.
BT Retail’s EBITDA increased by 18% to £845 million in the
2007 ﬁnancial year, a signiﬁcant improvement compared to last
year. The beneﬁts from the investment in new products and
value added services have contributed to an improved EBITDA
performance in the current year. This was also reﬂected in the
18% improvement in operating proﬁt to £674 million in the
2007 ﬁnancial year.
Capital expenditure for the 2007 ﬁnancial year was 8% higher
at £166 million due to extra expenditure on implementation of
the systems development required under the Undertakings.

BT Wholesale is the line of business within BT that provides
network services and solutions within the UK. Its customers include
communications companies, ﬁxed and mobile network operators,
internet and other service providers interconnecting with BT’s UK
ﬁxed line network. The customer base also includes BT’s other lines
of business, BT Retail, BT Global Services and Openreach.
A signiﬁcant amount of BT Wholesale’s revenue is internal (2007:
47%, 2006: 47%).
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, revenue was £7,584 million, an
increase of 3%. External revenue increased by 4% to £4,057 million
in the 2007 ﬁnancial year. The increase reﬂects particularly strong
growth in new wave revenues, mainly broadband.
External revenue from traditional products remained ﬂat in
the 2007 ﬁnancial year at £2,960 million. The performance in
the traditional businesses was mainly driven by growth in transit
revenues, offset by continued migration from lower bandwidth
products to less expensive alternatives such as PPCs and
broadband. Substitution to broadband has resulted in the
continued declining trend in Flat Rate Internet Access Call
Origination revenues, which have more than halved to £9 million
in the 2007 ﬁnancial year.
New wave revenue, including broadband and managed
services, grew by 17% to £1,097 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial

year with broadband revenue growing by 26% year on year.
Wholesale broadband connections, including LLU lines, increased
to 10.7 million at 31 March 2007, an increase of 2.6 million
compared to the prior year.
Internal revenue increased by 3% to £3,527 million in the
2007 ﬁnancial year. The growth was driven mainly by increased
broadband sales through internal channels. This was offset by
the impact of lower volumes of calls and private circuits, and
lower regulatory prices being reﬂected in internal charges.
The proﬁt margins generated by certain new wave activities
are currently lower than those from the BT Wholesale’s
traditional product and service offerings. Any negative impact in
Wholesale’s overall proﬁtability has been offset by the overall
growth in revenues and our cost efﬁciency programmes which
achieved savings of over £80 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year.
We expect to continue to pursue proﬁtable growth in new wave
markets, defend our traditional business and generate
sustainable cost savings.
Gross variable proﬁt increased by 3% to £3,736 million in the
2007 ﬁnancial year reﬂecting volume changes and changes in
the mix towards more proﬁtable products.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, network, selling, general and
administration costs, excluding leaver costs, were 3% higher at
£1,775 million. Leaver costs were £39 million in the 2007
ﬁnancial year, compared with £31 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year. Activity levels in the network, mainly driven by broadband
and LLU volumes, have increased. In addition, there has been
increased 21CN related activity in the 2007 ﬁnancial year. The
ﬁnancial impact of this increased activity has been mitigated by
a series of cost reduction programmes focusing on efﬁciency,
discretionary cost management and process improvements.
EBITDA at £1,922 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year was 3%
higher. EBITDA margins were maintained at 25% across both
ﬁnancial years.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 9% in the 2007
ﬁnancial year to £1,198 million, due to the shortening of the
useful economic lives of legacy transmission assets to be
replaced by 21CN assets.
Operating proﬁt at £724 million decreased by 5% in the 2007
ﬁnancial year mainly as a result of the increase in depreciation.
The operating proﬁt margin remained ﬂat year on year at 10%.
Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and
computer software at £1,017 million increased by 4% in the
2007 ﬁnancial year. This reﬂects increased capital expenditure to
prepare for the 21CN and investment in new systems to ensure
compliance with the Undertakings. Investment in legacy network
technologies continues to be lower year on year as the 21CN
activity expands and legacy networks are replaced.

Openreach is a new line of business created within BT following
Ofcom’s strategic review of telecommunications. It was launched
operationally on 21 January 2006 and was separately reported
within BT’s results for the ﬁrst time in the 2007 ﬁnancial year.
Openreach manages the ‘ﬁrst mile’ of the UK access network on
behalf of the telecommunications industry. It operates and
delivers ubiquitous services on an open and even-handed basis,
to any and all communications providers, including to BT’s own
downstream divisions. It also strives not just to provide, maintain
and repair the access infrastructure, but to continually improve
both service and reliability.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, revenue was £5,177 million, an
increase of 1%. This increase is despite £170 million of
regulatory price cuts on WLR and LLU made in March 2005 and
August 2006.
External revenue increased by 115% to £685 million in the
2007 ﬁnancial year. This reﬂects the strong growth of the
broadband market and active competition among
communications providers. External LLU lines were 1.9 million at
31 March 2007, an increase of 1.6 million in the year. External
WLR lines and channels have increased by 1.4 million to
4.2 million at 31 March 2007.
Revenue from other BT lines of businesses decreased by 7%
to £4,492 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year. This reduction is
mainly driven by the WLR regulatory price reductions and the
shift of the WLR volumes from other BT lines of businesses to
external communications providers.
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, operating costs, excluding leaver
costs, were 4% higher at £3,289 million. Activity levels in the
network, driven by broadband and LLU volumes, have increased
in 2007 along with the investment in improving service levels.
There have also been new ongoing infrastructure costs of
supporting Openreach and the Equivalent Management Platform
(EMP) which enables Openreach to manage all communication
providers’ orders, both external and from other BT lines of
business, on an equivalent basis. These increases have been
partially offset by cost efﬁciencies made within the business. The
investment in service and equivalence has resulted in the
headcount increasing by around 2,000 in the year to 33,265.
EBITDA at £1,884 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year was 5%
lower as a result of the higher operating costs. This includes
leaver costs of £4 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year, an increase
of £1 million.
Depreciation and amortisation was £707 million in the 2007
ﬁnancial year, 12% lower than 2006. The decrease which is
mainly driven by the extension to the asset life of copper and
duct consistent with Ofcom’s review, partially offset increased
LLU depreciation.
Operating proﬁt at £1,177 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
was broadly ﬂat year on year, with operating proﬁt margins level
at 23% for both years.
Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and
computer software was £1,108 million, an increase of 7% in the
2007 ﬁnancial year. This reﬂects signiﬁcant investment in new
systems to ensure compliance with the Undertakings and
increased spend to meet LLU demand.

LINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS FOR 2006 AND 2005
In the following commentary, we discuss the operating results of
the group for the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years in relation to
the lines of business.
Prior to the 2007 ﬁnancial year, the group was organised into
three primary segments; BT Global Services, BT Retail and BT
Wholesale.
In order to assist the reader in understanding the year on
year performance, additional disclosures have been included
below showing the previously reported segmental data for the
2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years in respect of the group’s three
primary businesses; BT Global Services, BT Retail and BT
Wholesale, prior to the creation of Openreach. As noted above,
the 2005 results have not been restated to reﬂect the creation
of Openreach because it is impracticable to do so.
BT Global Services 2006 2005
£m £m
Revenue 8,632 7,488
EBITDA 1,001 961
Operating proﬁt 363 411
Capital expenditure 702 605
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, BT Global Services revenue was
£8,632 million, 15% higher than the 2005 ﬁnancial year. This
includes revenue of £795 million from the acquisitions of
AIbacom and Infonet which strengthened our global networked
IT services business. Revenue arising from services provided
outside the UK increased during the 2006 ﬁnancial year,
demonstrating BT’s continued transformation into a global
networked IT services company serving multi-site organisations.
Excluding the impact of the Albacom and Infonet acquisitions,
BT Global Services’ revenue was 5% higher than the 2005
ﬁnancial year.
New wave external revenue grew in the 2006 ﬁnancial year,
fuelled by networked IT services contracts which generated
revenue of £3,732 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year, an increase of
34%. Networked IT services contract wins were £5.4 billion in the
2006 ﬁnancial year. We believe these wins, coupled with the
£7.7 billion contracts won in the 2005 ﬁnancial year are building
the foundation for future revenue growth. Included in the contract
wins for the 2006 ﬁnancial year was aE450 million ﬁve year
contract with Fiat, as well as a realigned and extended contract
with the Department for Work and Pensions.
Traditional external revenue, which includes the global carrier
business as well as voice and data revenue from major
corporates, declined by £44 million compared to the 2005
ﬁnancial year to £3,184 million. This reﬂects the migration to
IPVPNS sold to major corporate customers in the UK and further
reductions in dial IP due to broadband substitution. However,
the decline in traditional revenue was partly offset by a 34%
increase in Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) revenue which
exceeded £400 million.
The increase in new wave revenue together with lower
network and sales, general and administrative costs, coupled
with the positive impact of the acquisitions has resulted in an
increase in EBITDA in the 2006 ﬁnancial year of 4% to
£1,001 million. The 2006 ﬁnancial year includes leaver costs of
£49 million compared to £59 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Depreciation and amortisation costs were £88 million higher
compared to the 2005 ﬁnancial year. This reﬂects the
acquisitions and increased investment in our global
infrastructure. These factors have contributed to a decrease in
operating proﬁt of 12% to £363 million.
Capital expenditure for the 2006 ﬁnancial year was £702 million,
an increase of 16% from the 2005 ﬁnancial year mainly due to
the investment in acquisitions and our global infrastructure.

BT Retail’s results demonstrated a continued strategic shift
towards new wave products with growth in broadband,
networked IT services and mobility revenues. Despite the
substitution by new wave products, traditional revenue was
defended by changes in pricing structure and packages to
beneﬁt frequent users and marketing campaigns focusing on key
customer service promises. BT Privacy, a service to address the
problem of unwanted calls by giving customers greater control
over the calls they receive, was launched on 1 July 2005, with
3.7 million customers registered by 31 March 2006. As at
31 March 2006, 16.2 million customers were on BT Together
packages. In the SME UK business market the focus remains on
placing customers on commitment packages whereby lower call
prices are received for annual committed spend. By 31 March
2006 there were 513,000 Business Plan sites, up 15% in the
year. Cost transformation programmes continued to successfully
reduce the cost base of the traditional business, allowing
investment in new wave products and services.
BT Retail’s revenue decreased by 3% in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year to £8,452 million. The growth in new wave revenue of
38% in the 2006 ﬁnancial year continued to reduce our
dependence on traditional revenue, the decline in which was
driven by the impact of regulation and competition. After
adjusting for the regulatory impact of the reduction in mobile
termination rates, revenue declined by 2% in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year. Revenue for the two years is summarised as follows:
2006 2005
£m £m
BT Retail revenue
Traditional 7,088 7,712
Networked IT services 363 304
Broadband 730 502
Mobility and other 271 180
New wave 1,364 986
Total 8,452 8,698
Traditional revenue comprises calls made by customers on the BT
ﬁxed line network in the UK, analogue lines, equipment sales,
rentals and other voice products. Overall revenue was 8% lower
in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. The reduction includes the effect of
continued high levels of migration to broadband which is
reﬂected in a 46% fall in dial up minutes over the year, a
reduction of 10% in ISDN lines and general competitive
pressure. The decline in private circuits and ISDN reﬂects
customers migrating to new wave products and services,
including broadband and IPVPN.
New wave revenue grew by 38% to £1,364 million in the
2006 ﬁnancial year driven primarily by broadband, mobility and
networked IT services. New wave revenue comprised 16% of

BT Retail’s revenue in the 2006 ﬁnancial year, compared to 11%
in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Broadband revenue grew by 45% to £730 million in the 2006
ﬁnancial year. The growth of broadband continues to accelerate
with 2,584,000 BT Retail connections at 31 March 2006, an
increase of 47% over last year.
BT Retail had net additions of 832,000 broadband customers
in the year, a 31% market share of the broadband DSL net
additions.
Broadband is increasingly critical to the success of SMEs and
BT Business Broadband revenue continues to grow.
Revenue from mobility and other new wave services increased
by 49% to £268 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. During the
year we launched BT Fusion, the world’s ﬁrst seamless combined
ﬁxed and mobile communications services on a single handset.
The consumer launch was in June 2005 and the business market
launch was in February 2006.
Networked IT services revenue increased by 19% to
£363 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. SME’s have become
increasingly interested in the beneﬁts they can achieve by
converging their voice and data into one network and BT
Business networked IT services are integrating and simplifying
the way customers are unifying their organisation’s voice and
data services. The portfolio includes IP infrastructure – WAN/LAN
and IP telephony and also Data Centre Services, Security,
Applications and outsourcing.
BT Retail’s gross margin percentage increased by 0.8
percentage points in the 2006 ﬁnancial year reﬂecting improved
margin management and greater efﬁciency in managing the
service provider network.
Gross margin is revenue less costs directly attributable to the
provision of the products and services reﬂected in revenue in the
period. Selling, general and administration costs are those costs
that are ancillary to the business processes of providing products
and services and are the general business operating costs.
Cost transformation programmes in the 2006 ﬁnancial year
generated selling, general and administration cost savings of
£206 million. These savings were driven by cost reduction
programmes focused on elimination of failure, channel
effectiveness, overheads and removal of inefﬁciencies and
duplication. The majority of these initiatives were targeted at
people related costs, with signiﬁcant savings in billing, IT
operations and other support functions.
BT Retail’s EBITDA increased by 5% to £791 million in the
2006 ﬁnancial year. This is a signiﬁcant improvement compared
to last year, which experienced EBITDA decline. The beneﬁts
from the investment in new products and value added services
have contributed to an improved EBITDA performance in the
current year. This was also reﬂected in the 6% improvement in
operating proﬁt to £644 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year.
Capital expenditure for the 2006 ﬁnancial year was
£153 million, a decrease of 10% resulting from tight controls
over expenditure.
BT Wholesale 2006 2005
£m £m
Revenue 9,232 9,095
Gross variable proﬁt 7,031 6,933
EBITDA 3,894 3,864
Operating proﬁt 1,992 1,950
Capital expenditure 2,013 1,981
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, revenue totalled £9,232 million, an
increase of 2%. External revenue increased by 11% to
£4,226 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year (an increase of 15%
excluding the impact of regulatory reductions to mobile
termination rates). The increase reﬂects particularly strong
growth in new wave revenues, mainly broadband. The regulatory
price reductions on mobile termination rates have no impact on
proﬁtability.
External revenue from traditional products increased by 1% in
the 2006 ﬁnancial year. Excluding the impact of regulatory
reductions to mobile termination rates external traditional
revenue was up 6% in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. The increase in
traditional revenue was mainly driven by growth in Partial
Private Circuits (PPCs) and Wholesale Access. Customers
continued to migrate from lower bandwidth products to less
expensive alternatives such as PPCs and broadband and this is
reﬂected in revenue from PPCs which increased by 18% to
£225 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. Substitution to
broadband has resulted in the continued declining trend in Flat
Rate Internet Access Call Origination revenues which have more
than halved to £26 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. Wholesale
access revenues have increased by £142 million in the 2006
ﬁnancial year as a result of increased volumes from other service
providers.
New wave revenue, including broadband and managed
services, grew by 56% to £1,033 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year. Broadband revenues grew by 74% year on year. Wholesale
broadband connections, including LLU lines, increased to
7.9 million at 31 March 2006, an increase of 2.9 million
compared to prior year.
Internal revenue decreased by 5% to £5,006 million in the
2006 ﬁnancial year. The reduction reﬂects both the impact of
lower volumes of calls, lines and private circuits, and lower
regulatory prices being reﬂected in internal charges.
Gross variable proﬁt increased by 1% to £7,031 million for
the 2006 ﬁnancial year reﬂecting volume changes and changes
in the mix towards more proﬁtable products.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, network and selling, general and
administration costs, excluding leaver costs, were 3% higher at
£3,103 million. Leaver costs were £34 million in the 2006
ﬁnancial year and £62 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. Activity
levels in the network, driven by broadband and LLU volumes,
have increased in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. The ﬁnancial impact
of this increased activity has been mitigated by a series of cost
reduction programmes focusing on efﬁciency, discretionary cost
management and process improvements.
EBITDA at £3,894 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year was 1%
higher. EBITDA margins were maintained at 42% across both
ﬁnancial years.
Depreciation and amortisation were ﬂat in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year at £1,902 million.
Operating proﬁt at £1,992 million increased by 2% in the
2006 ﬁnancial year. The operating proﬁt margin increased to
22% compared to 21% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and
computer software at £2,013 million increased by 2% in the
2006 ﬁnancial year. This reﬂects increased capital expenditure to
prepare for the 21st Century Network and to invest in new
systems to ensure compliance with the Undertakings agreed with
Ofcom. Investment in legacy network technologies continues to
be lower than last year.

OTHER OPERATING INCOME
Other operating income increased by £6 million to £233 million
in the 2007 ﬁnancial year and decreased by £324 million to
£227 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year due to the one off
impact of the £358 million proﬁt on disposal of non current
asset investments in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
OPERATING COSTS
Total operating costs before speciﬁc items increased by 4% in
the 2007 ﬁnancial year to £17,746 million which is in line with
the 4% increase in revenue. Our cost efﬁciency programmes
achieved savings of over £500 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
which enabled us to invest in further growth of our new wave
activities.
As a percentage of revenue, operating costs, excluding
speciﬁc items, were 88% in the 2007 ﬁnancial year (2006: 88%;
2005: 86%). In all three ﬁnancial years, net speciﬁc item
operating costs were incurred, amounting to £169 million,
£138 million and £59 million in the 2007, 2006 and 2005
ﬁnancial years, respectively. These speciﬁc costs are considered
separately in the discussion which follows.

In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, the number of staff employed
increased by 1,800 to 106,200, compared with increases of
2,300 and 2,200 in the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years,
respectively. The increases have been mainly due to the
additional staff required to service networked IT contracts,
increased levels of network activity, and in the 2007 ﬁnancial
year, the investment in service, and meeting the Undertakings.
Early leaver costs of £147 million were incurred in the 2007
ﬁnancial year, compared with £133 million and £166 million in
the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years, respectively. This reﬂects the
group’s continued focus on improving operational efﬁciencies.
The group’s pension expense for 2007 was £643 million, an
increase of £40 million from the 2006 ﬁnancial year, compared
to an increase of £63 million from the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
The increase in headcount, pay rates and pension costs have
contributed to a 5% increase in staff costs which were £5,223
million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year, following a 9% increase to
£4,966 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. The increase in
pension costs in the 2007 ﬁnancial year included the adverse
impact of using longer life expectancy assumptions. The increase
in pension costs in the 2006 ﬁnancial year included a switch
between wages and salaries and pension costs as a result of the
introduction of Smart Pensions, a salary sacriﬁce scheme.
The depreciation and amortisation charge increased by 1% in
both the 2007 and 2006 ﬁnancial years to £2,920 million.
Payments to other telecommunications operators increased by
3% in the 2007 ﬁnancial year to £4,162 million, due to
increased volumes, after increasing by 9% in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year.
Other operating costs before speciﬁc items increased by 5% in
the 2007 ﬁnancial year to £6,159 million after increasing by 8%
in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. This reﬂects not only the cost of
supporting new networked IT services contracts, but also
increased levels of activity in the network and investment in
service levels. Other operating costs include the maintenance
and support of our networks, accommodation, sales and
marketing costs, research and development and general
overheads.

In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, speciﬁc operating costs included
£64 million of property rationalisation charges in relation to the
group’s provincial property portfolio. A further £30 million was
recognised for the incremental costs associated with the creation
of Openreach and complying with the Undertakings agreed with
Ofcom. A charge of £65 million was recognised as a result of a
review of circuit inventory and other working capital balances.
During the year, the group agreed the settlement of
substantially all open UK tax matters relating to ten tax years up
to and including 2004/05 with HM Revenue and Customs. The
total impact of this settlement was a net credit of £1,067 million
comprising a tax credit of £938 million representing those

elements of the tax charges previously recognised which were in
excess of the ﬁnal agreed liability, interest income of
£139 million and operating costs of £10 million representing the
costs associated with reaching this agreement. The group also
disposed of 6% of its equity interest in its associate Tech
Mahindra Limited resulting in a proﬁt on disposal of £22 million,
in addition, the group disposed of a number of non core
businesses in the 2007 ﬁnancial year, resulting in a total loss on
disposal of £5 million. This principally comprised a loss on
disposal of £7 million relating to the sale of satellite broadcast
assets.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year speciﬁc operating costs included
£68 million of property rationalisation charges in relation to the
group’s provincial property portfolio. In addition, a provision of
£70 million was recognised relating to the incremental and
directly attributable costs to create Openreach arising from the
Undertakings agreed with Ofcom.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, the proﬁt on disposal of non
current asset investments, included within other operating
income totalled £358 million. This mainly comprised the sale of
BT’s 15.8% interest in Eutelsat SA for net proceeds of
£356 million resulting in a proﬁt on disposal of £236 million,
the sale of BT’s 4% interest in Intelsat for net proceeds of
£64 million which resulted in a proﬁt on disposal of £46 million
and the sale of BT’s 11.9% interest in StarHub Pte Ltd for net
proceeds of £77 million resulting in a proﬁt on disposal of
£38 million. In addition, BT incurred an impairment charge of
£25 million being BT’s share of a write down of Albacom’s
assets prior to becoming a subsidiary.
OPERATING PROFIT
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, operating proﬁt before speciﬁc items
of £2,713 million was 3% higher than the 2006 ﬁnancial year.
The increase in the 2007 ﬁnancial year reﬂects the revenue
growth of 4% offset by increased operating costs, described
above. Operating proﬁt of £2,633 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year was 2% lower than the 2005 ﬁnancial year due to the
higher operating costs.
Total operating proﬁt after speciﬁc items for the 2007
ﬁnancial year was £2,541 million compared to £2,495 million in
the 2006 ﬁnancial year and £2,992 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year.

In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, the net ﬁnance expense before
speciﬁc items of £233 million was £239 million lower than the
2006 ﬁnancial year, which in turn was £127 million lower than
in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The net ﬁnance income associated
with the group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension obligation of
£420 million was £166 million higher than the 2006 ﬁnancial
year which in turn was £56 million higher than the 2005
ﬁnancial year as a result of the increase in the value of the
scheme assets over the period. The interest on pension scheme
liabilities and expected return on pension scheme assets for the
2007 ﬁnancial year reﬂects the IAS 19 assumptions and
valuation as at 31 March 2006.
Interest on borrowings of £728 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial
year was £188 million lower than the 2006 ﬁnancial year which
in turn was £137 million lower than the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Both reductions mainly reﬂect the reduction in gross debt
through the repayment of bonds on maturity, in particular the
2005 dollar bond and 2006 euro bond. Interest income arising
from listed investments and other interest and similar income of
£79 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year was £119 million lower
than the 2006 ﬁnancial year which in turn was £58 million
lower than the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The reduction in interest
income mainly reﬂects the lower level of investment holdings
following their utilisation to fund bond maturities. In the 2006
ﬁnancial year the reduction in ﬁnance income was offset by a
gain of £27 million on the redemption of group’s US dollar
convertible 2008 bond.
Interest cover before speciﬁc items in the 2007 ﬁnancial year,
excluding the net ﬁnance income associated with the group’s
deﬁned beneﬁt pension obligation and speciﬁc items,
represented 4.2 times total operating proﬁt before speciﬁc items
which compares with interest cover of 3.6 times in the 2006
ﬁnancial year and 3.4 in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The
improvement in cover was due to the improvement in operating
proﬁt and reduction in net ﬁnance expense before pensions and
speciﬁc items.

joint ventures, before speciﬁc items, was a proﬁt of £15 million
in the 2007 ﬁnancial year. This compares with a proﬁt of
£16 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year and a loss of £14 million
in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
The principal contributor to proﬁt before taxation in the 2007
ﬁnancial year was the group’s associate, Tech Mahindra, which
contributed £21 million (2006: £13 million, 2005 £6 million). In
the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years the joint venture LG Telecom
in Korea also contributed a proﬁt of £7 million and £6 million
respectively. In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, Albacom in Italy
contributed a loss of £22 million prior to becoming a subsidiary.
PROFIT BEFORE TAXATION
The group’s proﬁt before taxation for the 2007 ﬁnancial year
was £2,484 million, compared with proﬁts of £2,040 million and
£2,354 million in the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years,
respectively.
The group’s proﬁt before taxation before speciﬁc items for
the 2007 ﬁnancial year was £2,495 million, compared with
£2,177 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year and £2,080 million in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year. Operating proﬁt was maintained in line
with the increase in revenue, with the improvement in proﬁt
before taxation mainly due to lower net ﬁnance charges.
TAXATION
The tax beneﬁt for the 2007 ﬁnancial year was a net credit of
£368 million and comprised a charge of £611 million on the
proﬁt before taxation and speciﬁc items, offset by a tax credit of
£41 million on certain speciﬁc items and a further speciﬁc items
tax credit of £938 million arising from the settlement of
substantially all open UK tax matters relating to ten tax years up
to and including the 2004/05 tax year.
The tax charge on the proﬁt before taxation and speciﬁc
items was at an effective rate of 24.5%, compared with 24.5%
and 26.0% in the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years, respectively,
and reﬂects the continued focus on tax efﬁciency in the group.
The tax charge for the 2006 ﬁnancial year was £492 million
and comprised a charge of £533 million on the proﬁt before
taxation and speciﬁc items, offset by a tax credit of £41 million
on certain speciﬁc items. The tax charge for the 2005 ﬁnancial
year was £525 million and comprised a £541 million charge on
the proﬁt before taxation and speciﬁc items, offset by a tax
credit of £16 million on certain speciﬁc items.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
The basic earnings per share of 34.4 pence per share for the
2007 ﬁnancial year compared with 18.4 pence per share for the
2006 ﬁnancial year and 21.5 pence for the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
The following table illustrates the impact of speciﬁc items on the
basic earnings per share.
Basic earnings per share before speciﬁc items of 22.7 pence
for the 2007 ﬁnancial year compare with 19.5 pence and 18.1

Diluted earnings per share were not materially different in either

DIVIDENDS
The Board recommends a ﬁnal dividend of 10.0 pence per share
(2006: 7.6 pence per share, 2005: 6.5 pence per share) to
shareholders, amounting to £825 million (2006: £631 million,
2005: £551 million). This will be paid, subject to shareholder
approval, on 17 September 2007 to shareholders on the register
on 24 August 2007. When combined with the 2007 interim
dividend of 5.1 pence per share, the total dividend proposed for
the 2007 ﬁnancial year is 15.1 pence per share, totalling
£1,247 million (2006: £993 million; 2005: £883 million). This
compares to 11.9 pence in the 2006 ﬁnancial year and 10.4
pence in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, an increase of 27% and 14%,
respectively. This represents a two thirds payout ratio, which has
been achieved a year earlier than previously announced.
Dividends paid in the 2007 ﬁnancial year were £1,053 million
(2006: £912 million; 2005: £786 million) and have been
presented as a deduction in shareholders’ equity.
SHARE BUY BACK
During the 2007 ﬁnancial year the share buy back programme
continued with the group repurchasing 148 million shares for
consideration of £401 million. During 2006 and 2005, the
group repurchased 166 million and 101 million shares for
consideration of £360 million and £195 million respectively.
Taking into account the group’s net debt level and the strong
cash ﬂow generation, we have decided to introduce a new
£2.5 billion share buy back programme whilst increasing
dividends and continuing to invest in the growth of the
business. The buy back programme is expected to be completed
by 31 March 2009. BT seeks to maintain a solid investment
grade credit rating whilst continuing to invest for the future and
with an efﬁcient balance sheet further enhance shareholder
value.
BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION
In April 2007, we announced a new structure that will deliver
faster, more resilient and cost effective services to customers
wherever they are. With effect from 1 July 2007, BT Design will
be responsible for the design and development of the platforms,
systems and processes, which will support our services; BT
Operate will be responsible for their deployment and operation.
Around 20,000 employees – from design, operations, IT and
networks – will move into these new units. We estimate that the
reorganisation and transformation activities will result in
restructuring costs of around £450 million which is expected to
generate a payback within two to three years. These activities
will include developing new processes and systems, re-skilling
and leaver costs which will be accommodated within existing
policies and by voluntary means. We expect the majority of
these costs to be incurred in the 2008 ﬁnancial year and to be
classiﬁed as a speciﬁc item in our 2008 results.

The cash inﬂow from operations of £5,245 million in the 2007
ﬁnancial year compares with £5,777 million in the 2006
ﬁnancial year and £5,906 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The
reduction of £532 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year, compared
to the 2006 ﬁnancial year, is mainly due to the pension
deﬁciency payment of £520 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
(2006: £54 million, 2005: £nil). The reduction in the 2006
ﬁnancial year when compared to the 2005 ﬁnancial year was
primarily as a result of lower working capital inﬂows of
£120 million compared with £253 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year. Net tax paid in the 2007 ﬁnancial year was £35 million
compared with £390 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year and
£332 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The reduction in net tax
payments in the 2007 ﬁnancial year when compared to the
2006 ﬁnancial year mainly reﬂects the initial net cash receipt of
£376 million in relation to the settlement with HM Revenue and
Customs discussed in the speciﬁc items section of this Financial
review. The increase in tax payments in the 2006 ﬁnancial year
when compared with the 2005 ﬁnancial year was primarily as a
result of normalisation of tax payments following low tax
payments in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Net cash outﬂow from investing activities of £3,035 million in
the 2007 ﬁnancial year compared with a net cash inﬂow of
£365 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year and net cash outﬂow of
£1,740 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The 2006 ﬁnancial
year includes a net cash inﬂow of £3,220 million on the sale of
investments, which was used to partly fund the repayment of
maturing debt in the 2006 ﬁnancial year, compared to a net
cash inﬂow of £258 million from the sale of investments in the
2007 ﬁnancial year. Net cash outﬂow for the purchase of
property, plant and equipment and computer software was
£3,209 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year, compared to
£2,874 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year and £2,945 million in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The increase in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
reﬂects the preparations for 21CN and the systems
developments required by the Undertakings agreed with Ofcom.
The net cash outﬂow for acquisitions in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
totalled £237 million and mainly related to the acquisition of
INS, PlusNet, dabs.com and Counterpane. In the 2006 ﬁnancial
year, the net cash outﬂow for acquisitions was £167 million and
mainly related to the acquisitions of Radianz and Atlanet. In the
2005 ﬁnancial year, the net cash outﬂow for acquisitions of
£418 million mainly related to the acquisitions of Infonet and
Albacom. Interest received was £147 million in the 2007
ﬁnancial year, compared to £185 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year and £374 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The interest
receipts in the 2007 ﬁnancial year include an initial cash
settlement of £74 million from HM Revenue and Customs
discussed in the speciﬁc items section of this Financial review.
Excluding this receipt, interest received was £112 million lower
than the 2006 ﬁnancial year reﬂecting the lower level of
investments held by the group. The 2005 ﬁnancial year included
receipts of £153 million on restructuring the group’s swap
portfolio.
Net cash outﬂow from ﬁnancing activities of £2,898 million in
the 2007 ﬁnancial year compares with £5,278 million in the
2006 ﬁnancial year and £3,529 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year. In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, the full and part maturity of
notes and leases resulted in a cash outﬂow of £1,085 million
mainly offset by the net issue of commercial paper of £309
million. Included in the 2006 ﬁnancial year net cash outﬂow is a
repayment of £4,432 million for maturing debt. In addition, the
group raised new sterling ﬂoating rate borrowing of £1,000
million and issued commercial paper raising net proceeds of
£464 million. Equity dividends paid in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
were £1,057 million, compared with £907 million and
£784 million in the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
Interest paid in the 2007 ﬁnancial year was £797 million
compared to £1,086 million and £1,260 million in the 2006 and
2005 years, respectively. The reduction in the 2007 ﬁnancial
year mainly reﬂects the impact of debt maturities noted above.
The reduction between the 2005 and 2006 ﬁnancial years
reﬂects payments of £139 million made in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year associated with restructuring the group’s swap portfolio.
During the 2007 ﬁnancial year the share buyback programme
continued with the group repurchasing 148 million shares for
consideration of £401 million and issued 67 million shares for a
consideration of £123 million. During the 2006 and 2005
ﬁnancial years the group repurchased 166 million and
101 million shares for a consideration of £360 million and
£195 million, respectively.
At 31 March 2007, net debt was £7,914 million, compared
with £7,534 million at 31 March 2006 and £7,893 million at
31 March 2005. Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings
(current and non current) less current asset investments and
cash and cash equivalents. Loans and other borrowings are
measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any
discount over the term of the debt. For the purpose of this
analysis current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents
are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Checksum: -1582723534
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to
sterling at swapped rates where hedged.
This deﬁnition of net debt measures balances at the expected
value of future cash ﬂows due to arise on maturity of ﬁnancial
instruments and removes the balance sheet adjustments made
from the re-measurement of hedged risks under fair value
hedges and the use of the amortised cost method as required by
IAS 39. In addition the gross balances are adjusted to take
account of netting arrangements.
Net debt is a non GAAP measure since it is not deﬁned in
IFRS. The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the
aggregate of loans and other borrowings (current and non-
current), current asset investments and cash and cash
equivalents which is reconciled to net debt in note 10 to the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. In 2001, BT’s net debt
reached £27.9 billion and as part of the group’s transformation
strategy the group went through a major restructuring to reduce
the level of net debt and improve the group’s ﬁnancial strength.
Therefore management believe it is both useful and necessary to
continue to disclose net debt as it is a key measure against
which the group’s performance against its strategy is measured.
Management believe it is a measure of net indebtedness that
provides an indicator of our overall balance sheet strength and
also facilitates an evaluation of the group’s cash position and
indebtedness in a single performance measure. There are
material limitations in the use of non GAAP measures and the
use of the term net debt does not necessarily mean that the
cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle
the liabilities included in this measure. The group’s deﬁnition of
net debt may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
used by other companies.

The components of free cash ﬂow, which is a non GAAP
measure, are presented in the table above and reconciled to net
cash inﬂow from operating activities, the most directly
comparable IFRS measure.
Management believe it is both useful and necessary to
disclose free cash ﬂow as it is one of the group’s key
performance indicators with which the group’s performance
against the group’s strategy is measured. Whilst free cash ﬂow is
primarily a liquidity measure, management also believe that it is
an important indicator of overall operational performance of the
group as it reﬂects the cash generated from operations after
reﬂecting capital expenditure and ﬁnancing costs, which are
both signiﬁcant ongoing cash outﬂows associated with investing
in infrastructure and ﬁnancing operations. In addition, free cash
ﬂow excludes cash ﬂows that are determined at a corporate
level independently of ongoing trading operations such as
dividends, share buy backs, acquisitions and disposals and
repayment of debt. There are material limitations in the use of
non GAAP measures and management’s use of the term free
cash ﬂow does not mean that this is a measure of the funds that
are available for distribution to shareholders. The group’s
deﬁnition of free cash ﬂow may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures used by other companies.
Free cash ﬂow was £1,354 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year,
compared to £1,612 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year and
£2,282 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
The reduction in free cash ﬂow in the 2007 ﬁnancial year
compared to the 2006 ﬁnancial year was mainly due to the
pension deﬁciency payment of £520 million and an increase in
net expenditure of property, plant, equipment and software of
£335 million, offset by lower income taxes paid following the
initial cash receipt in relation to the settlement of £376 million
from HM Revenue and Customs and lower net interest paid of
£251 million.
The reduction in free cash ﬂow in 2006 compared to the
2005 ﬁnancial year was mainly due to the impact of proceeds of
£537 million from the disposal of non-current asset investments
in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, mainly in respect of the disposal of
interests in Eutelsat, Starhub and Intelsat. Other factors
contributing to the decrease were lower working capital inﬂows
and higher normalised tax payments following low tax payments
in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. This was partly offset by lower cash
payments on purchase of property, plant and equipment and
software in the 2006 ﬁnancial year, although capital additions
and accruals were higher at the end of the 2006 ﬁnancial year.
TREASURY POLICY
The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary
role is to manage liquidity, funding, investment and the group’s
ﬁnancial risk, including risk from volatility in currency and
interest rates and counterparty credit risk. The treasury operation
is not a proﬁt centre and the objective is to manage risk at
optimum cost.
The Board sets the policy for the centralised treasury
operation and its activities are subject to a set of controls
commensurate with the magnitude of the borrowings and
investments under its management. Counterparty credit risk is
closely monitored and managed within controls set by the
Board. The group does not hold or issue derivative ﬁnancial
instruments for trading purposes. All transactions in ﬁnancial
instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from
underlying business activities.
We have set out further details on this topic in note 33 to
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements there are no off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a
current or future material effect on the group’s ﬁnancial
condition, changes in ﬁnancial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital
resources, with the exception of the following:
Operating leases (note 27)
Capital commitments and guarantees (note 27)
CAPITAL RESOURCES
During the period under review the group has increased its level
of net debt to £7.9 billion at 31 March 2007 compared with
£7.5 billion at 31 March 2006 and £7.9 billion at 31 March
2005 (based on BT’s deﬁnition of net debt as set out in note
10).

The directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future and therefore they continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
There has been no signiﬁcant change in the ﬁnancial or
trading position of the group since 31 March 2007.

At 31 March 2007, the group had cash, cash equivalents and
current asset investments of £1,078 million. At that date,
£2,071 million of debt fell due for repayment in the 2008
ﬁnancial year. The group had unused short-term bank facilities,
amounting to approximately £3,535 million at 31 March 2007.
These resources will allow the group to settle its obligations as
they fall due.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Most of the group’s current revenue is invoiced in pounds
sterling, and most of its operations and costs arise within the
UK. The group’s foreign currency borrowings, which totalled
£5.3 billion at 31 March 2007, are used to ﬁnance its
operations. These borrowings have been predominantly swapped
into sterling. Cross currency swaps and forward currency
contracts have been entered into to reduce the foreign currency
exposure on the group’s operations and the group’s net assets.
The group also enters into forward currency contracts to hedge
foreign currency investments, interest expense, capital purchases
and purchase and sale commitments on a selective basis. The
commitments hedged are principally US dollar and euro
denominated. As a result of these policies, the group’s exposure
to foreign currency arises mainly on the residual currency
exposure on its non-UK investments in its subsidiaries and on
any imbalances between the value of outgoing and incoming
international calls.
A 10% strengthening in sterling against major currencies
would cause the group’s net assets at 31 March 2007 to fall by
less than £220 million, with an insigniﬁcant effect on the
group’s proﬁts. This compares to a fall of less than £150 million
for the year ended 31 March 2006.
The majority of the group’s long-term borrowings have been,
and are, subject to sterling ﬁxed interest rates after applying the
impact of hedging instruments. The group has entered into
interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks and other
institutions to vary the amounts and period for which interest
rates are ﬁxed. The group had outstanding interest rate swap
agreements with notional principal amounts totalling £5.1 billion
at 31 March 2007 and 31 March 2006 and £5.3 billion at 31
March 2005.
The long-term debt instruments which BT issued in December
2000 and February 2001 both contained covenants providing
that if the BT group credit rating were downgraded below A3 in
the case of Moody’s or below A minus in the case of Standard &
Poor’s (S&P), additional interest would accrue from the next
interest coupon period at the rate of 0.25 percentage points for
each ratings category adjustment by each ratings agency. In July
2006, S&P downgraded BT’s credit rating to BBB plus, which
will increase BT’s annual ﬁnance expense by approximately
£11 million in the 2008 ﬁnancial year. Moody’s currently apply a
credit rating of Baa1 on BT following a downgrade in May
2001. Based upon the total amount of debt of £4.4 billion
outstanding on these instruments at 31 March 2007, BT’s
annual ﬁnance expense would increase by approximately
£22 million if BT’s credit rating were to be downgraded by one
credit rating category by both agencies below a long-term debt
rating of Baa1/BBB plus. If BT’s credit rating with each of
Moody’s and S&P were to be upgraded by one credit rating
category the annual ﬁnance expense would be reduced by
approximately £22 million.
Based upon the composition of net debt at 31 March 2007, a
one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase
the group’s annual net ﬁnance expense by around £11 million,
which compares to £10 million for the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial
years.
The group considers that it is not exposed to major
concentrations of credit risk. The group, however, is exposed to
credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by
counterparties to ﬁnancial instruments, but does not expect any
counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. The group limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. Where
multiple transactions are undertaken with a single counterparty,
or group of related counterparties, the group may enter into a
netting arrangement to reduce the group’s exposure to credit
risk. Currently the group makes use of standard International
Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) documentation. In
addition, where the group has a legal right of set off and the
ability and intention to settle net, the relevant asset and
liabilities are netted within the balance sheet. The group seeks
collateral or other security where it is considered necessary.
The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into
long and short term ﬁnancial instruments to support operational
and other funding requirements. The group’s liquidity and
funding management process includes projecting cash ﬂows and
considering the level of liquid assets in relation thereto,
monitoring balance sheet liquidity and maintaining a diverse
range of funding sources and back-up facilities. Liquid assets
surplus to immediate operating requirements of the group are
generally invested and managed by the centralised treasury
function. Requirements of group companies for operating
ﬁnance are met whenever possible from central resources. The
group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate committed
borrowing facilities. Reﬁnancing risk is managed by limiting the
amount of borrowing that matures within any speciﬁc period.
The group has limited exposure to equity securities price risk
on investments held by the group.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and
computer software (excluding the movement on capital accruals)
totalled £3,247 million in the 2007 ﬁnancial year compared with
£3,142 million and £3,011 million in the 2006 and 2005
ﬁnancial years, respectively. Capital expenditure is expected to
remain at around £3.2 billion in the 2008 ﬁnancial year as the
group continues to invest in its 21st century network (21CN)
programme.

Of the capital expenditure, £296 million was in Europe, outside
of the UK, the Americas and Asia Paciﬁc in the 2007 ﬁnancial
year, compared to £270 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year.
Contracts placed for ongoing capital expenditure totalled
£779 million at 31 March 2007. 21CN is being developed using
stringent capital return criteria and a rigorous approach to any
investment in the narrowband network. 21CN aims to deliver
long term, structural cost reduction, as we progressively migrate
onto a simpler, lower cost network architecture. BT expects that
future capital expenditure will be funded from net cash inﬂows
from operating activities, and, if required, by external ﬁnancing.
ACQUISITIONS
The total amount invested in acquisitions in the 2007 ﬁnancial
year, net of cash acquired, was £268 million, relating primarily
to the acquisitions of INS and PlusNet. Goodwill arising on
acquisitions made in the year was £282 million.
The acquisition of INS completed in February 2007, for a
total consideration of £133 million. Net of deferred
consideration and cash acquired, the net cash outﬂow was
£129 million. The provisional fair value of INS’s net assets at the
date of acquisition was £12 million, giving rise to goodwill of
£121 million.
The acquisition of PlusNet completed in January 2007, for a
total consideration of £66 million. Net of consideration
outstanding at 31 March 2007 and cash acquired, the net cash
outﬂow was £59 million. The provisional fair value of PlusNet’s
net assets at the date of acquisition was £9 million, giving rise
to goodwill of £57 million.
Other acquisitions made in the year included primarily
dabs.com, Counterpane LLC and I3IT Limited. The total
consideration in respect of these acquisitions was £144 million,
and goodwill of £104 million has been recognised.
The total amount invested in the 2006 ﬁnancial year was
£165 million mainly due to the acquisitions of Radianz and
Atlanet, which was £286 million lower than the £453 million
invested in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, which was mainly due to the
acquisitions of Infonet and Albacom.
BALANCE SHEET
Net assets at 31 March 2007 amounted to £4,272 million
compared to £1,607 million at 31 March 2006, with the
increase of £2,665 million mainly due to the retained proﬁts for
the year of £2,850 million and actuarial gains of £985 million
(net of deferred tax) offset by dividends paid of £1,053 million,
losses on cash ﬂow hedges of £201 million and the net purchase
of treasury shares of £284 million.
BT’s non current assets totalled £18,340 million at 31 March
2007, of which £14,997 million were property, plant and
equipment, principally forming the UK ﬁxed network. At
31 March 2006, non current assets were £18,283 million and
property, plant and equipment were £15,222 million.
BT Group plc, the parent company, whose ﬁnancial
statements are prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, had proﬁt
and loss reserves of £9,713 million at 31 March 2007,
compared with £9,499 million at 31 March 2006.
RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED
The return before speciﬁc items on the average capital employed
was 17.6% for the 2007 ﬁnancial year. In the 2006 and 2005
ﬁnancial years the group made a return before speciﬁc items of
18.1% and 18.2%, respectively.
PENSIONS
The group’s total pension operating charges for the 2007, 2006
and 2005 ﬁnancial years were £643 million, £603 million and
£540 million, respectively. This includes £594 million,
£552 million and £507 million, respectively, in relation to the
BTPS, the group’s main deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. The increase in
the pension charge in the 2007 ﬁnancial year includes the effect
of increased life expectancy assumptions and pay inﬂation. The
increase in the pension charge in the 2006 ﬁnancial year partly
reﬂects the introduction of Smart Pensions (a salary sacriﬁce
scheme) part way through the 2005 ﬁnancial year, as a result of
which there is a switch between wages and salaries and pension
charges, as well as increases in pensionable pay.
Detailed pensions disclosures are provided in note 29 to the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. At 31 March 2007 the IAS 19
accounting deﬁcit was £0.3 billion, net of tax, being a
£1.5 billion reduction from £1.8 billion at 31 March 2006. The
reduction reﬂects the increase in value of equity investments
during the year and the increase in the AA bond rates used to
discount the future liabilities.
The number of retired members and other current
beneﬁciaries in the BTPS pension fund has been increasing in
recent years. Consequently, BT’s future pension costs and
contributions will depend on the investment returns of the
pension fund and life expectancy of members and could
ﬂuctuate in the medium term.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and
we launched a new deﬁned contribution pension scheme for
people joining BT after that date which is to provide beneﬁts
based on the employees’ and the employing company’s
contributions. This change is in line with the practice increasingly
adopted by major UK groups and is designed to be more ﬂexible
for employees and enable the group to determine its pension
costs more precisely than is the case for deﬁned beneﬁt
schemes.
The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuation of
the BTPS, performed by the BTPS independent actuary for the
trustees of the scheme, was carried out as at 31 December
2005. This valuation showed the fund to be in deﬁcit to an
amount of £3.4 billion. Assets of the fund of £34.4 billion at
that date covered 90.9 % of the fund’s liabilities. The previous
valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2002 which
showed the fund was in deﬁcit by £2.1 billion. The funding
valuation uses conservative assumptions whereas, had the
valuation been based on the actuary’s view of the median
estimate basis, the funding valuation would have shown a
surplus. The market value of the equity investments had
increased and the investment income and contributions received
by the scheme exceeded the beneﬁts paid in the three years
ended 31 December 2005. However, longer life expectancy
assumptions and a lower discount rate used to calculate the
present value of the liabilities, meant the deﬁcit had not
improved by the same amount.
As a result of the triennial valuation the group agreed to
increase the contribution rate to 19.5% of pensionable pay, of
which 6% is payable by employees, from 1 January 2007. In
addition, the group will make deﬁciency payments equivalent to
£280 million per annum for ten years. The ﬁrst three instalments
were paid upfront with £520 million paid in the 2007 ﬁnancial
year and a further £320 million paid in April 2007. This
compares to the previous contribution rate of 18.2%, of which
6% was payable by employees, and annual deﬁciency payments
of £232 million that were agreed as a result of the 2002
funding valuation.

GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION
In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, approximately 85% of the group’s
revenue was generated by operations in the UK, compared with
87% in the 2006 ﬁnancial year and 92% in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year. The group’s operating proﬁts have been derived from its
UK operations with losses being incurred outside the UK in the
each of the last three ﬁnancial years.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The group’s principal accounting policies are set out on pages
78 to 85 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and conform
with IFRS. These policies, and applicable estimation techniques,
have been reviewed by the directors who have conﬁrmed them
to be appropriate for the preparation of the 2007 ﬁnancial
statements.
We, in common with virtually all other companies, need to
use estimates in the preparation of our ﬁnancial statements. The
most sensitive estimates affecting our ﬁnancial statements are in
the areas of assessing the level of interconnect income with and
payments to other telecommunications operators, providing for
doubtful debts, establishing asset lives of property, plant and
equipment for depreciation purposes, assessing the stage of
completion and likely outcome under long term contracts,
making appropriate long-term assumptions in calculating
pension liabilities and costs, making appropriate medium-term
assumptions on asset impairment reviews and calculating current
and deferred tax liabilities. Details of critical accounting
estimates and key judgements are provided in the accounting
policies on page 84 to 85.
US GAAP
The group’s net income and earnings per share for the three
ﬁnancial years ended 31 March 2007 and shareholders’ equity at
31 March 2007 and 2006 under US Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (US GAAP) are shown in the United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in note 35. Differences
between IFRS and US GAAP include the treatment of leasing
transactions, pension costs, redundancy costs, deferred taxation,
capitalisation of interest and ﬁnancial instruments.
US GAAP DEVELOPMENTS
In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No 155, ‘Accounting
for Certain Hybrid Instruments – an amendment to FASB
statements No 133 and 140’ (‘ ‘FAS 155’ ’), that amends SFAS No
133, ‘Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities’ (‘ ‘FAS 133’ ’). This statement
resolves issues addressed in FAS 133 Implementation Issue No.
D1, ‘Application of Statement 133 to Beneﬁcial Interests in
Securitised Financial Assets’. The statement permits fair value
remeasurement for any hybrid ﬁnancial instrument that contains
an embedded derivative that otherwise would require
bifurcation. Additionally it clariﬁes which interest-only strips and
principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of FAS
133. FAS 155 also establishes a requirement to evaluate
interests in securitised ﬁnancial assets to identify interests that
are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid ﬁnancial
instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring
bifurcation. It clariﬁes that concentrations of credit risk in the
form of subordination are not embedded derivatives. Also FAS
155 amends FAS 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a
qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative
ﬁnancial instrument that pertains to a beneﬁcial interest other
than another derivative ﬁnancial instrument. FAS 155 is effective
for BT for all ﬁnancial instruments acquired or issued after
31 March 2007. The group does not expect this to have a
material impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In March 2006 the FASB issued SFAS No 156, ‘Accounting for
Servicing of Financial Assets: an amendment of FASB No 140’
(‘ ‘FAS 156’ ’) that amends SFAS No 140 ‘Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of
Liabilities’ (‘ ‘FAS 140’ ’) with respect to the accounting for
separately recognised servicing assets and servicing liabilities.
FAS 156 is effective for BT from 1 April 2007. The group does
not anticipate that the adoption of this new statement at the
required effective date will have a material impact on the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No 157, ‘Fair
Value Measurements’ (‘ ‘FAS 157’ ’). FAS 157 deﬁnes fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. The provisions of this standard apply to
other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair
value measurements. FAS 157 applies for the group’s ﬁnancial
year beginning 1 April 2008. The group is currently evaluating
the impact, if any, that the adoption of FAS 157 will have on
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No 159 ‘The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’
(‘ ‘FAS 159’ ’). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure, on
an item by item basis, speciﬁed ﬁnancial instruments and certain
other items at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses on items
for which the fair value option has been elected are required to
be reported in earnings at each reporting date. FAS 159 is
effective for the 2009 ﬁnancial year, the provisions of which are
required to be applied prospectively. The group is currently
evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of FAS 159 will
have on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No 48
‘Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – An Interpretation
of FASB Statement No 109’ (‘ ‘FIN 48’ ’). FIN 48 requires tax
beneﬁts from uncertain positions to be recognised only if it is
‘ ‘more likely than not’ ’ that the position is sustainable based on
its technical merits. The interpretation also requires qualitative
and quantitative disclosures, including discussion of reasonably
possible changes that might occur in unrecognised tax beneﬁts
over the next 12 months, a description of open tax years by
major jurisdiction, and a roll-forward of all unrecognised tax
beneﬁts. FIN 48 applies to the group’s 2008 ﬁnancial. The group
is currently in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, that
the adoption of FIN 48 will have on the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements.
In September 2006, the FASB ratiﬁed Emerging Issues Task
Force No 06-01 ‘Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Service Provider to Manufactures or Resellers of Equipment
Necessary for an End-Customer to Receive Service from the
Service Provider’ (‘ ‘EITF 06-01’ ’). This guidance requires the
application of EITF 01-09 ‘Accounting for Consideration Given
by a Vendor to a Service provider’s end customer’ (‘ ‘EITF 01-
09’ ’), when consideration is given to a reseller or manufacturer
for beneﬁt to the service provider’s end customer. EITF 01-09
requires the consideration given to be recorded as a liability at
the time of the sale of the equipment and, also, provides
guidance for the classiﬁcation of the expense. EITF 06-01 is
effective for the group’s 2008 ﬁnancial year. The group is
currently in the process of quantifying the impact, if any, that
the adoption of EITF 01-09 will have on the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.

BOARD COMPOSITION AND ROLE
The names and biographical details of the directors are given on
pages 49 to 51 in Board of Directors and Operating
Committee. All served throughout the ﬁnancial year, with the
exception of Deborah Lathen, who was appointed to the Board
on 1 February 2007, and Franc ¸ois Barrault, who was appointed
to the Board on 24 April 2007. Sir Anthony Greener served as a
director until 30 September 2006. The Board, which operates as
a single team, is currently made up of the part-time Chairman,
the Chief Executive, ﬁve other executive directors and eight
non-executive directors. All of the non-executive directors
during the 2007 ﬁnancial year met, and continue to meet, the
criteria for independence set out in the Combined Code and are
therefore considered by the Board to be independent. In line
with BT’s policy, the Board comprised a majority of independent
non-executive directors throughout the 2007 ﬁnancial year.
The Board’s principal focus is the overall strategic direction,
development and control of the group. In support of this, the
Board approves the group’s values, business practice policies,
strategic plans, annual budget, capital expenditure and
investments budgets, larger capital expenditure proposals and
the group’s overall system of internal controls, governance and
compliance authorities. It also has oversight and control of the
group’s operating and ﬁnancial performance and reviews the risk
register. These responsibilities are set out in a formal statement
of the Board’s role which is available on the company’s website.
The Board has agreed the group’s corporate governance
framework, including empowering the company’s key
management committee, the Operating Committee, to make
decisions on operational and other matters. The roles and
powers of this committee are set out below. A statement of
their powers and the authorities delegated to individual
members of the Operating Committee is available on the group’s
intranet site.
Historically the Board met every month, except in August. The
standard Board cycle changed in the 2006 ﬁnancial year to nine
meetings each year. The Board met eleven times during the
2007 ﬁnancial year including two ad hoc meetings to consider
time-critical matters.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are
separate. They are set out in written job descriptions, approved
by the Nominating Committee. In addition to chairing the Board,
the Chairman is responsible for consulting the non-executive
directors, particularly the Deputy Chairman, on corporate
governance issues, matters considered by the Nominating
Committee, which the Chairman chairs, and the individual
performance of the non-executive directors. The Chairman and
the non-executive directors hold regular dinners at which they
discuss matters without the executive directors being present.
With the Chief Executive and the Secretary, the Chairman
ensures the Board is kept properly informed, is consulted on all
issues reserved to it and that its decisions are made in a timely
and considered way that enables the directors to fulﬁl their
ﬁduciary duties. The Chairman ensures that the views of the
shareholders are known to the Board and considered
appropriately. He represents the company in speciﬁed strategic
and Government relationships, as agreed with the Chief
Executive, and generally acts as the bridge between the Board
and the company’s executive team, particularly on the group’s
broad strategic direction. The Chairman’s other current
signiﬁcant commitments are shown in Board of Directors and
Operating Committee above. The Chief Executive has ﬁnal
executive responsibility, reporting to the Board, for the success
of the group.
The Secretary manages the provision of timely, accurate and
considered information to the Board for its meetings and, in
consultation with the Chairman and Chief Executive, at other
appropriate times. He recommends to the Chairman and the
Chief Executive, for Board consideration where appropriate, the
company’s corporate governance policies and practices and is
responsible for their communication and implementation. He
advises the Board on appropriate procedures for the
management of its meetings and duties (and the meetings of
the company’s principal committees), as well as the
implementation of corporate governance and compliance within
the group. The appointment and removal of the Secretary is a
matter for the whole Board.
BT’s non-executive directors
The Nominating Committee has agreed and periodically reviews
the combination of experience, skills and other attributes which
the non-executive directors as a whole should bring to the
Board. This proﬁle is used by the Committee, when the
appointment of a non-executive director is being considered, to
assess the suitability of candidates put forward by the directors
and outside consultants. Short-listed candidates meet the
Committee, which then recommends to the Board candidates for
appointment.
The non-executive directors provide a strong, independent
element on the Board. Between them, they bring experience
and independent judgment, gained at the most senior levels of
international business operations and strategy, ﬁnance,
marketing, technology, communications and political and
international affairs.
Maarten van den Bergh, the Deputy Chairman, is the senior
independent director. In this capacity and his capacity as the
chairman of the Remuneration Committee, he meets with BT’s
major institutional shareholders. He is available to discuss
matters with institutional shareholders where it would be
inappropriate for those discussions to take place with either the
Chairman or the Chief Executive.
Non-executive directors are appointed initially for three years,
subject to three months’ termination notice from either BT or
the director. At the end of the ﬁrst three years the appointment
may be continued by mutual agreement. Each non-executive
director is provided, upon appointment, with a letter setting out
the terms of his or her appointment, including membership of
Board committees, the fees to be paid and the time
commitment expected from the director. The letter also covers
such matters as the conﬁdentiality of information and the
company’s share dealing code.
Principal Board committees
The Operating Committee, the company’s key management
committee, meets weekly and is chaired by the Chief Executive.
The other members are the Group Finance Director and the
Chief Executives of BT Retail, BT Wholesale, BT Global Services
and Group Strategy and Operations. The Secretary attends all
meetings and the Group HR Director normally attends meetings.
The Committee has collective responsibility for running the
group’s business end-to-end. To do that, it develops the group’s
strategy and budget for Board approval, recommends to the
Board the group’s capital expenditure and investments budgets,
monitors the ﬁnancial, operational and customer quality of
service performance of the whole group, reviews the group’s risk
register, allocates resources across the group within plans agreed
by the Board, plans and delivers major cross-business
programmes and reviews the senior talent base and succession
plans of the group. Within the group’s corporate governance

framework, approved by the Board, the Operating Committee is
empowered to approve, up to limits beyond which Board
approval is required, capital expenditure, disposals of ﬁxed
assets, the making of investments by the group and divestments.
It is authorised to delegate these approvals, up to its own limits,
to senior executives.
To meet best corporate governance practice, the Audit
Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Nominating
Committee have long been an established part of BT’s system of
governance. Each committee has written terms of reference,
which are available on the company’s website. The Report of
the Audit Committee, the Report of the Nominating Committee
and the Report on directors’ remuneration are on pages 54 to
68.
The Equality of Access Board (EAB) was established on
1 November 2005, as part of the Undertakings given by BT to
Ofcom following Ofcom’s Strategic Review of
Telecommunications, to monitor, report and advise BT on BT’s
compliance with these Undertakings. The EAB is a committee of
the BT Group plc Board, which formally approved the formation
of the EAB and its terms of reference. As required by the
Undertakings, the EAB comprises ﬁve members: Carl Symon, a
BT Group plc non-executive director and chairman of the EAB; a
BT senior executive, Sally Davis, Chief Portfolio Ofﬁcer; and
three independent members: Sir Bryan Carsberg, Stephen Pettit
and Dr Peter Radley. The EAB reports regularly to the Board. Its
terms of reference are available on the company’s website.
The Board also has a Community Support Committee and a
Pension Scheme Performance Review Group.
New York Stock Exchange
The company, as a foreign issuer with American Depositary
Shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is obliged
to disclose any signiﬁcant ways in which its corporate
governance practices differ from the corporate governance
listing standards of the NYSE.
The company has reviewed the NYSE’s new listing standards
and believes that its corporate governance practices are
consistent with them, with the following exception where the
company does not meet the strict requirements set out in the
standards. The standards state that companies must have a
nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely
of independent directors and with written terms of reference
which, in addition to identifying individuals qualiﬁed to become
board members, develops and recommends to the Board a set of
corporate governance principles applicable to the company. BT
has a Nominating Committee chaired by the Chairman, Sir
Christopher Bland. It does not develop corporate governance
principles for the Board’s approval. The Board approves the
group’s overall system of internal controls, governance and
compliance authorities. The Board and the Nominating
Committee are made up of a majority of independent, non-
executive directors.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the US Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) and NYSE introduced rules on
31 July 2005 requiring the company to comply with certain
provisions relating to the Audit Committee. These include the
independence of Audit Committee members and procedures for
the treatment of complaints regarding accounting or auditing
matters. The company is fully compliant with these
requirements.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Introduction
The Audit Committee is chaired by Phil Hodkinson. The other
members are Maarten van den Bergh, Clay Brendish, John
Nelson and Carl Symon. They are all independent non-executive
directors. They were members of the Committee throughout the
2007 ﬁnancial year. Sir Anthony Greener stepped down as
chairman and a member of the Committee on 30 September
2006 when he retired from the Board, and Phil Hodkinson was
appointed chairman of the Committee on 1 October 2006. The
Board considers that the Committee’s members have broad
commercial knowledge and extensive business leadership
experience, having held various roles in accountancy, ﬁnancial
management and supervision, treasury and corporate ﬁnance
and that there is a broad and suitable mix of business, ﬁnancial
and IT experience on the Committee. The Board has reviewed
membership of the Committee and is satisﬁed that several of the
Committee’s members have the recent and relevant ﬁnancial
experience required for the provisions of the Combined Code. It
is the opinion of the Board that the Audit Committee includes a
member in the person of Phil Hodkinson who is an ‘audit
committee ﬁnancial expert’ for the purposes of the US
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Committee role
The Committee recommends the appointment and
reappointment of the company’s external auditors and considers
their resignation or dismissal, recommending to the Board
appropriate action to appoint new auditors. It ensures that key
partners are rotated at appropriate intervals. It discusses with
the auditors the scope of their audits before they commence,
reviews the results and considers the formal reports of the
auditors and reports the results of those reviews to the Board. It
reviews the auditors’ performance, including the scope of the
audit, and recommends to the Board appropriate remuneration.
As a result of regulatory or similar requirements, it may be
necessary to employ the company’s external auditors for certain
non-audit work. In order to safeguard the independence and
objectivity of the external auditors, the Board has determined
policies as to what non-audit services can be provided by the
company’s external auditors and the approval processes related
to them. Under those policies, work of a consultancy nature will
not be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear
efﬁciencies and value added beneﬁts to the company. The
overall policies and the processes to implement them were
reviewed and appropriately modiﬁed in the light of the
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act relating to non-audit
services that external auditors may not perform. The Audit
Committee monitors the extent of non-audit work being
performed by the company’s auditors and approves any
substantive work before it is undertaken. It also monitors the
level of non-audit fees paid to the external auditors.
The Audit Committee reviews the company’s published
ﬁnancial results, the Annual Report & Form 20-F and other
published information for statutory and regulatory compliance. It
reports its views to the Board to assist it in its approval of the
results’ announcements and the Annual Report & Form 20-F.
The Committee also reviews the disclosure made by the Chief
Executive and Group Finance Director during the certiﬁcation
process for the annual report about the design and operation
of internal controls or material weaknesses in the controls,
including any fraud involving management or other employees
who have a signiﬁcant role in the company’s ﬁnancial controls.
The Board, as required by UK law, takes responsibility for all
disclosures in the annual report.
Committee activities
During the year, the Audit Committee monitored and reviewed
the standards of risk management and internal control, including
the processes and procedures for ensuring that material business
risks, including risks relating to IT security, fraud and related
matters, are properly identiﬁed and managed, the effectiveness
of internal control, ﬁnancial reporting, accounting policies and
procedures, and the company’s statements on internal controls
before they were agreed by the Board for the annual report. It
also reviewed the company’s internal audit function and its
relationship with the external auditors, including internal audit’s
plans and performance. It reviewed the arrangements for
dealing, in conﬁdence, with complaints from employees and
others about accounting or ﬁnancial management impropriety,
fraud, poor business practices and other matters, ensuring that
arrangements are in place for the proportionate and
independent investigation and appropriate follow up action. At
each of its meetings it reviewed with the group chief internal
auditor and appropriate executives the implementation and
effectiveness of key operational and functional change and
remedial programmes including major contracts and IT
programmes. The Committee also set aside time at every
meeting to seek the views of the company’s internal and
external auditors in the absence of executives.
In addition to carrying out those regular tasks described
above under the Committee’s terms of reference, which are
posted on the company’s website at www.bt.com/committees
the Committee also carried out its annual consideration of the
group’s risk register process, and reviewed the company’s system
of internal control, its accounting systems, IT security and fraud
and related matters. Additionally, the Committee has reviewed at
each of its meetings during the 2007 ﬁnancial year the steps
being taken within the group with regard to the application of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act dealing with internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting. It also speciﬁcally evaluated its performance
and processes by again inviting Committee members and several
executives and the external auditors to complete questionnaires.
This process formed part of the annual Board and Committee
evaluation. Committee members, and those others consulted,
regard the Committee as effective on both behaviours and
processes. There is a similar view too of the external audit
process, which is regarded as effective. The Committee also
reviewed the experience, skills and succession planning within
the Group’s ﬁnance function.
The Group Finance Director, the Secretary, the group’s chief
internal auditor and the company’s external auditors attend the
Committee’s meetings. The Committee met four times during the
2007 ﬁnancial year. The papers and minutes of Audit Committee
meetings are sent to directors who are not members of the
Committee.

REPORT OF THE NOMINATING COMMITTEE
Introduction
The Nominating Committee is chaired by the Chairman. The
other members are the Deputy Chairman, Phil Hodkinson and
John Nelson. Sir Anthony Greener stepped down as a member of
the Committee on 30 September 2006 when he retired from the
Board and was succeeded on 1 October 2006 by Phil Hodkinson.
Three of its four members are independent non-executive
directors. The Secretary and, where appropriate, at the invitation
of the Chairman, the Chief Executive attend the Committee’s
meetings.
Committee role and activities
The Nominating Committee ensures an appropriate balance of
experience and abilities on the Board, using this evaluation to
review the size and composition of the Board and to recommend
any proposed changes to the Board. It keeps under review the
need for appointments to the Board, prepares a description of
the speciﬁc experience and skills needed for an appointment,
considers candidates who are put forward by the directors and
external consultants, and recommends to the Board the
appointments of all directors after having met short-listed
candidates. It also reviews the time required from the Deputy
Chairman and other non-executive directors to carry out their
duties and advises the Board on succession planning for the
positions of the Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Chief Executive and
all other Board appointments. The Committee met eight times
during the 2007 ﬁnancial year. It reviewed Board succession, the
size, proﬁle and composition of the Board and the Board and
Board committee evaluation questionnaire and process. Under
the leadership of the Deputy Chairman, the Committee identiﬁed
candidates for the position of Chairman and recommended to
the Board the appointment of Sir Mike Rake. The candidates on
the short list drawn up by the Committee’s appointed search
consultants, MWM, were considered and interviewed by the
Committee and met with the Chief Executive. The Committee
also reviewed and recommended to the Board the continued
appointments of non-executive directors including the
three-year extension for Maarten van den Bergh linked to his
appointment as Deputy Chairman and senior independent
director, and the new appointments of Deborah Lathen and
Franc ¸ois Barrault.
The terms of reference of the Nominating Committee are
posted on the company’s website at: www.bt.com/committees
The minutes of Nominating Committee meetings are sent, at
their request, to directors who are not members of the
Committee, where appropriate to do so.
Chairman succession
The Board approved the recommendation of the Nominating
Committee to appoint Sir Mike Rake as Chairman, in succession
to Sir Christopher Bland, as announced on 19 February 2007.
Sir Mike will join the Board on 26 September 2007, and
Sir Christopher steps down as Chairman on 25 September 2007
and as a director on 30 September 2007. A full programme of
induction and familiarisation is in hand.
Board evaluation
During summer 2006, the Board carried out, through a
questionnaire and discussion with directors, its fourth formal
evaluation of Board and Board committee performance and
effectiveness. The individual performance of directors was also
evaluated at one-to-one sessions with the Chairman. The
previous Deputy Chairman and senior independent director,
Sir Anthony Greener, led the review of the Chairman’s
performance in consultation with the non-executive and
executive directors. The results of that evaluation were
considered by the Board in July 2006. The directors considered
BT’s Board processes and effectiveness to be good. Key areas
highlighted were the need for continued attention to Board
diversity, more focused brieﬁng on technology matters, and the
continuing need to pay attention to the amount of paperwork.
These matters are being addressed. The previous year’s concerns
on maintaining visibility of major capital projects (including post-
project reviews) and the amount of time available at Board
meetings for free-ranging strategic discussion did not feature
strongly this year as it was felt steps taken during the year had
adequately dealt with them via process and Board agenda
changes. Further evaluations will be carried out annually.
Separate questionnaires about Audit Committee effectiveness
were also completed and the results are reviewed in the Report
of the Audit Committee.

REMUNERATION POLICY
This part of the Report on directors’ remuneration is not
subject to audit.
(i) Constitution and process
The directors consider that BT has, throughout the year,
complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the 2003
Combined Code on Corporate Governance. Shareholders will be
invited to approve this report at the company’s 2007 AGM. The
Board is ultimately responsible for both the structure and
amount of executive remuneration, but it has delegated prime
responsibility for executive remuneration to the Remuneration
Committee. The Committee is made up wholly of independent
non-executive directors. The terms of reference of the
Committee are available on the company’s website at
www.bt.com/committees The Committee’s role is to set the
remuneration policy and individual remuneration packages for
the Chairman and the executive directors. The Committee also
reviews the remuneration of other senior executives reporting
to the Chief Executive. This includes approving changes to the
company’s long-term incentive plans, recommending to the
Board those plans which require shareholder approval and
overseeing their operation. In this role the Committee also
monitors the structure of reward for executives reporting to the
senior management team and determines the basis on which
awards are granted under the company’s executive share plans.
The Committee met ﬁve times during the ﬁnancial year
2006/07. Sir Anthony Greener chaired the Committee from
18 July 2001 until he retired as a director on 30 September
2006. From 1 October 2006, Maarten van den Bergh has been
chairman of the Committee. Other members of the Committee
who served during the ﬁnancial years 2005/06 and 2006/07
were:
r Matti Alahuhta (appointed 7 February 2006)
r Lou Hughes (retired 31 March 2006)
r Baroness Jay
r Deborah Lathen (appointed 1 February 2007)
r Carl Symon.
The Chairman and Chief Executive are invited to attend
meetings. They are not present when matters affecting their
own remuneration arrangements are considered. No director
or executive is involved in any decision relating to his or her
remuneration. Non-executive directors who are not members
of the Committee are entitled to receive papers and minutes of
the Committee. The Committee had access during the year to
professional advisers, both from within the company and
externally: Kepler Associates (remuneration consultants), who
were appointed by the company; Ben Verwaayen, Chief
Executive; Hanif Lalani, Group Finance Director; Alex Wilson,
Group HR Director and Larry Stone, Company Secretary. They
provided advice that materially assisted the Committee in
relation to directors’ remuneration in the ﬁnancial year 2006/07.
Remuneration consultants provide a range of data and advisory
services covering all aspects of executive pay, bonus
arrangements, shares and beneﬁts. The Committee agreed that
Kepler Associates may advise both the Committee and BT, and
should be invited to attend meetings when major remuneration
policy issues were discussed.
BT’s policy is to reward its senior executives competitively,
taking account of the performance of individual lines of business
and the company as a whole, comparison with other FTSE 30
companies and the competitive pressures in the information and
communications technology industry. This has been crucial as
BT’s revenues from traditional business have fallen and new

wave services, generated mainly from networked IT services and
broadband, have been developed to provide revenue growth. To
ensure that key people are both recruited and retained, base
salaries are positioned within a range, consistent with prevailing
market rates, with the potential for total direct compensation
(basic salary, annual bonus – cash and deferred shares – and the
expected value of any long-term incentives) to deliver upper
quartile remuneration for sustained and excellent performance.
A signiﬁcant proportion of the total executive remuneration
package is variable and is linked to corporate performance.
Remuneration arrangements and performance targets are kept
under regular review to achieve this.
As members of the Board, all Committee members receive
and review an annual corporate social responsibility report
detailing the way in which the company manages social, ethical
and environmental issues. The Committee is satisﬁed that the
structure for the remuneration of the executive directors and
senior executives does not raise environmental, social and
governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible
behaviour.
(ii) Packages and ﬁnancial year 2006/07 operation
The remuneration package is made up of some or all of the
following:
Basic salary
Salaries are reviewed annually, but increases are made only
where the Committee believes that adjustments are appropriate
to reﬂect contribution, increased responsibilities and/or market
pressures. No base pay changes were proposed or made for
executive directors in 2006/07, save that the Committee agreed
increases in annual base salary effective from 1 June 2006 for
Ben Verwaayen and Hanif Lalani to bring their remuneration
more into line with the market.
Performance-related remuneration
Annual bonus
The annual bonus plan is designed to reward the achievement
of results against set objectives.
For the ﬁnancial year 2006/07, on-target and maximum
(requiring truly exceptional performance) bonus levels for
executive directors, as a percentage of salary, were set at 60%
and 110% respectively. In addition, executive directors are
entitled to a bonus in the form of deferred shares with a value
of 75% of the cash bonus.
The Chief Executive has a target cash bonus of 85% of salary
and a maximum cash bonus, for exceptional performance, of
130% of salary. He is also entitled to an award of deferred
shares, equal to two-times his cash bonus, subject to an overall
cap of three-times salary (cash plus deferred shares) in any one
year.
Under his contract, the Chairman is not entitled to a bonus.
Corporate performance targets, set at the beginning of the
ﬁnancial year 2006/07, were weighted such that 40% of the
bonus potential was based on EPS (earnings per share), 40% on
free cash ﬂow and 20% on customer satisfaction. Delivery
against these operational targets is a key determinant of success
and supports BT’s strategy for transformation and growth. The
Committee agreed that in calculating earnings per share for
purposes of the annual bonus, volatile items which would be
reported under IFRS should be excluded. The impact of market
movements in foreign exchange and ﬁnancial instruments plus
the net ﬁnance income relating to the group’s pension liabilities
were excluded from the target.
For the executive directors and other relevant senior executives,
(but not Openreach executives, see ‘Openreach’ on page 59) the
importance of meeting these operational targets is recognised by
linking 100% of their potential bonus to BT’s corporate
performance. The Committee retains the ﬂexibility to enhance or
reduce bonus awards in exceptional circumstances.

The deferred share element of the annual bonus is paid under
the DBP (Deferred Bonus Plan). The shares vest and are
transferred to the executive after three years if still employed by
the company. There are no additional performance measures for
the vesting of deferred share awards. The Committee considers
that deferring a part of the annual bonus in this way also acts as
a retention measure and contributes to aligning management
with long-term shareholder interests.
The deferred awards for Ben Verwaayen, Andy Green, Hanif
Lalani, Ian Livingston and Paul Reynolds at the end of the
ﬁnancial year 2006/07, and for Franc ¸ois Barrault on 24 April
2007 when he was appointed as a director, are contained in the
table on page 67. The initial values of the awards to be granted
in respect of the ﬁnancial year 2006/07 are given in the table
on page 63.
Long-term incentives
The BT Equity Incentive Portfolio (the Portfolio) is designed to
ensure that equity participation is an important part of total
remuneration and that overall directors’ remuneration is aligned
with shareholders’ interests. It comprises three elements: share
options, incentive shares and retention shares. Incentive shares
were used for equity participation in the ﬁnancial year 2006/07.
Retention shares are used principally as a recruitment or
retention tool. No options were granted in the ﬁnancial year
2006/07.
Under his service agreement, the Chairman is not entitled to
receive annual grants of incentive awards or options.
Normally, awards vest and options become exercisable only if
a predetermined performance target has been achieved. The
performance measure for outstanding awards and options is
total shareholder return (TSR), calculated on a common currency
basis and compared with a relevant basket of companies. TSR
for these purposes was calculated by the law ﬁrm, Allen &
Overy. TSR links the reward given to directors with the
performance of BT against the shares of other major companies.
For grants in the ﬁnancial years 2002/03 and 2003/04, the
comparator group was the FTSE 100 at 1 April in each year. For
grants in the ﬁnancial year 2004/05, 2005/06 and 2006/07,
TSR was measured against a group of companies from the
European Telecom Sector. This comparator group was chosen
because the companies face similar market sector challenges to
BT and are within the sector in which BT competes for capital.

Moviles were members of the comparator group at 1 April 2005;
Cable & Wireless, 02 and TDC were also members of the group.
At 1 April 2004, Belgacom was not a member of the group but
Mobistar and Tele2 were members.
The TSR for a company is calculated by comparing the return
index (RI) at the beginning of the performance period to the RI
at the end of the period. The RI is the TSR value of a company
measured on a daily basis, as tracked by independent analysts,
Datastream. It uses the ofﬁcial closing prices for a company’s
shares, adjusted for all capital actions and dividends paid. The
initial RI is determined by calculating the average RI value taken
daily over the six months prior to the beginning of the
performance period, the end value is determined by calculating
the average RI over the six months up to the end of the
performance period. This mitigates the effects of share price
volatility. A positive change between the initial and end values
indicates TSR growth.
Incentive shares
For the ﬁnancial year 2006/07, the Committee granted incentive
shares to executive directors, senior executives, key managers
and professionals.
Awards of incentive shares vest after a performance period of
three years, if the participant is still employed by BT and a
performance measure has been met. Dividends paid on the
shares during the three-year period are reinvested in further
shares and added to the awards. For awards of incentive shares
granted in the ﬁnancial years 2004/05, 2005/06 and 2006/07,
TSR at the end of the three year period must be in the upper
quartile relative to the comparator group for all of the shares to
vest. At median, 25% of the shares under award will vest. Below
that point, none of the shares under award will vest. The
proportion of shares that vests reduces on a straight-line basis
between the upper quartile and median positions. There will be
no re-testing, and no matching shares are being offered to any
executive on vesting of the incentive shares.
At 31 March 2007, the TSR for the 2004/05 awards was at
8th position against the comparator group of 20 companies. As
a result, 55% of the awards will vest in May 2007.
The details of incentive share awards held by Ben Verwaayen,
Andy Green, Hanif Lalani, Ian Livingston and Paul Reynolds at
the end of the ﬁnancial year 2006/07, and by Franc ¸ois Barrault
on 24 April 2007 when he was appointed as a director, are
contained in the table on page 66.
Share options
No share options were granted in 2006/07. The last grant of
share options was in the ﬁnancial year 2004/05.
The price at which shares may be acquired under the Global
Share Option Plan (GSOP) is the market price at the date of
grant. Options are exercisable after three years, subject to a
performance target being met.
For options granted subject to a TSR measure, BT’s TSR at the
end of the three-year period must be in the upper quartile for
all of the options to be exercisable. At median, 30% of the
options will be exercisable. Below that point, none of the
options may be exercised. The proportion of options that are
exercisable reduces on a straight-line basis between upper
quartile and median performance. Options were granted in the
2002/03, 2003/04 and 2004/05 ﬁnancial years. The options
granted in the 2002/03 ﬁnancial year did not, after re-testing,
meet the TSR target at the end of the performance period on
31 March 2007 and lapsed on that date. For options granted in
the ﬁnancial year 2003/04, TSR had reached 85th position at
the ﬁrst measurement relative to the FTSE 100 and performance
will be re-tested in the ﬁnancial year 2007/08. If the
performance measure is not met, the options will lapse.
For options granted in the ﬁnancial year 2004/05 there were
no re-testing provisions, and the policy of the Committee is for
there to be no re-testing for future equity awards. At 31 March
2007, TSR for these options was at 8th position against the
comparator group of 20 companies and, as a result, 58% of the
options will become exercisable from June 2007.
The option granted to Sir Christopher Bland on 22 June 2001
as part of his recruitment package is not subject to a
performance measure as it matched a personal investment in BT
shares of £1 million.
The details of the options held by Sir Christopher Bland, Ben
Verwaayen, Andy Green, Hanif Lalani, Ian Livingston and Paul
Reynolds at the end of the ﬁnancial year 2006/07 and by
Franc ¸ois Barrault on 24 April 2007 when he was appointed as a
director, are contained in the table on page 65.
Retention shares
Retention shares are granted under the RSP (Retention Share
Plan) to individuals with critical skills, as a recruitment or
retention tool. In some cases, they are granted to key employees
who have contributed to good corporate performance to assist
retention. As a result, shares currently under award are not
generally linked to a corporate performance target. The length
of the retention period before awards vest is ﬂexible although
this would normally be three years unless the Committee agreed
otherwise. The shares are transferred at the end of the speciﬁed
period if the individual is still employed by BT.
Retention shares are used in special circumstances and, in the
ﬁnancial year 2006/07, seven awards were granted of which
three awards were made for recruitment purposes.
As a retention measure in his role as Chief Executive, BT
Global Services, Andy Green receives awards of retention shares
linked to BT Global Services’ ﬁnancial performance in 2005/06
and 2006/07. The target award was equivalent to 100% of
salary with a maximum of 150% of salary. The ﬁrst award with a
value of £750,000 was granted in June 2006. The second award
with a value of £217,000 will be granted in June 2007. The
awards vest three years after the date of grant subject to
continued employment. In recognition of the leading role which
Andy Green will take in delivering the next phase of
transformation of the company over the next two years, a
further retention share award with a value of £535,000 will be
granted to him in June 2007. The vesting of the award will be
after two years and will not be subject to performance
conditions.
The awards under the RSP held by Sir Christopher Bland and
Ian Livingston at the end of the ﬁnancial year 2006/07 and by
Franc ¸ois Barrault on 24 April 2007 when he was appointed as a
director, or which vested during the year, are contained in the
table on page 66.

Other share plans
The executive directors and the Chairman may participate in BT’s
HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) approved all-employee share
plans, the Employee Sharesave Scheme and Employee Share
Investment Plan, on the same basis as other employees. There
are further details of these plans in note 31 to the accounts.
Dilution
Treasury shares are generally used to satisfy the exercise of share
options, the grant of share awards and for the all-employee
share plans. At the end of the 2006/07 ﬁnancial year, treasury
shares equivalent to 6.2% of the issued share capital would be
required for these purposes. It is estimated that treasury shares
equivalent to approximately 1% of the issued share capital will
be required for all the employee share plans in 2007/08.
(iii) Annual package – ﬁnancial year 2007/08
The Remuneration Committee has carried out a review of
executive remuneration and, as a result, resolved to place a
greater emphasis on long-term reward.
Long-term reward
To provide appropriate incentives, to recognise good
performance in recent years and to help rebalance overall
remuneration to long-term reward, incentive share awards with
an initial face value in the range of 100% to 200% of salary will
be awarded. Awards will have a fair market value in the range of
44.5% to 89% of salary respectively.
Salaries
Salaries have been increased in order to bring the overall
packages more into line with the market.
Annual bonus plan
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the structure of the
corporate scorecard for the annual bonus plan. The annual
bonus will continue to reward performance against EPS, free
cash ﬂow and a customer-related measure. Given the
importance of excellent customer service to the company, the
weighting of the customer-related element will be increased to
30%; the EPS and cash ﬂow elements will each be reduced
to 35%.
In addition, the existing customer-related element of the
scorecard, customer satisfaction, will be changed to customer
service to reﬂect the drive to improve the efﬁciency of the
service provided to customers. This is in line with programmes in
the business designed to reﬂect new quality assurance and
efﬁciency measures.
As in the previous two ﬁnancial years, for purposes of
calculating EPS for the scorecard, volatile items reported under
IFRS have been excluded from the target.
The bonus levels for the Chief Executive and the executive
directors will continue unchanged. For the Chief Executive, at
target, two thirds of any bonus will continue to be payable in
deferred shares.
The Committee believes that the group performance targets
for the ﬁnancial year 2007/08 are more challenging than the
outturn for 2006/07.
Proportion of ﬁxed and variable remuneration
The targeted composition of each executive director’s
performance-related remuneration, excluding pension, for the
ﬁnancial year 2007/08, comprising annual and long-term
incentives, will be:
Fixed
Base Pay Variable Total
B Verwaayen 23% 77% 100%
F Barrault 37% 63% 100%
A Green 34% 66% 100%
H Lalani 37% 63% 100%
I Livingston 34% 66% 100%
P Reynolds 40% 60% 100%
Total remuneration comprises base salary, annual bonus – cash
and deferred shares – and the expected value of awards under
BT’s long-term incentive plans, excluding retention shares.
Openreach
In the Undertakings given to Ofcom on 22 September 2005, BT
agreed that the incentive elements of the remuneration of
executives within Openreach should be linked to Openreach
performance rather than BT targets or share price. These
incentives cannot be provided by way of BT shares.
As a result, special arrangements were put in place for
Openreach executives in 2005/06. The annual bonus is linked to
all Openreach targets and long-term incentives are paid in cash
instead of shares.
Openreach executives participate in the BT HMRC-approved
all-employee share plans on the same terms as other BT
employees. In addition, there were no changes to the pension
arrangements of these executives.
None of the executive directors participates in the Openreach
incentive plans.
(iv) Other matters
Executive share ownership
A mandatory shareholding programme was introduced for the
ﬁnancial year 2005/06 onwards. This is to encourage executive
directors and certain other executives to build up a shareholding
in the company over time by retaining shares received either as
a result of participating in a BT employee share plan (other than
the shares sold to pay a National Insurance or income tax
liability) or from on-market purchases. The Chief Executive is
required to build up a shareholding of 2 x salary and the
remaining executive directors 1.5 x salary. Given that a large
part of an executive’s remuneration is already variable, the
requirement excludes the need to make a further personal
investment to build up the shareholding should share plan
awards not vest. Current shareholdings are set out on page 62.
Progress towards meeting these targets has been made during
the ﬁnancial year 2006/07.
Pensions
Those directors and other employees, who joined the company
prior to 1 April 2001, are eligible for membership of the BT
Pension Scheme, which is a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. The beneﬁts
of the executive directors who are members of the scheme are
set out on page 64. The executive directors, who have opted
out of future pensionable service accrual following the pension
simpliﬁcation legislation which came into force on 6 April 2006,
receive, as an alternative, a cash allowance annually. The
beneﬁts for executive directors who are covered by this are set
out on page 64. This is broadly cash neutral for the company.
BT closed the BT Pension Scheme to new members from
1 April 2001. From this date, provision is generally made on a
deﬁned contribution basis. The company agrees to pay a ﬁxed
percentage of the executive’s salary each year which can be put
towards the provision of retirement beneﬁts. Additionally, a

lump sum equal to four times salary is payable on death in
service. The beneﬁts for the executive directors who are covered
by this are set out on page 64.
Pension provision for all executives is based on salary alone –
bonuses, other elements of pay and long-term incentives are
excluded.
Other beneﬁts
Other beneﬁts for the Chairman and the senior management
team include some or all of the following: company car, fuel or
driver, personal telecommunications facilities and home security,
medical and dental cover for the director and immediate family,
special life cover, professional subscriptions, and personal tax
planning and ﬁnancial counselling. The company has a
permanent health insurance policy to provide cover for the
Chairman and certain executive directors who may become
permanently incapacitated.
Service agreements
It is the policy for the Chairman and executive directors to have
service agreements providing for one year’s notice. It may be
necessary on recruitment to offer longer initial periods to new
directors from outside BT, or circumstances may make it
appropriate to offer a longer ﬁxed term. All of the service
agreements contain provisions dealing with the removal of a
director through poor performance, including in the event of
early termination of the contract by BT. During the ﬁnancial year
2006/07, Sir Christopher Bland’s service agreement was
extended to provide for his resignation as Chairman on
25 September 2007 and his resignation as a director on
30 September 2007 instead of at the conclusion of the 2007
AGM. On termination of his contract by BT before 30 September
2007, he is entitled to payment of salary and the value of any
beneﬁts until that date. Sir Mike Rake, who will replace Sir
Christopher Bland as Chairman, entered into a service agreement
as a director and Chairman to take effect from 26 September
2007. Ben Verwaayen’s contract entitles him on termination of
his contract by BT to payment of £700,000. The contracts of
Franc ¸ois Barrault, Andy Green, Hanif Lalani, Ian Livingston and
Paul Reynolds entitle them on termination of their contract by
BT to payment of salary and the value of beneﬁts until the
earlier of 12 months from notice of termination or the director
obtaining full-time employment. If the contract of an executive
director (other than that of the Chairman, Franc ¸ois Barrault and
Hanif Lalani) is terminated by BT within one year of BT entering
into a scheme of arrangement or becoming a subsidiary of
another company, he will be entitled to receive the higher of
that current year’s on-target bonus or the previous year’s bonus,
the market value of shares awarded under an employee share
ownership plan or deferred bonus plan that have not vested,
together with a year’s salary and the value of any beneﬁts.
The Committee has reviewed contracts taking into account
the joint statement of best practice on executive contracts and
severance by the Association of British Insurers and the National
Association of Pension Funds, and other relevant guidelines, and
believes that contract terms are generally in line with best
practice. The clause described above dealing with termination
following BT entering into a scheme of arrangement or
becoming a subsidiary of another company will be excluded
from contracts for new appointments. This clause was not
included in the contracts of Franc ¸ois Barrault and Hanif Lalani.
Outside appointments
The Committee believes that there are signiﬁcant beneﬁts, to
both the company and the individual, from executive directors
accepting non-executive directorships of companies outside BT.
The Committee will consider up to two external appointments
(of which only one may be to the Board of a major company),
for which a director may retain the fees. Ben Verwaayen as a
non-executive director of United Parcel Service (UPS), receives
an annual fee of US$75,000. On 1 May 2006, he was granted
1,051 shares of restricted UPS common stock amounting to
US$85,000 and on 8 February 2007 he was granted 1,501
shares of UPS restricted common stock amounting to
US$110,000. Ian Livingston received an annual fee of £45,000
as a non-executive director of Ladbrokes plc until he resigned as
a director on 31 October 2006. Paul Reynolds, as a non-
executive director of E-Access in Japan, receives an annual fee
of ¥3,200,000 (approximately £14,000). Andy Green is a non-
executive director of NAVTEQ in the US. He is entitled to receive
an annual fee of US$60,000 and an annual grant of restricted
stock units to the value of US$125,000. Franc ¸ois Barrault, as a
director of eServGlobal in Australia, receives an annual fee of
E36,000. In 2003, he was granted 500,000 options over
eServGlobal shares; 50% have an exercise price of A$0.15 per
option and 50% have an exercise price of A$0.40 per option.
Non-executive directors’ letters of appointment
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment. They are
appointed for an initial period of three years. During that period,
either party can give the other at least three months’ notice. At
the end of the period the appointment may be continued by
mutual agreement. Further details of appointment arrangements
for non-executive directors are set out in the Report of the
Directors. The letters of appointment of non-executive directors
are terminable on notice by the company without compensation.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration
Eight of the directors on the Board are non-executive directors
who, in accordance with BT’s articles of association, cannot
individually vote on their own remuneration. Non-executive
remuneration is reviewed by the Chairman and the Chief
Executive and discussed and agreed by the Board. Non-
executive directors may attend the Board discussion but may not
participate in it.
The Board last reviewed fees in 2004 and plans to review
them again in the 2007/08 ﬁnancial year.
The basic fee for non-executive directors is £40,000 per year.
An additional fee for membership of a Board committee is
£5,000 per year and a further £5,000 for chairing a committee.
Sir Anthony Greener, who was Deputy Chairman and senior
independent director until he retired on 30 September 2006 and
also chaired both the Remuneration Committee and the Audit
Committee, received total fees of £115,000 per year. Maarten
van den Bergh, who was appointed Deputy Chairman and senior
independent director from 1 October 2006 and chairman of the
Remuneration Committee from that date, and who is also
chairman of the Pension Scheme Performance Review Group,
receives total fees of £120,000 per year. Carl Symon receives an
annual fee of £70,000 as chairman of the Equality of Access
Board (a Board Committee), which was established on
1 November 2005.
To align further the interests of the non-executive directors
with those of shareholders, the company’s policy is to encourage
these directors to purchase, on a voluntary basis, £5,000 of BT
shares each year. The directors are asked to hold these shares
until they retire from the Board. This policy is not mandatory.
No element of non-executive remuneration is performance-
related. Non-executive directors do not participate in BT’s bonus
or employee share plans and are not members of any of the
company pension schemes.

Performance graph
This graph illustrates, as required by the Companies Act 1985,
the performance of BT Group plc measured by TSR relative to a
broad equity market index over the past ﬁve years. We consider
the FTSE 100 to be the most appropriate index against which to
measure performance for these purposes, as BT has been a
constituent of the FTSE 100 throughout the ﬁve-year period and
the index is widely used. TSR is the measure of the returns that
a company has provided for its shareholders, reﬂecting share
price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends.

These amounts represent the deferred pension to which the directors would have been entitled had they left the company on 31 March 2007 and 2006, respectively.
c
Transfer value of the deferred pension in column (a) as at 31 March 2007 calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. The transfer value represents a
liability of the BT Pension Scheme rather than any remuneration due to the individual and cannot be meaningfully aggregated with annual remuneration, as it is not money the individual is entitled to
receive.
d
The equivalent transfer value but calculated as at 31 March 2006 on the assumption that the director left service at that date.
e
The increase in pension built up during the year, net of inflation. The gross amount can be calculated by deducting the amount under column (b) from the amount under column (a).
f
The transfer value of the pension in column (e), less directors’ contributions.
g
Directors’ contributions in the financial year 2006/07 were as follows: Andy Green, £30,000 (2006 – £30,000); Hanif Lalani £nil (2006 – £24,000) and Paul Reynolds £nil (2006 – £26,000).

All of the above options were granted for nil consideration.
a
Option granted under the GSOP on 22 June 2001. The option is not subject to a performance measure. It was a term of Sir Christopher Bland’s initial service contract that (i) he purchased BT shares
to the value of at least £1 million; and (ii) as soon as practicable after the purchase of the shares (‘invested shares’), the company would grant a share option over shares to the value of at least
£1 million. Sir Christopher Bland was the legal and beneficial owner of the invested shares on 1 May 2004, so the option became exercisable on that date.
b
Option granted under the GSOP on 11 February 2002. The exercise of the option was subject to a performance measure being met. The performance measure was relative TSR compared with the
FTSE 100 as at 1 April 2002. BT’s TSR must be in the upper quartile for all of the option to become exercisable. At median, 40% of the option would be exercisable. Below that point, none of the
option may be exercised. On 31 March 2005, BT’s TSR was below median and also when it was retested on 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2007. As a result, the option lapsed on 31 March 2007.
c
Options granted under the GSOP on 29 July 2002. The exercise of the options was subject to a performance measure being met. The performance measure was relative TSR compared with the FTSE
100 as at 1 April 2002. BT’s TSR must be in the upper quartile for all of the options to become exercisable. At median, 30% of the options would be exercisable. Below that point, none of the
options may be exercised. On 31 March 2005, BT’s TSR was below median and also when it was retested on 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2007. As a result, the options lapsed on 31 March 2007.
d
Options granted under the GSOP on 24 June 2003. The exercise of the options is subject to a performance measure being met. The performance measure is relative TSR compared with the FTSE 100
as at 1 April 2003. BT’s TSR must be in the upper quartile for all of the options to become exercisable. At median, 30% of the options will become exercisable. Below that point, none of the options
may be exercised. On 31 March 2006, BT’s TSR was at 85th position against the FTSE 100. As a result, the options did not become exercisable. The TSR will be re-tested against a fixed base on 31
March 2008.
e
Options granted under the GSOP on 24 June 2004. The exercise of the options is subject to a performance measure being met. The performance measure is relative TSR compared with a group of 20
companies from the European Telecom Sector as at 1 April 2004. BT’s TSR must be in the upper quartile for all of each option to become exercisable. At median, 30% of the option will be
exercisable. Below that point, no part of the option may be exercised. On 31 March 2007, BT’s TSR was at 8th position against the comparator group and as a result, 42% of each option lapsed and
58% of each option will become exercisable on 24 June 2007.
f
Option granted on 25 June 2004 under the Employee Sharesave Scheme, in which all employees of the company are eligible to participate.
g
Option granted on 27 June 2003 under the Employee Sharesave Scheme, in which all employees of the company are eligible to participate. On 14 August 2006, Hanif Lalani exercised his option and
realised a gain of £3,608 based on the share price of 240.5p per share on the date of exercise.
h
Option granted under the GSOP (Special Incentive Award) on 24 June 2003, prior to Hanif Lalani’s appointment as a director. This option is not subject to a performance measure as the grant was
linked to personal performance.
i
Option granted on 25 June 2002 under the Employee Sharesave Scheme, in which all employees of the company are eligible to participate.
j
Option granted on 21 December 2001 under the Employee Sharesave Scheme, in which all employees of the company are eligible to participate.
k
Franc ¸ois Barrault was appointed as a director on 24 April 2007.
l
Option granted on 23 June 2006 under the Employee Sharesave Scheme, in which all employees of the company are eligible to participate.
m
Option granted under the GSOP on 21 May 2004. The exercise of the option is subject to the same performance measure as options granted on 24 June 2004 – see e above.

DIRECTORS’ INFORMATION
Election and re-election
All directors are required by the company’s articles of association
to be elected by shareholders at the ﬁrst annual general meeting
(AGM) after their appointment, if appointed by the Board. A
director must subsequently retire by rotation at an AGM at
intervals of not more than three years. The director may seek
re-election.
In accordance with the articles of association, Deborah Lathen
and Franc ¸ois Barrault, having been appointed as directors by the
Board, retire at the forthcoming AGM and will be proposed for
election. Sir Christopher Bland, Andy Green, Ian Livingston and
John Nelson retire by rotation and will be proposed for
re-election. Details of these directors’ contracts of appointment
are included in the Report on directors’ remuneration.

Service agreements
The Chairman and executive directors have service agreements,
which are approved by the Remuneration Committee.
Information about the periods of these contracts is in the
Report on directors’ remuneration.
Training and information
On appointment, directors take part in an induction programme
when they receive information about BT, the role of the Board
and the matters reserved for its decision, the terms of reference
and membership of the principal Board committees, and the
powers delegated to those committees, the company’s corporate
governance policies and procedures, including the powers
reserved to the group’s most senior executives, and the latest
ﬁnancial information about the group. This is supplemented by
visits to key BT locations and meetings with members of the
Operating Committee and other key senior executives. Each
year, directors participate in BT’s ‘Back to the Floor’ programme,
an activity that demonstrates commitment to our customers and
the people who serve them.
Throughout their period in ofﬁce the directors are continually
updated on BT’s business, the competitive and regulatory
environments in which it operates, technology and corporate
social responsibility matters and other changes affecting BT and
the communications industry as a whole, by written brieﬁngs
and meetings with senior BT executives. The Board also has two
lengthy sessions annually to discuss strategy. Directors are also
advised on appointment of their legal and other duties and
obligations as a director of a listed company, both in writing and
in face-to-face meetings with the Secretary. They are reminded
of these duties each year and they are also updated on changes
to the legal, accounting and governance requirements affecting
the company and themselves as directors. During the 2007
ﬁnancial year, for example, they attended presentations on BT’s
accounting policies and on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which
affects BT because its securities are registered with the SEC; and
received brieﬁngs on changes to UK company law and various
corporate governance proposals from the European Commission.
The Chairman also sends a weekly e-mail to non-executive
directors with topical sector highlights.
Guidelines are in place concerning the content, presentation
and delivery of papers for each Board meeting, so that the
directors have enough information to be properly briefed
sufﬁciently far ahead of each Board meeting and at other
appropriate times.
Independent advice
The Board has a procedure for directors, in furtherance of their
duties, to take independent professional advice if necessary, at
the company’s expense. In addition, all directors have access to
the advice and services of the Secretary.
Directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance and
indemnity
For some years the company has purchased insurance to cover
its directors and ofﬁcers against their costs in defending
themselves in civil legal proceedings taken against them in that
capacity and in respect of damages resulting from the
unsuccessful defence of any proceedings. At the date upon
which this report was approved, and throughout the 2007
ﬁnancial year, the company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, British
Telecommunications plc, has provided an indemnity in respect of
all the company’s directors. Neither the insurance nor the
indemnity provides cover where the director has acted
fraudulently or dishonestly.
Interest of management in certain transactions
During and at the end of the 2007 ﬁnancial year, none of the
company’s directors was materially interested in any material
transaction in relation to the group’s business and none is
materially interested in any presently proposed material
transactions.

BUSINESS POLICIES
Responsible business
To reinforce our commitment to achieve best practice in our
standards of business integrity and ethics, we have had in place
for nearly eight years a written statement of business practice
(The Way We Work). This covers all our operations and applies
worldwide to all employees, and to all agents and contractors
when representing BT, and is available in eight languages. A
copy has been sent to every employee and copies are also sent
to the employees of newly-acquired subsidiaries.
We measure our performance against these principles through
our Ethics Performance Measure (EPM), one of our key CSR key
performance indicators. The EPM comprises a measure of
employee awareness of The Way We Work, our ranking in an
external benchmarking of a selection of FTSE-100 companies
and the results of a survey on the extent to which employees
consider our activities ethical. In the 2007 ﬁnancial year, the
EPM was 84%.
Global sourcing, a key aspect of which is managing a complex
global supply chain, is increasingly important to BT. Through our
Sourcing with Human Dignity initiative, we seek to ensure that
working conditions in our supply chain meet internationally
recognised human rights standards. We investigate potential
social and environmental shortcomings and are committed to
achieving 100% follow-up within three months for all suppliers
identiﬁed as high- or medium-risk. During the 2007 ﬁnancial
year, we conducted 413 risk assessments. We also conduct a
survey every two years to establish the effectiveness of our
relationships with suppliers. The next survey will be carried out
in the 2008 ﬁnancial year.
During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we put increased emphasis on
the environmental aspects of our supply chain by introducing
new procurement principles covering the energy consumption
and environmental impacts of products and services from
manufacture through usage and including disposal. In the 2008
ﬁnancial year, we will be focusing on the implementation of
these principles.
The high-level principles in The Way We Work are supported
by a continuing and comprehensive communications programme
and on-line training. A conﬁdential helpline and dedicated e-
mail facility are also available to employees who have questions
about the application of these principles. The helpline number is
also published externally. BT’s new Undertakings code of
practice (It matters) forms part of our statement of business
practice and is consistent with it.
A Board committee – the Community Support Committee,
chaired by Sir Christopher Bland and comprising representatives
from BT businesses, three non-executive directors and an
independent member – oversees our community investment
activities including charitable and arts expenditure and the
strategy for maximising our contribution to society.
An executive committee, the Corporate Social Responsibility
Steering Group, oversees the implementation of our CSR strategy
and programme. This includes risk assessment, setting of targets
and objectives, and public accountability. BT also takes advice
from an external independent panel of CSR experts. More
information, including details of charitable donations made by
the group, is available in Business review – Our commitment to
society.
Political donations
The company’s continuing policy is that no company in the
group shall make contributions in cash or kind to any political
party, whether by gift or loan. Arrangements are in place to
implement this policy. However, the deﬁnition of political
donations used in the Companies Act 1985 is very much broader
than the sense in which these words are ordinarily used. It
covers activities such as making MPs and others in the political
world aware of key industry issues and matters affecting the
company, which make an important contribution to their
understanding of BT. These activities are carried out on an even-
handed basis related broadly to the major UK political parties’
electoral strength. The authority we are requesting at the AGM
is not designed to change the above policy. It will, however,
ensure that BT acts within the provisions of the Companies Act
1985 (the Act) requiring companies to obtain shareholder
authority before they can make donations to EU political
organisations (which includes UK political parties) as deﬁned in
the Act. During the 2007 ﬁnancial year the company’s wholly-
owned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, made the
following payments to cover the cost of hosting brieﬁng
meetings with MPs and MEPs about the company’s activities:
Labour Party £3,953; Conservative Party £5,710; Liberal
Democrats £4,444; Scottish National Party £3,500; Plaid Cymru
£785. No loans were made to any political party by any
company in the BT group.
Pension funds
BT’s two main pension funds – the BT Pension Scheme and the
BT Retirement Plan – are not controlled by the Board but by
separate and independent trustees. The trustees look after the
assets of the funds, which are held separately from those of the
company. The pension funds’ assets can be used only in
accordance with their respective rules and for no other purpose.
Payment of suppliers
BT subscribes to the Better Payment Practice Code for all
suppliers, the four principles of which are: to agree payment
terms at the outset and stick to them; to explain payment
procedures to suppliers; to pay bills in accordance with any
contract agreed with the supplier or as required by law; and to
tell suppliers without delay when an invoice is contested and
settle disputes quickly. Details of this code can be found at
www.payontime.co.uk BT’s normal payment terms are 42
calendar days from date of receipt of a due and valid invoice. BT
will make payment to the supplier on the next payment run
following expiry of this term. The ratio, expressed in days,
between the amounts invoiced to the company by its suppliers
in the 2007 ﬁnancial year and the amounts owed to its trade
creditors at the end of the year was 44 calendar days.
Financial statements
So far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant
information that has not been disclosed to the company’s
auditors and each of the directors believes that all steps have
been taken that ought to have been taken to make them aware
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the
company’s auditors have been made aware of that information.
A statement by the directors of their responsibilities for
preparing the ﬁnancial statements is included in the Statement
of directors’ responsibility. The directors’ statement on going
concern is included in Financial review – Capital resources.
Financial instruments
Details of the ﬁnancial risk management objectives and policies
of the group and exposure to interest risk, credit risk, liquidity
risk and price risk are given on page 45 and note 33 on pages
126 to 133.

Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the group’s systems of internal
control and risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness
of those systems, which it does annually. Such systems are
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives; any system can provide only
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. The process in place for reviewing the
group’s systems of internal control includes procedures designed
to identify and evaluate failings and weaknesses, and in the case
of any categorised as signiﬁcant, procedures exist to ensure that
necessary action is taken to remedy the failings.
The Board also takes account of signiﬁcant social,
environmental and ethical matters that relate to BT’s businesses
and reviews annually BT’s corporate social responsibility. The
company’s workplace practices, speciﬁc environmental, social
and ethical risks and opportunities and details of underlying
governance processes are dealt with in the Business review –
Motivating our people and living the BT values and Our
commitment to society.
BT has processes for identifying, evaluating and managing the
signiﬁcant risks faced by the group. These processes have been
in place for the whole of the 2007 ﬁnancial year and have
continued up to the date on which this document was approved.
The processes are in accordance with the Revised Guidance for
Directors on the Combined Code published by the Financial
Reporting Council (‘the Turnbull Guidance’).
Risk assessment and evaluation takes place as an integral part
of the group’s annual strategic planning cycle. The group has a
detailed risk management process, culminating in a Board
review, which identiﬁes the key risks facing the group and each
business unit. This information is reviewed by senior
management as part of the strategic review. The group’s current
key risks are summarised in Business review – Group risk
factors.
The key features of the risk management process comprise
the following procedures:
r senior executives, led by the Secretary, review the group’s key
risks and have created a group risk register describing the
risks, owners and mitigation strategies. This is reviewed by the
Operating Committee before being reviewed and approved by
the Board.
r the lines of business carry out risk assessments of their
operations, have created registers relating to those risks, and
ensure that the key risks are addressed.
r senior management reports regularly to the Group Finance
Director on the operation of internal controls in its area of
responsibility.
r the Chief Executive receives annual reports from senior
executives with responsibilities for major group operations
with their opinion on the effectiveness of the operation of
internal controls during the ﬁnancial year.
r the group’s internal auditors carry out continuing assessments
of the quality of risk management and control. Internal Audit
reports to the management and the Audit Committee on the
status of speciﬁc areas identiﬁed for improvement. Internal
Audit also promotes effective risk management in the lines of
business operations.
r the Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, considers the
effectiveness of the operation of internal control procedures
in the group during the ﬁnancial year. It reviews reports from
the internal auditors and from the external auditors and
reports its conclusions to the Board. The Audit Committee has
carried out these actions for the 2007 ﬁnancial year.
New subsidiaries acquired during the year have not been
included in the above risk management process. They will be
included for the 2008 ﬁnancial year. Material joint ventures and
associates, which BT does not control, outside the UK are not
part of the group risk management process and are responsible
for their own internal control assessment.
The Board has approved the formal statement of matters
which are reserved to it for consideration, approval or oversight.
It has also approved the group’s corporate governance
framework, which sets out the high level principles by which the
group is managed and the responsibilities and powers of the
Operating Committee and the group’s senior executives. As part
of this framework the development and implementation of
certain powers relating to group-wide policies and practices are
reserved to identiﬁed senior executives.
US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
BT has securities registered with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). As a result, BT is obliged to comply with
those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to foreign
issuers. BT complies with the legal and regulatory requirements
introduced pursuant to this legislation, in so far as they are
applicable to the group.
It is the opinion of the Board that the Audit Committee
includes in the person of Phil Hodkinson a member who is an
‘audit committee ﬁnancial expert’, and who is independent (as
deﬁned for this purpose). The Board considers that the
Committee’s members generally have broad commercial and
business leadership experience, having held various roles in
accountancy, ﬁnancial management and supervision, treasury
and corporate ﬁnance and that there is a broad and suitable mix
of business, ﬁnancial and IT experience on the Committee.
The code of ethics adopted for the purposes of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act is posted on the company’s website at www.bt.com/
ethics The code applies to the Chief Executive, Group Finance
Director and senior ﬁnance managers.
Disclosure controls and procedures
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, after evaluating
the effectiveness of BT’s disclosure controls and procedures as of
the end of the period covered by this Annual Report & Form
20-F, have concluded that, as of such date, BT’s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that material
information relating to BT was made known to them by others
within the group. The Chief Executive and Group Finance
Director have also provided the certiﬁcations required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Internal control over ﬁnancial reporting
BT’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over ﬁnancial reporting for the group.
Internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial
reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements for
external reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS, and the
required reconciliation to US GAAP.
Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over ﬁnancial reporting based on the framework
for internal control evaluation contained in the Turnbull
Guidance.
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as
at 31 March 2007, the group’s internal control over ﬁnancial
reporting was effective.
There were no changes in BT’s internal control over ﬁnancial
reporting that occurred during the 2007 ﬁnancial year that have

Any signiﬁcant deﬁciency, as deﬁned by the US Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), in internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting, is reported to the Audit Committee.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which has audited the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the group for the 2007
ﬁnancial year, has also audited management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting and the

SHAREHOLDERS AND ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Relations with shareholders
Senior executives, led by the Chief Executive and the Group
Finance Director and including, as appropriate, the other
executive directors, hold meetings with the company’s principal
institutional shareholders to discuss the company’s strategy,
ﬁnancial performance and speciﬁc major investment activities.
The Deputy Chairman also attends, at his discretion and in
consultation with the Chairman and the Chief Executive,
meetings with shareholders during the year; this may also
include meetings with investors to discuss overall remuneration
policies and plans in his role as chairman of the Remuneration
Committee. All non-executive directors have an invitation to
attend investors’ meetings if they wish. Contact with institutional
shareholders (and with ﬁnancial analysts, brokers and the media)
is controlled by written guidelines to ensure the protection of
share price sensitive information that has not already been made
generally available to the company’s shareholders. The directors
are provided with either full or summarised reports and other
written brieﬁngs from the company’s major shareholders and
analysts and are regularly informed by the Secretary about the
holdings of its principal shareholders. The Secretary also surveys
the company’s retail shareholders about the quality of the
company’s shareholder communications and share registration
services.
Established procedures ensure the timely release of share
price sensitive information and the publication of the company’s
ﬁnancial results and regulatory ﬁnancial statements. All external
announcements are also reviewed for accuracy and compliance
requirements by a committee of senior executives, the
Disclosure Committee, which is chaired by the Secretary.
Substantial shareholdings
At 16 May 2007, the company had received notiﬁcations from
Legal & General Investment Management Limited, Brandes
Investment Partners LLC and Barclays PLC, under the Disclosure
and Transparency Rules issued by the Financial Services
Authority, in respect of holdings of 300,805,154 shares,
330,627,819 shares and 360,935,363 shares respectively,
representing holdings of 3.6%, 4.0% and 4.4% of the company’s
total voting rights.
AGM resolutions
We are continuing our policy that shareholders vote on the
annual report at the AGM. Shareholders will also again be asked
to vote separately on the Report on directors’ remuneration.
It is part of our policy to involve shareholders fully in the
affairs of the company and to give them the opportunity at the
AGM to ask questions about the company’s activities and
prospects. We also give shareholders the opportunity to vote on
every substantially different issue by proposing a separate
resolution for each issue.
The proxy votes for and against each resolution, as well as votes
withheld, will be counted before the AGM and the results will be
made available at the meeting after the shareholders have voted
on each resolution on a show of hands, and at the end of the
meeting. It is our policy for all directors to attend the AGM if at
all possible. Whilst, because of ill health or other pressing
reasons, this may not always be possible, in normal
circumstances this means that the chairmen of the Audit,
Nominating and Remuneration committees are at the AGM and
are available to answer relevant questions. All the directors
attended the 2006 AGM.
The resolutions to be proposed at the AGM at The Sage
Gateshead on 19 July 2007, together with explanatory notes,
appear in the separate Annual Review & Notice of Meeting 2007
which is sent to all shareholders together with the Annual
Report & Form 20-F (if requested). These documents are sent
out in the most cost-effective fashion, given the large number
of shareholders. We aim to give as much notice as possible and
at least 21 clear days’ notice, as required by the company’s
articles of association. In practice, these documents are being
sent to shareholders more than 20 working days before the
AGM.
In line with the new provisions introduced by the Companies
Act 2006, we are proposing a resolution at the AGM to allow us
more ﬂexibility in communicating electronically with shareholders
in the future.
Resolutions to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
auditors of the company and to authorise the directors to settle
their remuneration will also be proposed at the AGM.
Authority to purchase shares
The authority given at last year’s AGM of the company held on
12 July 2006 for the company to purchase in the market 834
million of its shares, representing 10% of the issued share
capital, expires on 11 October 2007. Shareholders will be asked
to give a similar authority at the AGM.
During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, 148 million shares of 5 pence
each were purchased under this authority (1.7% of the share
capital) for a total consideration of £401 million, at an average
price of £2.72 per share. The shares were purchased in an on-
market programme of buying back the company’s shares,
initiated in November 2003, as part of the company’s
shareholder distribution strategy. For more details, see the table
on page 162. A total of 368 million shares have been retained
as treasury shares. At 16 May 2007, 91 million treasury shares
had been transferred to meet the company’s obligations under
its employee share plans.

UNITED KINGDOM OPINION
Independent auditors’ report to the members of BT
Group plc
We have audited the group ﬁnancial statements of BT Group plc
for the year ended 31 March 2007 which comprise the group
income statement, the group balance sheet, the group cash ﬂow
statement, the group statement of recognised income and
expense, accounting policies and the related notes. These group
ﬁnancial statements are set out on pages 78 to 142 and 148.
These group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁnancial
statements of BT Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2007
and on the information in the Report on directors’ remuneration
that is described as having been audited. This separate report is
set out on page 144.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report
and the group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of
directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This
report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only
for the company’s members as a body in accordance with
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group
ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the
group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion
the information given in the Report of the Directors is consistent
with the group ﬁnancial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement
reﬂects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of
the Combined Code (2003) speciﬁed for our review by the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if
it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
Form 20-F and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited group ﬁnancial statements. The other information
comprises only BT at a glance, the Chairman’s message, the
Chief Executive’s statement and the Report of the Directors. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
group ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
group ﬁnancial statements. It also includes an assessment of the
signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the group ﬁnancial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the group ﬁnancial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
group ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
r the group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of
the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 March 2007 and of
its proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year then ended;
r the group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation; and
r the information given in the Report of the Directors is
consistent with the group ﬁnancial statements.

UNITED STATES OPINION
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm to the Board of Directors and Shareholders of BT
Group plc
We have completed an integrated audit of BT Group plc’s
31 March 2007 consolidated ﬁnancial statements and of its
internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of 31 March 2007
and audits of its 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005
consolidated ﬁnancial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented
below.
Consolidated ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion, the accompanying group income statements and
the related group balance sheets, group statements of cash
ﬂows and group statements of recognised income and expense
present fairly, in all material respects, the ﬁnancial position of BT
Group plc and its subsidiaries at 31 March 2007 and 2006, and
the results of their operations and their cash ﬂows for each of
the three years in the period ended 31 March 2007, in
conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. These ﬁnancial
statements are the responsibility of the company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these ﬁnancial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these ﬁnancial statements in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
ﬁnancial statements includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
signiﬁcant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall ﬁnancial statements presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in the accounting policies section in the ﬁnancial
statements, the group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 April
2005 prospectively.
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union vary in certain
signiﬁcant respects from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Information relating
to the nature and effect of such differences, as restated, is
presented in the United States Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles note to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (note 35).
Internal control over ﬁnancial reporting
Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
Managements’ Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Internal Control
as set out in the ﬁrst three paragraphs of Internal Control over
ﬁnancial reporting in Report of the Directors, Corporate
governance of the Form 20-F, that the group maintained
effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of 31 March
2007 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Revised
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code as issued by the
Financial Reporting Council (the Turnbull criteria), is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in
our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of 31 March
2007, based on criteria established in the Turnbull criteria. The
company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over ﬁnancial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment
and on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit of internal control over ﬁnancial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over ﬁnancial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
An audit of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over ﬁnancial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over ﬁnancial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the ﬁnancial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Checksum: -2049875414
(I) BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
These consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in
accordance with applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
For BT there are no differences between IFRSs as adopted for
use in the EU and full IFRS as published by the IASB. The
ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention, modiﬁed for the revaluation of certain ﬁnancial
assets and liabilities at fair value.
Where there are signiﬁcant differences to US GAAP, these
have been described in note 35.
The policies set out below have been consistently applied to
all years presented with the exception of those relating to
ﬁnancial instruments under IAS 32, ‘Financial Instruments:
Disclosure and Presentation’ and IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement’, which have been applied with
effect from 1 April 2005.
Certain comparative balance sheet amounts for the 2006
ﬁnancial year have been reclassiﬁed to conform with the
presentation adopted in the 2007 ﬁnancial year. These include
£305 million which has been reclassiﬁed from prepayments to
non current assets at 31 March 2006 in respect of costs relating
to the initial set up, transition or transformation phase of long
term networked IT services contracts. In addition, £267 million
has been reclassiﬁed from property, plant and equipment to
intangible assets at 31 March 2006 in respect of IT software
application assets.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with
IFRSs requires the use of accounting estimates. It also requires
management to exercise its judgement in the process of
applying the group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a
higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where
assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant to the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements, are disclosed below in ‘Critical accounting
estimates and key judgements’.
The group’s income statement and segmental analysis
separately identiﬁes trading results before signiﬁcant one-off or
unusual items (termed ‘speciﬁc items’), a non GAAP measure.
This is consistent with the way that ﬁnancial performance is
measured by management and assists in providing a meaningful
analysis of the trading results of the group. The directors believe
that presentation of the group’s results in this way is relevant to
an understanding of the group’s ﬁnancial performance as
speciﬁc items are signiﬁcant one-off or unusual in nature and
have little predictive value. Furthermore, the group consider a
columnar presentation to be appropriate as it improves the
clarity of the presentation and is consistent with the way that
ﬁnancial performance is measured and reported to the board of
directors. Speciﬁc items may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures used by other companies. Items which have been
considered signiﬁcant one-off or unusual in nature include
disposals of businesses and investments, business restructuring,
asset impairment charges and property rationalisation
programmes. The directors intend to follow such a presentation
on a consistent basis in the future. Speciﬁc items for the current
and prior years are disclosed in note 4.
Accounting policies in respect of the parent company, BT
Group plc, are set out on page 145. These are in accordance
with UK GAAP.
(II) BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The group ﬁnancial statements consolidate the ﬁnancial
statements of BT Group plc (‘ ‘the company’ ’) and entities
controlled by the company (its subsidiaries) and incorporate its
share of the results of jointly controlled entities (joint ventures)
and associates using the equity method of accounting.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the
year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition or
up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where
necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to bring the
accounting policies used in line with those used by the group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are
eliminated on consolidation.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are initially
recognised at cost. Subsequent to acquisition the carrying value
of the group’s investment in associates and joint ventures
includes the group’s share of post acquisition reserves, less any
impairment in the value of individual assets. The income
statement reﬂects the group’s share of the results of operations
after tax of the associate or joint venture.
The group’s principal operating subsidiaries and associate are
detailed on page 148.
(III) REVENUE
Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration received
or receivable for communication services and equipment sales,
net of discounts and sales taxes. Revenue from the rendering of
services and sale of equipment is recognised when it is probable
that the economic beneﬁts associated with a transaction will
ﬂow to the group and the amount of revenue and the
associated costs can be measured reliably. Where the group acts
as agent in a transaction it recognises revenue net of directly
attributable costs.
Revenue arising from separable installation and connection
services is recognised when it is earned, upon activation.
Revenue from the rental of analogue and digital lines and
private circuits is recognised evenly over the period to which the
charges relate. Revenue from calls is recognised at the time the
call is made over the group’s network.
Subscription fees, consisting primarily of monthly charges for
access to broadband and other internet access or voice services,
are recognised as revenue as the service is provided. Revenue
arising from the interconnection of voice and data trafﬁc
between other telecommunications operators is recognised at
the time of transit across the group’s network.
Revenue from the sale of peripheral and other equipment is
recognised when all the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of
ownership are transferred to the buyer, which is normally the
date the equipment is delivered and accepted by the customer.
Revenue from long term contractual arrangements is
recognised based on the percentage of completion method. The
stage of completion is estimated using an appropriate measure
according to the nature of the contract. For long term services
contracts revenue is recognised on a straight line basis over the
term of the contract. However, if the performance pattern is
other than straight line, revenue is recognised as services are
provided, usually on an output or consumption basis. For ﬁxed
price contracts, including contracts to design and build software

Checksum: 1907973669
solutions, revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of
completion, as determined by the proportion of costs incurred
relative to the estimated total contract costs, or other measures
of completion such as contract milestone customer acceptance.
In the case of time and materials contracts, revenue is
recognised as the service is rendered.
Costs related to delivering services under long term
contractual arrangements are expensed as incurred. An element
of costs incurred in the initial set up, transition or
transformation phase of the contract are deferred and recorded
within non current assets. These costs are then recognised in the
income statement on a straight line basis over the remaining
contractual term, unless the pattern of service delivery indicates
a different proﬁle is appropriate. These costs are directly
attributable to speciﬁc contracts, relate to future activity, will
generate future economic beneﬁts and are assessed for
recoverability on a regular basis.
The percentage of completion method relies on estimates of
total expected contract revenues and costs, as well as reliable
measurement of the progress made towards completion. Unless
the ﬁnancial outcome of a contract can be estimated with
reasonable certainty, no attributable proﬁt is recognised. In such
circumstances, revenue is recognised equal to the costs incurred
to date, to the extent that such revenue is expected to be
recoverable. Recognised revenue and proﬁts are subject to
revisions during the contract if the assumptions regarding the
overall contract outcome are changed. The cumulative impact of
a revision in estimates is recorded in the period in which such
revisions become likely and can be estimated. Where the actual
and estimated costs to completion exceed the estimated revenue
for a contract, the full contract life loss is immediately
recognised.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more
separate elements that have value to a customer on a
standalone basis, revenue is recognised for each element as if it
were an individual contract. The total contract consideration is
allocated between the separate elements on the basis of relative
fair value and the appropriate revenue recognition criteria
applied to each element as described above.
(IV) LEASES
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a
lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement and
requires an assessment of whether the fulﬁlment of the
arrangement is dependent on the use of a speciﬁc asset or
assets and whether the arrangement conveys the right to use
the asset.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the group
holds substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are
classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases.
Finance lease assets are capitalised at the commencement of
the lease term at the lower of the present value of the minimum
lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset. The
obligations relating to ﬁnance leases, net of ﬁnance charges in
respect of future periods, are recognised as liabilities. Leases are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. If a sale and leaseback transaction results in a
ﬁnance lease, any excess of sale proceeds over the carrying
amount is deferred and recognised in the income statement over
the lease term.
Leases where a signiﬁcant portion of the risks and rewards are
held by the lessor are classiﬁed as operating leases. Rentals are
charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over
the period of the lease. If a sale and leaseback transaction
results in an operating lease, any proﬁt or loss is recognised in
the income statement immediately.
(V) FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Items included in the ﬁnancial statements of each of the group’s
subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the entity operates (the
‘functional currency’). The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are
presented in sterling, the presentation currency of the group.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the
functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the
date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the
translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies at period end exchange rates are recognised
in the income statement in the line which most appropriately
reﬂects the nature of the item or transaction. Where monetary
items form part of the net investment in a foreign operation and
are designated as hedges of a net investment or as cash ﬂow
hedges, such exchange differences are initially recognised in
equity.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign undertakings
are translated into sterling at year end exchange rates. The
results of foreign undertakings are translated into sterling at
average rates of exchange for the year (unless this average is
not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effects of the
rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income
and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions).
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are
recognised directly in a separate component of equity, the
translation reserve.
In the event of the disposal of an undertaking with assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currency, the cumulative
translation difference associated with the undertaking in the
translation reserve is charged or credited to the gain or loss on
disposal.
(VI) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The purchase method of accounting is used for the acquisition
of subsidiaries, in accordance with IFRS 3, ‘Business
Combinations’. On transition to IFRSs, the group elected not to
apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions that occurred before
1 April 2004. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries
which occurred between 1 January 1998 and 1 April 2004 is
therefore included in the balance sheet at original cost, less
accumulated amortisation to the date of transition and any
provisions for impairment. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of
a subsidiary which occurred prior to 1 January 1998 was written
off directly to retained earnings.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, fair values are attributed to the
identiﬁable net assets acquired. The excess of the cost of the
acquisition over the fair value of the group’s share of the
identiﬁable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the
cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the group’s
share of the identiﬁable net assets acquired, the difference is
recognised directly in the income statement. On disposal of a
subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal includes the carrying
amount of goodwill relating to the subsidiary sold. Goodwill
previously written off to retained earnings is not recycled to the
income statement on disposal of the related subsidiary.
(VII) INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Identiﬁable intangible assets are recognised when the group
controls the asset, it is probable that future economic beneﬁts
attributable to the asset will ﬂow to the group and the cost of
BT Group plc Annual Report & Form 20-F 79
Financial statements Filename: 51384_08.3d Time: 15:18:34 Date: 19/05/07
Checksum: -2081772869
the asset can be reliably measured. All intangible assets, other
than goodwill and indeﬁnite lived assets, are amortised over
their useful economic life. The method of amortisation reﬂects
the pattern in which the assets are expected to be consumed. If
the pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight line
method is used.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over
the fair value of the group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets
(including intangible assets) of the acquired subsidiary. Goodwill
is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses.
Telecommunication licences
Licence fees paid to governments, which permit
telecommunication activities to be operated for deﬁned periods,
are initially recorded at cost and amortised from the time the
network is available for use to the end of the licence period.
Brands, customer lists and customer relationships
Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are
recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Assumptions are
used in estimating the fair values of acquired intangible assets
and include management’s estimates of revenue and proﬁts to
be generated by the acquired businesses.
Computer software
Computer software comprises computer software purchased from
third parties, and also the cost of internally developed software.
Computer software purchased from third parties is initially
recorded at cost.
Subscriber acquisition costs
Subscriber acquisition costs are expensed as incurred, unless they
meet the criteria for capitalisation, in which case they are
capitalised and amortised over the shorter of the customer life
or contractual period.
Estimated useful economic lives
The estimated useful economic lives assigned to the principal
categories of intangible assets are as follows:
Telecommunication licences 1 to 5 years
Brands, customer lists and customer relationships 3 to 15 years
Computer software 2 to 5 years
(VIII) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research expenditure is recognised in the income statement in
the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure, including the cost of internally
developed software, is recognised in the income statement in
the period in which it is incurred unless it is probable that
economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the group from the asset being
developed, the cost of the asset can be reliably measured and
technical feasibility can be demonstrated. Capitalisation ceases
when the asset being developed is ready for use.
Research and development costs include direct labour,
contractors’ charges, materials and directly attributable
overheads.
(IX) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is included in the balance sheet
at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and any
provisions for impairment.
On disposal of property, plant and equipment, the difference
between the sale proceeds and the net book value at the date
of disposal is recorded in the income statement.
Cost
Included within the cost for network infrastructure and
equipment are direct labour, contractors’ charges, materials,
payments on account and directly attributable overheads.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment on a
straight line basis from the time the asset is available for use, so
as to write off the asset’s cost over the estimated useful life
taking into account any expected residual value. Freehold land is
not subject to depreciation.
The lives assigned to principal categories of assets are as
follows:
Land and buildings
Freehold buildings 40 years
Leasehold land and buildings Unexpired portion of lease
or 40 years, whichever is
the shorter
Network infrastructure and equipment
Transmission equipment:
Duct 40 years
Cable 3 to 25 years
Radio and repeater equipment 2 to 25 years
Exchange equipment 2 to 13 years
Payphones other network equipment 2 to 20 years
Other
Motor vehicles 2 to 9 years
Computers and ofﬁce equipment 3 to 6 years
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated over the shorter
of the lease term or their useful economic life. Residual values
and useful lives are re-assessed annually and if necessary
changes are recognised prospectively.
(X) ASSET IMPAIRMENT (NON FINANCIAL ASSETS)
Intangible assets with ﬁnite useful lives and property, plant and
equipment are tested for impairment if events or changes in
circumstances (assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an impairment
test is performed, the recoverable amount is assessed by
reference to the higher of the net present value of expected
future cash ﬂows (value in use) of the relevant cash generating
unit and the fair value less cost to sell.
Goodwill and intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful lives are
tested for impairment at least annually.
If a cash generating unit is impaired, provision is made to
reduce the carrying amount of the related assets to their
estimated recoverable amount, normally as a speciﬁc item.
Impairment losses are allocated ﬁrstly against goodwill, and
secondly on a pro rata basis against intangible and other assets.
Where an impairment loss is recognised against an asset it
may be reversed in future periods where there has been a

change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, except in
respect of impairment of goodwill which may not be reversed in
any circumstances.
(XI) INVENTORY
Inventory mainly comprises items of equipment held for sale or
rental and consumable items.
Equipment held and consumable items are stated at the lower
of cost and estimated net realisable value, after provisions for
obsolescence. Cost is calculated on a ﬁrst-in-ﬁrst-out basis.
(XII) TERMINATION BENEFITS
Termination beneﬁts (leaver costs) are payable when
employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or
when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange
for these beneﬁts. The group recognises termination beneﬁts
when it is demonstrably committed to the affected employees
leaving the group.
(XIII) POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The group operates a funded deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan,
which is administered by an independent trustee, for the
majority of its employees.
The group’s net obligation in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt
pension plans is calculated separately for each scheme by
estimating the amount of future beneﬁt that employees have
earned in return for their service to date. That beneﬁt is
discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of
any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate used is the yield
at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have
maturity dates approximating the terms of the group’s
obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualiﬁed actuary
using the projected unit credit method. The net obligation
recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the
deﬁned beneﬁt obligation less the fair value of the plan assets.
The income statement charge is allocated between an
operating charge and a net ﬁnance charge. The operating
charge reﬂects the service cost which is spread systematically
over the working lives of the employees. The net ﬁnance charge
reﬂects the unwinding of the discount applied to the liabilities
of the plan, offset by the expected return on the assets of the
plan, based on conditions prevailing at the start of the year.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period
in which they occur and are presented in the statement of
recognised income and expense.
Actuarial valuations of the main deﬁned beneﬁt plan are
carried out by an independent actuary as determined by the
trustees at intervals of not more than three years, to determine
the rates of contribution payable. The pension cost is
determined on the advice of the group’s actuary, having regard
to the results of these trustee valuations. In any intervening
years, the actuaries review the continuing appropriateness of the
contribution rates.
The group also operates deﬁned contribution pension schemes
and the income statement is charged with the contributions
payable.
(XIV) SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The group has a number of employee share schemes and share
option and award plans under which it makes equity settled
share based payments to certain employees. The fair value of
options and awards granted is recognised as an employee
expense after taking into account the group’s best estimate of
the number of awards expected to vest allowing for non market
and service conditions. Fair value is measured at the date of
grant and is spread over the vesting period of the award. The
fair value of options and awards granted is measured using
either the Binomial or Monte Carlo model, whichever is most
appropriate to the award. Any proceeds received are credited to
share capital and share premium when the options are exercised.
The group has applied IFRS 2 ‘Share based payment’
retrospectively to all options and awards granted after
7 November 2002 and not fully vested at 1 January 2005.
(XV) TAXATION
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is
provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, in
respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount
of the group’s assets and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets
within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group. Any
remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the
basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable
that there will be suitable taxable proﬁts, within the same
jurisdiction, in the foreseeable future against which the
deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that are expected
to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability
settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on
investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can
be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in the income
statement, except when the tax relates to items charged or
credited directly in equity, in which case the tax is also
recognised in equity.
(XVI) ADVERTISING AND MARKETING
The costs associated with the group’s advertising and marketing
activities are expensed within other operating costs as incurred.
(XVII) DIVIDENDS
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the year in which
they are declared and approved by the company’s shareholders
in general meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they
are paid.
(XVIII) PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely
than not that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is
material.
(XIX) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (FROM 1 APRIL 2005)
The following are the key accounting policies used from 1 April
2005 onwards to reﬂect the adoption of IAS 32, ‘Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ and IAS 39, ‘Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.

Checksum: 2061749365
Recognition and derecognition of ﬁnancial assets and
ﬁnancial liabilities
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised when the
group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the group no
longer has rights to cash ﬂows, the risks and rewards of
ownership or control of the asset. Financial liabilities are
derecognised when the obligation under the liability is
discharged, cancelled or expires. In particular, for all regular way
purchases and sales of ﬁnancial assets, the group recognises the
ﬁnancial assets on the settlement date, which is the date on
which the asset is delivered to or by the group.
Financial assets
Financial assets at fair value through income statement
A ﬁnancial asset is classiﬁed in this category if acquired
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term (held for
trading) or if so designated by management. Financial assets
held in this category are initially recognised and subsequently
measured at fair value, with changes in value recognised in the
income statement in the line which most appropriately reﬂects
the nature of the item or transaction.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non derivative ﬁnancial assets with
ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market other than:
r those that the group intends to sell immediately or in the
short term, which are classiﬁed as held for trading;
r those for which the group may not recover substantially all of
its initial investment, other than because of credit
deterioration, which are classiﬁed as available-for-sale.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus
transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, with changes in carrying
value recognised in the income statement in the line which most
appropriately reﬂects the nature of the item or transaction.
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets
Non-derivative ﬁnancial assets classiﬁed as available-for-sale are
either speciﬁcally designated in this category or not classiﬁed in
any of the other categories. Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets
are carried at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses (except
for changes in exchange rates for monetary items, interest,
dividends and impairment losses which are recognised in the
income statement) are recognised in equity until the ﬁnancial
asset is derecognised, at which time the cumulative gain or loss
previously recognised in equity is taken to the income
statement, in the line that most appropriately reﬂects the nature
of the item or transaction.
Trade and other receivables
Financial assets within trade and other receivables are initially
recognised at fair value, which is usually the original invoiced
amount and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method less provisions made for doubtful
receivables.
Provisions are made speciﬁcally where there is objective
evidence of a dispute or an inability to pay. An additional
provision is made based on an analysis of balances by age,
previous losses experienced and general economic conditions.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current
balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to
insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value and have an original
maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash ﬂow statement, cash
and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as
deﬁned above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Bank
overdrafts are included within loans and other borrowings in
current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a
ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets are impaired.
Where there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has
arisen on assets carried at amortised cost, the carrying amount is
reduced with the loss being recognised in the income statement.
The impairment loss is measured as the difference between that
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated
future cash ﬂows discounted at the ﬁnancial asset’s original
effective interest rate. The impairment loss is only reversed if it
can be related objectively to an event after the impairment was
recognised and is reversed to the extent the carrying value of
the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the date of
reversal.
If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount
comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal
payment and amortisation) and its fair value is transferred from
equity to the income statement. Reversals of impairment losses
on debt instruments are taken through the income statement if
the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively
related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was
recognised in the income statement. Reversals in respect of
equity instruments classiﬁed as available-for-sale are not
recognised in the income statement.
If there is objective evidence of an impairment loss on an
unquoted equity instrument that is not carried at fair value
because its fair value cannot be objectively measured, or on a
derivative asset that is linked to and must be settled by delivery
of such an unquoted equity instrument, has been incurred, the
amount of loss is measured as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated
future cash ﬂows discounted at the current market rate of return
for a similar ﬁnancial asset.
Financial liabilities
Trade and other payables
Financial liabilities within trade and other payables are initially
recognised at fair value, which is usually the original invoiced
amount, and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.
Loans and other borrowings
Loans and other borrowings are initially recognised at fair value
plus directly attributable transaction costs. Where loans and
other borrowings contain a separable embedded derivative, the
fair value of the embedded derivative is the difference between
the fair value of the hybrid instrument and the fair value of the
loan or borrowing. The fair value of the embedded derivative
and the loan or borrowing is recorded separately on initial
recognition. Loans and other borrowings are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method
and if included in a fair value hedge relationship are revalued to
reﬂect the fair value movements on the hedged risk associated
Consolidated ﬁnancial statements Accounting policies

with the loans and other borrowings. The resultant amortisation
of fair value movements are recognised in the income
statement.
Financial guarantees
Financial guarantees are recognised initially at fair value plus
transaction costs and subsequently measured at the higher of
the amount determined in accordance with the accounting
policy relating to provisions and the amount initially determined
less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments mainly to reduce
exposure to foreign exchange risks and interest rate movements.
The group does not hold or issue derivative ﬁnancial instruments
for ﬁnancial trading purposes. However, derivatives that do not
qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading
instruments.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are classiﬁed as held for
trading and initially recognised at cost. Subsequent to initial
recognition, derivative ﬁnancial instruments are stated at fair
value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is
recognised immediately in the income statement in net ﬁnance
expense. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge
accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on
the nature of the hedge. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are
classiﬁed as current assets or current liabilities where they are
not designated in a hedging relationship or have a maturity
period within 12 months. Where derivative ﬁnancial instruments
have a maturity period greater than 12 months and are
designated in a hedge relationship, they are classiﬁed within
either non current assets or non current liabilities.
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments or other
host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risk
and characteristics are not closely related to those of host
contracts and host contracts are not carried at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives are
recognised in the income statement in the line which most
appropriately reﬂects the nature of the item or transaction.
Hedge accounting
Cash ﬂow hedge
When a ﬁnancial instrument is designated as a hedge of the
variability in cash ﬂows of a recognised asset or liability, or a
highly probable transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss
on the derivative ﬁnancial instrument is recognised directly in
equity.
For cash ﬂow hedges of recognised assets or liabilities, the
associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and
recognised in the same line in the income statement in the same
period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
the income statement.
For highly probable transactions, when the transaction
subsequently results in the recognition of a non-ﬁnancial asset
or non-ﬁnancial liability the associated cumulative gain or loss is
removed from equity and included in the initial cost or carrying
amount of the non-ﬁnancial asset or liability.
If a hedge of a highly probable transaction subsequently
results in the recognition of a ﬁnancial asset or a ﬁnancial
liability, then the associated gains and losses that were
recognised directly in equity are reclassiﬁed into the income
statement in the same period or periods during which the asset
acquired or liability assumed affects the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness arising on a cash ﬂow hedge of a
recognised asset or liability is recognised immediately in the
same income statement line as the hedged item. Where
ineffectiveness arises on highly probable transactions, it is
recognised in the line which most appropriately reﬂects the
nature of the item or transaction.
Fair value hedge
When a derivative ﬁnancial instrument is designated as a hedge
of the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or
unrecognised ﬁrm commitment, the change in fair value of the
derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are recorded
in the same line in the income statement, together with any
changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is
attributable to the hedged risk.
Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of currency
instruments designated as hedges of net investments in a
foreign operation are taken to shareholders’ equity on
consolidation to the extent the hedges are deemed effective.
Any ineffectiveness arising on a hedge of a net investment in
a foreign operation is recognised in net ﬁnance expense.
Discontinuance of hedge accounting
Discontinuance of hedge accounting may occur when a hedging
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge
no longer qualiﬁes for hedge accounting or the group revokes
designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged ﬁnancial
asset or liability remains or highly probable transaction is still
expected to occur. Under a cash ﬂow hedge the cumulative gain
or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in
accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If
the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place or
the underlying hedged ﬁnancial asset or liability no longer exists,
the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is
recognised immediately in the income statement. Under a hedge
of a net investment the cumulative gain or loss remains in
equity when the hedging instrument expires or is sold,
terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer qualiﬁes for hedge
accounting or the group revokes designation of the hedge
relationship. The cumulative gain or loss is recognised in the
income statement as part of the proﬁt on disposal when the net
investment in the foreign operation is disposed. Under a fair
value hedge the cumulative gain or loss adjustment associated
with the hedged risk is amortised to the income statement using
the effective interest method over the remaining term of the
hedged item.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Incremental costs directly
attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a
deduction from the proceeds received. Shares in the parent
company, BT Group plc, held by employee share ownership
trusts and repurchased shares are recorded in the balance sheet
as a deduction from shareholders’ equity at cost.
(XX) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (TO 31 MARCH 2005)
The accounting policies adopted in respect of ﬁnancial
instruments in periods up to, and including 31 March 2005, are
set out below.
Financial assets were held at the lower of cost and net
realisable value in accordance with UK GAAP. Debt instruments
are stated at the amount of net proceeds adjusted to amortise
any discount over the term of the debt.

Criteria to qualify for hedge accounting
The group considers its derivative ﬁnancial instruments to be
hedges when certain criteria are met. For foreign currency
derivatives, the instrument must be related to actual foreign
currency assets or liabilities or a probable commitment whose
characteristics have been identiﬁed. It must involve the same
currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also
reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the
group’s operations. For interest rate derivatives, the instrument
must be related to assets or liabilities or a probable
commitment, such as a future bond issue, and must also change
the interest rate or the nature of the interest rate by converting
a ﬁxed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Accounting for derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Interest differentials, under interest rate swap agreements used
to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on
borrowings are ﬁxed, are recognised by adjustment of net
ﬁnance expense.
The forward exchange contracts used to change the currency
mix of net debt are revalued to balance sheet rates with net
unrealised gains and losses included in current and non current
derivative ﬁnancial instruments. The difference between spot and
forward rate for these contracts is recognised as part of net
ﬁnance expense over the term of the contract.
The forward exchange contracts hedging transaction
exposures are revalued at the prevailing forward rate on the
balance sheet date with net unrealised gains and losses being
shown as current and non-current derivative ﬁnancial
instruments.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND KEY
JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRSs
requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. It
also requires management to exercise its judgement in the
process of applying the group’s accounting policies. We
continually evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgements
based on available information and experience. As the use of
estimates is inherent in ﬁnancial reporting, actual results could
differ from these estimates. The areas involving a higher degree
of judgement or complexity are described below.
Interconnect income and payments to other
telecommunications operators
In certain instances, BT relies on other operators to measure the
trafﬁc ﬂows interconnecting with our networks. Estimates are
used in these cases to determine the amount of income
receivable from or payments we need to make to these other
operators. The prices at which these services are charged are
often regulated and are subject to retrospective adjustment and
estimates are used in assessing the likely effect of these
adjustments.
Providing for doubtful debts
BT provide services to around 18 million individuals and
businesses, mainly on credit terms. We know that certain debts
due to us will not be paid through the default of a small
number of our customers. Estimates, based on our historical
experience are used in determining the level of debts that we
believe will not be collected. These estimates include such
factors as the current state of the economy and particular
industry issues.
Goodwill
The recoverable amount of cash generating units has been
determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations
require the use of estimates, including management’s
expectations of future revenue growth, operating costs and
proﬁt margins for each cash generating unit.
Useful lives for property, plant and equipment
The plant and equipment in BT’s networks is long lived with
cables and switching equipment operating for over ten years and
underground ducts being used for decades. The annual
depreciation charge is sensitive to the estimated service lives
allocated to each type of asset. Asset lives are assessed annually
and changed when necessary to reﬂect current thinking on their
remaining lives in light of technological change, network
investment plans (including the group’s 21CN transformation
programme) prospective economic utilisation and physical
condition of the assets concerned. Changes to service lives of
assets implemented from 1 April 2006 in aggregate had no
signiﬁcant impact on the results for the year ended 31 March
2007.
Property arrangements
As part of the property rationalisation programme we have
identiﬁed a number of surplus properties. Although efforts are
being made to sub-let this space, it is recognised that this may
not be possible immediately in the current economic
environment. Estimates have been made of the cost of vacant
possession and any shortfall arising from the sub lease rental
income being lower than the lease costs being borne by BT. Any
such cost or shortfall has been recognised as a provision.
Long term customer contracts
Long term customer contracts can extend over a number of
ﬁnancial years. During the contractual period, revenue, costs and
proﬁts may be impacted by estimates of the ultimate
proﬁtability of each contract. If, at any time, these estimates
indicate the contract will be unproﬁtable, the entire estimated
loss for the contract is recognised immediately. The group
performs ongoing proﬁtability reviews of its contracts in order to
determine whether the latest estimates are appropriate. Key
factors reviewed include transaction volumes, or other inputs for
which we get paid, future staff and third party costs and
anticipated cost productivity, savings and efﬁciencies.
Pension obligations
BT has a commitment, mainly through the BT Pension Scheme,
to pay pension beneﬁts to approximately 350,000 people over
more than 60 years. The cost of these beneﬁts and the present
value of our pension liabilities depend on such factors as the life
expectancy of the members, the salary progression of our
current employees, the return that the pension fund assets will
generate in the time before they are used to fund the pension
payments and the rate at which the future pension payments
are discounted. We use estimates for all these factors in
determining the pension costs and liabilities incorporated in our
ﬁnancial statements. The assumptions reﬂect historical
experience and our judgement regarding future expectations.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management
judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised. In
particular, judgement is used when assessing the extent to which
deferred tax assets should be recognised with consideration
given to the timing and level of future taxable income.

Income tax
The actual tax we pay on our proﬁts is determined according to
complex tax laws and regulations. Where the effect of these
laws and regulations is unclear, we use estimates in determining
the liability for the tax to be paid on our past proﬁts which we
recognise in our ﬁnancial statements. We believe the estimates,
assumptions and judgements are reasonable but this can involve
complex issues which may take a number of years to resolve.
The ﬁnal determination of prior year tax liabilities could be
different from the estimates reﬂected in the ﬁnancial
statements.
Determination of fair values
Certain ﬁnancial instruments such as investments, derivative
ﬁnancial instruments and certain elements of loans and
borrowings, are carried on the balance sheet at fair value, with
changes in fair value reﬂected in the income statement. Fair
values are estimated by reference in part to published price
quotations and in part by using valuation techniques.
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND
AMENDMENTS TO PUBLISHED STANDARDS ADOPTED
IN THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2007
During the year the following standards which are relevant to
the group’s operations became effective and were adopted:
r Amendment to IAS 21, ‘Net Investment in a Foreign
Operation’
r Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4, ‘Financial Guarantee
Contracts’
r Amendment to IAS 39, ‘Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of
Forecast Intragroup Transactions’
r Amendment to IAS 39, ‘The Fair Value Option’
r IFRIC 4, ‘Determining whether an arrangement contains
a lease’
r IFRIC 6, ‘Liabilities arising from Participating in a Speciﬁc
Market – Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment’
The adoption of these standards has not had a signiﬁcant
impact on the group’s ﬁnancial statements in the year.
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, INTERPRETATION AND
AMENDMENTS TO PUBLISHED STANDARDS NOT YET
EFFECTIVE
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to
existing standards have been published that are mandatory for
the group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April
2007 or later periods, but which the group has not early
adopted. The new standards which are relevant to the group’s
operations are as follows:
IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ (effective
from 1 April 2007) and amendment to IAS 1
‘Presentation of Financial Statements – Capital
Disclosures’ (effective from 1 April 2007)
IFRS 7 introduces new disclosures of qualitative and quantitative
information about exposure to risks arising from ﬁnancial
instruments including speciﬁed minimum disclosures about credit
risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including sensitivity analysis to
market risk. The amendment to IAS 1 introduces disclosures
about the level of an entity’s capital and how it manages
capital. Management is currently assessing the disclosure impact
of IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 on the group’s ﬁnancial
statements.
IFRS 8, ‘Operating Segments’ (effective from 1 April
2009)
IFRS 8 requires the identiﬁcation of operating segments based
on internal reporting to the chief operating decision maker and
extends the scope and disclosure requirements of IAS 14
‘Segmental Reporting’. The group is currently assessing the
impact of IFRS 8 on its segmental analysis disclosure.
Amendment to IAS 23, ‘Borrowing Costs’ (effective
from 1 April 2009)
The amendment to IAS 23 eliminates the option to expense
borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition, construction or
production of a qualifying asset as incurred. As a result, the
group will be required to capitalise such borrowing costs as part
of the cost of that asset. The group is currently assessing the
impact of the amendment upon the results and net assets of the
group.
IFRIC 8, ‘Scope of IFRS 2’ (effective from 1 April
2007)
IFRIC 8 clariﬁes that transactions within the scope of IFRS 2
‘Share Based Payment’ include those in which the entity cannot
speciﬁcally identify some or all of the goods and services
received. The group has assessed the impact of this
interpretation and has concluded it is not likely to have a
signiﬁcant impact on the group’s ﬁnancial statements.
IFRIC 9, ‘Reassessment of embedded derivatives’
(effective from 1 April 2007)
IFRIC 9 clariﬁes that an entity should assess whether an
embedded derivative is required to be separated from the host
contract and accounted for as a derivative when the entity ﬁrst
becomes a party to the contract. Subsequent reassessment is
prohibited unless there is a change in the contract terms, in
which case it is required. The group has assessed the impact of
this interpretation and has concluded it is not likely to have a
signiﬁcant impact on the group’s ﬁnancial statements.
IFRIC 10, ‘Financial Reporting and Impairment’
(effective from 1 April 2007)
IFRIC 10 states that impairment losses recognised in interim
ﬁnancial statements should not be reversed in subsequent
interim or full year ﬁnancial statements. The group has assessed
the impact of this interpretation and has concluded it is not
likely to have a signiﬁcant impact on the group’s ﬁnancial
statements.
IFRIC 11, ‘IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share
Transactions’ (effective from 1 April 2007)
IFRIC 11 provides guidance on whether share based payment
arrangements involving group entities should be accounted for
as cash settled or equity settled. The group has assessed the
impact of this interpretation and has concluded it is not likely to
have a signiﬁcant impact on the group’s ﬁnancial statements.
IFRIC 12, ‘Service Concession Arrangements’ (effective
from 1 April 2008)
IFRIC 12 addresses the accounting by operators of public-private
service concession arrangements. The group has assessed the
impact of this interpretation and has concluded it is not likely to
have a signiﬁcant impact on the group’s ﬁnancial statements.

1. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
Primary reporting format – business segments
The group provides communication services which include networked IT services, local and international telecommunications services
and broadband and internet products and services. The group is organised into four primary business segments; BT Global Services,
BT Retail, BT Wholesale and Openreach.
Each of these four lines of businesses have differing risks, rewards and customer proﬁles and hence are the group’s primary
reporting segments. The revenue of each business segment is derived as follows:
BT Global Services mainly generates its revenue from the provision of networked IT services, outsourcing and system integration
work and traditional ﬁxed line services to multi-site organisations which include the public sector and major corporates and from the
ﬁxed network operations of the group’s worldwide subsidiaries.
BT Retail derives its revenue from the supply of exchange lines and from the calls made over these lines, the leasing of private
circuits and other private services. It also generates revenue from broadband, mobility, data, internet and multimedia services and
from providing managed and packaged communications solutions to consumers and small and medium sized business customers in
the UK.
BT Wholesale derives its revenue from providing network services and solutions to communication companies, including ﬁxed and
mobile network operators and other service providers, and from carrying transit trafﬁc between telecommunications operators.
Openreach derives its revenue from providing equivalent access to the local access network in the UK. Its primary products are
Local Loop Unbundling (LLU), Wholesale Line Rental (WLR), Wholesale Extension Services (WES) and Backhaul Extension Services
(BES). These ‘equivalent’ products are sold to BT lines of business and other communication providers at the same arm’s length
prices, with the BT lines of business being treated no differently than any other customer with regard to terms and conditions or
access to systems and data.
There is extensive trading between BT’s lines of business and the line of business proﬁtability is dependent on the transfer price
levels. For regulated products and services those transfer prices are market based whilst for other products and services the transfer
prices are agreed between the relevant lines of business on an arm’s length basis. These intra-group trading arrangements are
subject to periodic review.
Impact of Openreach on segmental disclosure
Prior to the 2007 ﬁnancial year, the group was organised into three primary segments; BT Global Services, BT Retail and BT
Wholesale. On 22 September 2005, BT entered into the Undertakings with Ofcom as a result of which BT was required to establish a
new line of business and primary segment called Openreach. Openreach was launched operationally on 21 January 2006 and is
separately reported within BT’s results for the ﬁrst time in the 2007 ﬁnancial year.
In accordance with the timetable set out in the Undertakings, the group was required to facilitate the reporting of Openreach as
a separate line of business by the end of July 2006. This was achieved and discrete ﬁnancial information has been presented to
senior management on the new business structure with respect to periods from 1 April 2006 onwards.
Both IFRSs and US GAAP require segmental information to be presented on a consistent basis for all years reported. In the event
of a restructuring of business segments, comparative information is therefore required to be restated, unless this is impracticable.
The results for the 2006 ﬁnancial year have been restated to reﬂect the separate reporting of Openreach as a new business
segment. These restatements also reﬂect the impact of the new internal trading arrangements which have been implemented due to
the creation of Openreach. The results for the 2005 ﬁnancial year, however, have not been restated as it is impracticable to do so.
Some of the products and services that Openreach now sell were previously provided by BT Wholesale, but in a different form. As
a result of the Undertakings, new ‘equivalent products’ which did not previously exist had to be created for both internal and
external customers. The changes required to capture the separate reporting of these new products and services were introduced
during the 2006 ﬁnancial year and therefore actual data was available to support the estimates and assumptions required to restate
the results for that year. The equivalent products and services did not exist in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, and therefore the level of
estimation and extrapolation required to restate the results for that year would have been too signiﬁcant to provide sufﬁciently
objective and reliable information.
Furthermore, the fundamental level of reorganisation and restructuring which occurred, combined with the fact that the products
previously sold by BT Wholesale no longer exist, mean it is also impracticable to report the results for the current ﬁnancial year on
the old business segment structure.
In order to assist the reader’s understanding of the year on year performance, additional disclosures have been presented showing
the previously reported segmental data for the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years on the old business segment basis, prior to the
creation of Openreach.

The group separately identiﬁes and discloses signiﬁcant one-off or unusual items (termed ‘speciﬁc items’). This is consistent with the
way that ﬁnancial performance is measured by management and we believe assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading
results of the group. A deﬁnition of speciﬁc items is provided in the accounting policies section on page 78.

d
In the current year a provision of £30 million (2006: £70 million, 2005: £nil) was recognised for the estimated incremental and directly attributable costs arising from the group’s obligation to set up
Openreach and meet the requirements of the Undertakings.

therefore include a net credit of £1,067 million, which represents those elements of the tax charges previously recognised that were in excess of the final agreed liability of £938 million; interest
income of £139 million on the repayment; and operating costs of £10 million, representing the costs associated with reaching the agreement.
g
In the 2005 financial year the group incurred an impairment charge of £25 million representing its share of a write down of Albacom’s assets prior to Albacom becoming a subsidiary.
h
In the current year the group disposed of 6% of its equity interest in Tech Mahindra Limited, an associated undertaking. The resulting profit on disposal was £22 million. The group’s shareholding at
31 March 2007 was 35%.

On 11 August 2005, the group exercised its option to require early redemption of its US dollar convertible 2008 bond. Bondholders had the option to take redemption proceeds in the form of cash
or shares in the group’s interest in LG Telecom. The majority of bondholders exercised their option to take the redemption proceeds in the form of LG Telecom shares. Other interest in 2006 includes
a net bond redemption gain of £27 million. This reflects the write off of LG Telecom shares of £121 million and the associated release from the available-for-sale reserve of £35 million; the write off
of the bond and transaction costs of £87 million and the associated option liability of £17 million; and the release from the translation reserve of £9 million credit relating to foreign exchange
movements on the investment in LG Telecom to the date of disposal.

8. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the proﬁt attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average
number of shares in issue after deducting the group’s shares held by employee share ownership trusts and treasury shares.
In calculating the diluted earnings per share, share options outstanding and other potential ordinary shares have been taken into
account where the impact of these is dilutive. Options over 12 million shares (2006: 52 million shares, 2005: 207 million shares)
were excluded from the calculation of the total diluted number of shares as the impact of these is anti-dilutive.

2007 were balances of £49 million (2006: £171 million) which had a legally enforceable right of set off against cash balances of
£117 million (2006: £209 million). These balances have not been netted above as settlement is not intended to take place
simultaneously or on a net basis.
10. NET DEBT
Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents. Loans and other
borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt. For the purpose
of this analysis current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to sterling at swapped rates where hedged.
This deﬁnition of net debt measures balances at the expected value of future cash ﬂows due to arise on maturity of ﬁnancial
instruments and removes the balance sheet adjustments made from the re-measurement of hedged risks under fair value hedges
and the use of the amortised cost method as required by IAS 39. In addition, the gross balances are adjusted to take account of
netting arrangements amounting to £49 million (2006: £171 million). Net debt is a non GAAP measure since it is not deﬁned in
IFRSs but it is a key indicator used by management in order to assess operational performance and balance sheet strength.

Impairment tests of goodwill
During the 2007 ﬁnancial year the group made a number of acquisitions. INS, Counterpane and I3IT have been fully integrated into
BT Global Services, which is considered to be the relevant cash generating unit (CGU). The group also acquired dabs.com and
PlusNet, for which the relevant CGUs are considered to be the Enterprises and Consumer divisions of BT Retail, respectively. In
addition, the group reorganised its structure with effect from 1 April 2006 such that the Irish operations were transferred from BT
Global Services to BT Retail and BT Ireland now also represents a separate CGU. For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing,
the group therefore had four relevant CGUs at 31 March 2007. These are the smallest identiﬁable groups of assets that generate
cash inﬂows that have goodwill and are largely independent of the cash inﬂows from other assets or groups of assets.
Goodwill is allocated to the group’s CGUs as follows:
BT Retail
BT Global
Services Consumer Enterprises BT Ireland Total

Exchange differences (20) – – – (20)
At 31 March 2007 691 57 55 16 819
The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations. These are determined using cash ﬂow projections derived
from ﬁnancial budgets approved by the board covering a four year period. They reﬂect management’s expectation of revenue
growth, operating costs and margin for each CGU based on past experience. Cash ﬂows beyond the four year period have been
extrapolated using estimated terminal growth rates ranging from 0% to 2%. These rates have been determined with regard to
projected growth rates for the speciﬁc markets in which the CGU participates and are not considered to exceed the long term
average growth rates for those markets. Discount rates applied to the cash ﬂow forecasts are derived from the group’s pre-tax
weighted average cost of capital for regulated and non-regulated products. The discount rates applied range from 10.0% to 11.4%.
The forecasts are most sensitive to changes in projected revenue growth rates in the ﬁrst four years of the forecast period.
However there is signiﬁcant headroom and based on the sensitivity analysis performed we have concluded that no reasonably
possible changes in the base case assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.

0.25% for each ratings category adjustment by each rating agency. In addition, if Moody’s or S&P subsequently increase the ratings ascribed to the group’s senior unsecured debt, then the interest
rate then payable on notes and the spread applicable to the floating notes will be decreased by 0.25% for each rating category upgrade by each rating agency, but in no event will the interest rate

be recovered after more than twelve months. At 31 March 2007, £1,683 million (2006: £1,505 million) of the deferred tax liability
of £1,683 million (2006: £1,505 million) is expected to be settled after more than twelve months.
At 31 March 2007 the group had operating losses, capital losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of
which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to £21.1 billion (2006: £21.8 billion). The group’s capital losses and other
temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions. The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax
law of the various territories in which the losses arise. A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is
set out below:
Territory
2007
£m
Expiry of
losses
Restricted losses:
Americas 218 2012-2027
Europe 1,226 2007-2022
Total restricted losses 1,444
Unrestricted losses:
Operating losses 1,026 No expiry
Capital losses 17,595 No expiry
Other 1,044 No expiry
Total unrestricted losses 19,665
Total 21,109
At the balance sheet date, the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries was £9.3 billion (2006: £8.6 billion). No deferred tax
liabilities have been recognised in respect of those unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of
the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not
been recognised are insigniﬁcant.

During the year ended 31 March 2007 the company repurchased 147,550,000 (2006: 165,772,145, 2005: 101,280,000) of its own shares of 5p each representing 2% of the called-up share capital,
for consideration (including transaction costs) of £404 million (2006: £365 million, 2005: £195 million). In addition, 66,719,600 shares (2006: 10,221,961, 2005: 11,131,503) were issued from
treasury to satisfy obligations under employee share schemes at a cost of £120 million (2006: £21 million, 2005: £19 million). At 31 March 2007, 370,877,631 shares (2006: 290,047,231) shares
with an aggregate nominal value of £19 million are held as treasury shares at cost.

The cash flow reserve is used to record the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet
occurred.
c
The available-for-sale reserve is used to record the cumulative fair value gains and losses on available-for-sale financial assets. The cumulative gains and losses are recycled to the income statement
on disposal of the assets. The gross gain in the period amounted to £nil (2006: £35 million).
d
The translation reserve is used to record cumulative translation differences on the assets and liabilities of foreign operations. The cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income
statement on disposal of the foreign operation.
e
The merger reserve arose on the group reorganisation that occurred in November 2001 and represents the difference between the nominal value of shares in the new parent company, BT Group plc,
and the share capital, share premium and capital redemption reserve of the prior parent company, British Telecommunications plc. Other reserves included within this caption relate primarily to
unrealised gains and losses on the transfer of assets and group undertakings to a joint venture.

26. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Amounts paid to the group’s retirement beneﬁt plans are set out in note 29. There were a number of transactions during the year
between the company and its subsidiary undertakings, which are eliminated on consolidation and therefore not disclosed.
Key management personnel are deemed to be the members of the Operating Committee which include the company’s executive
directors. It is this committee which has responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the group. Key
management personnel compensation, is shown in the table below:

During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, the group purchased services in the normal course of business and on an arm’s length basis from
its associate Tech Mahindra Limited. The value of services purchased was £178 million (2006: £105 million) and the amounts
outstanding and payable for services at 31 March 2007 was £97 million (2006: £59 million).

Thereafter 7,367 7,175
Total future minimum operating lease payments 9,557 9,782
Operating lease commitments were mainly in respect of land and buildings. Leases have an average term of 24 years and rentals are
ﬁxed for an average of 24 years.
At 31 March 2007, other than disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the
ordinary course of the group’s business and on these no material losses are anticipated. The group has insurance cover to certain
limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O2 UK Limited prior to its demerger with O2 on
19 November 2001. O2 plc has given BT a counterindemnity for these guarantees. The maximum likely exposure is US$82 million
(2006: US$72 million), approximately £39 million (2006: £42 million) as at 31 March 2007, although this could increase by a
further US$486 million (2006: US$545 million), approximately £248 million (2006: £314 million) in the event of credit default in
respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations. The guarantee lasts until O2 UK Limited has discharged all its
obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the
ﬁnancial position or results of operations of the group.
There have been criminal proceedings in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with the Italian
UMTS auction. Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process. On 20 July 2005, the former BT employee
was found not culpable of the fraud charge brought by the Rome Public Prosecutor. All the other defendents were also acquitted. The
Public Prosecutor is in the process of appealing the court’s decision. If the appeal is successful, BT could be held liable, with others, for
any damages. The company has concluded that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such claim.
Following the European Commission’s formal investigation into the way the UK government set BT’s property rates and those paid
by Kingston Communications, and whether the government complied with European Community treaty rules on state aid, the
Commission concluded that no such state aid had been granted. The Commission’s decision has now been appealed, but the
company continues to believe that any allegation of state aid is groundless, and that the appeal will not succeed.

28. ACQUISITIONS continued
The fair value adjustments relating to the acquisition of INS are provisional due to the timing of the transaction and will be ﬁnalised
during the 2008 ﬁnancial year, which will include the identiﬁcation and valuation of any intangible assets acquired through the
transaction. Accordingly, the value of any acquired intangible assets are aggregated within goodwill.
From the date of acquisition, INS has contributed to the group’s results revenue of £5 million and a net loss of £1 million. If the
acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2006, the group’s revenue would have been higher by £63 million, and proﬁt for the year would
have been lower by £5 million (2006: £74 million higher and £5 million lower, respectively).
PlusNet
On 16 November 2006, the group announced an offer to acquire 100% of the share capital of PlusNet plc. The offer became
unconditional on 23 January 2007 once sufﬁcient acceptances had been received from shareholders and all regulatory clearances
were obtained. 23 January 2007 is therefore considered to be the date of acquisition. The net assets acquired in the transaction and
the goodwill arising were as follows:

The fair value adjustments relating to the acquisition of PlusNet are provisional due to the timing of the transaction and will be
ﬁnalised during the 2008 ﬁnancial year, which will include the identiﬁcation and valuation of any intangible assets acquired through
the transaction. Accordingly, the value of any acquired intangible assets are aggregated within goodwill.
From the date of acquisition, PlusNet has contributed to the group’s results revenue of £7 million and a net income of £nil. If the
acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2006, the group’s revenue would have been higher by £7 million, and proﬁt for the year would
have been higher by £3 million (2006: £9 million higher and £1 million higher, respectively).
Other acquisitions
During the year ended 31 March 2007, the group acquired a number of other smaller subsidiary undertakings including principally
dabs.com plc, I3IT Limited and Counterpane LLC. The combined net assets and goodwill arising in respect of these acquisitions were

The fair value adjustments in respect of intangible assets are due to the recognition of £8 million and £4 million in respect of a
brand and customer relationships, respectively. The assessment of the fair value of the net assets of Counterpane LLC are provisional
at 31 March 2007 and will be ﬁnalised during the 2008 ﬁnancial year. This will include the identiﬁcation and valuation of any
intangible assets acquired through the transaction.
From the date of acquisition, the companies have contributed to the group’s results revenue of £180 million and a net proﬁt of
£5 million. If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 April 2006, the group’s revenue would have been higher by £15 million, and proﬁt
for the year would have been lower by £4 million (2006: £159 million higher and £3 million higher, respectively). Goodwill in
respect of these acquisitions comprises principally the fair value of the skills and expertise of the acquired companies’ workforce and
both anticipated revenue and cost synergies.

Atlanet’s net assets were determined on a provisional basis. During the 2007 ﬁnancial year the determination of fair value has been

29. RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
Background
The group offers retirement beneﬁt plans to its employees. The group’s main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS), is a deﬁned
beneﬁt scheme where the beneﬁts are based on employees’ length of service and ﬁnal pensionable pay. This scheme has been
closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 and replaced by a deﬁned contribution scheme, the BT Retirement Plan (BTRP). The
total pension cost of the group for the year, included within staff costs, was £643 million (2006: £603 million, 2005: £540 million).
Deﬁned contribution schemes
The income statement charge in respect of deﬁned contribution schemes represents the contribution payable by the group based
upon a ﬁxed percentage of employees’ pay. The total pension cost for the year in respect of the group’s main deﬁned contribution
scheme was £28 million (2006: £19 million, 2005: £11 million) and £3 million (2006: £2 million, 2005: £1 million) of contributions
were outstanding at 31 March 2007.
Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited administers and manages the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms
of the Trust Deed of the scheme and relevant legislation. Under the terms of the trust deed of the BTPS, there are nine trustee
directors appointed by the group, ﬁve of which appointments are made with the agreement of the relevant trade unions, including
the Chairman of the Trustees. Four trustee directors other than the Chairman are appointed by BT on the nomination of the relevant
trade unions. Two of the trustee directors will normally hold senior positions within the group, and two will normally hold (or have
held) senior positions in commerce or industry. Subject to there being an appropriately qualiﬁed candidate, there should be at least
one current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS as one of the trustee directors. Trustee directors are appointed for a
three-year term, but are then eligible for re-appointment.
Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities – IAS 19
Scheme assets are measured at market value at the balance sheet date. The liabilities of the BTPS are measured by discounting the
best estimate of future cash ﬂows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit method. Estimated future cash ﬂows are
discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of an equivalent term to the liability. Actuarial gains and
losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The ﬁnancial assumptions used to measure the net pension obligation of the BTPS at 31 March 2007 are as follows:
Real rates (per annum) Nominal rates (per annum)
2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005

There is a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 0.5% for the first three years.
The average life expectancy assumptions, after retirement at 60 years of age, are as follows:
2007 2006

The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, ﬁxed interest and index linked securities,
deposits and short-term investments. At 31 March 2007, the UK equities included 14 million (2006: 15 million) ordinary shares of
the company with a market value of £43 million (2006: £33 million). The group occupies two properties owned by the BTPS scheme
on which an annual rental of £0.1 million is payable (2006: £2 million).

The assumption for the expected return on scheme assets is a weighted average based on the assumed expected return for each
asset class and the proportions held of each asset class at the beginning of the year. The expected returns on ﬁxed interest and
interest linked securities are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year. Expected returns on equities and property
are based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above yields on government bonds and consensus economic
forecasts of future returns. The long-term expected rate of return on investments does not affect the level of the obligation but
does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets within the net ﬁnance income.

Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure BTPS scheme liabilities

The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions:

Funding valuation and future funding obligations
A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent scheme trustees by a professionally qualiﬁed independent actuary, using the
projected unit credit method. The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that present and future
contributions should be sufﬁcient to meet future liabilities. The funding valuation is performed at 31 December as this is the
ﬁnancial year end of the BTPS.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows:
– scheme assets are valued at market value at the valuation date; and,
– scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value.
The last three triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions:
Real rates (per annum) Nominal rates (per annum)

There is a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 1.25% for the first three years.
At 31 December 2005, the assets of the BTPS had a market value of £34.4 billion (2002: £22.8 billion) and were sufﬁcient to cover
90.9% (2002: 91.6%) of the beneﬁts accrued by that date. This represented a funding deﬁcit of £3.4 billion compared to £2.1 billion
at 31 December 2002. The funding valuation uses conservative assumptions whereas, had the valuation been based on the actuary’s
view of the median estimate basis the scheme would have been in surplus. The market value of equity investments had increased
and the investment income and contributions received by the scheme exceeded the beneﬁts paid. In the three years ended
31 December 2005, however, the deﬁcit had not improved by the same amount as the assets because the liabilities included longer
life expectancy assumptions and used a lower discount rate.
Following the valuation the ordinary contributions rate increased to 19.5% of pensionable salaries (including employee
contributions of 6%) from 18.2%, with effect from 1 January 2007. In addition, the group will make deﬁciency payments equivalent
to £280 million per annum for ten years. The ﬁrst three years’ instalments are to be paid up front; £520 million was paid in the
2007 ﬁnancial year and £320 million was paid in April 2007. Subsequently, annual payments of £280 million will be made, with the
next payment due in December 2009. This compared to annual deﬁciency payments of £232 million that were determined under the
2002 funding valuation.
In the year ended 31 March 2007, the group made regular contributions of £402 million (2006: £396 million). Deﬁciency
contributions of £520 million were also made (2006: £54 million), and a further £320 million was paid in April 2007. Accordingly
no further deﬁciency payments are due until after the 31 December 2008 valuation.

29. RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS continued
The intention is for there to be sufﬁcient assets in the scheme to pay pensions now and in the future. Without any further
contribution from the company, it is estimated that as at 31 December 2005, the assets of the scheme would have been sufﬁcient
to provide around 70% of the members’ beneﬁts with an insurance company.
If the group were to become insolvent, however, there are a number of additional protections available to members. Firstly, there
is the Crown Guarantee which was granted when the group was privatised in 1984. This applies, on a winding up of the group, to
pension entitlements for anyone who joined the scheme before 6 August 1984, and to payments to beneﬁciaries of such persons.
Secondly, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) may take over the scheme and pay certain beneﬁts to members. There are limits on the
amounts paid by the PPF and this would not give exactly the same beneﬁts as those provided by the scheme.
Under the terms of the trust deed that governs the BTPS, the group is required to have a funding plan that should address the
deﬁcit over a maximum period of 20 years. The agreed funding plan addresses the deﬁcit over a period of ten years. The BTPS was
closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and the age proﬁle of active members will consequently increase. Under the projected
unit credit method, the current service cost, as a proportion of the active members’ pensionable salaries, is expected to increase as
the members of the scheme approach retirement. Despite the scheme being closed to new entrants, the projected payment proﬁle
extends over more than 60 years.

31. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The total charge recognised in the 2007 ﬁnancial year in respect of share based payments was £93 million (2006: £76 million,
2005: £50 million). The total fair value to be recognised over the vesting period of share options and awards granted in the 2007
ﬁnancial year was £92 million (2006: £105 million, 2005: £88 million).
The company has an employee share investment plan and savings-related share option plans for its employees and those of
participating subsidiaries, further share option plans for selected employees and an employee stock purchase plan for employees in
the United States. It also has several share plans for executives. All share based payment plans are equity settled and details of these
plans are provided below.

Share option plans
BT Group Employee Sharesave plans
There is an HM Revenue and Customs approved savings related share option plan, under which employees save on a monthly basis,
over a three or ﬁve year period, towards the purchase of shares at a ﬁxed price determined when the option is granted. This price is
usually set at a 20% discount to the market price for ﬁve year plans and 10% for three year plans. The options must be exercised
within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse. Options are granted annually, usually in June. Similar
plans operate for BT’s overseas employees.
Employees may cancel sharesave options and remain employed by the group. In such cases the options so cancelled do not vest
and the monthly savings contributions are returned to the employee, with interest if applicable. Such events are accounted for by
ceasing to record a share based payments charge from the date of the employee’s withdrawal from the relevant plan. Previously
recorded share based payment charges are not reversed, and no charge is made for the accelerated vesting of future options that
will not now vest.
For options outstanding at 31 March 2007, 2006 and 2005, the weighted average exercise prices are shown below.

The weighted average remaining contractual life of options exercisable at 31 March 2007 was 4 months (2006: nil, 2005: 5 months).
The intrinsic value of options exercisable at 31 March 2007 was £2 million (2006: £nil; 2005: £nil).
Options were exercised regularly throughout the year. The weighted average share price during the year was 265p (2006: 205p,
2005: 183p).
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year was £36.5 million (2006: £0.7 million, 2005: £nil). The intrinsic
value of options outstanding at 31 March 2007 was £378 million (2006: £155 million; 2005: £105 million).
The weighted average fair value of savings related options granted during the 2007 ﬁnancial year has been estimated on the date
of grant using a binomial option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used in that model: an expected
life extending three months later than the ﬁrst exercise date; share price at date of grant of 229p (2006: 223p, 2005: 195p);
estimated annualised dividend yield of approximately 5.5% (2006: 5%, 2005: 5%); risk free interest rates of approximately 5%
(2006: 4%, 2005: 5%) and expected volatility of approximately 17% (2006: 25%, 2005: 25%). Volatility has been determined by
reference to BT’s historical volatility over a three year period, which is expected to reﬂect the BT share price in the future. The
exercise prices are 202p (2006: 192p, 2005: 165p) for Sharesave options exercisable three years after the date of grant and 179p
(2006: 171p, 2005: 146p) for Sharesave options exercisable ﬁve years after the date of grant. The weighted average fair value of
Sharesave options granted in the 2007 ﬁnancial year was 35p (2006: 44p, 2005: 41p) for Sharesave options exercisable three years
after the date of grant and 45p (2006: 55p, 2005: 52p) for Sharesave options exercisable ﬁve years after the date of grant.
Options granted under BT’s international sharesave, which is a three year plan, have been valued using the same assumptions. The
exercise price is 179p (2006: 171p, 2005: 146p). The weighted average fair value of these share options is 46p (2006: 49p, 2005:
52p). The share price at the date of grant was 229p (2006: 214p, 2005: 195p).
BT Group Global Share Option Plan (GSOP)
There were no options granted under the GSOP in the 2007 ﬁnancial year. The options granted in previous years will be exercisable
subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets. These options were valued using Monte Carlo
simulations. The weighted average fair value of options granted under the 2005 GSOP was estimated as 36p. The following
weighted average assumptions were used in that model: dividend yield of 5%, expected volatility of 25% and a risk free interest rate
of 4%. Details of this plan are provided in the share options section of the Report on directors’ remuneration.
BT Group Legacy Option Plan
On the demerger of O2, BT’s share option plans ceased to operate and were replaced by similar BT Group Employee Sharesave plans
and the BT Group Global Share Option Plan.

31. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS continued
The BT Group Legacy Option Plan was launched on 17 December 2001 following the scheme of arrangement and demerger of O2 in
November 2001, and is therefore outside the scope of IFRS 2. Replacement unapproved options over BT Group shares were granted
to all participants in the executive option plans who had released their options over British Telecommunications plc shares. The value
of the replacement options was determined by averaging the combined prices of BT Group plc and O2 plc shares over the 20
dealing days following the demerger on 19 November 2001. This resulted in a factor of 1.3198 being applied to the former option
over British Telecommunications plc shares in order to give the number of BT Group shares under the new option. The option prices
of the original options were also adjusted to take account of the different number of shares under option. The options are
exercisable subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets, on the third anniversary of the date of
grant.

Incentive Share Plan, Deferred Bonus Plan and Retention Share Plan
The BT Group Incentive Share Plan (ISP) and the BT Group Retention Share Plan (RSP) were introduced for employees of the group
in 2001. Under the plans, company shares are conditionally awarded to participants.
Under the ISP, participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three year period if the company has met the
relevant pre-determined corporate performance measure and if the participants are still employed by the group. The corporate
performance measure is BT’s total shareholder return (TSR) measured against a comparator group of companies from the European
Telecom Sector at the beginning of the relevant performance period. The ISP operated in the 2007 ﬁnancial year with 1,507
participants granted awards over 24.9 million shares (2006: 1,382 participants were granted awards over 23.2 million shares, 2005;
1,406 participants were granted awards over 12.6 million shares). Awards under the ISP have been valued using Monte Carlo
simulations. TSRs were generated for BT and the comparator group at the end of the three year performance period, using each
company’s volatility and dividend yield, as well as the cross correlation between pairs of stocks. The weighted average fair value of
awards granted under the ISP for the 2007 ﬁnancial year was 127p (2006: 123p, 2005: 98p). Awards under the ISP were valued by
reference to the weighted average market price of the shares on the date of grant of 230p (2006: 222p, 2005: 195p). Historical
dividend yields of 5.5% (2006: 4.1%, 2005: 5%), volatility of 17% (2006: 24%, 2005: 25%) and a risk free rate of 5% (2006: 4%,
2005: 4%) were used in the simulations.
Under the RSP, the length of retention period before awards vest is ﬂexible. Awards may vest annually in tranches. The shares are
transferred at the end of a speciﬁed period, only if the employee is still employed by the group. During the 2007 ﬁnancial year
participants were granted awards over 0.8 million shares (2006; 1.8 million shares; 2005: 1.6 million shares). Awards under the RSP
were valued using the average middle market share price for the three days prior to grant date. The weighted average share price
for awards granted in the 2007 ﬁnancial year was 267p (2006: 216p, 2005: 182p). During the 2007 ﬁnancial year 1.2 million
shares vested in 11 participants in the RSP (2006: 1.1 million shares vested in 16 participants, 2005: 2.0 million shares vested in 11
participants).
The BT Group Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) was established in 1998 and awards are granted annually to selected employees of the
group. Under this plan, shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be
employed by the group throughout that period. During the 2007 ﬁnancial year participants were granted awards over 5.8 million
shares (2006; 2.3 million shares; 2005: 2.9 million shares). Awards under the DBP were valued using the average middle market
share price for the three days prior to grant date which was 232p (2006: 223p, 2005: 193p). During the 2007 ﬁnancial year 2.9
million shares (2006: 2.0 million shares, 2005: 0.6 million shares) were transferred to 184 (2006: 193, 2005: 219) participants at
the end of the three year period.

conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential beneﬁt of the participants.
At 31 March 2007, 15.6 million shares (2006: 21.4 million, 2005: 23.3 million) were held in trust and 57.8 million shares (2006:
27.4 million, 2005: 0.2 million) were held in treasury for employee share plans and other share based payment plans.
Employee Share Investment Plan
The BT Group Employee Share Investment Plan (ESIP) has been in operation since December 2001. The ESIP, which has been
approved by HM Revenue and Customs, comprises ‘directshare’ and ‘allshare’. Under directshare, UK employees are given an
opportunity to purchase shares (partnership shares) out of pre-tax salary up to a maximum value of £1,500 per year. During the
2007 ﬁnancial year, 6.3 million shares (2006: 6.4 million shares, 2005: 6.1 million shares), including 1.0 million shares (2006:
0.8 million shares, 2005: 0.2 million shares) purchased by dividend reinvestment, were purchased by the Trustee of the ESIP on
behalf of 15,445 (2006: 14,443, 2005: 13,017) employees at a total cost of £14.3 million (2006: £13.7 million, 2005: £11.7
million). Allshare, the free shares element of the ESIP allows BT to provide free shares to UK employees which are held in trust for
at least three years. Employees outside the UK receive the same awards of shares where practicable, otherwise they will receive
awards equivalent to the value of the free shares. In 2007 1% (2006: 1%, 2005: 0.5%) of pre-tax proﬁts, amounting to £25
million, was allocated to Allshare (2006: £22 million, 2005: £11 million). Up to 2% of pre-tax proﬁts would have been available
subject to meeting two corporate performance targets; one of these to maintain earnings per share at the same level as in the 2006
ﬁnancial year, and the other to have ﬁve percent more customers very or extremely satisﬁed with BT (provided the percentage of
customers who are dissatisﬁed did not increase compared with the 2006 ﬁnancial year). The earnings per share target was met but
not the one for customer satisfaction. From the 2008 ﬁnancial year onwards, Allshare will be replaced by free BT Total Broadband
Option 3 for all BT employees in the UK.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The BT Group Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), for employees in the US, enables participants to purchase American Depositary
Shares (ADSs) quarterly at a price (the Initial Base Option Price) which is 85% of the fair market price of an ADS at the start of the
Initial Enrolment Period of, in the case of employees who enrol in the ESPP after the Initial Enrolment Period, 85% of the fair
market price of an ADS on the last business day of the calendar quarter immediately following enrolment. From 15 May 2006 to
15 May 2007 2,070,190 shares (207,019 ADSs) have been transferred to participants out of treasury under the ESPP (from 15 May
2005 to 15 May 2006 1,750,560 shares (175,056 ADSs); from 15 May 2004 to 15 May 2005 934,782 shares (93,478 ADS’s)). The
fourth offer, with an Initial Base Option Price of US$32.52 ended in December 2006. A ﬁfth offer was launched in December 2006
with an Initial Base Option Price of US$46.00 and will expire in December 2008.
Openreach
In the Undertakings given to Ofcom on 22 September 2005, BT agreed that the incentive elements of the remuneration of
employees within Openreach should be linked to Openreach performance rather than BT targets or share price. However Openreach
employees are allowed to participate in the BT HMRC approved all-employee share plans on the same terms as other BT employees.

31. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS continued
Therefore in order to comply with the Undertakings, during the 2007 ﬁnancial year BT offered a cash alternative to 102 Openreach
employees holding BT share options and awards in the 2004 and 2005 ISP and the 2004 GSOP. The cash alternative is payable to
the employees at the time the options and awards would normally vest and remains subject to the employees continuing in
employment throughout the vesting period. Those employees who declined the cash alternative will continue to be entitled to
exercise their awards in accordance with the original vesting timetable. The impact of this modiﬁcation did not have a signiﬁcant
impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. New arrangements were also introduced for Openreach employees during the 2007
ﬁnancial year whereby long term incentive arrangements are linked to Openreach targets and will be paid in cash instead of shares
and hence are neither equity settled or cash settled share based payment arrangements.
32. AUDIT AND NON AUDIT SERVICES

The audit fee of the company was £38,600 (2006: £37,700, 2005: £35,000).
In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Board has determined policies as to what non audit services
can be provided by the company’s external auditors and the approval processes related to them. Under those policies work of a
consultancy nature will not be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear efﬁciencies and value added beneﬁts to the
company. All non audit services are approved by the Audit Committee.
‘Audit services’ represents fees payable for services in relation to the audit of the parent company and the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements and also includes fees for reports under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which is required for the ﬁrst
time for the year ended 31 March 2007.
‘Other services pursuant to legislation’ represents fees payable for services in relation to other statutory ﬁlings or engagements
that are required to be carried out by the company’s auditor. In particular, this includes fees for audit reports issued on the group’s
regulatory ﬁnancial statements.
‘Tax services’ represents fees payable for tax compliance and advisory services.
‘Services relating to corporate ﬁnance transactions’ represent fees payable in relation to due diligence work completed on
acquisitions.
‘All other services’ represents fees payable for non-regulatory reporting on internal controls and other advice on accounting
matters.
33. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The group adopted IAS 32, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ and IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement’ with effect from 1 April 2005. Financial information was previously prepared under UK GAAP for the ﬁnancial year
ended 31 March 2005. Where applicable, information for the comparative period has been separately disclosed below in order to
comply with the previous requirements of UK GAAP.
The group issues or holds ﬁnancial instruments mainly to ﬁnance its operations; for the temporary investment of short-term
funds; and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of ﬁnance. In addition,
various ﬁnancial instruments, for example trade receivables and trade payables, arise directly from the group’s operations.
The group ﬁnances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained proﬁts, deferred taxation, long-term
loans and short-term loans, principally by issuing commercial paper supported by committed borrowing facilities. The group borrows
in the major long-term debt markets in major currencies. Typically, but not exclusively, the bond markets provide the most cost-
effective means of long-term borrowing. The group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to market
risks from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates against these borrowings. The derivatives used for this purpose are
principally interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The group also uses ﬁnancial instruments to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from its overseas short-term investment
funds and other non-UK assets, liabilities and forward purchase commitments. The ﬁnancial instruments used comprise borrowings in
foreign currencies and forward currency contracts.

33. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT continued
The group does not hold or issue derivative ﬁnancial instruments for trading purposes. All transactions in derivative ﬁnancial
instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
The group’s proﬁle of borrowings and short-term funds is managed with consideration of the cash ﬂow from operations. These
borrowings and short term funds are managed by the centralised treasury operation. The types of ﬁnancial instrument used for
investment of short term funds are prescribed in group treasury policies with limits on the exposure to any one organisation.
Short term investment in ﬁnancial instruments is partially undertaken on behalf of the group by substantial external fund managers
who are limited to dealing in debt instruments and certain deﬁned derivative instruments and are given strict guidelines on credit,
diversiﬁcation and maturity proﬁles.
The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity, funding, investment and the group’s
ﬁnancial risk, including risk from volatility in currency and interest rates and counterparty credit risk. The treasury operation is not a
proﬁt centre and the objective is to manage risk at optimum cost.
The Board sets the policy for the group’s centralised treasury operation and its activities are subject to a set of controls
commensurate with the magnitude of the borrowings and investments under its management. Counterparty credit risk is closely
monitored and managed within controls set by the Board.
During the year ended 31 March 2007, the group’s net debt (note 10) increased from £7.5 billion to £7.9 billion mainly due to
outﬂows arising on investing activities such as capital expenditure and acquisitions, and from ﬁnancing activities such as dividend
and net interest payments which more than offset inﬂows mainly arising from operating activities. During the 2007 ﬁnancial year,
debt amounting to £1.1 billion matured consisting of the 2006 sterling 7.375% notes, ﬁnance leases and other sterling ﬂoating rate
loans and notes. This was offset by increased holdings of commercial paper and lower current ﬁnancial assets and cash and cash
equivalent investments.
During the year ended 31 March 2006 the group’s net debt (note 10) reduced from £7.9 billion to £7.5 billion mainly due to
operational and working capital inﬂows. During the 2006 ﬁnancial year two substantial notes matured, namely the 2005 US dollar
7.875% notes and 2006 Euro 6.375% notes amounting to £3.8 billion and were primarily funded from current ﬁnancial assets and
cash and cash equivalents. The group utilised its commercial paper programme during the year, which was supported by a
committed borrowing facility, as well as raising a sterling ﬂoating rate borrowing of £1 billion.
There has been no change in the nature of the group’s risk proﬁle between 31 March 2007 and the date of these ﬁnancial
statements.
Interest rate risk management
The group has interest bearing ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities. The group’s policy is to ensure that at least 70% of net debt is
at ﬁxed rates. In order to manage this proﬁle, the group has entered into interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks and
other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are ﬁxed. Under interest rate swaps, the
group agrees with other parties to exchange, at speciﬁed intervals, the differences between ﬁxed rate and ﬂoating rate interest
amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
The majority of the group’s long-term borrowings have been, and are, subject to ﬁxed sterling interest rates after applying the
impact of hedging instruments. At 31 March 2007, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with notional principal
amounts totalling £5.1 billion (2006: £5.1 billion).
At 31 March 2007, the group’s ﬁxed:ﬂoating interest rate proﬁle, after hedging, on net debt was 75:25 (2006: 85:15).
Based on the composition of net debt at 31 March 2007, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the
group’s annual net ﬁnance expense by approximately £11 million (2006: £10 million).
Foreign exchange risk management
The purpose of the group’s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that the eventual net inﬂows
and net outﬂows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
Most of the group’s current revenue is invoiced in pounds sterling, and most of its operations and costs arise within the UK. The
group’s foreign currency borrowings which totalled £5.3 billion at 31 March 2007 (2006: £5.4 billion), are used to ﬁnance its
operations. These borrowings have been predominantly swapped to sterling. Cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts
have been entered into to reduce the foreign currency exposure on the group’s operations and the group’s net assets. The group
also enters into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency investments, interest expense, capital purchases and purchase
and sale commitments on a selective basis. The commitments hedged are principally US dollar and euro denominated. As a result of
these policies, the group’s exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on the residual currency exposure on its non-UK investments in
its subsidiaries and on imbalances between the value of outgoing and incoming international calls.
A 10% strengthening in sterling against major currencies would cause the group’s net assets at 31 March 2007 to fall by less
than £220 million (2006: £150 million), with an insigniﬁcant effect on the group’s proﬁts.
At 31 March 2007, the group had outstanding contracts to sell or purchase foreign currency with a total gross notional principal
of £6.1 billion (2006: £6.4 billion). The majority of these instruments were cross currency swaps with a remaining term ranging from
2 months to 24 years. The notional value of forward currency contracts included in the gross notional principal at 31 March 2007
were £1,297 million (2006: £809 million) for purchases of currency and £2 million (2006: £781 million) for sales of currency. The
forward currency contracts had a term remaining ranging from 2 to 321 days.

33. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT continued
Credit risk management
The group considers that it is not exposed to major concentrations of credit risk. The group, however, is exposed to credit-related
losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to ﬁnancial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to
meet their obligations. The group limits the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. Where multiple transactions are
undertaken with a single counterparty, or group of related counterparties, the group may enter into a netting arrangement to
reduce the group’s exposure to credit risk. Currently the group makes use of standard International Swaps and Derivative Association
(ISDA) documentation. In addition, where the group has a legal right of set off and the ability and intention to settle net, the
relevant assets and liabilities are netted within the balance sheet. The group seeks collateral or other security where it is considered
necessary.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the group’s ﬁnancial assets at 31 March 2007 and 31 March 2006 is represented by the
amounts reported under the corresponding balance sheet headings.
Liquidity risk management
The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into long and short term ﬁnancial instruments to support operational and
other funding requirements. The group’s liquidity and funding management process includes projecting cash ﬂows and considering
the level of liquid assets in relation thereto, monitoring balance sheet liquidity and maintaining a diverse range of funding sources
and back-up facilities. Liquid assets surplus to immediate operating requirements of the group are generally invested and managed
by the centralised treasury function. Requirements of group companies for operating ﬁnance are met whenever possible from central
resources. The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate committed borrowing facilities. During the year the group
utilised its commercial paper programme which was supported by a committed borrowing facility of up to £1,500 million (2006:
£1,500 million). The facility is available for a period of ﬁve years. The group had additional committed borrowing facilities of £2,035
million (2006: £35 million). This amount includes a facility of £2,000 million (2006: £nil) and is available for one year with an
extension option for a future year. Reﬁnancing risk is managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any
speciﬁed period.
Price risk management
The group has limited exposure to equity securities price risk on investments held by the group.
Hedging activities
The group entered into a combination of interest rate and cross currency swaps designated as a combination of fair value and cash
ﬂow hedges in order to hedge certain risks associated with the group’s US dollar and euro borrowings. The risks being hedged
consist of currency cash ﬂows associated with future interest and principal payments and the fair value risk of certain elements of
borrowings arising from ﬂuctuations in currency rates and interest rates.
At 31 March 2007, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements in cash ﬂow hedges against borrowings with a total
notional principal amount of £3.2 billion (2006: £3.2 billion). The fair value of these interest rate swaps at the balance sheet date
comprised assets of £15 million and liabilities of £234 million (2006: £405 million). The interest rate swaps have a remaining term
ranging from four to 24 years (2006: four to 25 years) to match the underlying hedged cash ﬂows arising on the borrowings
consisting of annual and semi-annual interest payments. The interest receivable under these swap contracts are at a weighted
average rate of 5.5% (2006: 4.6%) and interest payable are at a weighted average rate of 5.9% (2006: 5.9%).
At 31 March 2007, the group had outstanding cross currency swap agreements in cash ﬂow and fair value hedges against
borrowings with a total notional principal amount of £4.8 billion (2006: £4.8 billion). The fair value of these cross currency swaps at
the balance sheet date comprised assets of £10 million (2006: £32 million) and liabilities of £833 million (2006: £433 million). The
cross currency swaps have a remaining term ranging from two months to 24 years (2006: one to 25 years) to match the underlying
hedged borrowings consisting of annual and semi-annual interest payments and the repayment of principal amounts. The interest
receivable under these swap contracts are at a weighted average rate of 6.9% (2006: 6.9%) for euro cross currency swaps and 8.2%
(2006: 8.2%) for dollar cross currency swaps and interest payable are at a weighted average rate of 9.2% (2006: 8.5%).
Forward currency contracts have been designated as cash ﬂow hedges of currency cash ﬂows associated with certain euro and US
dollar step up interest payments on bonds. At 31 March 2007, the group had outstanding forward currency contracts with a total
notional principal amount of £205 million (2006: £77 million). The fair value of the forward currency contracts at the balance sheet
date comprised an asset of £1 million (2006: £1 million) and had a remaining term of between three and 11 months (2006: three
and 11 months) after which they will be rolled into new contracts. The hedged interest cash ﬂows arise on a semi-annual basis and
extend over a period of up to 24 years (2006: 12 years).
Forward currency contracts have been designated as cash ﬂow hedges of currency cash ﬂows associated with certain euro and US
dollar commercial paper issues. At 31 March 2007, the group had outstanding forward currency contracts with a total notional
principal amount of £760 million (2006: £434 million). The fair value of the forward currency contracts at the balance sheet date
comprised assets of £15 million (2006: £6 million) and had a remaining term of less than three months (2006: less than two
months) to match the cash ﬂows on maturity of the underlying commercial paper.

33. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT continued
Forward currency contracts have been designated as cash ﬂow hedges against currency cash ﬂows associated with the forecast
purchase of ﬁxed assets and invoice cash ﬂows arising on certain dollar denominated supplies. At 31 March 2007, the group had
outstanding forward currency contracts with a total notional principal amount of £2 million (2006: £6 million) for sales of currency
and £165 million (2006: £197 million) for purchases of currency. The fair value of forward currency contracts at the balance sheet
date comprised liabilities of £3 million (2006: £nil) and had a remaining term of less than one month (2006: less than one month)
after which they will be rolled into new contracts. The forecast cash ﬂows are anticipated to arise over a period of one month to six
years (2006: one month to six years) from the balance sheet date.
The group has hedged currency cash ﬂows associated with US dollar denominated investments using forward currency contracts.
At 31 March 2007, the group had outstanding forward currency contracts with a total notional principal amount of £nil (2006:
£759 million). The fair value of the forward foreign currency contracts at the balance sheet date comprised liabilities of £nil (2006:
£5 million with a remaining term of less than one month).
Other derivatives
At 31 March 2007, the group held certain foreign currency forward and interest rate swap contracts that were not in hedging
relationships in accordance with IAS 39. Foreign currency forward contracts were economically hedging operational purchases and
sales and had a notional principal amount of £nil for sales of currency (2006: £16 million) and £167 million for purchases of
currency (2006: £101 million) and had a maturity period of under nine months (2006: under 12 months). Interest rate swaps not in
hedging relationships under IAS 39 had a notional principal amount of £1.9 billion (2006: £1.9 billion) and mature between 2014
and 2030 (2006: 2014 and 2030). The interest receivable under these swap contracts are at a weighted average rate of 6.5%
(2006: 6.1%) and interest payable are at a weighted average rate of 8.1% (2006: 7.7%). The volatility arising from these swaps is
recognised through the income statement but is limited due to a natural offset in their valuation movements.
At 31 March 2006, the group recognised the fair value of an option contained in a supplier contract which required separate
recognition. In addition, two embedded derivatives expired during the year. The ﬁrst related to an option exercisable on the group’s
US dollar convertible bond (see note 5) and the second related to a put option whose value was based on an underlying interest
differential between sterling ﬁxed and ﬂoating interest rates.
Fair value of ﬁnancial instruments
The following table discloses the carrying amounts and fair values of all of the group’s ﬁnancial instruments which are not carried at
an amount which approximates to its fair value on the balance sheet at 31 March 2007 and 2006. The carrying amounts are
included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings. The fair value of the ﬁnancial instruments are the amounts at
which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or
sale. In particular, the fair values of listed investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments. The
carrying amount of the short-term deposits and investments approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the
investments held. The carrying amount of trade receivables and payables approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity
of the amounts receivable and payable. The fair value of the group’s bonds, debentures, notes, ﬁnance leases and other long-term
borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where
they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash ﬂows using the appropriate discount rates in effect at the
balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist. The fair value of the group’s outstanding swaps and foreign
exchange contracts where the estimated amounts, calculated using discounted cash ﬂow models, that the group would receive or
pay in order to terminate such contracts in an arms length transaction taking into account market rates of interest and foreign
exchange at the balance sheet date.

34. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
In April 2007, we announced a new structure that will deliver faster, more resilient and cost effective services to customers wherever
they are. With effect from 1 July 2007, BT Design will be responsible for the design and development of the platforms, systems and
processes, which will support our services; BT Operate will be responsible for their deployment and operation. Around 20,000
employees – from design, operations, IT and networks – will move into these new units. We estimate that the reorganisation and
transformation activities will result in restructuring costs of around £450 million which is expected to generate a pay back within
two to three years. These activities will include developing new processes and systems, re-skilling and leaver costs which will be
accommodated within existing policies and by voluntary means. We expect the majority of these costs to be incurred in the 2008
ﬁnancial year and to be classiﬁed as a speciﬁc item in our 2008 results.

35. UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
The group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union (IFRS), which differ in certain respects from those applicable in the United States. For BT there are
no differences between IFRS as adopted for use in the EU and IFRS as published by the IASB.
(I) DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IFRS AND UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
(US GAAP)
The following are the main differences between IFRS and US GAAP which are relevant to the group’s consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.
(a) Sale and leaseback of properties
Under IFRS, the sale of BT’s property portfolio in 2001 is treated as a disposal and the vast majority of the subsequent leaseback is
an operating lease. Under US GAAP as BT has a continuing interest in the properties, these properties are recorded on the balance
sheet at their net book value, a leasing obligation is recognised and the gain on disposal is deferred until the properties are sold and
vacated by BT and the corresponding lease obligation is terminated. Rental payments made by BT are reversed and replaced by a
ﬁnance lease interest and a depreciation charge.
(b) Pensions
Under IFRS, the group accounts for its pension beneﬁt plans according to IAS 19 ‘Employee Beneﬁts’. Surpluses and deﬁcits of
pension and other post-retirement beneﬁt plans are included in the group balance sheet at their fair values and all movements in
these balances are reﬂected in the income statement, except for those actuarial gains and losses which are reﬂected in the
statement of recognised income and expense. The over or underfunded status of the deﬁned beneﬁt plan is recorded as an asset or
liability on the balance sheet.
Prior to the adoption of FAS 158 ‘Employers Accounting for Deﬁned Beneﬁt Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans, an
amendment of FASB Statements No 87, 88, 106 and 132 (R)’ (‘ ‘FAS 158’ ’), when a pension plan had an accumulated beneﬁt
obligation which exceeded the fair value of the plan assets, FAS 87 required the unfunded amount to be recognised as a minimum
liability in the balance sheet under US GAAP. The offset to the liability was recorded as an intangible asset up to the amount of any
unrecognised prior service cost, and thereafter directly in other comprehensive income. The actuarial gains or losses recognised in
other comprehensive income were transferred to net income over the average remaining service period if certain thresholds were
met.
FAS 158 requires an employer to recognise the over or underfunded status of a deﬁned beneﬁt post-retirement plan as an asset
or liability and to recognise changes in that funded status in other comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur.
Because the funded status of beneﬁt plans are now fully recognised, a minimum liability is no longer recognised. Retrospective
application of FAS 158 is not permitted and upon adoption of FAS 158, the recognition of the over or underfunded status of the
group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans is generally consistent with IAS 19. Differences in recognition rules for actuarial gains and
losses will continue to give rise to differences in periodic pension expense as measured under IFRS and US GAAP. The group has
adopted FAS 158 in full with effect from 31 March 2007.
(c) Capitalisation of interest
Under IFRS, the group has chosen not to capitalise interest. Under US GAAP, the estimated amount of interest incurred whilst
constructing major capital projects is included in property, plant and equipment, and depreciated over the lives of the related assets.
The amount of interest capitalised is determined by reference to the average interest rates on outstanding borrowings. The
capitalised interest is depreciated over a period of 5 to 27 years determined by the nature of the related asset.
(d) Financial instruments
The group exercised the exemption available under IFRS 1 to adopt IAS 32, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ and
IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ from 1 April 2005. The 2005 comparative period is therefore
presented in accordance with UK GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, investments are held on the balance sheet at historical cost. Gains and losses on instruments used for hedges are
not recognised until the exposure being hedged is recognised. Certain derivative ﬁnancial instruments which qualify for hedge
accounting under UK GAAP do not qualify or were not designated as hedges under US GAAP.
From 1 April 2005 the group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 which gave rise to differences in accounting treatments applied under
US GAAP SFAS No. 133 ‘Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities’. On adoption of IAS 39, all derivative
ﬁnancial instruments and the fair value of the hedged risks, where a hedged item is in a fair value hedge, were recognised as a one
time transition adjustment to equity and resulted in a transitional difference between US GAAP and IFRS.
Under IFRS, certain cash ﬂow hedges result in a hedged non-ﬁnancial asset or liability being adjusted from the equity reserve for
the applicable hedged amount. US GAAP does not allow the amounts taken to equity to be transferred to the initial carrying amount
of the non-ﬁnancial asset or liability. The amounts remain in equity and are recognised in earnings as the non-ﬁnancial asset is
depreciated or disposed.
The group did not apply hedge accounting under US GAAP for certain items designated as hedges under IFRS. As a result, certain
gains or losses on derivatives held in the cash ﬂow reserve or translation reserve are credited or charged to the income statement
under US GAAP. In addition, under IFRS, the hedged risk associated with a hedged item is fair valued where the item has been
designated in a fair value hedge. As hedge accounting has not been claimed for those items under US GAAP, this fair value
adjustment will not be reﬂected. These differences will reverse as the derivatives or hedged items mature, are sold or expire.
The fair value and book value of derivative instruments as at 31 March 2007 and 2006 is disclosed in note 33.

35. UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued
IFRS prescribes four investment categories, namely held for trading, available-for-sale, loans and receivables and held to maturity.
US GAAP prescribes only three categories, namely held for trading, available-for-sale and held to maturity. Whilst the held for
trading and available-for-sale categories are similar under both GAAPs, items held in loans and receivables under IFRS are generally
classiﬁed as held to maturity under US GAAP.
(e) Foreign exchange
Under US GAAP, on the sale of a foreign enterprise, foreign exchange differences within the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA)
are included in net income in arriving at a gain or loss on disposal. Although IFRS also requires inclusion of the cumulative
translation differences held in reserves as part of the calculation of gains or losses on disposal, they were reset to zero on transition
to IFRS on 1 April 2004.
(f) Deferred taxation
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, provision for deferred income tax is required on a full provision basis in accordance with IAS 12
‘Income taxes’ and SFAS No. 109 ‘Accounting for Income Taxes’.
Under IFRS, deferred tax is recorded for temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets
not recognised are disclosed in note 21.
Under US GAAP deferred taxes are recorded on all temporary differences and a valuation allowance is established in respect of
those deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion will remain unrealised.
Deferred tax adjustments in the IFRS to US GAAP reconciliation are primarily the result of the deferred tax impact of the other US
GAAP adjustments made in the reconciliation. In addition, IFRS and US GAAP adopt different methods for recognising deferred tax
on share based payments. Under FAS 123 (R), deferred tax assets are recognised over the service period based on the compensation
charge. Any realised tax deductions which exceed the related compensation expense is recognised in additional paid in capital
(APIC). These beneﬁts are pooled and can be used to offset shortfalls in deductions related to other share awards.
At 31 March 2007, total deferred tax liabilities were £1,447 million (2006: £1,291 million
a
) primarily in respect of accelerated
capital allowances and total deferred tax assets were £117 million (2006: £1,132 million), primarily in respect of pension
obligations.
The total valuation allowance recognised for deferred tax assets was as follows:
2007 2006
Movement in
year
£m £m £m
Capital losses 5,279 5,493 (214)
Operating losses not utilised 741 775 (34)
Other 313 271 42
Total 6,333 6,539 (206)
a
Opening retained earnings and shareholders’ equity have been restated to correct a deferred tax valuation allowance of £320 million related to the group’s property sale and leaseback transaction in
2001. The adjustment has the effect of increasing US GAAP deferred tax assets and retained earnings by £320 million. The adjustment did not have a material impact on US GAAP net income or
earnings per share for any of the years presented.
(g) Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Certain network assets previously impaired did not meet the US GAAP criteria for impairment under SFAS No. 144 ‘Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets’.
US GAAP requires that an entity assess whether impairment has occurred based on the undiscounted future cash ﬂows. An
impairment exists if the sum of these cash ﬂows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The impairment loss recognised in the
income statement is based on the asset’s fair value, being either market value or the sum of discounted future cash ﬂows. The assets
that were not impaired under US GAAP are continuing to be depreciated over their remaining useful lives.
(h) Revenue
Under IFRS, long-term contracts to design, build and operate software solutions are accounted for under IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and
IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ under which revenue is recognised as earned over the contract period.
Under US GAAP certain of these contracts are accounted for as multiple element arrangements under EITF 00-21 and SOP 97-2,
‘Software Revenue Recognition’. As vendor speciﬁc objective evidence to support the fair value of the separate elements to be
delivered is unavailable, revenue of £214 million under certain contracts is deferred in the 2007 ﬁnancial year (2006: £109 million,
2005: £162 million). There was no impact on net income due to the deferral of costs on these contracts. Total deferred revenue and
costs recorded under US GAAP at 31 March 2007 was £562 million (2006: £348 million).
Under IFRS, IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ connection and installation services revenue is recognised when it is earned, upon activation. Under
US GAAP, SAB 104 ‘Revenue Recognition’ such revenues are recognised over the estimated customer life and the costs directly
associated with the revenue are deferred. Accordingly, an adjustment has been recognised for the ﬁrst time in the 2007 ﬁnancial
year in respect of Openreach products which have a signiﬁcant connection and installation service charge.

(i) Share-based payments
Under IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based Payment’, share options are fair valued at their grant date and the cost is charged to the income
statement over the relevant vesting periods.
The group adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) ‘Share-Based Payment’ with effect from 1 April 2005 using the modiﬁed
prospective transition method. Under FAS 123(R), share based payments to employees are required to be measured based on their
grant date fair value (with limited exceptions) and recognised over the related service period. For periods prior to 1 April 2005, the
group accounted for share-based payments under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 using the intrinsic value method. The
results for the prior periods have not been restated.
Under US GAAP the fair value of the Deferred Bonus Plan award is spread over the three year vesting period, but under IFRS the
fair value is spread over the performance period, which is four years.
For the 2007 ﬁnancial year, the compensation expense for all types of share based payment arrangements was £91 million (2006:
£77 million).
At 31 March 2007 the group had approximately £106 million (2006: £121 million) of total unrecognised compensation expense
related to non vested share-based compensation arrangements, of which £51 million (2006: £86 million) relates to share option
schemes. The total expense is expected to be recognised over a weighted average period of 1.9 years (2006: 2.0 years), and 2.1
years (2006: 2.1 years) for share option schemes.
The tax beneﬁt realised from share options exercised and share awards vested during the year was approximately £26 million
(2006: £9 million). Cash proceeds received from the exercise of share options during the year was £123 million (2006: £13 million).
(j) Goodwill
Under UK GAAP, the group wrote off goodwill arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures on
acquisition prior to 1 April 1998, against retained earnings. Goodwill arising on acquisitions completed after 1 April 1998 was
capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life. Following transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer
amortised but tested annually for impairment and the amount of goodwill previously recorded at the transition date was carried
forward under IFRS.
Under US GAAP up to 31 March 2002, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures was
capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful life. BT adopted SFAS No. 142 ‘Goodwill and other intangible assets’
on 1 April 2002 and goodwill is no longer amortised but tested annually for impairment.
(k) Property rationalisation provision
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, a provision in connection with the rationalisation of the group’s London ofﬁce property portfolio was
recorded. Under US GAAP, in accordance with SFAS No 146 ‘Accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities’, these
costs are not recognised until the group fully exits and therefore ceases to use the affected properties. All these properties were
exited by 31 December 2004.
(l) Contingent consideration
Under IFRS contingent consideration in respect of acquisitions is recorded when the outcome of the contingency is considered more
likely than not. Under US GAAP the consideration is recorded when the contingent event has occurred.
(m) Termination beneﬁts
Under US GAAP the fair value of termination beneﬁts for employees who are to be retained beyond their minimum contractual
retention period is recognised on a straight line basis over the future service period. Under IFRS these costs are recognised when the
employees agree to leave the group.

Reclassiﬁcations
The following reclassiﬁcations would need to be made in addition to those disclosed elsewhere and in the above reconciliation of
shareholders’ equity in order to present amounts in accordance with US GAAP.
r Trade and other receivables and trade and other payables would be £562 million higher (2006: £348 million higher) – see note
(h).
r A ﬁnance lease obligation of £2,316 million higher (2006: £2,325 million higher) and property, plant and equipment of £669
million higher (2006: £780 million higher) would be shown and trade and other payables would be £552 million lower (2006:
£478 million lower) in respect of the property sale and ﬁnance leaseback transaction as described in note (a).
r Goodwill would be £7 million lower (2006: £10 million lower), other debtors would be £1 million lower (2006: £1 million lower),
current liabilities would be the same (2006: £2 million lower) and long term borrowings would be £1 million lower (2006: £12
million lower) in respect of ﬁnancial instruments.
r Prior to the adoption of FAS 158 a pension intangible asset was recognised separately from retirement beneﬁt obligations. Due to
the adoption of FAS 158 on 31 March 2007 there is no reclassiﬁcation required in the current year (2006: £31 million).
r As outlined in note (1), contingent consideration on acquisitions of £15 million (2006: £7 million) was not recognised for
US GAAP. This results in goodwill and other payables being lower by £15 million (2006: £7 million).
r The cumulative impact of the above adjustments is:
r Current assets – £649 million higher (2006: £337 million higher)
r Non current assets – £943 million higher (2006: £1,490 million higher)
r Current liabilities – £164 million higher (2006: £137 million lower)
r Non current liabilities – £2,080 million higher (2006: £3,356 million higher).
(III) CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
The group cash ﬂow statements are presented in accordance with IAS 7. The statements prepared under IAS 7 present substantially
the same information as that required under SFAS No. 95, ‘Statement of Cash Flows’.
If the cash ﬂow statement had been prepared in accordance with SFAS No 95, the net movement in cash and cash equivalents
would have been higher by £130 million (2006: £179 million higher, 2005: unchanged). This is because under IAS 7, bank
overdrafts are classiﬁed as a movement in cash and cash equivalents, while under US GAAP, the movements in bank overdrafts are
classiﬁed as a ﬁnancing activity.
(IV) PENSION COSTS
The net liabilities of the BTPS represent substantially all of the group’s pensions obligations.
The pension cost determined under FAS 87 was calculated by reference to an expected long-term rate of return on scheme assets
of 6.5% (2006: 7.1%, 2005: 7.3%).
The components of the net periodic pension cost for the BTPS comprised:
2007

The incremental effects of adopting the provisions of FAS 158 on the group’s balance sheet at 31 March 2007, as adjusted to
accord with US GAAP, are presented in the following table. The adoption of FAS 158 had no effect on the group’s consolidated
income statement, as adjusted to accord with US GAAP, and will not affect the group’s US GAAP net income in future periods.

1 January 2005. For the current ﬁnancial year the group has early adopted the change in measurement date provisions of FAS 158,
and have changed the measurement date to the year end date of 31 March 2007. The current year assumptions are disclosed in
note 29.

Contributions expected to be paid to the BTPS during the 2008 ﬁnancial year are estimated at £748 million including £320 million
of deﬁciency contributions.
Estimated future beneﬁt payments are as follows:
£m
Year ending 31 March 2008 1,526
Year ending 31 March 2009 1,591
Year ending 31 March 2010 1,671

Year ending 31 March 2012 1,862
1 April 2012 to 31 March 2017 10,748
Asset allocation
The Trustees of the BTPS approve the target asset allocation as well as deviation limits. The objective of the investment activities is
to maximise investment returns within an acceptable level of risk, taking into consideration the liabilities of the BTPS. For the 2007
ﬁnancial year the group has early adopted the change in measurement date provisions of FAS 158, and has changed the
measurement date to the year end date of 31 March 2007. Therefore the 2007 ﬁnancial year disclosure for each major category of
plan assets and the percentage of the fair value of total plan assets is disclosed in note 29.
The prior year disclosures are presented below:
Period ended 31 December 2005
Fair value
£bn %
Target

Equities 20.3 59 58
Fixed interest securities 5.4 16 16
Index linked securities 3.2 9 9
Property 4.2 12 12
Cash and other 1.2 4 5
34.3 100 100
The assumption for the expected return on scheme assets is a weighted average based on an assumed expected return for each
asset class and the proportions held for each asset class at the beginning of the year. The expected returns on bonds are based on
the gross redemption yields at the start of the year. Expected returns on equities and property are based on a combination of an
estimate of the risk premium above, yields on government bonds and consensus economic forecasts on future returns. The expected
return of 7.1% per annum used for the calculation of pension costs for the year ended 31 March 2006 is consistent with that
adopted for IAS 19.

(V) INCOME STATEMENT IN US GAAP FORMAT
The group income statements on page 86 comply with IFRS and the directors believe they are in the most appropriate format for
shareholders to understand the results of our business. We believe that it is important to show our results before deducting speciﬁc
items because these predominantly relate to items which are signiﬁcant, one-off or unusual in nature. For SEC reporting purposes
this presentation may be considered ‘non GAAP’ and therefore the group has also prepared the following income statement. The
numbers disclosed in the following income statement are prepared under IFRS.

(VI) ADDITIONAL US GAAP INFORMATION
Intangible asset amortisation
The total amortisation charge expected under US GAAP in 2008 is £589 million. As a consequence of the pattern of amortisation
applied this annual charge will decrease in each of the following four years to be approximately £53 million for the year ended
31 March 2012.
US GAAP Developments
In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No 155, ‘Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments – an amendment to FASB statements
No 133 and 140’ (‘ ‘FAS 155’ ’), that amends SFAS No 133 ‘Accounting for derivative Instruments and hedging activities’ (‘ ‘FAS 133’ ’)
and SFAS 140, ‘Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities’ (‘ ‘FAS 140’ ’). This
statement resolves issues addressed in FAS 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, ‘Application of Statement 133 to Beneﬁcial Interests
in Securitised Financial Assets’. The statement permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid ﬁnancial instrument that contains an
embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. Additionally it clariﬁes which interest-only strips and principal-only
strips are not subject to the requirements of FAS 133. FAS 155 also establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitised
ﬁnancial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid ﬁnancial instruments that contain an
embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. It clariﬁes that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not
embedded derivatives. Also FAS 155 amends FAS 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from
holding a derivative ﬁnancial instrument that pertains to a beneﬁcial interest other than another derivative ﬁnancial instrument.
FAS 155 is effective for BT for all ﬁnancial instruments acquired or issued after 31 March 2007. The group does not expect this to
have a material impact on the ﬁnancial statements.
In March 2006 the FASB issued SFAS No 156, ‘Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets: an amendment of FASB No 140’
(‘ ‘FAS 156’ ’) that amends SFAS No 140 ‘Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities’
with respect to the accounting for separately recognised servicing assets and servicing liabilities. FAS 156 is effective for BT from 1
April 2007. The group does not anticipate that the adoption of this new statement at the required effective date will have a
signiﬁcant effect on its results of operations, ﬁnancial position or cash ﬂows.

35. UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No 157, ‘Fair Value Measurements’ (‘ ‘FAS 157’ ’). FAS 157 deﬁnes fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. The provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
measurements. FAS 157 applies for the group’s ﬁnancial year beginning 1 April 2008. The group is currently evaluating the impact,
if any, that the adoption of FAS 157 will have on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No 159, ‘The Fair value option for ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities’ (‘ ‘FAS 159’ ’).
FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure, on an item by item basis, speciﬁed ﬁnancial instruments and certain other items at
fair value. Unrealised gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are required to be reported in
earnings at each reporting date. FAS 159 is effective for the 2009 ﬁnancial year, the provisions of which are required to be applied
prospectively. The group is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of FAS 159 will have on the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.
In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No 48 ‘Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – An Interpretation of FASB
Statement No 109’ (‘ ‘FIN 48’ ’). FIN 48 requires tax beneﬁts from uncertain positions to be recognised only if it is ‘ ‘more likely than
not’ ’ that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. The interpretation also requires qualitative and quantitative
disclosures, including discussion of reasonably possible changes that might occur in unrecognised tax beneﬁts over the next
12 months, a description of open tax years by major jurisdiction, and a roll-forward of all unrecognised tax beneﬁts. FIN 48 applies
for the group’s ﬁnancial year beginning 1 April 2007. The group is currently in the process of quantifying the impact, if any, on the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB ratiﬁed Emerging Issues Task Force No 06-01 ‘Accounting for Consideration Given by a Service
Provider to Manufactures or Resellers of Equipment Necessary for an End-Customer to Receive Service from the Service Provider’
(‘ ‘EITF 06-01’ ’). This guidance requires the application of EITF 01-09 ‘Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Service
provider’s end customer’ (‘ ‘EITF 01-09’ ’), when consideration is given to a reseller or manufacturer for beneﬁt to the service
provider’s end customer. EITF 01-09 requires the consideration given to be recorded as a liability at the time of the sale of the
equipment and, also, provides guidance for the classiﬁcation of the expense. EITF 06-01 is effective for the group’s ﬁnancial year
beginning 1 April 2008. The group is currently in the process of quantifying the impact, if any, on the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of BT Group plc
We have audited the parent company ﬁnancial statements of BT Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2007 which comprise the
balance sheet, accounting policies and the related notes. These parent company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein. These parent company ﬁnancial statements are set out on pages 145 to 148. We have also
audited the information in the Report on directors’ remuneration that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the group ﬁnancial statements of BT Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2007. This separate
report is set out on page 75.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in
the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report on the directors’ remuneration
to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the
parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the report on the directors’ remuneration to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
report of the directors is consistent with the parent company ﬁnancial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and

We read other information contained in the Annual Report and Form 20-F and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
parent company ﬁnancial statements. The other information comprises only BT at a glance, the Chairman’s message, the Chief
Executive’s statement and the Report of the Directors. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any

Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices

ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report on directors’ remuneration to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the parent company ﬁnancial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
Report on directors’ remuneration to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company
ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report on directors’ remuneration to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
r the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 March 2007;
r the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report on directors’ remuneration to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
r the information given in the Report of the Directors is consistent with the parent company ﬁnancial statements.

BT GROUP PLC ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(i) Accounting basis
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention as modiﬁed by the
revaluation of certain ﬁnancial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable United
Kingdom accounting standards (UK GAAP).
As permitted by Section 230(3) of the Companies Act 1985, the company’s proﬁt and loss account has not been presented.
The BT Group plc consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 contain a consolidated statement of cash
ﬂows. Consequently, the company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 1, (Revised 1996) ‘Cash Flow Statements’ not to
present its own cash ﬂow statement.
The BT Group plc consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 contain related party disclosures.
Consequently, the company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8, ‘Related Party Disclosures’ not to disclose transactions
with other members of the BT Group.
The BT Group plc consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 contain ﬁnancial instrument disclosures
which comply with FRS 25, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’. Consequently, the company has taken advantage of
the exemption in FRS 25 not to present separate ﬁnancial instrument disclosures for the company.
(ii) Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indicators that the carrying value
may not be recoverable.
(iii) Investments
Investments comprise an available-for-sale asset. Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are carried at fair value, with unrealised gains
and losses recognised in equity until the ﬁnancial asset is de-recognised, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously
recognised in equity is taken to the income statement, in the line item that most appropriately reﬂects the nature of the item or
transaction.
(iv) Taxation
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufﬁcient taxable
proﬁts from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted. The deferred tax balances are not discounted.
(v) Dividends
Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the year in which the dividends are approved by the company’s shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid; ﬁnal dividends when authorised in general meetings by shareholders.
(vi) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Repurchased shares of the company are recorded in the balance sheet as treasury shares and
presented as a deduction from shareholders’ equity at cost.
(vii) Cash
Cash includes cash in hand, bank deposits repayable on demand and bank overdrafts.
(viii) Share based payments
The company does not incur a charge for share based payments. However the issuance by the company of share options and awards
to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions to its subsidiaries. An addition to the company’s
investment in subsidiaries is recorded with a corresponding increase in equity shareholders’ funds. The additional capital contribution
is determined based on the fair value of options and awards at the date of grant and is recognised over the vesting period.
OTHER INFORMATION
(i) Dividends
The directors are proposing that a ﬁnal dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2007 of 10.0 pence will be paid to
shareholders on 17 September 2007, taking the full year proposed dividend in respect of the 2007 ﬁnancial year to 15.1 pence
(2006: 11.9 pence). This dividend is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting and therefore the liability of
£825 million (2006: £631 million) has not been included in these ﬁnancial statements.
(ii) Employees
The ﬁve (2006: ﬁve) executive directors of BT Group plc were the only employees of the company during the 2007 ﬁnancial year.
The costs relating to qualifying services provided to the company’s principal subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, are recharged
to that company.
(iii) Available-for-sale
The movement in the available-for-sale reserve in the year was £nil (2006: £nil).

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements in this annual report are forward-looking and are made in reliance on the safe harbour provisions of the
US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to analyses and other information which are based on
forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements include, without limitation, those
concerning: BT’s transformation strategy and its ability to achieve it; expected cost savings; growth of, and opportunities available
in, the communications industry and BT’s positioning to take advantage of those opportunities; expectations regarding competition,
market shares, prices and growth; expectations regarding the convergence of technologies; growth and opportunities in new wave
business (such as networked IT services, broadband and mobility); BT’s network development and plans for the 21st century network;
plans for the launch of new products and services; network performance and quality; the impact of regulatory initiatives on
operations, including the regulation of the UK ﬁxed wholesale and retail businesses and the impact of the Undertakings to Ofcom
under the Enterprise Act; BT’s possible or assumed future results of operations and/or those of its associates and joint ventures; BT’s
future dividend policy; capital expenditure and investment plans; adequacy of capital; ﬁnancing plans; demand for and access to
broadband and the promotion of broadband by third-party service providers; and those preceded by, followed by, or that include
the words ‘aims’, ‘believes’, ‘expects’, ‘anticipates’, ‘intends’, ‘will’, ‘should’ or similar expressions.
Although BT believes that the expectations reﬂected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance
that these expectations will prove to have been correct. Because these statements involve risks and uncertainties, actual results may
differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause differences between actual results and those implied by the forward-looking statements include, but are
not limited to: material adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by BT and its lines of business; future
regulatory actions and conditions in its operating areas, including competition from others; selection by BT and its lines of business
of the appropriate trading and marketing models for its products and services; technological innovations, including the cost of
developing new products, networks and solutions and the need to increase expenditures for improving the quality of service; the
anticipated beneﬁts and advantages of new technologies, products and services, including broadband and other new wave initiatives
not being realised; developments in the convergence of technologies; prolonged adverse weather conditions resulting in a material
increase in overtime, staff or other costs; the timing of entry and proﬁtability of BT and its lines of business in certain
communications markets; signiﬁcant changes in market shares for BT and its principal products and services; ﬂuctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates; and general ﬁnancial market conditions affecting BT’s performance. Certain of these
factors are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this annual report including, without limitation, in Group risk factors on page 27.
BT undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.

The prices are the highest and lowest closing middle market prices for BT ordinary shares, as derived from the Daily Ofﬁcial List of
the London Stock Exchange and the highest and lowest closing sales prices of ADSs, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange
composite tape.
Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the US dollar affect the dollar equivalent of the pound sterling
price of the company’s ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange and, as a result, are likely to affect the market price of the
ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange.
CAPITAL GAINS TAX (CGT)
The rights issue in June 2001 and the demerger of O2 in November 2001 adjusted the value for capital gains tax purposes of
BT shares.
Rights issue
An explanatory note on the effects of the rights issue on the CGT position relating to BT shareholdings is available from the
Shareholder Helpline. (See page 168)
Demerger of O2 – capital gains tax calculation
The conﬁrmed ofﬁcial opening prices for BT Group and O2 shares on 19 November 2001 following the demerger were 285.75p and
82.75p respectively. This means that, of the total (combined) value of 368.50p, 77.544% is attributable to BT Group and 22.456%
to O2. Accordingly, for CGT calculations, the base cost of BT Group shares and O2 shares is calculated by multiplying the acquisition
cost of a BT shareholding by 77.544% and 22.456%, respectively.

Qualifying holders of ADSs on record as of 24 August 2007 are entitled to receive the final dividend which will be paid on 24 September 2007, subject to approval at the AGM. The US dollar amount
of the final dividend of 100 pence per ADS to be paid to holders of ADSs will be based on the exchange rate in effect on 17 September 2007, the date of payment to holders of ordinary shares.
As dividends paid by the company are in pounds sterling, exchange rate ﬂuctuations will affect the US dollar amounts received by
holders of ADSs on conversion by the Depositary of such cash dividends.
DIVIDEND MANDATE
Any shareholder wishing dividends to be paid directly into a bank or building society account should contact the Shareholder
Helpline. (See page 168) Dividends paid in this way will be paid through the Bankers Automated Clearing System (BACS).

GLOBAL INVEST DIRECT
Details of the direct purchase plan run by the ADR Depositary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, Global Invest Direct, including reinvestment of
dividends, are available from JPMorgan Chase Bank on +1 800 634 8366 (toll free within the USA) or +1 201 680 6630 (from

TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders, reﬂecting share price
movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends. It is therefore, a good indicator of a company’s overall performance.
Over the last ﬁve years (as shown in the ﬁrst TSR chart below), BT’s TSR is positive 34%, compared to the FTSE 100 TSR of
positive 42%. BT’s TSR has caught up considerably with that of the FTSE 100 mainly due to a strong share price performance,
relative to the FTSE 100, during the 2006/7 ﬁnancial year. BT’s share price was up 37% whilst the FTSE 100 Index was up 6% over
the year.
In the period between the demerger on the 19 November 2001 and 31 March 2007, BT’s TSR was a positive 29%, compared to
negative 3% for the FTSEuroﬁrst 300 Telco Index. The FTSE 100 TSR over the same period was positive 42%.
The strength of BT’s TSR performance over the last year is evident with a positive 44% return, compared to the FTSE 100 TSR
with a positive 8% and the FTSEuroﬁrst 300 Telco Index a positive 18%.

MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
The following is a summary of the principal provisions of BT’s memorandum and articles of association (‘Memorandum’ and
‘Articles’), a copy of which has been ﬁled with the Registrar of Companies.
Memorandum
The Memorandum provides that the company’s principal objects are, among other things, to carry on any business of running,
operating, managing and supplying telecommunication systems and systems of any kind for conveying, receiving, storing, processing
or transmitting sounds, visual images, signals, messages and communications of any kind.
Articles
In the following description of the rights attaching to the shares in the company, a ‘holder of shares’ and a ‘shareholder’ is, in either
case, the person entered on the company’s register of members as the holder of the relevant shares. Shareholders can choose
whether their shares are to be evidenced by share certiﬁcates (i.e. in certiﬁcated form) or held in electronic (i.e. uncertiﬁcated) form
in CREST (the electronic settlement system in the UK).
(a) Voting rights
Subject to the restrictions described below, on a show of hands, every shareholder present in person or by proxy at any general
meeting has one vote and, on a poll, every shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote for each share which they hold.
Voting at any meeting of shareholders is by a show of hands unless a poll is demanded by the chairman of the meeting or by at
least ﬁve shareholders at the meeting who are entitled to vote (or their proxies), or by one or more shareholders at the meeting
who are entitled to vote (or their proxies) and who have, between them, at least 10% of the total votes of all shareholders who
have the right to vote at the meeting.
No person is, unless the Board decide otherwise, entitled to attend or vote at any general meeting or to exercise any other right
conferred by being a shareholder if he or any person appearing to be interested in those shares has been sent a notice under section
793 of the Companies Act 2006 (which confers upon public companies the power to require information with respect to interests in
their voting shares) and he or any interested person has failed to supply to the company the information requested within 14 days
after delivery of that notice. These restrictions end seven days after the earlier of the date the shareholder complies with the request
satisfactorily or the company receives notice that there has been an approved transfer of the shares.
(b) Variation of rights
Whenever the share capital of the company is split into different classes of shares, the special rights attached to any of those classes
can be varied or withdrawn either:
(i) with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class; or
(ii) with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class.
At any separate meeting, the necessary quorum is two persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one-third in
nominal amount of the issued shares of the class in question (but at any adjourned meeting, any person holding shares of the class
or his proxy is a quorum).
The company can issue new shares and attach any rights and restrictions to them, as long as this is not restricted by special rights
previously given to holders of any existing shares. Subject to this, the rights of new shares can take priority over the rights of
existing shares, or existing shares can take priority over them, or the new shares and the existing shares can rank equally.
(c) Changes in capital
The company may by ordinary resolution:
(i) consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of a larger amount;
(ii) divide all or part of its share capital into shares of a smaller amount;
(iii) cancel any shares which have not, at the date of the ordinary resolution, been taken or agreed to be taken by any person and
reduce the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares cancelled; and
(iv) increase its share capital.
The company may also:
(i) buy back its own shares; and
(ii) by special resolution reduce its share capital, any capital redemption reserve and any share premium account.
(d) Dividends
The company’s shareholders can declare dividends by passing an ordinary resolution provided that no dividend can exceed the amount
recommended by the directors. Dividends must be paid out of proﬁts available for distribution. If the directors consider that the proﬁts
of the company justify such payments, they can pay interim dividends on any class of shares of the amounts and on the dates and for
the periods they decide. Fixed dividends will be paid on any class of shares on the dates stated for the payments of those dividends.
The directors can offer ordinary shareholders the right to choose to receive new ordinary shares, which are credited as fully paid,
instead of some or all of their cash dividend. Before they can do this, the company’s shareholders must have passed an ordinary
resolution authorising the directors to make this offer.
Any dividend which has not been claimed for ten years after it was declared or became due for payment will be forfeited and will
belong to the company unless the directors decide otherwise.

(e) Distribution of assets on winding up
If the company is wound up (whether the liquidation is voluntary, under supervision of the court or by the court) the liquidator can,
with the authority of an extraordinary resolution passed by the shareholders, divide among the shareholders all or any part of the
assets of the company. This applies whether the assets consist of property of one kind or different kinds. For this purpose, the
liquidator can place whatever value the liquidator considers fair on any property and decide how the division is carried out between
shareholders or different groups of shareholders. The liquidator can also, with the same authority, transfer any assets to trustees
upon any trusts for the beneﬁt of shareholders which the liquidator decides. The liquidation of the company can then be ﬁnalised
and the company dissolved. No past or present shareholder can be compelled to accept any shares or other property under the
Articles which could give that shareholder a liability.
(f) Transfer of shares
Certiﬁcated shares of the company may be transferred in writing either by an instrument of transfer in the usual standard form or in
another form approved by the Board. The transfer form must be signed or made effective by or on behalf of the person making the
transfer. The person making the transfer will be treated as continuing to be the holder of the shares transferred until the name of
the person to whom the shares are being transferred is entered in the register of members of the company.
The Board may refuse to register any transfer of any share held in certiﬁcated form:
(i) which is in favour of more than four joint holders; or
(ii) unless the transfer form to be registered is properly stamped to show payment of any applicable stamp duty and delivered to
the company’s registered ofﬁce or any other place the Board decide. The transfer must have with it the share certiﬁcate for the
shares to be transferred; any other evidence which the Board ask for to prove that the person wanting to make the transfer is
entitled to do this; and if the transfer form is executed by another person on behalf of the person making the transfer, evidence
of the authority of that person to do so.
Transfers of uncertiﬁcated shares must be carried out using a relevant system (as deﬁned in the Uncertiﬁcated Securities
Regulations 2001 (the Regulations)). The Board can refuse to register a transfer of an uncertiﬁcated share in the circumstances
stated in the Regulations.
If the Board decide not to register a transfer of a share, the Board must notify the person to whom that share was to be
transferred no later than two months after the company receives the transfer or instruction from the operator of the relevant
system.
The Board can decide to suspend the registration of transfers, for up to 30 days a year, by closing the register of shareholders.
The register must not be closed without the consent of the operator of a relevant system (as deﬁned in the Regulations) in the case
of uncertiﬁcated shares.
(g) Untraced shareholders
BT may sell any shares after advertising its intention and waiting for three months if the shares have been in issue for at least
ten years, during that period at least three dividends have become payable on them and have not been claimed and BT has not
heard from the shareholder or any person entitled to the dividends by transmission. The net sale proceeds belong to BT, but it must
pay those proceeds to the former shareholder or the person entitled to them by transmission if that shareholder, or that other
person, asks for them.
(h) General meetings of shareholders
Every year the company must hold an annual general meeting. The Board can call an extraordinary general meeting at any time and,
under general law, must call one on a shareholders’ requisition.
(i) Limitations on rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders
The only limitation imposed by the Articles on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders is that a shareholder whose
registered address is outside the UK and who wishes to receive notices of meetings of shareholders or documents from BT must give
the company an address within the UK to which they may be sent.
(j) Directors
Directors’ remuneration
Excluding remuneration referred to below, each director will be paid such fee for his services as the Board decide, not exceeding
£50,000 a year and increasing by the percentage increase of the UK Retail Prices Index (as deﬁned by Section 833(2) Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988) for any 12 month period beginning 1 April 1999 or an anniversary of that date. The company may by
ordinary resolution decide on a higher sum. This resolution can increase the fee paid to all or any directors either permanently or for
a particular period. The directors may be paid their expenses properly incurred in connection with the business of the company.
The Board can award extra fees to a director who holds an executive position; acts as chairman or deputy chairman; serves on a
Board committee at the request of the Board; or performs any other services which the Board consider extend beyond the ordinary
duties of a director.
The directors may grant pensions or other beneﬁts to, among others, any director or former director or persons connected with
them. However, BT can only provide these beneﬁts to any director or former director who has not been an employee or held any
other ofﬁce or executive position in the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, or to relations or dependants of, or people
connected to, those directors or former directors, if the shareholders approve this by passing an ordinary resolution.

BT Group plc Annual Report & Form 20-F 165
Directors’ votes
A director need not be a shareholder, but a director who is not a shareholder can still attend and speak at shareholders’ meetings.
Unless the Articles say otherwise, a director cannot vote on a resolution about a contract in which the director has a material
interest (this will also apply to interests of a person connected with the director). The director can vote if the interest is only an
interest in BT shares, debentures or other securities. A director can, however, vote and be counted in a quorum in respect of certain
matters in which he is interested as set out in the Articles.
Subject to the relevant legislation, the shareholders can by passing an ordinary resolution suspend or relax, among other things,
the provisions relating to the interest of a director in any contract or arrangement or relating to a director’s right to vote and be
counted in a quorum on resolutions in which he is interested to any extent or ratify any particular contract carried out in breach of
those provisions.
Directors’ interests
If the legislation allows and the director has disclosed the nature and extent of the interest to the Board, the director can:
(i) have any kind of interest in a contract with or involving BT (or in which BT has an interest or with or involving another
company in which BT has an interest);
(ii) have any kind of interest in a company in which BT has an interest (including holding a position in that company or being a
shareholder of that company);
(iii) hold a position (other than auditor) in BT or another company in which BT has an interest on terms and conditions decided by
the Board; and
(iv) alone (or through some ﬁrm with which the director is associated) do paid professional work (other than as auditor) for BT or
another company in which BT has an interest on terms and conditions decided by the Board.
A director does not have to hand over to BT any beneﬁt received or proﬁt made as a result of anything permitted to be done
under the Articles.
When a director knows that they are interested in a contract with BT they must tell the other directors.
Retirement of directors
No one is prevented from being or becoming a director because they have reached the age of 70.
At every annual general meeting, any director who was elected or last re-elected a director at or before the annual general
meeting held in the third year before the current year, must retire by rotation. Any director appointed by the directors automatically
retires at the next following annual general meeting. A retiring director is eligible for re-election.
Directors’ borrowing powers
To the extent that the legislation and the Articles allow, the Board can exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money, to
mortgage or charge its business, property and assets (present and future) and to issue debentures and other securities, and give
security either outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation of the company or another person. The Board
must limit the borrowings of the company and exercise all the company’s voting and other rights or powers of control exercisable by
the company in relation to its subsidiary undertakings so as to ensure that the aggregate amount of all borrowings by the group
outstanding, net of amounts borrowed intra-group among other things, at any time does not exceed £35 billion.
MATERIAL CONTRACTS
Excluding contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business, no contracts have been entered into in the two years preceding
the date of this document by BT or another member of the group which are, or may be, material to the group or contain a
provision under which a member of the group has an obligation or entitlement which is, or may be, material to BT or such other
member of the group.
TAXATION (US HOLDERS)
This is a summary only of the principal US federal income tax and UK tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of ordinary
shares or ADSs by US Holders (as deﬁned below) who hold their ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets. It does not address all
aspects of US federal income taxation and does not address aspects that may be relevant to persons who are subject to special
provisions of US federal income tax law, including US expatriates, insurance companies, tax-exempt organisations, banks, regulated
investment companies, ﬁnancial institutions, securities broker-dealers, traders in securities who elect a mark-to-market method of
accounting, persons subject to alternative minimum tax, investors that directly, indirectly or by attribution own 10% or more of the
outstanding share capital or voting power of BT, persons holding their ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a straddle, hedging
transaction or conversion transaction, persons who acquired their ordinary shares or ADSs pursuant to the exercise of options or
otherwise as compensation, or persons whose functional currency is not the US dollar, amongst others. Those holders may be subject
to US federal income tax consequences different from those set forth below.
For the purposes of this summary, a US Holder is a beneﬁcial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs that, for US federal income tax
purposes, is: a citizen or individual resident of the United States, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for
US federal income tax purposes) created or organised in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof,
an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if a US court can exercise
primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons are authorised to control all
substantial decisions of the trust. If a partnership holds ordinary shares or ADSs, the US tax treatment of a partner generally will
depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner in a partnership that holds ordinary shares or
ADSs is urged to consult its own tax advisor regarding the speciﬁc tax consequences of owning and disposing of the ordinary shares
or ADSs.
Shareholder information Filename: 51384_12.3d Time: 15:19:51 Date: 19/05/07
Checksum: -1602875833
In particular, this summary is based on (i) current UK tax law and the practice of Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) and US
law and US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) practice, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, existing and
proposed Treasury regulations, rulings, judicial decisions and administrative practice, all as currently in effect and available, (ii) the
United Kingdom–United States Convention relating to estate and gift taxes, and (iii) the United Kingdom–United States Tax
Convention that entered into force on 31 March 2003 and the protocol thereto (the Convention), all as in effect on the date of this
annual report, all of which are subject to change or changes in interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect.
US Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the applicability of the Convention and the consequences under UK,
US federal, state and local, and other laws, of the ownership and disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs.
Taxation of dividends
Under current UK tax law, BT will not be required to withhold tax at source from dividend payments it makes.
For US federal income tax purposes, a distribution will be treated as ordinary dividend income. The amount of the distribution
includible in gross income of a US Holder will be the US dollar value of the distribution calculated by reference to the spot rate in
effect on the date the distribution is actually or constructively received by a US Holder of ordinary shares, or by the Depositary, in
the case of ADSs. A US Holder who converts the British pounds into US dollars on the date of receipt generally should not recognise
any exchange gain or loss. A US Holder who does not convert the British pounds into US dollars on the date of receipt generally will
have a tax basis in the British pounds equal to their US dollar value on such date. Foreign currency gain or loss, if any, recognised
by the US Holder on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the British pounds generally will be US source ordinary income
or loss. Dividends paid by BT to a US Holder will not be eligible for the US dividends received deduction that may otherwise be
available to corporate shareholders.
For purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit limitation, dividends paid on the ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as
income from sources outside the United States and generally will constitute ‘passive income’ or, for certain Holders, ‘ﬁnancial
services income’ for tax years beginning before 1 January 2007, and for tax years beginning after 31 December 2006, will be
treated as ‘passive category income’ or ‘general category income’. The rules relating to the determination of the foreign tax credit
are very complex. US Holders who do not elect to claim a credit with respect to any foreign taxes paid in a given taxable year may
instead claim a deduction for foreign taxes paid. A deduction does not reduce US federal income tax on a dollar for dollar basis like
a tax credit. The deduction, however, is not subject to the limitations applicable to foreign credits.
There will be no right to any UK tax credit or to any payment from HMRC in respect of any tax credit on dividends paid on
ordinary shares or ADSs.
Certain US Holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of US federal income tax (currently at a maximum rate of
15%) in respect of ‘qualiﬁed dividend income’ received in taxable years beginning before 1 January 2011. For this purpose, qualiﬁed
dividend income generally includes dividends paid by a non-US corporation if, among other things, the US Holders meet certain
minimum holding periods and the non-US corporation satisﬁes certain requirements, including that either (i) the shares or ADSs with
respect to which the dividend has been paid are readily tradeable on an established securities market in the United States, or (ii) the
non-US corporation is eligible for the beneﬁts of a comprehensive US income tax treaty (such as the Convention) which provides for
the exchange of information. BT currently believes that dividends paid with respect to its ordinary shares and ADSs should constitute
qualiﬁed dividend income for US federal income tax purposes. Each individual US Holder of ordinary shares or ADSs is urged to
consult his own tax advisor regarding the availability to him of the reduced dividend tax rate in light of his own particular situation
and regarding the computations of his foreign tax credit limitation with respect to any qualiﬁed dividend income paid by BT to him,
as applicable.
Taxation of capital gains
Unless a US Holder of ordinary shares or ADSs is resident in or ordinarily resident for United Kingdom tax purposes in the United
Kingdom or unless a US Holder of ordinary shares or ADSs carries on a trade, profession, or vocation in the United Kingdom through
a branch, agency, or permanent establishment in the UK, and the ordinary shares and/or ADSs have been used, held, or acquired for
purposes of that trade, the holder should not be liable for UK tax on capital gains on a disposal of ordinary shares and/or ADSs.
A US Holder who is an individual and who has ceased to be resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom
on or after 17 March 1998 or who falls to be regarded as resident outside the United Kingdom for the purposes of any double tax
treaty (Treaty non-resident) on or after 16 March 2005 and continues to not be resident or ordinarily resident in the United
Kingdom or continues to be Treaty non-resident for a period of less than ﬁve years of assessment and who disposes of his ordinary
shares or ADSs during that period may also be liable on his return to the United Kingdom to United Kingdom tax on capital gains,
subject to any available exemption or relief, even though he is not resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom or is Treaty
non-resident at the time of disposal.
For US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder generally will recognise capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other
disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realised on
the disposition and the US Holder’s adjusted tax basis (determined in US dollars) in the ordinary shares or ADSs. Such gain or loss
generally will be US source gain or loss, and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the ordinary shares have been held
for more than one year at the time of disposition. Long-term capital gains recognised by an individual US Holder generally are
subject to US federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to signiﬁcant limitations.
Passive foreign investment company status
A non-US corporation will be classiﬁed as a Passive Foreign Investment Company for US federal income tax purposes (a PFIC) for any
taxable year if at least 75% of its gross income consists of passive income or at least 50% of the average value of its assets consist
of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. BT currently believes that it did not qualify as a PFIC for
the tax year ending 31 March 2007. If BT were to become a PFIC for any tax year, US Holders would suffer adverse tax

consequences. These consequences may include having gains realised on the disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs treated as
ordinary income rather than capital gains and being subject to punitive interest charges on certain dividends and on the proceeds of
the sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares or ADSs. Furthermore, dividends paid by BT would not be ‘qualiﬁed dividend
income’ which may be eligible for reduced rates of taxation as described above. US Holders should consult their own tax advisors
regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules to BT.
US information reporting and backup withholding
Dividends paid on and proceeds received from the sale, exchange or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to
information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding at a current rate of 28% (which rate may be subject to change). Certain
exempt recipients (such as corporations) are not subject to these information reporting requirements. Backup withholding will not
apply, however, to a US Holder who provides a correct taxpayer identiﬁcation number or certiﬁcate of foreign status and makes any
other required certiﬁcation or who is otherwise exempt. Persons that are United States persons for US federal income tax purposes
who are required to establish their exempt status generally must furnish IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identiﬁcation Number
and Certiﬁcation). Holders that are not United States persons for US federal income tax purposes generally will not be subject to US
information reporting or backup withholding. However, such holders may be required to provide certiﬁcation of non-US status in
connection with payments received in the United States or through certain US-related ﬁnancial intermediaries.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a holder’s
US federal income tax liability. A holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by
timely ﬁling the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.
UK stamp duty
A transfer of an ordinary share will generally be subject to UK stamp duty or UK stamp duty reserve tax SDRT at 0.5% of the
amount or value of any consideration provided rounded up (in the case of stamp duty) to the nearest £5. SDRT is generally the
liability of the purchaser. It is customarily also the purchaser who pays UK stamp duty. A transfer of an ordinary share to, or to a
nominee or agent of, a person whose business is or includes issuing depositary receipts gives rise to a 1.5% charge to stamp duty or
SDRT of either the amount of the consideration provided or the value of the share issued rounded up (in the case of stamp duty) to
the nearest £5. No UK stamp duty will be payable on the transfer of an ADS (assuming it is not registered in the UK), provided that
the transfer documents are executed and always retained outside the UK.
Transfers of ordinary shares into CREST will generally not be subject to stamp duty or SDRT unless such a transfer is made for a
consideration in money or money’s worth, in which case a liability to SDRT will arise, usually at the rate of 0.5% of the value of the
consideration. Paperless transfers of ordinary shares within CREST are generally liable to SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the value of
the consideration. CREST is obliged to collect SDRT from the purchaser of the shares on relevant transactions settled within the
system.
UK inheritance and gift taxes in connection with ordinary shares and/or ADSs
The rules and scope of domicile are complex and action should not be taken without advice speciﬁc to the individual’s
circumstances. A lifetime gift or a transfer on death of ordinary shares and/or ADSs by an individual holder, who is US domiciled (for
the purposes of the UK/US Estate and Gift Tax Convention) and who is not a UK national (as deﬁned in the Convention) will not
generally be subject to UK inheritance tax if the gift is subject to US federal gift or US estate tax unless the tax is not paid.
LIMITATIONS AFFECTING SECURITY HOLDERS
There are no limitations under the laws of the United Kingdom restricting the right of non-residents to hold or to vote shares in the
company.
