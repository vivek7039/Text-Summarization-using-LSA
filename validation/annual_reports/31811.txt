WWW.C4XDISCOVERY.COM Our Discovery Engine
Our suite of combined proprietary technologies forms the core of our state-of-the-art 
Drug Discovery Engine that spans novel target identification and drug molecule design.
Our vision
C4XD is committed to becoming the world’s most productive Drug Discovery Engine, 
supplying the pharmaceutical industry with a sustainable source of commercially attractive 
drug assets. We commit our resources to the early discovery of novel therapeutic targets 
for high value disease areas and generate new drug molecules against these targets rather 
than competing with others by running clinical studies. We are ambitious and aim to produce 
four or more pre-clinical candidates every year once the Company reaches “steady state”. 
Our sustainability will be driven by licensing our assets to the pharmaceutical industry and 
using the revenue generated to drive our engine harder.
We continue to invest in our proprietary suite of drug discovery technologies and our highly experienced and 
uniquely trained scientific team. Combined, we believe this makes us uniquely positioned to achieve our goal.

Strategic report Our business model
A key aspect of our vision is our aim to become self-sustaining. 
The pharmaceutical industry’s demand for high quality, early stage drug candidates 
continues to grow and we are poised to take advantage of this growing trend by continuing 
to build a focussed commercial function that continually monitors the landscape for licensing 
opportunities. We only pursue new programmes in areas of high unmet medical need that 
are commercially attractive and focus on generating long-term partnerships with licensors. 
Revenue generated through early stage licensing deals will be reinvested into our Drug 
Discovery Engine to maximise value for our shareholders.
We remain on track to complete our first early stage licensing deal in early 2018. 
Where beneficial we will continue to seek opportunities to build alliances with organisations that have capabilities 
complementary to our own.

WWW.C4XDISCOVERY.COM  Interim Chairman’s statement
Sam Williams, Interim Chairman
The Board is fully 
committed to the 
delivery of our strategy. 
Last year we set out our vision as 
the “architects” of drug discovery, 
constantly innovating and finding 
novel ways to solve challenges in 
biology and chemistry that confound 
others and, through this, building 
the world’s most productive Drug 
Discovery Engine.
This has been an important year in 
delivering that vision. We have continued 
to strengthen the data package around our 
lead Orexin-1 antagonist and believe its 
broad applicability in addiction and related 
disorders such as anxiety, post-traumatic 
stress disorder and impulse control make 
it a compelling candidate for partnership. 
Our agreement with Evotec will involve us 
working together on novel small molecule 
drug targets across a range of targets and 
stages of development.
We are also seeing the power of our Drug 
Discovery Engine with exciting new targets 
identified in inflammation/autoimmune 
diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. 
These, alongside our existing programmes, 
open new opportunities for future 
revenue-generating deals with the 
pharmaceutical industry.
During the year we have strengthened 
our financial position through the raising 
of a total of £12 million and added a wealth 
of knowledge and experience to our Board 
with Brad Hoy and Dr Craig Fox joining 
as Directors.
We continue to build towards becoming 
a significant self-sustaining business and 
look forward to further progress in the 
coming period in delivering on the 
potential of our model.

Strategic report CEO’s statement
Clive Dix, Chief Executive Officer
This has been an important year 
for C4XD in implementing our 
vision as we have progressed our 
pipeline towards commercialisation, 
replenished our pipeline with new 
discovery programmes and raised 
the capital required to support 
our strategy.
Commercialisation
During the fundraise in March 2017 we 
stated that we fully expected to complete 
our first commercial deal within 12 months 
of that date. We believe and understand 
that this is a crucial element of successful 
implementation of our business model. 
We continue to believe that this important 
milestone will be met.
Our lead programme, Orexin-1, aims to treat 
addiction by targeting the “craving” process 
itself and, therefore, can be applied across 
a broad range of substance disorders. We 
have continued to build our pre-clinical data 
package, including the recent presentation of 
data at Neuroscience 2017 in Washington, DC.
We have seen high levels of pre-clinical 
partnering interest and have entered into 
late stage commercial discussions.
Forming strategic alliances
Last year we announced we would no longer 
continue providing any fee-for-service 
capabilities choosing instead to seek 
longer-term risk-sharing strategic alliances.
In September 2016 we entered a 
new multi-target, risk-sharing strategic 
collaboration with Evotec AG (“Evotec”), 
a leading drug discovery and development 
alliance company. This deal enables us to 
increase the output of our engine whilst 
reducing risk and cost.
Alongside our own proprietary suite of 
cutting-edge technologies, the alliance with 
Evotec will expand our ability to generate 
commercially attractive pre-clinical assets 
to meet the pharmaceutical industry’s 
increasing demand for high quality, early 
stage drug candidates.
We will continue to seek similar, 
value-adding alliances. 
Successful fundraises
In September 2016, we completed a 
£5 million fundraise at 102 pence per 
share bringing in several new investors, 
including Calculus Capital Limited and 
Polar Capital LLP .
In March 2017 we completed a £7.0 million 
fundraise at 85 pence per share bringing 
in several new investors including Legal 
& General and Hargreave Hale which have 
strong track records in investing in the life 
science sector. This new cash enables us 
to progress and add to our pre-clinical 
pipeline and provides working capital 
for operations.
Building our discovery portfolio
We are constantly building our portfolio 
and will continue to invest into C4XD’ s 
core discovery activities in order to 
support our ambitions. 
Over the past 12 months, key drug 
discovery programmes in addiction 
and inflammation have advanced and our 
Taxonomy3
®
 DNA-based target discovery 
technology continues to produce novel 
target data in a number of commercially 
valuable disease areas. These targets can 
be addressed through our drug design 
platform including our Conformetrix 
and MolPlex chemistry technologies.
Critically, robust scientific and commercial 
intelligence gathering continues to drive 
selection criteria for inclusion in our portfolio.
Outlook
C4XD’ s strategy is delivering value for 
our shareholders and positioning us well 
to achieve our ambitions in drug discovery. 
The next year will continue to focus on 
securing deal revenue from the commercial 
discussions initiated this year, progressing 
our discovery candidates to pre-clinical 
development and commercialisation 
and continuing to replenish and build the 
pipeline by identifying novel and exciting 
drug targets. I am excited about what we 
can achieve, and I look forward to sharing 
this journey with you.
We have a complete range 
of tools to discover novel 
compounds and pioneer 
new disruptive approaches 
to drug discovery.

Neuroscience – addiction 
and neurodegeneration
Oral Orexin-1 Receptor 
Antagonist Programme
Our most advanced drug discovery 
programme aims to provide a novel oral 
medicine for addiction/substance use 
disorders, a substantial area of unmet 
medical need forecast to be worth an 
estimated $13 billion per annum by 2018
1
. 
Our pre-clinical candidate molecule, an 
oral selective Orexin-1 receptor antagonist, 
remains on schedule to be ready for clinical 
development by the end of 2017. Following 
completion of a successful 4.2Kg GMP 
manufacturing campaign of drug substance, 
the in-life phase of the pivotal GLP toxicology 
studies have been completed with the 
subsequent pathological analysis in 
progress. The pre-clinical profile of this 
candidate was recently presented at the 
annual conference organised by the Society 
for Neuroscience in Washington, DC, in 
November and was well received. This 
was the first scientific presentation of our 
candidate highlighting its strong efficacy in 
pre-clinical models of nicotine addiction. 
The Orexin-1 receptor is considered to be 
central to the brain’ s “craving” and “reward” 
pathways with pre-clinical efficacy observed 
in multiple addiction models. In a recently 
conducted pre-clinical pilot study, C4XD’ s 
candidate attenuated cocaine-induced brain 
dopamine elevation supporting its potential 
in this important therapeutic area and 
adding to the compelling pre-clinical data 
already achieved in nicotine addiction. 
The most advanced Orexin-1 antagonist 
currently in development was discovered 
by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd (“Actelion”) 
and following the acquisition of this company 
by Johnson & Johnson in 2017 for its 
advanced clinical portfolio is now being 
developed by Idorsia Ltd. Recently , the 
Orexin-1 pathway has also been strongly 
linked with the treatment of anxiety and 
it appears that this may be the focus 
of Idorsia’ s programme. Idorsia has 
completed the Phase 1 clinical study 
with this molecule in 2017 but not yet 
announced a Phase 2 study and so C4XD’ s 
programme remains very attractive and 
competitive. As a result, and in line with 
our stated goal, late stage commercial 
discussions are underway.
Parkinson’s disease (“PD”)
T owards the end of 2016, we completed 
our analysis on a publicly available PD 
dataset from the UK (Wellcome T rust) using 
C4XD’s proprietary target discovery 
technology T axonomy3
®
. This identified 
multiple novel disease associated genes 
in discrete patient sub-groups that could 
potentially provide an opportunity in 
stratified medicine. During 2017, we have 
extended our initial exciting results on 
understanding the genetic basis of this 
disorder and confirmed these discrete 
patient sub-groups. Using a US dataset, 
we have now found an additional 67 
genetic variants not previously associated 
with PD, complementing the 47 novel 
genetic variants identified in our initial study . 
The identification of these new genetic 
associations further confirms the power 
of T axonomy3
®
 to generate novel genetic 
insights into disease. T o put these findings 
into context, at the start of 2017 only 
40 PD associated genes were known in 
the scientific literature, and in September , 
Genentech and 23andme published the 
results of their collaboration in the scientific 
journal Nature Genetics (Nature Genetics 
49, 1511–1516, 2017), which identified 
a further 17 novel genetic associations.
Informatic analysis of proprietary genes 
discovered with T axonomy3
®
, together 
with known genetic susceptibility genes, 
has flagged new pathways relevant to the 
disease aetiology: identification of such 
disease-relevant pathways is a pivotal step 
in drug discovery. We are now selecting 
the optimum drug targets from the genes 
we have discovered that map to these 
pathways, to progress these targets 
to drug discovery programmes.
Alzheimer’s disease
Following the significant genetic 
discoveries in PD using our T axonomy3
®
 
platform we initiated analysis of an 
Alzheimer’ s disease dataset in 2017 which 
is now starting to deliver its preliminary 
results. Excitingly, as observed with the 
PD dataset we have identified discrete 
patient sub-groups in this disease that 
have not been described previously and 
characterisation of the novel genetic 
associations are underway. 
Oral NRF-2 Activator Programme
C4XD has designed and discovered 
novel potent activators of the NRF-2 
pathway , which is important in mediating 
lung diseases such as chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (“COPD”), pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (“P AH”) and other 
inflammatory diseases. COPD represents 
an area of substantial unmet medical 
need and a $41 billion market
2
 and, 
therefore, oral activators of NRF-2 are 
the subject of considerable interest to 
the pharmaceutical industry . GSK has filed 
several further patents on their molecules 
against this target in the last 12 months and 
is likely to be close to clinical development. 
Recently, C4XD’ s lead compounds have 
been shown to significantly increase 
NRF-2 activation in the lungs in pre-clinical 
studies following oral administration. 
This has previously been a significant 
challenge in this area, demonstrating 
the valuable properties of our molecules 
and highlighting the recent progress made 
in this programme. Studies continue to 
further optimise these molecules to enable 
the selection of a pre-clinical candidate.
Oral IL-17 Inhibitor Programme
As previously reported, our small molecule 
programme against Interleukin-17 (“IL-17”), 
a high value clinically validated target for 
inflammation and autoimmune diseases such 
as psoriasis (estimated to be worth $9 billion 
per annum
3
), has identified small molecules 
that can selectively block IL-17 activity whilst 
keeping the molecular size of the molecule 
in the traditional “drug-like” range. T o 
date, the identification of orally available 
small molecules has proved extremely 
challenging but they are highly sought 
after by the Pharma industry . Recently we 
identified potent compounds suitable for 
oral delivery and these are now the subject 
of in vivo studies. Commercially this is 
critical as current marketed drugs that 
target IL-17 are based on injectable 
C4X DISCOVERY HOLDINGS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 06
Strategic report monoclonal antibodies so an oral or topical 
treatment would increase the number of 
patients who can access drugs targeting 
this mechanism.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Analysis of a rheumatoid arthritis dataset 
using C4XD’ s proprietary target discovery 
technology T axonomy3
®
 identified 66 
novel genes that have not previously been 
associated with this major disease. Of these, 
nine were prioritised based on corroborative 
biology in the scientific literature and 
druggability . These potential targets are from 
protein families whose function suggests that 
any resulting drug molecules will have a very 
different biological impact on disease from 
that of existing rheumatoid arthritis therapies, 
enabling considerable therapeutic and 
commercial differentiation. T wo of these drug 
targets were nominated for evaluation as 
potential new pipeline programmes and the 
first of these targets has progressed into the 
hit to lead stage of discovery with molecules 
showing activity in a disease-relevant 
cell system.
Opportunistic programmes
Immuno-oncology
C4XD’ s Drug Discovery Engine is currently 
being used to target two key therapeutic 
targets for the treatment of cancer in 
the immuno-oncology space and these 
programmes are at the evaluation stage. 
These programmes are being progressed 
as part of the multi-target risk-sharing 
alliance with Evotec AG (“Evotec”) 
announced in September 2016.
Diabetes
In late 2016, C4XD was awarded a ~£140k 
Biomedical Catalyst feasibility study award 
from InnovateUK to progress hits for the 
GPR142 agonist programme for diabetes. 
T ype-2 diabetes (“T2D”) affects over 420 
million people worldwide, creating an 
enormous healthcare and socio-economic 
burden. The GPR142 receptor has been 
recently reported to be an exciting new 
target for the treatment of T2D with several 
advantages. Firstly , its activation results in 
insulin secretion but only in the presence 
of high blood sugar levels, avoiding the 
life-threatening side effect of low blood 
sugar associated with insulin-based 
therapies. Secondly, GPR142-based 
medicines would be orally administered, 
avoiding compliance issues caused by 
injectable therapies. Lilly is the leader in 
this area and announced it had initiated a 
Phase 1 clinical study with its candidate in 
July 2017. Prosecution of this programme 
has gone well and a lead compound will 
soon be tested in a pre-clinical oral glucose 
tolerance test.
Proprietary technology development
T axonomy3
®
 platform development
In the last year C4XD has significantly 
invested in updating its T axonomy3
®
 
software to enable the goal of being 
capable of analysing six disease datasets 
a year. A new version of the software was 
released in late 2017 which has doubled 
the analysis speed for gene-gene interaction 
analysis via refactoring the CPU code 
architecture. This will also facilitate a move 
to GPU analysis in the future should 
additional computational speed be 
required in the cloud environment.
Conformetrix data platform development 
including VR (virtual reality) visualisation
C4XD’ s novel drug design platform 
“Conformetrix” determines the 3D shapes 
of drug molecules from experimental 
data giving medicinal chemists new and 
unprecedented insights into the behaviour 
and physical properties of drug molecules. 
This enables the rapid design and discovery 
of better and safer drugs for diseases with 
high unmet medical need across broad 
therapeutic areas. During 2017, C4X’ s 
proprietary database of conformational 
3D data surpassed the milestone of 300 
drug molecules providing a rich resource 
for new drug design underpinning our 
unique and differentiated approach. 
One challenge with generating this data 
is that multiple 3D shape information 
is generated for each molecule (a “4D” 
ensemble of these individual 3D shapes) 
and scientific insights for design can be 
obtained from this data by comparing similar 
molecules that have different biological 
activity. Visualising comparisons such as 
these is difficult with current molecular 
software as data of this complexity is 
proprietary to C4XD.
C4XD has initiated the creation of a 
specialised visualiser to allow the viewing 
of C4XD’ s proprietary 4D molecular data 
to provide a revolutionary way of viewing 
and comparing molecules and collaborating 
with multiple users from both a 2D desktop 
environment and in a virtual world utilising 
the latest VR technology. C4XD has 
harnessed the “Unreal Engine” from the 
computer gaming firm Epic Games as a 
technological foundation for this visualiser . 
The choice was made to use this engine 
to provide a cutting-edge render originally 
built for the high-end gaming industry 
but applied to C4XD’ s proprietary data. 
This project has progressed well with 
the first release of this platform recently 
being deployed.

its programmes. In addition, a qualitative 
summary of performance is provided 
in the Interim Chairman’ s Statement and

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group continues to manage the 
inherent risk for the business by collaborating 
and partnering with pharmaceutical companies 
and research organisations. The principal 
risks to achieving full commercialisation and 
to becoming cash generative are outlined 
as follows:
T echnology
In common with other technology 
businesses developing new and innovative 
technical applications for the pharmaceutical 
sector, there is an inherent risk that C4XD’ s 
techniques will not enable its scientists to 
obtain the results required to generate 
meaningful value in its internal drug 
discovery programmes nor satisfy the 
needs of its customers. The Group cannot 
guarantee in advance that its technologies 
will meet either its internal demands or 
those of its partners. The Group works 
closely with its collaborators and partners 
to ensure that C4XD continues to meet 
their expectations. The C4XD technical 
development team continues to improve 
the core technology in terms of functionality 
and efficiency of output.
Collaborators and partners
C4XD’ s success is dependent upon how 
extensively the Group’ s techniques are 
successful in discovering drug candidates 
that are commercially and technically 
attractive to pharmaceutical company 
collaborators and partners.
Business model
A description of the Group’ s activities and 
how it seeks to add value is included in the 
“Our business model” section, the Interim 
Chairman’ s Statement and the CEO’ s 
Statement on pages 4 to 7.
Review of the business 
and future developments
C4XD continues to progress its proprietary 
programmes and focus its activities on the 
delivery of its strategic ambitions and 
acquiring complementary technologies. 
Grant income received by the Group is 
netted off administrative expenses and 
is not included within revenue.
Brexit
C4XD has considered the potential impact 
of Brexit on the business and perceives the 
risk to be minimal. We will continue to review 
the situation, in particular the harmonisation 
of drug approval regulations and patent law, 
as well as any potential impact on existing 
staff and planned staff recruitment caused 
by any changes in immigration legislation.
Key performance indicators
The key performance indicators 
for the business in its current stage of 
development are the progression of the 
Group’ s proprietary pipeline projects 
through the relevant milestones, together 
with collaborations with industry partners 
and other major bodies.
In addition, the management of and 
control of cash balances is a priority for the 
Group and this is budgeted and monitored 
closely to ensure that the Group maintains 
adequate liquid resources to meet financial 
commitments as they arise.

Results
Revenue for the 12 months ended 
31 July 2017 amounted to £143,000 
(2016: £279,000). These revenues were 
largely generated through collaborations 
with our partners. Last year the Group 
ceased its fee-for-service offering choosing 
only to work on a collaborative risk and 
revenue sharing basis. Grants secured are 
accounted for as a reduction in research 
and development (“R&D”) expenses.
R&D expenses, which comprise payroll 
costs, materials spend and third party 
contract development costs, have 
increased by 16% to £6,100,000 for the 
year ended 31 July 2017 (2016: £5,239,000). 
This reflects both the increase in drug 
discovery activity and the continued 
development of lead drug candidates 
towards commercialisation.
Our cash position and 
fundraising will allow 
C4XD to continue with its 
plan of becoming the 
world’s most productive 
Drug Discovery Engine.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

Corporate governance C4XD is committed to high standards 
of corporate governance and the Board 
acknowledges the importance of the 
principles set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code published by the 
Financial Reporting Council in 
September 2014 (the “Code”).
Although the Code is not mandatory 
for companies admitted to AIM, the 
Group has adopted many, although 
not all, aspects of the code as set 
out in this report.
The Board
The Group is controlled through its Board 
of Directors. The Board’ s main roles are to 
provide overall strategy and direction for 
the Group and to ensure that the necessary 
financial and other resources are made 
available to enable those objectives to be 
met. It has a schedule of matters reserved 
for its approval, including, but not limited to, 
decisions on strategy and risk management, 
approval of budgets, acquisitions and 
disposals, major capital expenditure, legal 
and insurance issues, board structure and 
the appointment of advisers. In some areas 
responsibility is delegated to Committees 
of the Board within clearly defined terms 
of reference.
Once the strategic and financial objectives 
of the Group have been set by the Board 
it is the role of the Chief Executive Officer 
to ensure that through the day-to-day 
management of the Group’ s business 
they are achieved.
All Directors are subject to election by the 
shareholders at the next general meeting 
following appointment to the Board and 
to re-election at intervals of not more 
than three years.
As at 31 July 2017, the Board comprised 
the Non-Executive Interim Chairman, the 
Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial 
Officer, the Chief Scientific Officer and two 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The names of the current Directors, together 
with their biographical details and any 
other directorships, are set out on pages 
10 and 11. The Directors at 31 July 2017 
served throughout the period under review, 
with the exception of the Chief Financial 
Officer and the Chief Scientific Officer, who 
joined the Board on 22 November 2016. 
The contracts of the Non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection 
by shareholders at the AGM.
The Board considers its independent 
Non-Executive Directors to be independent 
in character and judgement. No Non-Executive 
Director has had a material business 
relationship with the Group; receives 
remuneration other than a Director’ s fee 
and share options (save as disclosed); has 
close family ties with any of the Group’ s 
advisers, Directors or senior employees; or 
holds cross-directorships. The independent 
Non-Executive Directors are Sam Williams, 
Harry Finch and Alex Stevenson. Prior to his 
appointment as a Non-Executive Director, 
Sam Williams was Chief Executive of C4XD. 
Alex Stevenson is a director and shareholder 
in Aquarius Equity Partners, a major 
shareholder of the Group.
The Non-Executive Directors constructively 
challenge and help develop proposals on 
strategy and bring strong, independent 
judgement, knowledge and experience 
to the Board’ s deliberations.
The Directors are given access to 
independent professional advice at the 
Group’ s expense, when the Directors deem 
it is necessary in order for them to carry out 
their responsibilities.
The Board meets at least six times a year 
and the Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee normally meet at least twice 
a year. 
The Board receives appropriate and timely 
information prior to each meeting, with a 
formal agenda and Board and Committee 
papers being distributed several days 
before meetings take place. Any Director 
may challenge Group proposals and 
decisions are taken democratically after 
discussion. Any Director who feels that 
any concern remains unresolved after 
discussion may ask for that concern to be 
noted in the minutes of the meeting. Any 
specific actions arising from such meetings 
are agreed by the Board and then followed 
up by management. 
The Group maintains, for its Directors 
and Officers, liability insurance for any 
claims against them in that capacity.
The Group has effective procedures in 
place to deal with conflicts of interest. 
The Board is aware of other commitments 
of its Directors and changes to these 
commitments are reported to the Board.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 12
Corporate governance The roles of the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive Officer
The division of responsibilities between 
the Chairman of the Board and the 
Chief Executive Officer is clearly defined. 
The Chairman leads the Board in the 
determination of its strategy and in the 
achievement of its objectives. The Chairman 
is responsible for organising the business 
of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness 
and setting its agenda. The Chairman 
is a Non-Executive Director and has no 
involvement in the day-to-day business 
of the Group. The Chairman facilitates the 
effective contribution of Non-Executive 
Directors and constructive relations between 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors, 
ensures Directors receive accurate, timely 
and clear information and facilitates effective 
communication with shareholders.
The Chief Executive Officer has direct 
charge of the Group on a day-to-day basis 
and is accountable to the Board for the 
financial and operational performance 
of the Group.
Professional development
On appointment, each Director takes 
part in an induction programme in which 
they receive comprehensive information 
about the Group, the role of the Board 
and the matters reserved for its decision, 
the terms of reference and membership 
of the Board and Committees and the 
powers delegated to those Committees, 
the Group’ s corporate governance 
practices and procedures, including the 
powers reserved to the Group’ s most 
senior executives, and the latest financial 
information about the Group. Throughout 
their period in office the Directors are 
updated on the Group’ s business, the 
competitive environment in which it 
operates, corporate social responsibility 
matters and other changes affecting the 
Group and the industry it operates in as 
a whole.
Performance evaluation
The Board has established a formal 
process for the annual evaluation of the 
performance of the Executive Directors. 
This evaluation is based on a performance 
evaluation questionnaire completed by 
each Executive Director. The evaluation 
of the Chief Executive Officer is performed 
by the Chairman and the evaluation of the 
other Executive Directors is performed 
by the Chief Executive Officer.
Information
Board reports and papers are circulated 
to the Directors in advance of the relevant 
Board or Committee meeting. These 
papers are supplemented by information 
specifically requested by the Directors 
from time to time. Minutes of Board and 
Committee meetings are circulated to all 
Board members.
The Non-Executive Directors receive 
monthly management accounts and 
regular management reports and 
information which enable them to 
scrutinise Group and management 
performance against agreed objectives.
Director dealings in Group shares
The Group has adopted a model code 
for Directors’ dealings in securities of the 
Group which is appropriate for a company 
quoted on AIM. The Directors comply with 
Rule 21 of the AIM Rules relating to directors’ 
and applicable employees’ dealings.
Investor relations
The Interim Chairman and other 
Non-Executive Directors are available 
to shareholders to discuss strategy and 
governance issues at a shareholder’s 
request. In accordance with AIM Rule 26, 
there is an investors section on the Group’ s 
website, www.c4xdiscovery.com, which is 
kept up to date.
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
At the AGM, separate resolutions 
will be proposed for each substantially 
different issue. The outcome of the voting 
on AGM resolutions is disclosed by 
means of an announcement on the 
London Stock Exchange.
Board Committees 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee comprises 
Sam Williams and Harry Finch; Sam Williams 
is Chairman. The Committee is responsible 
for monitoring the quality of internal controls, 
ensuring that the financial performance 
of the Group is properly measured and 
reported on and reviewing reports from 
the Group’ s auditors relating to the Group’ s 
accounting and internal controls, in all 
cases having due regard to the interests 
of shareholders.
The Audit Committee’ s primary 
responsibilities are to review and monitor: 
•  the annual report and accounts 
and preliminary and interim results 
and statements of the Group; 
•  the appropriateness of accounting 
policies and the critical judgements 
and estimates; 
•  the relevance of developments in 
accounting and reporting requirements; 
•  the effectiveness of internal controls 
and risk management systems; 
•  the auditors’ plan for the year-end audit; 
•  the formal engagement terms, 
performance, objectivity and 
independence of the auditors, 
including the extent of non-audit 
work undertaken by the auditors; and 
•  the audit and non-audit fees of the 
auditors. These are set out in note 6 
to the financial statements. 
The Audit Committee reports to the Board 
on its activities and recommendations. 
The Committee has recommended to 
the Board that a resolution reappointing 
KPMG LLP as external auditors be put 
to the shareholders at the AGM.

Corporate governance Corporate governance statement continued
Board Committees continued 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee 
comprises Harry Finch, who is Chairman 
of the Committee, and Alex Stevenson. 
The Committee is responsible for establishing 
a formal and transparent procedure for 
developing policy on executive remuneration 
and for setting the remuneration of 
individual Directors. Full details of 
Directors’ remuneration and remuneration 
policy are set out on pages 15 to 17.
Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee comprises 
Alex Stevenson, who is Chairman of the 
Committee, and Sam Williams. The 
Committee is responsible for identifying 
and nominating, for the approval of the 
Board, candidates to fill Board vacancies 
as and when they arise. 
Internal controls and risk management 
The Board has overall responsibility for 
the Group’ s system of internal controls, 
including reviewing the effectiveness of 
these controls and the processes in place 
for risk management. The role of the 
Executive Director is to implement the 
Board’ s policies on risk and control and 
provide assurance on compliance with 
these policies. The processes and 
procedures in place are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risk and 
can therefore only provide a reasonable 
and not an absolute assurance against 
material misstatements or losses. 
Executive Directors have a close 
involvement with all day-to-day operations 
and also meet with staff on a regular basis 
to identify and review business risks, the 
controls needed to minimise those risks 
and the effectiveness of controls in place. 
Business risks are monitored and updated 
on a regular basis. Insurance is in place 
where appropriate. 
Some key features of the internal control 
system are: 
(i)  annual budgets and rolling forecasts 
reviewed and approved by the Board; 
(ii)  monthly management accounts 
information compared and reconciled 
with budgets; 
(iii)  the Group has written operational, 
accounting and employment policies 
in place;
(iv)  the Board actively identifies and 
evaluates the risks inherent in the 
business and ensures that appropriate 
controls and procedures are in place 
to manage these risks; 
(v)  the Group has well established 
financial reporting and approval 
systems and procedures which cover 
all key transactional processes and 
Group commitments; and 
(iv)  the Group has a uniform system 
of investment appraisal. 
Risk management 
Details of the technical, product, market 
and operational risks of the business are 
disclosed in the Strategic Report. 
Details of the Group’ s financial risk 
management objectives and policies 
are disclosed in note 25 to the 
financial statements. 
The Directors do not consider that the 
business is, at this time, significantly 
exposed to credit or interest risk and as 
such these risks are not considered to be 
material for an assessment of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and results. 
The Group seeks to manage liquidity 
by ensuring funds are available to meet 
foreseeable needs and to invest cash 
assets safely and profitably. The Group 
had cash, cash equivalent and deposit 
balances of £6,031,000 at 31 July 2017 
(2016: £1,328,000). Cash deposits are 
spread across a range of financial 
institutions with investment grade credit 
status. Deposits are invested in a mixture 
of fixed-term and notice accounts. The 
Board approves all financial institutions 
before deposits are placed and regularly 
reviews the level of funds allocated to 
each institution.

Corporate governance Directors’ remuneration report
As a company listed on AIM, the Group is 
not required by the Companies Act 2006 to 
prepare a Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
The Board has, however, provided certain 
information in relation to the remuneration 
policy of the Group as set out in this report. 
Information not subject to audit 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises 
Harry Finch, who is Chairman of the 
Committee, Sam Williams and Alex Stevenson. 
The Committee may invite anyone it deems 
appropriate to attend and advise at meetings. 
The Committee is responsible for 
establishing a formal and transparent 
procedure for developing policy on 
executive remuneration and for setting the 
remuneration of the Directors and certain 
senior management, as well as reviewing 
the performance of the Executive Directors 
of the Group. 
The overall policy of the Board is to ensure 
that executive management are provided 
with appropriate incentives to encourage 
enhanced performance and are, in a fair 
and responsible manner, rewarded for their 
contribution to the success of the Group, 
including, where appropriate, bonuses 
and the award of share options. The 
Remuneration Committee takes into 
account the remuneration practices 
adopted in similar businesses and best 
practice in other AIM-listed businesses 
as well as in the general market. 
There are three main elements to the 
remuneration packages for Executive 
Directors and senior management: 
Basic annual salary 
The base salary is reviewed annually. 
The review process is undertaken by 
the Remuneration Committee and takes 
into account several factors, including the 
current position and development of the 
Group, individual contributions and market 
salaries for comparable organisations.
Other taxable benefits 
The Group provides an occupational 
pension scheme for employees, including 
Executive Directors. The Group operates 
a voluntary, subsidised private health 
insurance scheme for employees, 
including Executive Directors. 
The Group does not provide any other 
taxable benefits for Executives. 
Discretionary annual bonus 
All Executive Directors and employees 
are eligible for a discretionary annual 
bonus. This takes into account individual 
contribution, business performance and 
technical and commercial progress, along 
with financial results. 
Discretionary share option schemes 
All Directors and employees are eligible 
to receive discretionary share options to 
be granted in accordance with the Group’ s 
approved share option scheme. Details 
of the grants made under the scheme 
are provided in note 20 to the financial 
statements. This takes into account the 
need to motivate and retain key individuals. 
Details of share option grants made to 
Directors are shown in the table below. 
Remuneration policy for 
Non-Executive Directors 
Non-Executives receive a fixed fee and do 
not receive any pension payments or other 
benefits, but they do participate in the 
share option scheme at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee.

Corporate governance Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the annual report and the Group and parent 
company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare Group and parent company 
financial statements for each financial year. 
As required by the AIM Rules of the 
London Stock Exchange they are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
EU (IFRSs as adopted by the EU) and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the parent company financial statements 
on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and parent company and of their profit or 
loss for that period. In preparing each of 
the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
•  select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently; 
•  make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable, relevant and reliable; 
•  state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU; 
•  assess the Group and parent company’ s 
ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern; and 
•  use the going concern basis of accounting 
unless they either intend to liquidate 
the Group or the parent company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’ s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are responsible for such 
internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error , and have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of 
the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic Report and a 
Directors’ Report that complies with 
that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’ s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Corporate governance Independent auditors’ report
to the members of C4X Discovery Holdings plc
1. Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of 
C4X Discovery Holdings plc (“the Company”) 
for the year ended 31 July 2017 which comprise 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity, the Company Statement 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position, the Company 
Statement of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the 
Company Cash Flow Statement, and the 
related notes, including the accounting 
policies in note 3.
In our opinion:
•  the financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’ s and 
of the parent Company’ s affairs as at 
31 July 2017 and of the Group’ s loss 
for the year then ended;
•  the group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
•  the parent Company financial 
statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
•  the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities are described below. We 
have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities 
under, and are independent of the Group 
in accordance with, UK ethical requirements 
including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied 
to listed entities. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is a sufficient 
and appropriate basis for our opinion.
Overview
Materiality: Group financial statements £65,000 (2016: £51,000)
0.75% (2016: 0.72%) of total expenses

Risks of material misstatement vs 2016
Recurring risks Impairment of group goodwill and

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, 
including those matters which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters. In arriving at our audit opinion, the key audit matters, in decreasing order 
of audit significance, were as follows:
The risk Our response
Impairment of 
group goodwill 
and intangible 
assets and parent’s 
investment in 
subsidiaries
(Group: £1.8 million; 
2016: £1.9million; 
Parent: £2.1 million; 
2016: £2.0 million)
Refer to page 33 
(accounting policy) 
and pages 41-42 
(financial 
disclosures).
Forecast based valuation:
Goodwill and intangible 
assets in the Group and the 
Parent’ s investment in 
subsidiaries are significant 
and at risk of impairment 
due to the current loss 
making position of the 
group. The estimated 
recoverable amount is 
subjective due to the 
inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting 
and discounting future 
cash flows.
Our procedures included:
•  Benchmarking assumptions: 
Comparing the group’ s 
assumptions to externally 
derived data relating to the key 
inputs of total expected licence 
value, success rates and 
discount rates;
•  Sensitivity analysis: Performing 
break even analysis on each of 
the assumptions noted above;
•  Comparing valuations: 
Comparing the sum of the 
discounted cash flows to the 
group’ s market capitalisation 
to assess the reasonableness 
of those cash flows; and
•  Assessing transparency: 
Assessing whether the group’ s 
and parent company’ s 
disclosures describing the 
sensitivity of the impairment 
assessment to changes in key 
assumptions accurately reflect 
the risks inherent in the valuation 
of goodwill and intangible assets 
and valuation of investment in 
subsidiaries respectively.

3. Our application of materiality and 
an overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the group financial 
statements as a whole was set at £65,000 
(2016: £51,000) determined with reference 
to a benchmark of group total expenses, 
of which it represents 0.75% (2016: 0.72%).
We consider total expenses to be the most 
appropriate benchmark as it is a more 
stable benchmark reflecting the group’ s 
focus on research activities.
Materiality for the parent company financial 
statements as a whole was set at £16,000 
(2016: £50,000), determined with reference 
to a benchmark of company total assets of 
which it represents 0.75% (2016: 0.72%).
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee 
any corrected or uncorrected identified 
misstatements exceeding £3,250 (2016: 
£3,000), in addition to other identified 
misstatements that we believe warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the group’ s six (2016: six) reporting 
components, two (2016: two), one of which 
is the parent Company, were subjected to 
full scope audits for group purposes, using 
component materialities, which ranged 
from £16,000 to £64,000 (2016: £50,000), 
having regard to the mix of size and risk 
profile of the Group across the 
components. The group audit team 
performed the audit of both components.
The components within the scope of our 
work accounted for the percentages 
illustrated opposite.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 22 4. We have nothing to report 
on going concern
We are required to report to you if we have 
concluded that the use of the going concern 
basis of accounting is inappropriate or 
there is an undisclosed material uncertainty 
that may cast significant doubt over the 
use of that basis for a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of 
the financial statements. We have nothing 
to report in these respects.
5. We have nothing to report on the 
other information in the Annual Report
The directors are responsible for the other 
information presented in the Annual Report 
together with the financial statements. Our 
opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, accordingly , 
we do not express an audit opinion or, 
except as explicitly stated below, any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider 
whether, based on our financial statements 
audit work, the information therein is 
materially misstated or inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our audit knowledge. 
Based solely on that work we have not 
identified material misstatements in the 
other information.
Strategic report and directors’ report
Based solely on our work on the 
other information:
•  we have not identified material 
misstatements in the strategic report 
and the directors’ report;
•  in our opinion the information given 
in those reports for the financial year 
is consistent with the financial 
statements; and
•  in our opinion those reports have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
6. We have nothing to report on the 
other matters on which we are required 
to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
•  the parent Company financial 
statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
•  certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
•  we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7. Respective responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement 
set out on page 20, the directors are 
responsible for: the preparation of the 
financial statements including being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view; 
such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error; assessing the Group and 
parent Company’ s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern; and 
using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either intend to 
liquidate the Group or the parent 
Company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in 
an auditor’ s report. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but does not 
guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities 
is provided on the FRC’ s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
8. The purpose of our audit work and 
to whom we owe our responsibilities
Our report is made solely to the Company’ s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’ s 
members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’ s report and for 
no other purpose. T o the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’ s members, 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.

Financial statements
C4X DISCOVERY HOLDINGS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 28 1. Reporting entity
C4X Discovery Holdings plc (the “Company”) is an AIM-listed company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
These Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group” 
and individually as “Group entities”) for the year ended 31 July 2017.
The financial statements of the Company and the Group for the year ended 31 July 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board 
of Directors on 14 December 2017 and the consolidated statement of financial position was signed on the Board’ s behalf by Clive Dix.
The Company has elected to take the exemption under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present the parent company’ s 
statement of comprehensive income. The parent company’ s result for the year ended 31 July 2017 was £nil (2016: £nil).
The significant accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 3.
2. Basis of preparation
(a) Statement of compliance
The Group’ s and parent company’ s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations as they apply to the 
financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31 July 2017.
(b) Basis of measurement 
The Company and Group financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
The methods used to measure fair values of assets and liabilities are discussed in the respective notes in note 3 below.
(c) Going concern 
The Interim Chairman’ s and CEO’ s Statements on pages 4 to 7 outline the business activities of the Group along with the factors which 
may affect its future development and performance. The Group’ s financial position is discussed in the Financial Review on page 9 along 
with details of its cash flow and liquidity. Note 25 to the financial statements sets out the Group’ s financial risks and the management 
of those risks. 
Having prepared management forecasts and made appropriate enquiries, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate 
resources for the foreseeable future. A majority of expenses are discretionary and within the control of management. Accordingly they 
have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group and Company financial statements. However, given the nature 
of the Group’ s biotechnology-based business and need for ongoing investment in its drug development activities, the Group will be 
looking to raise additional funds in the future to allow for continued development.
(d) Functional and presentational currency 
These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Group’ s functional currency. All financial information presented 
has been rounded to the nearest thousand.
(e) Use of estimates and judgements 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the amounts reported 
for assets and liabilities as at the reporting date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. The nature of 
estimation means that actual amounts could differ from those estimates. Estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the 
financial statements are continually reviewed and revised as necessary. 
 While every effort is made to ensure that such estimates and judgements are reasonable, by their nature they are uncertain and, as such, 
changes in estimates and judgements may have a material impact on the financial statements.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

2. Basis of preparation continued
(e) Use of estimates and judgements continued
Intangible fixed assets and goodwill
The Group tests annually whether intangible fixed assets and goodwill have suffered any impairment. The potential recoverable amounts 
of intangible fixed assets and goodwill have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use 
of estimates both in arriving at the expected future cash flows and the application of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the 
present value of these flows. There is a degree of judgement involved in making these assessments of attributable values on acquisition 
and making impairment assessments. The assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are included in notes 12 and 13. 
Equity-settled share-based payments
The determination of share-based payment costs requires: the selection of an appropriate valuation method; consideration as to 
the inputs necessary for the valuation model chosen; judgement regarding when and if performance conditions will be met; and the 
estimation of the number of awards that will ultimately vest. Inputs required for this arise from judgements relating to the future volatility 
of the share price of C4XD and comparable companies, the Group’ s expected dividend yields, risk-free interest rates and expected lives 
of the options. The Directors draw on a variety of sources to aid in the determination of the appropriate data to use in such calculations. 
The share-based payment expense is most sensitive to vesting assumptions and to the future volatility of the future share price factor. 
Further information is included in note 3.
T axation 
Management judgement is required to determine the amount of tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing 
and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. The carrying value of the 
unrecognised tax losses at 31 July 2017 was £1,425,000 (2016: £830,000). The value of the net deferred tax asset not recognised at the 
year end is £14,000 (2016: net liability of £12,000). Management judgement is similarly required in estimating the value of the research 
and development income tax credit receivable of £1,700,000 (2016: £1,400,000). Further information is included in note 9.
3. Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below are consistent with those of the previous financial year and are applied consistently by Group entities. 
(a) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of C4X Discovery Holdings plc and the entities it controls (its subsidiaries) 
drawn up to 31 July each year. 
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group. 
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
• the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
Transaction costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs 
in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies. All C4X Discovery 
Holdings plc’ s subsidiaries are 100% owned. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date control passes.
All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. 
Subsidiaries’ accounting policies are amended where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 30 3. Significant accounting policies continued
(b) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of 
exchange ruling at the reporting date. All differences are taken to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
(c) Segmental reporting
An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’ s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about 
resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. 
As at the reporting date the Group operated with only a single segment.
(d) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods or services, excluding 
discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duties.
The Group’ s revenues to date comprise amounts earned under joint development agreements and individual project development 
programmes in respect of novel small molecule therapies. 
Revenues received from development programmes are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period that the development work 
is being performed as measured by contractual milestones. Revenue is not recognised where there is uncertainty regarding the achievement 
of such milestones and where either revenue has not been paid or the customer has the right to recoup advance payments.
(e) Government grants
Government grants are recognised when it is reasonable to expect that the grants will be received and that all related conditions are 
met, usually on submission of a valid claim for payment. 
Government grants of a revenue nature are deducted from administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income in line with the terms of the underlying grant agreement.
(f) Research and development
Research costs are charged in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as they are incurred. Development costs will be 
capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. Such intangible assets will be 
amortised on a straight-line basis from the point at which the assets are ready for use over the period of the expected benefit, and will 
be reviewed for impairment at each reporting date based on the circumstances at the reporting date.
The criteria for recognising expenditure as an asset are:
• it is technically feasible to complete the product;
• management intends to complete the product and use or sell it;
• there is an ability to use or sell the product;
• it can be demonstrated how the product will generate probable future economic benefits; 
• adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete the development, use and sale of the product; and
• expenditure attributable to the product can be reliably measured.
Development costs are currently charged against income as incurred since the criteria for their recognition as an asset are not met.
(g) Lease payments
Rentals payable under operating leases, which are leases where the lessor retains a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of the 
underlying asset, are charged in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. 
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense over the term of the lease.

(h) Finance income
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested. Interest income is recognised as interest accrues using the effective 
interest rate method.
(i) Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or 
paid to, the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted 
by the reporting date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements with the following exceptions:
•  where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss; and
•  in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and tax laws that have been 
enacted or substantially enacted by the date and which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the 
deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
differences can be utilised. An asset is not recognised to the extent that the transfer of economic benefits in the future is uncertain.
(j) T angible fixed assets
Property, plant and equipment assets are recognised initially at cost. After initial recognition, these assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value 
of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating 
as intended. 
Depreciation is computed by allocating the depreciable amount of an asset on a systematic basis over its useful life and is applied 
separately to each identifiable component.
The following bases and rates are used to depreciate classes of assets:
Building improvements – straight line over remainder of lease period
Office equipment, fixtures and fittings – straight line over three years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful lives and residual values 
are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
A property, plant and equipment item is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from 
the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is included in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income in the period of derecognition.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 32 3. Significant accounting policies continued
(k) Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired either as part of a business combination or from contractual or other legal rights are recognised separately 
from goodwill provided they are separable and their fair value can be measured reliably. This includes the costs associated with acquiring 
and registering patents in respect of intellectual property rights.
Where intangible assets recognised have finite lives, after initial recognition their carrying value is amortised on a straight-line basis over 
those lives. The nature of those intangibles recognised and their estimated useful lives are as follows:
Patents – straight line over 20 years
IP assets – straight line over five years
Software – straight line over five years
(l) Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised 
but is tested annually for impairment.
(m) Impairment of assets
At each reporting date the Group reviews the carrying value of its plant, equipment, intangible assets and goodwill to determine 
whether there is an indication that these assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, or when annual 
impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an assessment of the asset’ s recoverable amount.
An asset’ s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’ s or cash-generating unit’ s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and 
is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other 
assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is 
written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In 
determining fair value less costs of disposal, an appropriate valuation model is used, these calculations corroborated by valuation multiples, 
or other available fair value indicators. Impairment losses on continuing operations are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no 
longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss 
is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’ s recoverable amount since the last impairment 
loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount 
cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income unless the asset is carried at 
its revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a valuation increase. After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted 
in future periods to allocate the asset’ s revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
The carrying values of plant, equipment, intangible assets and goodwill as at the reporting date have not been subjected to impairment charges.
(n) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the Company statement of financial position at cost less provision for any impairment.

3. Significant accounting policies continued
(o) Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 60 day terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value 
and recoverable amount. The time value of money is not material.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full. Significant financial 
difficulties faced by the customer, probability that the customer will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default in payments 
are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’ s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying 
value of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income within administrative expenses. 
When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
(p) Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash on deposit
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at hand and deposits with maturities of three months or less. Short-term investments 
and cash on deposit comprise deposits with maturities of more than three months, but no greater than 12 months.
(q) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value. They are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
(r) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made 
of the amount of the obligation.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, net of any expected 
reimbursement, but only where recoverability of such reimbursement is virtually certain. 
Provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risk specific to the liability. Where discounting 
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
There were no provisions at 31 July 2017 (2016: nil).
(s) Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classified as 
financial assets and liabilities at fair value through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The Group determines the 
classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end. 
A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
At the year end, the Group had no financial assets or liabilities designated at fair value through the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income (2016: £nil).
(t) Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
Following the adoption of IAS 32 financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet 
the following two conditions: 
•  they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets 
or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and 
•  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’ s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’ s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company’ s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
T o the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified 
takes the legal form of the Company’ s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and 
share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 
Financial statements
C4X DISCOVERY HOLDINGS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 34 3. Significant accounting policies continued
(u) Share capital
Proceeds on issue of shares are included in shareholders’ equity, net of transaction costs. The carrying amount is not remeasured 
in subsequent years.
(v) Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured with reference to the fair value at the date of grant, recognised on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’ s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured 
using a suitable option pricing model.
At each reporting date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and management’ s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, 
the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is 
recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference 
between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. 
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where awards are granted to the employees of a subsidiary company, the fair value of the awards at grant date is recorded in the 
Company’ s financial statements as an increase in the value of the investment with a corresponding increase in equity via the share-based 
payment reserve.
(w) Defined contribution pension scheme
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an 
independently administered fund. The amounts charged against profits represent the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of 
the accounting period.
(x) New accounting standards and interpretations 
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been endorsed by the EU and are effective for annual 
periods commencing on or after 1 January 2017 or ending 31 July 2018 or thereafter and have not been applied in preparing these 
consolidated financial statements and those that are relevant to the Group are summarised below. None of these are expected to have 
a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group in the period of initial application.

4. Acquisitions of businesses
Acquisition of subsidiary
On 1 March 2016, the Group acquired all of the ordinary shares in Adorial Limited together with its subsidiaries for a consideration of 
£1,670,700, of which £1,598,700 was satisfied by the issue of 1,508,207 ordinary shares at a price of 106 pence, being a 3% premium to 
the closing price of a C4XD share on 29 February 2016, and £72,000 in cash. The privately held company has a key proprietary genetic 
technology platform, T axonomy3
®
, for the identification of novel drug targets. 
In the five months to 31 July 2016 the subsidiary contributed a pre-tax loss of £75,000 to the consolidated pre-tax loss for the year. 
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 August 2015, Group revenue would have been unchanged, as Adorial currently has no revenue, 
and the pre-tax loss would have been an estimated £75,000 higher than currently shown. In determining these amounts, management 
has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition occurred 
on 1 August 2015.

Reductions in the main rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) were 
substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.
An additional reduction to 17% (effective 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. This will reduce the Group’ s 
future tax charge accordingly.
The Group has accumulated losses available to carry forward against future trading profits. The estimated value of the deferred tax 
asset, measured at a standard rate of 17% (2016: 18%) is £1,425,000 (2016: £830,000), of which £nil (2016: £nil) has been recognised. 
Remaining tax losses have not been recognised as an asset as it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
The Group also has a deferred tax liability being accelerated capital allowances, for which the tax, measured at a standard rate 
of 17% (2016: 18%), is £30,000 (2016: £32,000).
The Group has a deferred tax asset for share-based payments, for which the tax, measured at a standard rate of 17% (2016: 18%), 
is £44,000 (2016: £20,000).
The net deferred tax asset of £14,000 has not been recognised (2016: the net deferred tax liability of £12,000 was not recognised 
as it was covered by accumulated tax losses).

Patents are amortised on a straight-line basis over 20 years. Amortisation provided during the period is recognised in administrative 
expenses. The Group does not believe that any of its patents in isolation is material to the business.
IP assets and software are amortised on a straight-line basis over five years. Amortisation provided during the period is recognised 
in administrative expenses. 
The recoverable amount of the combined value of intangible assets and goodwill exceeds the carrying value by 139%. The key assumptions 
considered most sensitive for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rate applied to the net present value calculations, 
the success rates of the project and the total expected licence value. Management has used a conservative discount rate of 25%. Due to 
the headroom which exists between the recoverable amount and the carrying value, there is no reasonable possible change in these 
assumptions that would cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount. 
The Company has no intangible assets.

of them being granted. The exercise price was set at 90 pence, being the average of the mid-market closing price over the three days 
prior to 17 May 2017. The fair value benefit is measured using a Black Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the share options were issued.
Share options are awarded to management and key staff as a mechanism for attracting and retaining key members of staff. The options 
are granted at no lower than either: (i) market price on the day preceding grant; or (ii) in the event of abnormal price movements at an 
average market price for the week preceding grant date. Options may be granted at prices higher than the market price on the day 
preceding grant where the Board believes it is appropriate to do so. These options vest over a three year period from the date of grant 
and are exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the award. Exercise of the award is subject to the employee remaining a full-time member 
of staff at the point of exercise. The fair value benefit is measured using a binomial valuation model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the share options were issued. 
The following tables illustrate the number and weighted average exercise prices of, and movements in, share options during the year.

Weighted average share price at date of grant (pence) 99.36 77.00
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily 
be the actual outcome.
No other features of options granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
21. Merger reserve 
The Group £000
As at 31 July 2015, 31 July 2016 and 31 July 2017 920
The merger reserve arises as a result of the reverse acquisition requirements of IFRS 3, meaning the consolidated accounts are 
presented as a continuation of the C4X Discovery Limited accounts along with the share capital structure of the legal parent company 
(C4X Discovery Holdings plc).

25. Financial risk management
Overview
This note presents information about the Group’ s exposure to various kinds of financial risks, the Group’ s objectives, policies 
and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’ s management of capital. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’ s risk management framework. The Executive Directors 
report regularly to the Board on Group risk management.
Capital risk management
The Group reviews its forecast capital requirements on a half-yearly basis to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue 
as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, 
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 19 to 23 and in the Group consolidated statement of changes in equity. T otal equity 
was £9,060,000 at 31 July 2017 (£4,305,000 at 31 July 2016).
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Liquidity risk
The Group’ s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that, as far as possible, it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities 
when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’ s reputation.
The Group manages all of its external bank relationships centrally in accordance with defined treasury policies. The policies include the 
minimum acceptable credit rating of relationship banks and financial transaction authority limits. Any material change to the Group’ s 
principal banking facility requires Board approval. The Group seeks to mitigate the risk of bank failure by ensuring that it maintains 
relationships with a number of investment grade banks.
At the reporting date the Group was cash positive with no outstanding borrowings.

The values disclosed in the above table are carrying values. The Board considers that the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities 
approximates to their fair value.
The main risks arising from the Group’ s financial instruments are credit risk and foreign currency risk. The Board of Directors reviews 
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below.
Credit risk
The Group’ s principal financial assets are cash, cash equivalents and deposits. The Group seeks to limit the level of credit risk on the cash 
balances by only depositing surplus liquid funds with multiple counterparty banks that have investment grade credit ratings.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result 
that the Group’ s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group’ s maximum exposure is the carrying amount of trade receivables as 
disclosed in note 15, which was neither past due nor impaired. All trade receivables are ultimately overseen by the Chief Executive Officer 
and are managed on a day-to-day basis by the finance team. Credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to cash, cash equivalents and deposits is the carrying value at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional 
currency of the Group. These are primarily US Dollars (“USD”) and Euros. Transactions outside of these currencies are limited.
The Group may use forward exchange contracts as an economic hedge against currency risk, where cash flow can be judged with 
reasonable certainty. Foreign exchange swaps and options may be used to hedge foreign currency receipts in the event that the timing 
of the receipt is less certain. 
There were no open forward contracts as at 31 July 2017 or at 31 July 2016 and the Group did not enter into any such contracts during 
2017 nor 2016.

Sensitivity analysis to movement in exchange rates
Given the immaterial net payable balances in foreign currency, the exposure to a change in exchange rate is negligible.
Interest rate risk
As the Group has no borrowings the risk is limited to the reduction of interest received on cash surpluses held at bank which receive a floating 
rate of interest. The principal impact to the Group is the result of interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances held as set out below:
31 July 2017 31 July 2016

The Company

As the majority of cash and cash equivalents are held on floating deposit and the overall level of interest rates is low, the exposure 
to interest rate movements is immaterial.
