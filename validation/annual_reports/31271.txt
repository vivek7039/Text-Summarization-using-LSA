3 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder
I am delighted to report that Serica made strong 
progress in 2017. With the announcement in late 
November of Serica’s acquisition of operated interests 
in the Bruce, Keith and Rhum fields (BKR Assets), the 
Company had a very strong finish to what was an 
excellent year. Gross profits from operations amounted 
to just under US$20 million, a three-fold increase over 
the prior year, derived solely from our interest in Erskine.
Serica’s target over the past two/three years has been to 
diversify the risk associated with being reliant on Erskine 
as a single production source and grow into a profitable 
mid-tier independent oil and gas producer through an 
acquisition led strategy, concentrating on assets where 
we believed that we could add value through our own 
expertise. I am very pleased to report that, with the 
agreement to purchase the BKR Assets from BP we are 
now well on our way to achieving this goal. These fields 
hold significant potential which Serica believes it can 
unlock as a focused, low cost and innovative operator 
under the leadership of Mitch Flegg who joined us as 
Chief Executive upon announcement of the transaction.
We welcome Mitch and the team who have joined with 
him. They will be joined on completion of the acquisition 
by experienced staff from BP who bring their expertise 
and knowledge of the assets to cement what I believe 
will be a very strong and technically competent team 
capable of running an exciting new growth phase 
for the Company.
The acquisition of the BKR Assets provides for an 
effective date of 1 January 2018. Apart from a short period 
of production interruptions in early January linked to 
a shutdown of the Forties Pipeline System and the 
impact of very severe weather conditions in the latter 
part of February and early March, the assets have been 
performing well since the start of this year. The assets 
are expected to bring material benefit to Serica upon 
completion of the acquisition, now expected in the third 
quarter this year. The ensuing period will be taken up 
by implementing the complex programme to enable a 
safe and efficient transfer of operations and securing the 
various consents required for the transfer and ensuing 
operations. To-date we are making good progress with 
all of these transition requirements, working closely with 
BP, partners and the various regulatory bodies.
Further information, as well as an update on Erskine 
where production is currently suspended due to a 
pipeline blockage, is provided in the Chief Executive’s 
Report and the Operations and Financial Reviews but 
the overall impact of the acquisition will be significant 
to the Company and its future prospects. Underlying 
reserves will have increased some sixteen-fold to 
approximately 50 million boe as at 1 January 2018 and 
the strength and depth of the Company will have been 
transformed by combining the Company’s skills with 
those of the BP employees joining us. Production is 
projected to increase significantly, with potential for 
further increases, and the Company’s financial position is 
expected to increase commensurately.
Following completion of the transaction, Serica’s 
production will be predominantly gas, with the Rhum 
and Bruce fields alone accounting for up to 5% of total 
UK gas production. At a time of rising political tensions 
and limited UK gas storage capacity this focus on gas 
should also provide a strong underpinning for Serica. 
4 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Whilst there will undoubtedly be challenges ahead I 
am very optimistic about the Company’s future and its 
ability to consolidate our recent acquisition and build 
on the platform that we have now created. Our future 
plans include organic growth, developing the position 
we will have in four North Sea producing fields as well as 
developing our Columbus interest and commencing an 
exploration programme with the Rowallan well whilst we 
review options for our interests in Namibia and Ireland. 
However, we will also continue to seek ways in which 
we can add new assets through selective acquisition to 
complement our strong production base and build a 
robust and exciting portfolio with further potential for 
value-generating growth.
In summary, I am delighted with the positive outcome 
which has resulted from the skills and focus of Serica’s 
team and a considerable amount of effort on their part. 
I would like to thank them on shareholders’ behalf, 
welcome all newcomers to the Company and look 
forward to an exciting period ahead.
Antony Craven Walker 
Executive Chairman
9 April 2018
The Company had a very 
strong finish to what was 
an excellent year. 
5 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2017 was a landmark year for Serica, delivering our highest profit to date and providing us 
with a platform to grow further. 
Building on a strong set of financial results, the announcement of the BKR Assets acquisition 
in late November rounded off an excellent year. We believe that the UK North Sea, where 
there are strategic benefits for Serica, will continue to provide new opportunities to grow the 
business and add shareholder value.
Net production of 722,000 boe (2016 – 597,000 boe) and 
operating profits of US$14.1 million (2016 – US$3.4 million) 
represent Serica’s strongest annual performance 
to-date even though wax control in the condensate 
export pipeline restricted Erskine second half volumes. 
The year also saw the announcement of the BKR 
Assets acquisition and significant progress on bringing 
Columbus to a development decision.
The problems with a wax build-up in the Lomond to 
Everest condensate export line have deferred production 
from Erskine but it is expected that this production will 
be recovered once the pipeline restrictions have been 
cleared. Erskine partners’ focus has therefore been placed 
on resolving the restrictions that have been preventing 
delivery of the field’s full capability. A long-term solution 
has been sanctioned and work on this has commenced 
alongside the ongoing efforts to clear the build-up.
The capability of the Erskine reservoir and wells 
continues to outperform the projections that Serica 
made when the asset was first acquired. Estimated 
remaining 2P reserves at 1 January 2018 of 3.1 million 
boe net to Serica compare to an estimated 3.3 million 
boe when Serica first acquired the field interest in 
mid-2015 even though 1.9 million boe net to Serica 
have been produced during the intervening period. 
When not subject to external restrictions, the field has 
demonstrated an ability to sustain production at rates 
around 3,000 boe per day net to Serica. 
The acquisition of the BP interests in the BKR Assets 
will provide Serica with the opportunity to build on the 
experience gained from Erskine in order to move forward 
as a production operator. I have been tremendously 
impressed with the professionalism and enthusiasm of 
the BP staff that will be transferring to Serica and I look 
forward to welcoming these staff as well as our new 
recruits into our new operational headquarters which 
will be opened in Aberdeen in the second half of 2018.
Meanwhile, we are pleased to confirm that Serica and 
the other Columbus partners have notified the Oil and 
Gas Authority (“OGA”) of a selected offtake route for the 
Columbus field development. This is discussed in more 
detail below and in the Operations Report. We now look 
forward to working with our partners and infrastructure 
owners to develop and submit a Field Development Plan 
(“FDP”) to the OGA for Columbus, targeted for mid-year.
Serica remains committed to exploration and the 
forthcoming Rowallan well, on which Serica is fully 
carried, is one of the few significant UK exploration wells 
due to be drilled in 2018 targeting gross reserves over 
100 million boe. Elsewhere in the UK Continental Shelf 
(“UKCS”) Serica is looking to grow its exploration portfolio 
and has participated in three applications for new 
licences in the UKCS 30th Offshore Licensing Round. 
Industry activity in both Ireland and Namibia is showing 
strong signs of recovery as oil prices recover from the 
lows seen in 2015-16; this is expected to enhance our 
ongoing efforts to secure drilling partners in these areas.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S 
REPORT
STRATEGIC REPORT
6 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Erskine 
During the first five months of 2017 Serica’s primary 
asset, the Erskine field, delivered a particularly strong 
performance with production averaging 3,100 boe 
per day net to the Company. This was followed by a 
period when wax build-up in the Lomond to Everest 
condensate export line restricted rates through June 
and July leading into a two-month field shut-in as a 
planned August maintenance programme extended into 
September for additional wax management processes 
and repairs to a Lomond caisson. The recommencement 
of production in late September brought a further 
period of steady production, averaging close to 
2,500 boe per day net, until an unplanned outage of the 
Forties Pipeline System (“FPS”) on 11 December shut-in 
Erskine along with approximately 80 other North Sea 
production platforms. 
Though frustrating not to have been able to maintain 
Erskine early year performance, Serica’s net share of 
production for 2017 still averaged close to 2,000 boe 
per day, delivered at improving oil and gas prices, and 
generating profit before tax of US$10.8 million compared 
to US$3.3 million for 2016. It should also be emphasised 
that output restrictions during 2017 were almost entirely 
related to the oil offtake pipelines. 
The FPS interruption was a rare event which the 
operator, Ineos FPS, was quick to address given the 
strategic importance of this line which transports to 
shore over 40% of total UK oil production. However, the 
wax build-up in the Lomond to Everest condensate 
export line has been a recurring challenge and, as 
already reported, has caused a further interruption to 
Erskine production in early 2018. Response to-date has 
been to manage the problem through rate control, 
periodic soaking of the line with solvents and pigging. 
However, pigging programmes have historically been 
limited due to the risk of full blockage. 
Net production of 722,000 
boe and operating profit of 
US$14.1 million represents 
Serica’s strongest annual 
performance to-date.
7 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT CONTINUED
New Lomond operator, Chrysaor Holdings Limited, 
after reviewing the various wax management measures 
employed in recent years, has concluded that the best 
long-term solution is to bypass the area of wax build-
up by replacing a 26 km section of line, a proposal that 
Serica fully supports. A clean line will allow full and 
regular pigging right from the start thus preventing 
the wax build-up that has proved so difficult to remove. 
Serica’s share of the cost is comparable to some 40 days 
of Serica’s field revenues. Equipment procurement 
has commenced and the installation is expected to be 
completed in Q3 2018.
So, although field production is again being curtailed 
during early 2018, Serica has confidence that the bypass 
solution will assist delivery of full field potential in 
future years and pay for itself many times over. In the 
meantime, the Lomond operator continues to make 
every effort to clear the blockage with further equipment 
currently being mobilised. 
BKR Asset acquisition
Since the 2015 acquisition of an interest in the producing 
Erskine field, Serica’s management has been seeking 
additional North Sea production interests. In addition to 
diversifying risk away from a single revenue stream, this 
would also assist in accelerating and fully exploiting the 
value of Serica’s UK North Sea ringfence tax losses. It has 
taken considerable time and patience to deliver the right 
deal but we believe the structure of the BKR transaction 
allows Serica to achieve further transformation whilst 
managing downside risk and avoiding excessive dilution 
or leverage. 
As the deal also brings operating responsibilities, the 
transition phase will necessarily be of sufficient duration 
to allow the Company to put in place systems and 
resources and obtain the necessary consents. This 
work is progressing well, the consultation phase for 
over 110 staff transferring from BP is almost complete, 
recruitment for additional positions is underway, new 
offices have been identified in Aberdeen and the 
Company is working with BP, the OGA and field partners 
to ensure a safe and ordered transition. Completion is 
targeted for late Q3 2018.
During Q1 2018, BKR production has remained strong, 
routinely exceeding 20,000 boe per day net to BP. 
However interruptions for the FPS shut-in and the recent 
severe weather conditions in the North Sea mean that in 
Q1 2018 the average production was 16,000 boe per day 
net to BP. Importantly, Ofgem has recently approved the 
raising of the National Transmission System (“NTS”) entry 
specification for CO2 content of gas delivered at the St 
Fergus Gas Terminal to 5.5mol% CO2 largely eliminating 
the need for costly blending gas required up to now to 
offset the relatively higher CO2 content of Rhum gas. 
BP has entered into a contract for a rig to carry out the 
re-entry and re-completion of the previously drilled (but 
STRATEGIC REPORT
8 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 not yet producing) Rhum R3 well. Operations are expected to commence in 
May this year. The well is already connected to the necessary infrastructure 
and it is expected that production will commence before the year-end. 
Under the terms of the SPA, Serica will benefit from a 40% share of 2018 net 
cashflow from the acquired assets rising on a stepped basis to 100% in 2022. 
The amount generated in the period up to completion, adjusted for notional 
tax, will be offset against the £12.8 million consideration due at completion. 
At current production volumes and sales prices, this is expected to exceed 
the initial consideration delivering a net cash receipt to Serica.
Columbus
Under the extension terms of the Columbus licences, Serica and its partners 
in the Columbus field were required to notify the OGA by 31 March 2018 
of the choice of an offtake route and to submit an FDP by 30 June 2018. 
Work has concluded on the evaluation of two potential offtake routes 
for Columbus production and the Columbus partners have selected the 
Shearwater hub as providing the optimum export route for Columbus gas 
and liquids. This selection is contingent on a near-term commitment being 
made by the Arran field partners to the construction of a pipeline from the 
Arran field to Shearwater passing near the Columbus field with appropriate 
tie-in points. The OGA has been informed of the decision and Serica has 
commenced the preparation of the field development plan which is intended 
to be ready for submission by mid-2018. 
Exploration
The Rowallan well, will be Serica’s first exploration well since 2014 and our 
15% fully carried interest brings significant potential with an independently 
assessed 19.7 mmboe of P50 Prospective Resources net to Serica. A tender 
process is underway to contract a drilling rig to commence drilling of the 
exploration well in H2 2018. Though Serica has been careful to manage its 
exploration commitments during the industry downturn, this well, targeting 
material hydrocarbon volumes, is close to infrastructure within the general 
Erskine/Lomond area making it a strong candidate for early development 
should the well prove successful and will be drilled at no cost to Serica.
Serica intends to continue targeting exploration opportunities where an 
attractive balance can be struck between financial commitment and risked 
commercial return and has participated in three applications for new 
licences in the UKCS 30th Offshore Licensing Round.
Further Opportunities
Though the main effort must necessarily be directed towards preparing 
for BKR operations and completing the transaction with BP, Serica will 
continue to look for opportunities to build the Company and deliver 
further shareholder value. As the time taken to deliver the BKR opportunity 
demonstrates, it requires patience to achieve this but we believe that 
Company progress to date provides a sound platform from which to further 
build our upstream business.

ACQUISITION
The BKR Assets comprise of BP's interests in the Bruce, Keith and Rhum fields (36%, 
34.83% and 50% respectively) in the North Sea along with associated oil and gas 
infrastructure. BP is retaining a 1% interest in the Bruce field. Subject to completion, 
Serica will also become the operator of the BKR Assets and the Directors anticipate 
that approximately 110 BP employees will be transferred to Serica with additional 
employees currently being recruited. 
The consideration being paid to BP, comprises:
●  an initial consideration of £12.8 million payable on completion to be adjusted for 
working capital calculated from an effective date of 1 January 2018; 
●  a further contingent amount of up to £16 million dependent on the Rhum R3 
Well (the third well on the Rhum field) achieving a specified minimum production 
threshold for 90 days during the first year following completion of the workover of 
the well, anticipated to take place in the summer of 2018;
●  an additional contingent consideration of up to £23.1 million in aggregate 
payable in three instalments of up to approximately £7.7 million each in respect 
of 2019, 2020 and 2021 if the Rhum field production volumes and sales prices 
meet or exceed certain agreed levels. The amounts payable will be reduced 
if Rhum field production and the price achieved for sales of Rhum gas do not 
meet the agreed levels; 
●  deferred cash consideration calculated as a percentage (60% in 2018, 50% in 2019 
and 40% in each of 2020 and 2021) of the pre-tax net cash flows resulting from 
BP's interests in the BKR Assets from 2018 through to 2021;
●  deferred consideration equal to 30% of BP's retained share of future 
decommissioning costs, reduced by the tax relief BP receives on such costs; and 
●  deferred consideration equal to 90% of Serica’s share of the realised value of oil 
in the Bruce pipeline at the end of field life.
The deferred and contingent cash consideration is expected to be financed from 
the expected cash flow from the BKR Assets. 
BP will retain liability for all the costs of decommissioning facilities, including wells 
existing at completion relating to the BKR Assets. Serica will pay for the costs of 
decommissioning new facilities.
As part of the acquisition, Serica has entered into product sales agreements with 
certain BP entities to off-take Serica's share of production of gas, oil and natural 
gas liquids from the BKR Assets on market terms. In addition, BP Gas has agreed to 
provide Serica with a prepayment facility of up to £16 million to provide for drawings 
to cover the cost of gas price hedging instruments which have been purchased by 
Serica in conjunction with signing the acquisition agreement and, if required, the 
initial consideration.
On 21 November 2017 Serica 
announced that it had reached 
agreement to conditionally  
acquire the BKR Assets from BP.

13 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Production
Central North Sea: Erskine Field – Blocks 23/26a (Area 
B) and 23/26b (Area B), Serica 18%
All of Serica’s 2017 production came from its 18% interest 
in Erskine, a gas and condensate field located in the UK 
Central North Sea. Serica’s co-venturers are Chevron, 
50% (operator), and Chrysaor Holdings Limited, 32% 
as of November 2017. Erskine fluids are processed and 
exported via the Lomond platform, which is 100% owned 
and operated by Chrysaor Holdings Limited. 
An updated independent audit of the Erskine field 
confirmed Serica’s share of estimated proven plus 
probable reserves at 3.1 million boe as of 1 January 2018.
Production for 2017 averaged 1,976 boe per day net to 
Serica. Between 1 January and 31 May 2017, production 
was excellent, with a net average of 3,100 boe per day 
and peaking at over 4,100 boe per day net. This was 
achieved through high uptime performance from 
export facilities and good performance from the Erskine 
wells. During June and July, production was reduced 
by approximately 50% to regulate wax deposition in the 
condensate export pipeline and some wax treatment 
procedures were carried out. 
A planned maintenance programme on the Lomond 
platform took place in August, coinciding with 
maintenance activities at the FPS. The operator also 
took the opportunity to undertake a chemical clean of 
the condensate export pipeline to treat wax deposits. 
Production restart was delayed as the operator of FPS 
imposed a restriction on production from the field, in 
order to manage the specialist fluids used in the wax 
treatment process. 
Erskine was brought back into production on 
22 September and rates net to Serica were gradually 
increased to over 2,500 boe per day, achieved with 
only three out of five wells producing. During the 
following months, further chemical and mechanical 
processes were carried out to maintain flow down the 
export pipeline.
In early December, the FPS, the export route for Erskine 
condensate, was shut in due to a hairline crack found in 
an onshore section of pipe. This impacted production for 
much of December and Erskine re-start occurred in early 
January 2018. However later in January during routine 
pipeline cleaning operations of the Lomond to Erskine 
condensate export pipeline, a blockage occurred in the 
pipeline. The operator of this pipeline is continuing to 
clear this wax build up.
Serica is working with the operators of Erskine and 
Lomond to implement long-term solutions to improve 
uptime of the export facilities and return to performance 
levels seen at the beginning of 2017. 
STRATEGIC REPORT
14 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Development
Central North Sea: Columbus Field – Blocks 23/16f and 
23/21a (part), Serica 50%
The Columbus gas condensate field is located in close 
proximity to the Lomond platform, which is the offtake 
route for production from Serica's Erskine producing 
interest. Serica is Columbus field operator with partners 
EOG Resources United Kingdom Limited (25%) and 
Endeavour Energy UK Limited (25%). The field is located 
in the Eastern Central Graben, UK Central North Sea and 
the reservoir is located within the Forties Sandstone. 
The Columbus field has been appraised with four wells 
and is planned to be developed with a single production 
well. Serica is currently working towards a full field 
development plan for submission to the OGA by mid-
2018 with a view to commencing development work 
before the end of 2018. First gas is currently targeted 
for 2021.
During 2017, Serica pursued two alternative development 
options for Columbus. One option was to drill a subsea 
well into Columbus and connect it to a proposed 
pipeline between the nearby Arran field and the 
Shearwater platform. The alternative option was to drill 
an extended-reach development well into Columbus 
directly from the Lomond platform, located 5 km away. 
The economic benefits of both options were very similar.
Under the extension terms of the Columbus licences, 
Serica and its partners in the Columbus field were 
required to notify the OGA by 31 March 2018 of the 
choice of an offtake route and to submit an FDP by 
30 June 2018.
Serica has informed the OGA that it will prepare an 
FDP to develop Columbus by tying a subsea well into 
the pipeline proposed to be laid between Arran and 
Shearwater. Under this option, Arran and Columbus 
fluids will combine in the new pipeline and be produced 
together over the Shearwater processing facilities via an 
existing riser onto the Shearwater platform. Although 
the expected first gas date would be around a year later 
than the Lomond alternative, the overall capital costs 
under this option are lower. The Columbus partners will 
now work with the operator of the Arran field and the 
operator of the Shearwater platform and move forward 
with a Columbus FDP, to be submitted by end of Q2 
2018, the timing requested by the OGA.
COLUMBUS
WELL
SHEARWATER
PLATFORM
Columbus development plan.
Final commitment to this offtake route and submission 
of an FDP in the timetable required by the OGA is, 
however, dependent upon the Arran field owners 
committing to development of the Arran field in 
the timeframe prescribed by the OGA. If the Arran 
development does not proceed as planned, Columbus 
cannot be developed through Shearwater on a stand-
alone basis. The selection of this route has been 
made conditional on that decision being made to 
the satisfaction of Serica. Therefore, discussions on 
commercial arrangements will continue with the 
Lomond field operator, in the event that the Shearwater 
option does not mature in the requisite time frame. The 
Lomond option has been engineered in detail and is 
capable of being fully implemented.
A CPR carried out in 2017 estimates net 2C contingent 
resources to Serica on the Columbus field to be 6.7 
mmboe. Once the FDP is submitted, Columbus 
contingent resources will be redefined as reserves, based 
on the economic cut off for the selected development. 
15 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Exploration
Central North Sea: Rowallan Prospect - Block 22/19c, 
Serica 15% 
Block 22/19c is located in the Central North Sea, around 
20 km west of the Columbus field. It contains the 
Rowallan Prospect comprising potential condensate 
targets in the Triassic Skagerrak and the Middle Jurassic 
Pentland formations. Serica’s partners comprise ENI 
UK Limited (operator – 40%), JX Nippon Exploration 
and Production (U.K.) Limited (25%) and Mitsui E&P UK 
Limited (20%).
Well preparations for the Rowallan Prospect are 
underway, with spending on a site survey and long-
lead items approved by partners for 2017. A vessel was 
deployed in December 2017 to complete a site survey 
in preparation for the drilling of a well in the second 
half of 2018 and the operator, ENI UK Limited, is now 
conducting a tendering process to contract a rig to drill 
the well. The prospect is located within Serica’s core 
Central North Sea area, close to Erskine and Columbus. 
Serica is fully carried on all costs for a well on this high 
pressure, high temperature prospect. 
A Serica CPR carried out in 2017 estimated the net 
P50 Prospective Resources to Serica on the Rowallan 
Prospect to be 19.7 mmboe.
East Irish Sea: Doyle Prospect - Blocks 113/22a, 113/26b 
and 113/27c, Serica 20% 
Serica held a 20% non-operated interest in Blocks 113/26b 
and 113/27c in partnership with Zennor Petroleum. 
Zennor were unable to secure a partner prior to the 
licence termination date of 30 April 2017 and, as a result, 
these blocks were relinquished in Q2 2017. The licence 
to the north over Block 113/27c was relinquished in 
December 2017. 
Ireland 
Rockall Basin: Frontier Exploration Licences 1/09 and 
4/13, Serica 100%
Serica secured a two-year extension on Licence 4/13 
up to the end of November 2018. The licence contains 
structural prospects Aghla Beg and Aghla More and the 
overlying stratigraphic prospect Derryveagh. During 
2017, Serica completed a process to enhance the 3D 
seismic data over the prospects which has enabled the 
identification of a fractured basement play within the 
Aghla Beg prospect. This work has also shown Aghla 
More to be relatively unfractured and so strengthens the 
interpretation that it comprises a clastic sedimentary 
section comparable to nearby Dooish discovery.
Serica estimates P50 Prospective Resources for these 
stacked prospects to be in the order of 4Tcf of gas and 
250 million barrels of condensate. 
Serica secured an extension of Licence 1/09 to January 
2019. Licence 1/09 contains a large, clearly defined 
structural prospect, which is also analogous to the 
Dooish discovery. Serica is seeking a partner to drill a 
well in one or both of blocks 1/09 and 4/13. 
Slyne Basin: Frontier Exploration Licence 1/06, Serica 100%
Serica increased its equity from 50% to 100% following 
the withdrawal of DEA from the licence and secured an 
extension on licence 1/06 until November 2018 to further 
explore the potential first identified through the Bandon 
oil discovery drilled by Serica on the licence in 2009. Serica 
has completed a study to investigate the quality of oil that 
could be expected in the Boyne prospect located on the 
licence. Results indicate that oil would be over 30◦ API, 
significantly lighter than that discovered in the Bandon 
well and capable of producing without assistance.
Serica is seeking to identify a farm-in partner to drill 
the Boyne oil prospect and take advantage of current 
low drilling and development costs. In the event of a 
commercial discovery, a swift development could be 
implemented to achieve an early first oil date. 
Namibia 
Luderitz Basin: Blocks 2512A, 2513A, 2513B and 2612A 
(part), Serica 85% 
Serica has progressed to the first renewal period of the 
licence, running until the end of 2018. This licence period 
does not include a commitment to drill a well. The 
excellent 3D seismic data acquired in a major seismic 
programme operated by Serica, has identified giant 
carbonate prospects as well as large, more conventional 
Cretaceous fan prospects supported by seismic 
anomalies. Serica plans to work on identifying more 
prospects supported by the latest seismic visualisation 
techniques as well as seeking a partner.
Morocco 
Sidi Moussa Licence: Serica 5%
Serica held 5% working interest and has withdrawn 
from the licence. The licence operator was previously 
considering a second well, in which Serica retained a 
back-in option, but decided to seek to undertake an 
alternative work programme. In view of this decision, 
the materiality of a 5% interest to Serica and in line with 
Serica’s view of the costs and benefits of retaining an 
interest, Serica elected to withdraw in October 2017.

17 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL REVIEW
Group profit after tax of US$17.1 million for 2017 compares 
to a profit after tax of US$10.8 million for 2016. Results for 
2016 were adversely impacted by a six-month Erskine 
field shut-in running from March until August of that 
year. 
BKR Asset acquisition
Details of the proposed acquisition, announced on 21 
November 2017, of the BKR Assets from BP are covered 
above. The deal has an effective date of 1 January 2018 
and completion of the acquisition is expected to take 
place in late Q3 2018. Although the most significant 
accounting aspects of the transaction will apply at 
the date of completion, under the prepayment facility 
arranged with BP Gas and dated 21 November 2017, 
BP Gas agreed to provide for drawings to cover the 
initial consideration and cost of premiums payable for 
gas price puts (hedging instruments which set a floor 
price for certain volumes of gas production from the 
BKR assets) which have been purchased by Serica in 
conjunction with signing the acquisition agreement. 
Results from operations
Income statement – continuing operations
Serica generated a gross profit of US$19.3 million in 2017 
from its Erskine field operations. The 2016 comparative 
gross profit of US$6.6 million reflected performance 
impacted by a six-month field shut-in. Serica’s 18% 
field interest generated net combined liquids and gas 
production of 722,000 boe in 2017 compared to 597,000 
boe for 2016.
Sales revenues
The Company currently generates all its sales revenue 
from the Erskine field. Revenue is earned from oil, gas 
and NGL product streams. Serica’s condensate allocation 
is sold as Forties crude oil. All products are sold at 
monthly average spot prices for the respective products. 
The Brent oil benchmark averaged over US$54 per barrel 
in 2017 (2016: average of US$45 per barrel) whilst UK 
NBP gas prices averaged approximately 42 pence per 
therm across the 2017 period (2016: average of 35 pence 
per therm).
Erskine field production averaged 1,976 boe per day net 
to Serica in 2017 (2016: 1,636 boe per day net). Net gas 
production averaged 6.3 mmscf per day during 2017 
(2016: 5.0 mmscf per day), whilst condensate production 
averaged 931 barrels per day (2016: 800 barrels per day).
Sales revenues in 2017 from lifted barrels of oil were 
US$17.2 million (2016: US$11.1 million) at an average 
realised price of US$53.2 per barrel (2016: US$42.1 per 
barrel). Associated NGL products earned additional 
revenue of US$0.4 million (2016: US$0.3 million). 
Sales revenues in 2017 were offset by a US$1.2 million 
charge (2016: US$0.5 million credit) reflecting the 
movement from a combined liquids underlift position at 
31 December 2016 to an overlift position at 31 December 
2017 (2016: movement from overlift position at 31 
December 2015 to underlift position at 31 December 
2016). 
The 2017 gas production was sold at prices averaging 
US$5.4 per mscf (2016: US$4.6 per mscf) and generated 
US$12.5 million (2016: US$8.4 million) of revenue net to 
Serica. A gas sales contract, under which Serica supplied 
approximately one quarter of its Erskine gas production 
at relatively low contract prices (approximately 30 pence 
per therm in the 2015/6 contract year), terminated on 30 
September 2016. 
Three NGL products (Propane, Butane and Naphtha) are 
derived from associated gas production and contributed 
revenue of US$3.1 million (2016: US$1.2 million) net to 
Serica. 
Cost of sales and depletion charges
Cost of sales is driven by production from the Erskine 
field and comprises field operating costs and a depletion 
charge against the asset’s net book amount.
The overall 2017 charge of US$12.7 million (2016: US$14.9 
million) comprised direct field operating costs of US$11.0 
million (2016: US$13.6 million) and non-cash depletion of 
US$1.7 million (2016: US$1.3 million). Serica’s operating 
costs including transportation and processing were 
around US$15 per boe during 2017, averaging well below 
2016 levels of US$23 per boe, which were adversely 
affected by the shut-in. The most significant elements 
of the field operating costs are as follows: Erskine’s 
contribution to the running costs of the Lomond 
facilities, standalone Erskine field operating costs, 
other transportation costs for use of the FPS and CATS 
pipelines, and charges for any necessary surface or 
sub-surface maintenance work. Significant operational 
expenditure continues during periods of field shut-in 
when no revenue is earned. 
The US$2.6 million decrease in field operating costs from 
2016 to 2017 is largely due to lower overall contributions 
by Erskine to Lomond facilities operating costs, arising 
from cost savings generated by the Lomond operator. 
The 2016 expense also included an agreed level of 
contribution from the Erskine partners to the exceptional 
costs incurred by the Lomond operator to resolve a 
Lomond to Everest pipeline blockage. Operating costs 
are billed in £ and, with the average £/US$ exchange rate 
falling from 1.36 in 2016 to 1.29 in 2017, the reported US$ 
equivalent figures have reduced accordingly in 2017.
STRATEGIC REPORT
18 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Depletion charges principally represent the costs of 
Erskine acquisition spread over the estimated remaining 
commercial life of the field on a unit of production basis. 
Other expenses and income
The Company generated a profit before tax from 
continuing operations of US$10.8 million for 2017 
compared to a profit before tax of US$3.3 million for 2016. 
Other expenditure of US$1.4 million in 2017 (2016: US$0.1 
million) represented hedging premium, including 
unrealised hedging losses of US$1.1 million, net of gains.
Pre-licence expenditure of US$0.3 million for 2017 has 
increased slightly from the 2016 charge of US$0.2 million. 
Pre-licence costs included direct costs and allocated 
general administrative costs incurred on oil and gas 
activities prior to the award of licences, concessions or 
exploration rights.
The Exploration and Evaluation (‘E&E’) asset impairment 
charge of US$1.6 million in 2017 (2016: US$0.1 million) 
comprised US$1.5 million of asset write-offs from the 
relinquished Doyle block in the UK and minor asset 
write-offs from licences in Morocco and the UK. 
Administrative expenses of US$2.2 million for 2017 
increased slightly from US$2.1 million in 2016.
Foreign exchange
Serica retains certain non-US$ cash holdings and other 
financial instruments relating to its operations. The US$ 
value of these may fluctuate from time to time causing 
reported foreign exchange gains and losses. 
Foreign exchange gains of US$0.5 million for 2017 (2016: 
US$0.6 million charge) largely reflect an increase in 
the reported US$ equivalent of £ cash balances caused 
by the strengthening of £ against the US$ during 
2017. Unrealised gains on the revaluation of £ cash 
balances have been partially offset by realised losses on 
settlement of significant £ creditors. 
Other
Significant transaction costs of US$3.4 million were 
expensed in 2017 on the proposed acquisition, 
announced on 21 November 2017, of the BKR Assets 
from BP. These were largely incurred on the negotiation 
and documentation of the transaction and on the AIM 
Admission Document published on 30 November 2017. It 
also included other consultancy and advisor fees arising 
throughout the process. 
Finance costs of US$0.1 million were incurred in 2017 
(2016: US$0.2 million) largely comprising the interest 
accruing on the liability payable to BP relating to the 
Erskine acquisition. 
Serica’s significant UK ring fence tax losses brought 
forward have been applied to fully shelter Erskine net 
income from tax payments and are expected to be 
sufficient to cover future income from the field leaving 
a surplus available that can be applied to revenues from 
BKR Asset acquisition after completion. The Group held 
approximately US$146 million of UK ring fence tax losses 
as at 31 December 2017.
The deferred taxation credit of US$6.3 million (2016: 
US$7.5 million) arose from the recognition of a 
corresponding deferred tax asset from historic tax losses 
expected to be utilised from future Erskine field profits.
Income statement - discontinued operations
Following the cessation of production and the 
decommissioning of the Kambuna field facilities in 
Indonesia in the second half of 2013, the financial 
results of the Kambuna field business segment are 
disclosed within ‘discontinued operations’ in the financial 
statements and separate from the results of the retained 
core business segments. 
This discontinued operation loss of US$8,000 in 2016 
comprised the final charge recorded against this 
operation. 
Balance Sheet 
During 2017, the total carrying value of investments in 
E&E assets increased by US$0.2 million from US$53.2 
million to US$53.4 million. This increase consisted of 
US$1.8 million of additions in the year largely offset by 
US$1.6 million of E&E asset write-offs. In the UK, US$0.8 
million was incurred on the Columbus development and 
other exploration licences. In Ireland, US$0.4 million was 
incurred on exploration work on the Rockall licences and 
US$0.3 million on the Slyne interest. In Africa, US$0.3 
million was incurred in respect of the Luderitz basin 
licence interests in Namibia.
The property, plant and equipment balance of US$7.6 
million as at 31 December 2017 (2016: US$9.1 million) 
comprises the net book amount of the Erskine asset 
acquisition costs capitalised on completion of the 
transaction net of depletion charges to date.
Trade and other receivables at 31 December 2017 totalled 
US$2.3 million, a decrease of US$4.5 million from the 
2016 balance of US$6.8 million. The 2017 balance includes 
US$1.2 million (2016: US$4.3 million) from December oil, 
gas and NGL sales earned from the Erskine field.
The financial asset of US$2.7 million reflects the fair value 
as at 31 December 2017 of a prepayment for gas put 
options covering production volumes through 2018 to 
1H 2020, purchased in conjunction with signing the BKR 
Assets acquisition agreement (2016: US$nil).
19 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Cash and cash equivalents, and short-term deposits, 
increased from US$16.6 million to US$34.0 million during 
the year. Operating cash inflows from net Erskine 
field sales were generated in 2017 providing a strong 
cash build for the Company in the year. The Company 
also paid the third US$2.8 million tranche of Erskine 
consideration to BP and significant corporate costs 
arising from the BKR Assets acquisition. Other cash 
outflows were incurred on E&E assets across the portfolio 
in the UK, Ireland and Namibia, ongoing administrative 
costs and corporate activity. 
Short-term trade and other payables totalled US$7.8 
million at 31 December 2017 (2016: US$5.9 million). This 
balance comprises the US$3.0 million (including accrued 
interest) final tranche of Erskine consideration payable 
to BP on 1 July 2018, US$1.5 million of liabilities associated 
with the BKR Assets acquisition, capital and operational 
liabilities for the Erskine interest, a US$0.8 million non-
cash overlift liability reflecting the combined year end 
liquids overlift position (2016: US$0.4 million underlift 
classified as an asset within trade and other receivables) 
and other creditors and accruals for E&E asset, corporate 
and administrative expenditure.
Provisions of US$2.7 million comprise current (US$2.2 
million) and non-current (US$0.5 million) components of 
an estimate for certain contingent payments related to 
savings in field operating costs that may be made to BP 
under the terms of the Erskine acquisition. 
Long-term financial liabilities of US$3.8 million as at 
31 December 2017 comprise drawings under the BKR 
prepayment facility. These cover the up-front premium 
cost of gas price puts purchased in conjunction with 
signing the BKR Assets acquisition agreement. The 
prepayment facility carries interest at one-month 
LIBOR plus 4.5% per annum compounded monthly 
and added to the outstanding amount and has a 
maximum duration of three years from initial drawings. 
Repayments will commence six months after completion 
and be based on 35% of Serica’s retained share of gas 
sales revenues from the BKR Assets including any price 
related hedging gains and after deduction of those 
proportions due to BP under the Net Cash Flow Sharing 
Deed.
Long-term liabilities of US$2.9 million as at 31 December 
2016 comprised the final tranche of Erskine consideration 
payable to BP on 1 July 2018. 
Serica’s share of estimated decommissioning costs 
relating to its 18% Erskine field interest will be met by BP 
up to a level of £31.3 million, adjusted for inflation, with 
Serica being responsible for any costs beyond that. No 
provision for decommissioning liabilities for the Erskine 
field is recorded at 31 December 2017 as the Company’s 
current estimate for such costs is under the level to be 
funded by BP. 
Cash balances and future commitments
Current cash position, capital expenditure 
commitments and other obligations
At 31 December 2017, the Group held cash and cash 
equivalents, and term deposits of US$34.0 million. Cash 
and term deposits had reduced to US$33.0 million 
by 6 April 2018, including cash receipts in respect of 
approximately 35,000 barrels of oil overlift that will be 
adjusted for during Q2 2018. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group held put options 
covering 2018, 2019 and 1H 2020 daily volumes of 
230,000, 240,000 and 160,000 therms of gas per day 
respectively, at floor prices of 35 pence per therm.
At 31 December 2017, in addition to the gas price puts 
referred to above, the Group held put options covering 
Q1 2018 daily volumes of 900 barrels of oil per day at a 
floor price of US$55 per barrel. 
Erskine field commitments
Net revenues from the Erskine field are expected 
to cover ongoing field expenditures as well as the 
remaining tranche of US$2.8 million (before interest) 
cash consideration payable to BP on or before 1 July 2018. 
Management believes there are sufficient resources to 
meet the current committed programme for 2018 but 
remains conscious that a single field income stream 
exposes it to operational and infrastructure risks and the 
consequent need for adequate working capital to cover 
associated fluctuations in revenue. The field has a history 
of intermittent production performance and operational 
expenditure continues during periods of field shut-down 
when no revenue is earned. Completion of the BKR 
Assets acquisition will diversify the Group’s sources of 
revenue.
Non-Erskine commitments
The Group has no significant exploration commitments. 
Progress towards the Columbus development continues 
with a target to compile a Field Development Plan by 
mid-2018. Financing plans for the project will be worked 
in conjunction with the FDP submission.
STRATEGIC REPORT
20 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Other 
Asset values and Impairment
At 31 December 2017, Serica’s market capitalisation 
stood at US$298.8 million (£221.5 million), based upon 
a share price of £0.84, which exceeded the net asset 
value at that date of US$102.3 million. By 6 April 2018 
the Company’s market capitalisation had decreased 
to US$241.6 million (£171.4 million). Management has 
conducted a thorough review of the carrying value of the 
Group’s assets and determined that no significant write-
downs were required. 
Business Risk and Uncertainties
Serica, like all companies in the oil and gas industry, 
operates in an environment subject to inherent risks and 
uncertainties. The Board regularly considers the principal 
risks to which the Group is exposed and monitors any 
agreed mitigating actions. The overall strategy for the 
protection of shareholder value against these risks is 
to retain a broad portfolio of assets with varied risk/
reward profiles, to apply prudent industry practice in all 
operations, to carry insurance where available and cost 
effective, and to retain adequate working capital.
The principal risks currently recognised and the mitigating actions taken by the management are as follows:
Investment Returns: Management seeks to raise funds and then to generate shareholder returns though 
investment in a portfolio of exploration, development and producing acreage leading to the discovery and 
exploitation of commercial reserves. Delivery of this business model carries a number of key risks. 
Risk Mitigation
Market support may be eroded obstructing fundraising 
and lowering the share price
Management regularly communicates its strategy to 
shareholders
Focus is placed on building an asset portfolio capable 
of delivering regular news flow and offering continuing 
prospectivity
Management’s decisions on capital allocation may not 
deliver the expected successful outcomes
Rigorous analysis is conducted of all investment 
proposals 
Investments are spread over a range of areas and risk 
profiles
Each asset carries its own risk profile and no outcome 
can be certain
Management aims to avoid over-exposure to individual 
assets and to identify the associated risks objectively
Operations: Operations may not go according to plan leading to damage, pollution, cost overruns or poor 
outcomes.
Risk Mitigation
The Group’s income is currently derived from a single 
producing field
Efforts are underway to add to producing assets with a 
major acquisition in progress
Management places a priority on building and retaining 
sufficient working capital
Individual wells may not deliver recoverable oil and gas 
reserves
Thorough pre-drill evaluations are conducted to identify 
the risk/reward balance
Exposure is selectively mitigated through farm-out

STRATEGIC REPORT
22 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Commercial environment: World and regional markets continue to be volatile with fluctuations and infrastructure 
access issues that might hinder the Group’s business success
Risk Mitigation
Volatile commodity prices mean that the Group cannot 
be certain of the future sales value of its products
Budget planning considers a range of commodity 
prices
Price mitigation strategies may be employed at the 
point of major capital commitment
Oil and gas price hedging contracts may be utilised 
where viable 
The Group may not be able to get access, at reasonable 
cost, to infrastructure and product markets when 
required
A range of different off-take options are pursued 
wherever possible 
Credit to support field development programmes may 
not be available at reasonable cost
Serica seeks to build and maintain strong banking 
relationships and initiates funding discussions at as 
early a stage as practicable 
Fiscal regimes may vary, increasing effective tax rates 
and reducing the expected value of reserves
Operations are currently spread over a range of 
different fiscal regimes in Western Europe and Africa
Before committing to a significant investment the 
likelihood of fiscal term changes is considered when 
evaluating the risk/reward balance
In addition to the principal risks and uncertainties described herein, the Group is subject to a number of other risk 
factors generally, a description of which is set out in our latest annual information form available on www.sedar.com.
Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”)
The Company’s main business is the acquisition of interests in prospective exploration acreage, the discovery of 
hydrocarbons in commercial quantities and the crystallisation of value whether through production or disposal 
of reserves. The Company tracks its non-financial performance through the accumulation of licence interests in 
proven and prospective hydrocarbon producing regions, the level of success in encountering hydrocarbons and the 
development of production facilities. In parallel, the Company tracks its financial performance through management 
of expenditures within resources available, the cost-effective exploitation of reserves and the crystallisation of value at 
the optimum point. A review of the Company’s progress against these KPIs is covered in the operations and financial 
review within this Strategic Report.
Additional Information

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
26 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
The Board of Directors fully endorses the importance 
of sound corporate governance. Serica is incorporated 
in the United Kingdom. During 2014 its shares were 
traded on both AIM and TSX. On 17 March 2015, the 
Company announced that it had applied for voluntary 
delisting of its ordinary shares from the TSX. This was 
because the directors believed that the minimal trading 
activity of Serica’s shares on the TSX no longer justified 
the expenses and administrative efforts associated with 
maintaining its dual listing, with Serica’s AIM listing 
providing its shareholders with sufficient liquidity. The 
Company’s shares were formally delisted from the TSX 
at the close of trading on 31 March 2015. After this date 
Serica’s shares continue to trade solely on AIM under its 
ticker SQZ.
The code of practice followed for companies 
incorporated in the United Kingdom and listed on the 
premium sector of the Main Market of the London Stock 
Exchange is set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the “UK Code”). It is not compulsory for companies 
whose shares are traded on AIM but the Board applies 
those principles of the UK Code to the extent that it 
considers it reasonable and practical to do so given the 
size and nature of the Company. 
Although the Company has now delisted from the 
TSX, the Company is still considered to be a reporting 
issuer in a number of Canadian provinces. The 
corporate governance guidelines applying to reporting 
issuers in Canada are set out under Ontario Securities 
Commission National Policy 58-201 (the “Corporate 
Governance Guidelines”). The Company is a ‘designated 
foreign issuer’ as defined under National Instrument 
71-1-2-Continuous Disclosure and Other Exemptions 
Relating to Foreign Issuers. The Company is subject to 
the regulatory requirements of AIM. 
The disclosures below explain the composition of, 
role and responsibilities of the Board and the Board 
Committees.
The Board and its Committees
The composition of the Board changed during 2017 
with the appointment of Mitch Flegg as Chief Executive 
Officer (‘CEO’) on 21 November 2017 at the time of the 
announcement of the proposed acquisition of BP’s 
interests in the Bruce, Keith and Rhum fields in the 
North Sea (the ‘BKR Assets’). As at 31 December 2017, 
the Board of the Company consisted of the CEO, the 
Executive Chairman and two non-Executive Directors. 
Jeffrey Harris, non-Executive Director, stepped down 
from the Board on 20 November 2017. It is recognised 
that further strengthening of the Board will be 
required in due course as the Company works towards 
completing the BKR Assets acquisition. The non-
Executive Directors are independent in character and 
judgement and have the range of experience and calibre 
to bring independent judgement on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources and standards of conduct which 
is vital to the success of the Group.
The Board retains full and effective control over the 
Company. The Company holds regular Board meetings 
at which financial, operational and other reports are 
considered and, where appropriate, voted on. The Board 
is responsible for the Group’s strategy, performance, 
key financial and compliance issues, approval of any 
major capital expenditure and the framework of internal 
controls. The matters reserved for the Board include, 
amongst others, approval of the Group’s long term 
objectives, policies and budgets, changes relating to the 
Group’s management structure, approval of the Group’s 
annual report and accounts and ensuring maintenance 
of sound systems of internal control.
There is a clearly defined organisational structure with 
lines of responsibility and delegation of authority to 
executive management. The Board is responsible for 
monitoring the activities of the executive management. 
The Executive Chairman has the responsibility of 
ensuring that the Board discharges its responsibilities. 
In the event of an equality of votes at a meeting of 
the Board, the Executive Chairman has a second 
or casting vote. The Board believes that there is an 
adequate balance between the non-Executive and 
Executive Directors, both in number and in experience 
and expertise, to ensure that the Board operates 
independently of executive management. There is no 
formal Board performance appraisal system in place but 
the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee 
considers this as part of its remit.
Both of the non-Executive Directors meet the 
requirements of independence prescribed in the UK 
Code. 
Individual Directors may engage outside advisors at the 
expense of the Company upon approval by the Board in 
appropriate circumstances.
The Board has established a Corporate Governance and 
Nomination Committee, an Audit Committee, a Reserves 
Committee, a Remuneration and Compensation 
Committee and a Health, Safety and Environmental 
Committee. The terms of reference of the Corporate 
27 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance and Nomination, Audit and Remuneration 
and Compensation Committees can be found on the 
Company’s website www.serica-energy.com
Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee
The Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee 
is responsible for the Company’s observance of the 
UK Code and the Corporate Governance Guidelines 
where they apply to the Company, for compliance with 
the rules of AIM, the rules applicable to designated 
foreign issuers in Canada and for other corporate 
governance matters, including compliance with the 
Company’s Share Dealing Code and with AIM in respect 
of dealings by directors or employees in the Company’s 
shares. The committee is responsible for monitoring 
the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees, 
proposing to the Board new nominees for election as 
directors to the Board, determining successor plans and 
for assessing directors on an ongoing basis. 
The Committee did not meet during 2017 and will meet 
as required during the next financial year. 
The Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee 
is comprised of the Executive Chairman and two 
independent non-Executive Directors. The committee is 
chaired by Neil Pike and its other members are Antony 
Craven Walker and Ian Vann.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee meets regularly and consists 
of two members, both of whom are non-Executive 
Directors. At such time that the Board appoints a further 
non-Executive director it is envisaged that this person 
would be a member of the committee. The committee’s 
purpose is to assist the Board’s oversight of the integrity 
of the financial statements and other financial reporting, 
the independence and performance of the auditors, the 
regulation and risk profile of the Group and the review 
and approval of any related party transactions. The Audit 
Committee may hold private sessions with management 
and with the external auditor without management 
present. 
The Audit Committee met three times in 2017 and 
proposes to meet at least three times during the next 
financial year. The committee is chaired by Neil Pike and 
its other member is Ian Vann. 
The responsibilities and operation of the Audit 
Committee are more particularly set out in the 
Company’s Audit Committee Charter, a copy of which 
is available on the Company’s website at www.serica-
energy.com.
Reserves Committee
The Reserves Committee is a sub-committee of the 
Audit Committee. The committee’s purpose is to 
review the reports of the independent reserves auditors 
pursuant to Canadian regulations which require that the 
Board discuss the reserves reports with the independent 
reserves auditors or delegate authority to a reserves 
committee comprised of at least two non-Executive 
Directors. The committee is chaired by Ian Vann and its 
other member is Neil Pike. The committee met once in 
2017 and typically meets once a year prior to publication 
of the annual results. 
Remuneration and Compensation Committee
The Remuneration and Compensation Committee 
meets regularly to consider all material elements 
of remuneration policy, the remuneration and 
incentivisation of Executive Directors and senior 
management and to make recommendations to the 
Board on the framework for executive remuneration and 
its cost. The role of the Remuneration and Compensation 
Committee is to keep under review the remuneration 
policies to ensure that Serica attracts, retains and 
motivates the most qualified talent who will contribute 
to the long-term success of the Company. 
The committee met four times in 2017 and proposes 
to meet at least twice during the next financial year. 
In addition, written resolutions of the committee 
are passed from time to time particularly in relation 
to routine matters such as the allotment of shares 
pursuant to share option exercises as well as to record 
formally decisions of the committee reached outside the 
scheduled meetings.
The committee is composed of two non-Executive 
Directors both of whom are independent. The 
committee is chaired by Ian Vann and its other member 
is Neil Pike.
Health, Safety and Environmental Committee
The Health, Safety and Environmental Committee is 
responsible for matters affecting occupational health, 
safety and the environment, including the formulation of 
a health, safety and environmental policy. 
The committee met twice during 2017 and proposes 
to meet at least three times during the next financial 
year. The committee is chaired by Ian Vann and its other 
member is Antony Craven Walker.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
30 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT  
IN RELATION TO THE GROUP AND COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Director’s Report and financial statements 
in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and regulations and those International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. As required by the AIM 
Rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Under United Kingdom company 
law the directors have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and the Company and the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those Group and Company financial statements the Directors are required to:
 ■ present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group;
 ■ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 ■ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 ■  state that the Group and Company has complied with IFRSs, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; 
 ■  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 ■  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s and 
Company’s financial position and financial performance; and
 ■  state whether the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
Company and enable them to ensure that the Group and Company financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with these requirements and, having a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, 
will continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
32 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to 
you where:
 ■  the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not 
appropriate; or
 ■  the directors have not disclosed in the Financial Statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt about the group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the Financial Statements are authorised 
for issue.
Overview of our audit approach
Key audit matters ■   Assessment of commercial reserves and its impact on the Financial Statements
 ■  Recoverability of the Exploration and Evaluation assets
Audit scope ■  We performed an audit of the complete financial information of two components and 
audit procedures on specific balances for a further three components.
 ■  The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 
  –  100% of Profit before tax,
 –   100% of Revenue and
  –  98% of Total assets.
Materiality ■ Overall group materiality of USD$550 thousand which represents 5% of the Group’s profit 
before tax.
 ■  Parent company materiality was set at USD$5,110 thousand which represents 5% of 
equity.
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
Financial Statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the 
overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
33 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Risk Our response to the risk Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee 
Assessment of commercial reserves and its impact on the Financial Statements 
Refer to the note 2 Accounting 
policies section “Use of Judgement 
and Estimates” (page 43); and “Group 
Proved plus Probable Reserves“ of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
(page 77)
The estimate of oil and gas reserves and 
resources has a significant impact on 
the Financial Statements, particularly 
impairment testing and depreciation, 
depletion and amortization (‘DD&A’) 
charges.
The estimation of oil and natural gas 
reserves and resources is a significant 
area of judgement due to the technical 
uncertainty in assessing quantities and 
complex contractual arrangements 
dictating the group’s share of reportable 
volumes.
Reserves and resources are also a 
fundamental indicator of the future 
potential of the group’s performance. 
 ■ We walked through the group’s 
controls over their internal certification 
process for technical and commercial 
experts who are responsible for 
reserves and resources estimation.
 ■ We assessed the competence and 
objectivity of these experts, to satisfy 
ourselves they were appropriately 
qualified to carry out the volumes 
estimation.
 ■ We obtained confirmation directly 
from Netherland, Sewell and 
Associates Inc (NSAI) that they are 
independent from Serica and have 
performed their procedures under the 
COGEH standards.
 ■ We confirmed that material changes 
in reserves and resources were made 
in the appropriate accounting period.
 ■ We validated that the updated 
reserves and resources estimates 
were included appropriately in the 
group’s preparation of the cash 
flow forecasts for the assessment of 
the going concern assumption, the 
determination of the deferred tax 
asset, accounting for DD&A and as 
part of management’s consideration 
of indicators of impairment. 
We did not identify any 
exceptions as a result of our 
audit procedures.
We consider the commercial 
reserves updates have

to the Audit Committee 
Recoverability of the Exploration and Evaluation assets
Refer to note 2 “Accounting policies” 
(page 43); and note 14 “Exploration and 
Evaluation assets“ of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements (page 60)
The carrying value of Exploration and 
Evaluation assets are held at historic 
cost and are subject to impairment 
assessments under IAS 36 Impairment 
of assets. Annually management is 
required to assess for impairment 
indicators in line with IFRS 6 Exploration 
for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources 
to determine whether a full impairment 
test is required. 
Exploration and Evaluation assets shall 
be assessed for impairment when 
facts and circumstances suggest that 
the carrying amount of an Exploration 
and Evaluation asset may exceed its 
recoverable amount. If this occurs, 
an entity shall measure, present and 
disclose any resulting impairment loss.
There is a risk that management 
fails to identify a relevant indicator 
and therefore do not perform an 
impairment test. There is also a risk 
that management use inappropriate 
assumptions in the full impairment 
test resulting in an overstatement of 
Exploration and Evaluation assets.
 ■ We obtained an understanding of the 
process to confirm the key controls 
mitigate the risk; assess their design 
effectiveness and obtain evidence of 
their implementation; 
 ■ We have held discussions with 
management, and read minutes 
from their meetings to get an 
understanding of the status of each 
license;
 ■ We have obtained management’s 
assessments of the indicators of 
impairment and associated audit 
evidence;
 ■ We have agreed the Columbus license 
extension date to the letters from 
the Oil and Gas Authority ‘OGA’, and 
evaluated management’s plans to 
achieve the necessary milestones;
 ■ We have assessed management’s 
business plan in relation to the 
Exploration and Evaluation assets and 
ensured any license commitments 
have been included within cashflow 
forecasts; 
 ■ We have tested the additions to the 
Exploration and Evaluation assets and 
agreed these to the company’s policy 
and ensured they are in line with 
IFRS 6.
We did not identify any 
exceptions in our testing of 
Exploration and Evaluation 
assets, and agree with 
management that the 
carrying value of these 
assets does not exceed their 
recoverable amounts.
We believe the conditions 
associated with the 
Columbus licence extension 
have been appropriately 
disclosed in the Annual 
Report.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine 
our audit scope for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the 
consolidated Financial Statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and 
effectiveness of group wide controls, changes in the business environment and other internal factors when assessing 
the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group Financial Statements, and to ensure we had adequate 
quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the Financial Statements we selected five components (2016: five), 
which represent the principal business units within the Group.
Of the five components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of two components 
(“full scope components”) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining three 
components (“specific scope components”), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that 
component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the Financial 
35 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. 
The components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2016: 96%) of the Group’s Profit before 
tax measure used to calculate materiality, 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s Revenue and 98% (2016: 99%) of the 
Group’s Total assets. 
For the current year, the full scope components contributed 100% (2016: 96%) of the Group’s Profit before tax, 100% 
(2016: 100%) of the Group’s Revenue and 86% (2016: 86%) of the Group’s Total assets. 
The specific scope component contributed 0% (2016: 0%) of the Group’s Profit before tax, 0% (2016: 0%) of the Group’s 
Revenue and 12% (2016: 13%) of the Group’s Total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included 
testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant tested for 
the Group. 
Of the remaining components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review, testing of consolidation 
journals and intercompany eliminations and foreign currency translation recalculations, to respond to any potential 
risks of material misstatement to the Group Financial Statements.
The charts below illustrate the coverage obtained from the work performed by the audit team.

Changes from the prior year
There were no significant changes in our scoping as compared to the prior year. We have performed full scope and 
specific procedures in 2017 on the same 5 number of components that were classified as full and specific scope in 
2016. Related audit procedures at these components have not significantly changed.
Involvement with component teams 
All audit work performed for the purposes of the audit was undertaken by the Group audit team.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified 
misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of the users of the Financial Statements. Materiality provides a basis for 
determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be USD$550 thousand (2016: USD$800 thousand), which is 5% of Group’s 
Profit before tax (2016: 8% of equity). We believe that Profit before tax represents one of the principal considerations 
for the users of the Financial Statements as opposed to the Group’s equity, which had been previously used in prior 
years’ audits due to the absence of a track record of profit. 
We determined materiality for the Parent Company to be USD$5,110 thousand (2016: USD$ 4,255 thousand, which 
is 5% (2016: 5%) of equity. Materiality for the Parent Company has been determined using equity. This is a different 
basis to the Group, where profit before tax is used, hence the Parent Company’s materiality is greater than that 
used for Group purposes. We use equity as the basis for materiality as the purpose of the Parent Company is to hold 
investments in its subsidiaries. 
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and updated its calculation for the actual financial 
results of the year. 
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  
TO THE MEMBERS OF SERICA ENERGY PLC CONTINUED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
36 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an 
appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds 
materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, 
our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2016: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely USD$ 
400 thousand (2016: USD$ 600 thousand). We based this judgement on factors including the past history of 
misstatements, our ability to assess the likelihood of misstatements and the effectiveness of the internal control 
environment.
Audit work at each location for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts 
is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each 
component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of 
the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to 
components was USD$200 thousand to USD$450 thousand (2016: USD$300 thousand to USD$600 thousand). 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of 
USD$28 thousand (2016: USD$40 thousand), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below 
that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above 
and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 4 to 24, other than 
the Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material 
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the Financial Statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to 
report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 ■ the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the Financial 
Statements are prepared is consistent with the Financial Statements; and 
 ■ the strategic report and directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
37 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained 
in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ 
report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires 
us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 ■ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 ■ the parent company Financial Statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 ■ certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 ■ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 31, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such 
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the Financial Statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements is located on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our 
auditor’s report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
42 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Authorisation of the Financial Statements and Statement of Compliance with IFRS
The Group’s and Company’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue by 
the Board of Directors on 9 April 2018 and the balance sheets were signed on the Board’s behalf by Antony Craven 
Walker and Mitch Flegg. Serica Energy plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England & 
Wales with its registered office at 52 George Street, London, W1U 7EA. The principal activity of the Company and the 
Group is to identify, acquire and subsequently exploit oil and gas reserves. Its current activities are located in the 
United Kingdom, Ireland, and Namibia. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on AIM.
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the EU as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 
2017. The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU as they 
apply to the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2017 and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The Group’s financial statements are also prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as issued by the IASB. The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group and by the Company are set 
out in note 2.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not 
to publish its individual income statement and related notes. The profit dealt with in the financial statements of the 
parent Company was US$17,103,000 (2016: profit US$10,838,000).
2. Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2017. 
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis and are presented in US 
dollars. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars (US$000) except when otherwise indicated.
Going Concern 
The Directors are required to consider the availability of resources to meet the Group’s liabilities for the foreseeable 
future. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and capital commitments are described in the Financial 
Review above.
At 31 December 2017 the Company held net current assets of US$29.3 million including cash and term deposits of 
US$34.0 million. The Erskine asset acquisition, completed in early June 2015 brought to Serica a producing interest 
capable of generating robust positive cash flow at current oil and gas prices. Existing resources plus Erskine revenues 
are expected to be sufficient to cover ongoing Erskine costs and the outstanding instalments of the acquisition price 
plus other operational, technical and administrative costs in the short-to-medium term. When the final decision to 
proceed with the Columbus development is made, the Group would consider a range of alternative means of finance 
to fund its share of development costs.
After making enquiries and having taken into consideration the above factors, the Directors have reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Use of judgement and estimates and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the disclosure of contingent assets 
and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s experience and other 
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual 
outcomes could differ from these estimates.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements are: the assessment of commercial reserves, the impairment of the Group 
and Company’s assets (including oil & gas development assets and Exploration and Evaluation “E&E” assets), and the 
recoverability of deferred tax assets.
43 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2. Accounting Policies continued
Assessment of commercial reserves
Management is required to assess the level of the Group’s commercial reserves together with the future expenditures 
to access those reserves, which are utilised in determining the amortisation and depletion charge for the period 
and assessing whether any impairment charge is required. The Group employs independent reserves specialists 
who periodically assess the Group’s level of commercial reserves by reference to data sets including geological, 
geophysical and engineering data together with reports, presentation and financial information pertaining to the 
contractual and fiscal terms applicable to the Group’s assets. In addition the Group undertakes its own assessment of 
commercial reserves and related future capital expenditure by reference to the same data sets using its own internal 
expertise. There has been no significant change to the management estimates and assumptions during the year that 
may impact the assessment of commercial reserves.
Assessment of the recoverable amount of intangible and tangible assets
The Group monitors internal and external indicators of impairment relating to its intangible and tangible assets, 
which may indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The Group’s most significant E&E 
asset is Columbus which is recorded in the Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2017 with a net book amount of US$40.8 
million. The carrying amount is dependent on the assumption that the terms of the licence extension to September 
2018 continue to be met, as outlined in further detail in the Review of Operations. The assessment of the existence of 
indicators of impairment in E&E assets involves judgement, which includes whether licence performance obligations 
can be met within the required regulatory timeframe, whether management expects to fund significant further 
expenditure in respect of a licence, and whether the recoverable amount may not cover the carrying value of the 
assets. For development and production assets judgement is involved when determining whether there have been 
any significant changes in the Group’s oil and gas reserves.
The Group determines whether E&E assets are impaired at an asset level and in regional cash generating units 
(‘CGUs’) when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of a regional CGU may exceed its 
recoverable amount. As recoverable amounts are determined based upon risked potential, or where relevant, 
discovered oil and gas reserves, this involves estimations and the selection of a suitable pre-tax discount rate relevant 
to the asset in question. The calculation of the recoverable amount of oil and gas development and production 
properties involves estimating the net present value of cash flows expected to be generated from the asset in 
question. Future cash flows are based on assumptions on matters such as estimated oil and gas reserve quantities 
and commodity prices. The discount rate applied is a pre-tax rate which reflects the specific risks of the country in 
which the asset is located.
Management is required to assess the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries in the parent company balance 
sheet for impairment by reference to the recoverable amount. This requires an estimate of amounts recoverable from 
oil and gas assets within the underlying subsidiaries (see note 16).
Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets, including those arising from unutilised tax losses, require management to assess the likelihood 
that the Group will generate sufficient taxable profits in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax 
assets. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management’s estimates of future 
cash flows. These estimates are based on forecast cash flows from operations (which are impacted by production 
and sales volumes, oil and natural gas prices, reserves, operating costs, decommissioning costs, capital expenditure, 
dividends and other capital management transactions) and judgement about the application of existing tax laws. 
The most significant variable behind the increased deferred tax asset recognised in 2017 from 2016 is the increase in 
management’s estimate of short-term forward commodity prices from prior year as other variables have remained 
largely unchanged. The most significant pricing assumptions are based on forward curve prices for the first three 
years. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the 
Group to realise deferred tax assets could be impacted.

Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Serica Energy plc (the “Company”) and its wholly 
owned subsidiaries Serica Holdings UK Limited, Serica Energy Holdings B.V., Serica Energy (UK) Limited, Serica 
Glagah Kambuna B.V., Serica Sidi Moussa B.V., Serica Foum Draa B.V., Serica Energy Slyne B.V., Serica Energy Rockall 
B.V., Serica Energy Namibia B.V., Serica Energy Corporation, Asia Petroleum Development Limited, Petroleum 
Development Associates (Asia) Limited and Petroleum Development Associates (Lematang) Limited. Together these 
comprise the “Group”.
All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional and presentational currency of Serica Energy plc and all its subsidiaries is US dollars.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the foreign currency 
rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and differences are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary 
items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at 
the date of initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rate at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange gains and losses arising from translation 
are charged to the income statement as an operating item.
Business Combinations and Goodwill
Business combinations from 1 January 2010
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as 
the aggregate of consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-
controlling interest in the acquiree. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Following initial acquisition it is measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to an impairment test at least annually 
and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
At the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units, or groups of cash 
generating units expected to benefit from the combination’s synergies. Impairment is determined by assessing the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, or groups of cash generating units to which the goodwill relates. 
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss 
is recognised.
Joint Arrangements
A joint operation is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have 
the rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
The Group conducts petroleum and natural gas exploration and production activities jointly with other venturers 
who each have direct ownership in and jointly control the operations of the ventures. These are classified as jointly 
controlled operations and the financial statements reflect the Group’s share of assets and liabilities in such activities. 
Income from the sale or use of the Group’s share of the output of jointly controlled operations, and its share of joint 
venture expenses, are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will 
flow to/from the Group and their amount can be measured reliably. 
Full details of Serica’s working interests in those petroleum and natural gas exploration and production activities 
classified as joint operations are included in the Review of Operations.
45 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2. Accounting Policies continued
Exploration and Evaluation Assets
As allowed under IFRS 6 and in accordance with clarification issued by the International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee, the Group has continued to apply its existing accounting policy to exploration and 
evaluation activity, subject to the specific requirements of IFRS 6. The Group will continue to monitor the application 
of these policies in light of expected future guidance on accounting for oil and gas activities.
Pre–licence Award Costs
Costs incurred prior to the award of oil and gas licences, concessions and other exploration rights are expensed in the 
income statement.
Exploration and Evaluation (E&E)
The costs of exploring for and evaluating oil and gas properties, including the costs of acquiring rights to explore, 
geological and geophysical studies, exploratory drilling and directly related overheads, are capitalised and classified as 
intangible E&E assets. These costs are directly attributed to regional CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing; UK 
& Ireland and Africa. 
E&E assets are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities but are assessed for impairment at an 
asset level and in regional CGUs when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of a regional cost 
centre may exceed its recoverable amount. Recoverable amounts are determined based upon risked potential, and 
where relevant, discovered oil and gas reserves. When an impairment test indicates an excess of carrying value 
compared to the recoverable amount, the carrying value of the regional CGU is written down to the recoverable 
amount in accordance with IAS 36. Such excess is expensed in the income statement. Where conditions giving 
rise to impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is reversed as a credit to the income 
statement.
Costs of licences and associated E&E expenditure are expensed in the income statement if licences are relinquished, 
or if management do not expect to fund significant future expenditure in relation to the licence.
The E&E phase is completed when either the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral 
resource are demonstrable or no further prospectivity is recognised. At that point, if commercial reserves have been 
discovered, the carrying value of the relevant assets, net of any impairment write-down, is classified as an oil and gas 
property within property, plant and equipment, and tested for impairment. If commercial reserves have not been 
discovered then the costs of such assets will be written off.
Asset Purchases and Disposals
When a commercial transaction involves the exchange of E&E assets of similar size and characteristics, no fair value 
calculation is performed. The capitalised costs of the asset being sold are transferred to the asset being acquired. 
Proceeds from a part disposal of an E&E asset, including back-cost contributions are credited against the capitalised 
cost of the asset, with any excess being taken to the income statement as a gain on disposal.
Farm–ins
In accordance with industry practice, the Group does not record its share of costs that are ‘carried’ by third parties 
in relation to its farm-in agreements in the E&E phase. Similarly, while the Group has agreed to carry the costs of 
another party to a Joint Operating Agreement (“JOA”) in order to earn additional equity, it records its paying interest 
that incorporates the additional contribution over its equity share.
Property, Plant and Equipment – Oil and gas properties
Capitalisation
Oil and gas properties are stated at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Oil and gas properties are accumulated into single field cost centres and represent the cost of developing the 
commercial reserves and bringing them into production together with the E&E expenditures incurred in finding 
commercial reserves previously transferred from E&E assets as outlined in the policy above. The cost will include, for 
qualifying assets, borrowing costs.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
46 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2. Accounting Policies continued
Depletion
Oil and gas properties are not depleted until production commences. Costs relating to each single field cost centre 
are depleted on a unit of production method based on the commercial proved and probable reserves for that cost 
centre. The depletion calculation takes account of the estimated future costs of development of recognised proved 
and probable reserves. Changes in reserve quantities and cost estimates are recognised prospectively from the last 
reporting date.
Impairment
A review is performed for any indication that the value of the Group’s development and production assets may be 
impaired.
For oil and gas properties when there are such indications, an impairment test is carried out on the cash generating 
unit. Each cash generating unit is identified in accordance with IAS 36. Serica’s cash generating units are those assets 
which generate largely independent cash flows and are normally, but not always, single development or production 
areas. If necessary, impairment is charged through the income statement if the capitalised costs of the cash 
generating unit exceed the recoverable amount of the related commercial oil and gas reserves.
Acquisitions, Asset Purchases and Disposals
Acquisitions of oil and gas properties are accounted for under the acquisition method when the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed constitute a business. 
Transactions involving the purchase of an individual field interest, or a group of field interests, that do not constitute 
a business, are treated as asset purchases. Accordingly, no goodwill and no deferred tax gross up arises, and the 
consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities purchased on an appropriate basis. Proceeds from the entire 
disposal of a development and production asset, or any part thereof, are taken to the income statement together 
with the requisite proportional net book value of the asset, or part thereof, being sold.
Decommissioning
Liabilities for decommissioning costs are recognised when the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove 
a production, transportation or processing facility and to restore the site on which it is located. Liabilities may arise 
upon construction of such facilities, upon acquisition or through a subsequent change in legislation or regulations. 
The amount recognised is the estimated present value of future expenditure determined in accordance with local 
conditions and requirements. A corresponding tangible item of property, plant and equipment equivalent to the 
provision is also created. 
Any changes in the present value of the estimated expenditure is added to or deducted from the cost of the assets 
to which it relates. The adjusted depreciable amount of the asset is then depreciated prospectively over its remaining 
useful life. The unwinding of the discount on the decommissioning provision is included as a finance cost.
Underlift/Overlift
Lifting arrangements for oil and gas produced in certain fields are such that each participant may not receive its 
share of the overall production in each period. The difference between cumulative entitlement and cumulative 
production less stock is ‘underlift’ or ‘overlift’. Underlift and overlift are valued at market value and included within 
debtors (‘underlift’) or creditors (‘overlift’). Movements during an accounting period are adjusted through revenue, 
such that gross profit is recognised on an entitlement basis.
Property, Plant and Equipment – Other
Computer equipment and fixtures, fittings and equipment are recorded at cost as tangible assets. The straight-line 
method of depreciation is used to depreciate the cost of these assets over their estimated useful lives. Computer 
equipment is depreciated over three years and fixtures, fittings and equipment over four years.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by the first-in first-out method 
and comprises direct purchase costs and transportation expenses.
47 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2. Accounting Policies continued
Investments
In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost less any provision 
for impairment.
Financial Instruments
Financial instruments comprise financial assets, cash and cash equivalents, financial liabilities and equity instruments.
Financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, 
or loans and receivables, as appropriate. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair 
value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset are capitalised 
unless they relate to a financial asset classified at fair value through profit and loss in which case transaction costs are 
expensed in the income statement. 
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and, where allowed and 
appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and derivatives. Financial 
assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market. After initial measurement loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost, 
using the effective interest rate method, less any allowance for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium on acquisition over the period to maturity. Gains and losses are recognised 
in the income statement when the loans and receivables are de-recognised or impaired, as well as through the 
amortisation process.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include balances with banks and short-term investments with original maturities of three 
months or less at the date acquired.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities include interest bearing loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are 
measured initially at the fair value of consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the 
amortisation process.
Equity
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded in equity at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation.
The Group’s fair value estimate in respect of contingent consideration that may be payable following the acquisition 
of its interest in the Erskine Field is capitalised as an asset acquisition cost. In determining fair value it is necessary 
to make a series of assumptions to estimate future operating costs and other variables. Accordingly, the fair value is 
categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Leases
Operating lease payments are recognised as an operating expense in the income statement on a straight line basis 
over the lease term.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
48 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2. Accounting Policies continued
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the 
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable 
and represents amounts receivable for goods provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs 
duties and sales taxes. Revenue from oil and natural gas production is recognised on an entitlement basis for the 
Group’s net working interest.
Finance Revenue
Finance revenue chiefly comprises interest income from cash deposits on the basis of the effective interest rate 
method and is disclosed separately on the face of the income statement.
Finance Costs
Finance costs of debt are allocated to periods over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. 
Arrangement fees and issue costs are amortised and charged to the income statement as finance costs over the term of 
the debt.
Share–Based Payment Transactions
Employees (including directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’).
Equity–settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which 
they are granted. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service or performance conditions, 
other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Serica Energy plc (‘market conditions’), if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period 
in which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the ‘vesting period’). The cumulative expense 
recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which 
the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately 
vest. The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised 
as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon 
a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-
vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. For equity awards cancelled 
by forfeiture when vesting conditions are not met, any expense previously recognised is reversed and recognised 
as a credit in the income statement. Equity awards cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on the date of 
cancellation, and any expense not recognised for the award at that date is recognised in the income statement. 
Estimated associated national insurance charges are expensed in the income statement on an accruals basis.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or 
settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. 
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any 
modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified 
award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Income Taxes
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid 
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method and tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. Provision is made for temporary differences at the balance sheet date between 
the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax is 
provided on all temporary differences except for:
49 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2. Accounting Policies continued
 ■ temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future; and
 ■ temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the income statement nor taxable profit 
or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are presented net only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and if the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during 
the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of shares that would be issued on the conversion 
of all relevant potentially dilutive shares to ordinary shares. It is assumed that any proceeds obtained on the exercise 
of any options and warrants would be used to purchase ordinary shares at the average price during the period. Where 
the impact of converted shares would be anti-dilutive, these are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings.
New and amended standards and interpretations
The Group has adopted and applied the following standards that are relevant to its operations for the first time for the 
annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2017:
 ■ Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes – Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses;
 ■ Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014 – 216 Cycle): IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities; and
 ■ Disclosure Initiative Amendments – IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows.
There are no new or amended standards or interpretations effective for the first time for periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2017 that had a significant impact on the financial statements.
Standards issued but not yet effective
Certain standards or interpretations issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial 
statements are listed below. This listing of standards and interpretations issued are those that the Group reasonably 
expects to have an impact on disclosures, financial position or performance when applied at a future date. The Group 
is currently assessing the impact of these standards and intends to adopt them when they become effective.

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which replaces IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new 
requirements for classification and measurement, impairment under the ‘expected credit loss’ (‘ECL’) model and 
hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application 
permitted. The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date and will not restate 
comparative information. During 2017, the Group has performed an impact assessment for the application of IFRS 
9. This assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject to changes arising from further 
reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Group in 2018. The Group’s receivables have 
a good credit rating and there has been no noted change in the credit risk of receivables in the year, therefore the 
Group does not believe that the new ECL impairment methodology will have a material impact on the valuation of 
financial assets. The Company’s review of the impact of the new ECL impairment methodology on intercompany 
receivables is ongoing.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and amended in April 2016. It establishes a single comprehensive model that will apply 
to revenue arising from contracts with customers. IFRS 15 will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance 
including IAS 18 Revenue and related interpretations when it becomes effective, for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018. 
Although IFRS 15 does not generally represent a change from Serica’s current practice, and the impact review is 
ongoing, the accounting for certain contracts, such as those for underlifts and overlifts, have been identified as areas 
of potential change. Movements in liquids overlift/underlift currently disclosed in sales revenue (see note 4) will be 
classified in cost of sales.
IFRS 16 Leases 
IFRS 16 Leases, issued in January 2016, sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and 
disclosure of leases for both lessors and lessees. It replaces the previous leases standard IAS 17 Leases and is effective 
from 1 January 2019. Under the new standard all lease contracts, with limited exceptions, are recognised in financial 
statements by way of right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities. Compared with the existing accounting 
for operating leases, it will also impact the classification and timing of expenses and consequently the classification 
between cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from financing activities.
Serica will not early adopt IFRS 16. The impact of the adoption of the new standard at 1 January 2019, will be 
dependent on factors such as Serica’s lease contracts at that date and the discount rate to be applied in accordance 
with IFRS 16, and therefore the impact cannot be determined from the disclosure of the minimum lease payments 
in accordance with IAS 17 in Note 28, which are not currently material. A detailed review of Serica’s contracts is under 
way to determine the impact of the new standard.

c) Recognised and unrecognised tax losses
Following the acquisition of a producing UK asset in 2015, the Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of US$16.2 
million (2016: US$10.0 million) in respect of certain carried forward losses that are expected to be utilised in the 
foreseeable future to offset the taxable profits that the acquired asset is expected to generate. 
The Group has UK ring fence tax losses of US$146.5 million available as at 31 December 2017 (2016: US$165.6 million) 
which form part of total UK tax losses of approximately US$176.1 million (2016: US$194.6 million) that are available 
indefinitely for offset against future trading profits of the companies in which the losses arose. Of this amount 
US$47.8 million (2016: US$50.3 million) has been set off against taxable temporary differences. The benefit of 
approximately US$87.8 million (2016: US$119.5 million) of tax losses has not been recognised in these consolidated 
statements which reflects the extent of the total available UK tax losses that have not either been recognised in the 
net deferred tax asset or set against a deferred tax liability arising.

e) Changes to UK corporation tax legislation
The main rate of UK corporation tax changed from 20% to 19% on 1 April 2017 and will change to 18% on 1 April 2020. 
The UK Finance Bill 2016 includes a reduction of the UK corporation tax rate to 17% on 1 April 2020. This will replace 
the 18% UK corporation tax rate that is currently legislated to take effect.
In March 2016 it was announced that the rate of SC would be reduced from 20% to 10% with effect from 1 January 
2016. This was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016 and reduced the headline rate of tax to 40% for ring-fenced 
trading profits.

13. Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings or loss per ordinary share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit or loss for the year attributable 
to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during 
the year. 
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders 
of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares into 
ordinary shares.

In June 2015, Serica Energy (UK) Limited acquired an 18% non-operated interest in the Erskine field located in the 
UK Central North Sea. This was treated as an asset acquisition. The total acquisition cost initially recorded was 
US$10.2 million (comprising cash consideration of US$8.885 million and non-cash consideration of US$1.35 million) 
which reflected the headline price plus internal transition costs less net income attributable to the interest from the 
effective date of 1 January 2014. Additions of US$0.3 million during 2017 (2016: US$1.5 million) comprise US$0.5 million 
(2016: US$2.2 million) relating to the Company’s estimate of contingent payments due to BP (see note 23) partially 
offset by other pre-completion date adjustments and revisions.

In the Company financial statements, the cost of the investment acquired on an historic reorganisation in 2005 was 
calculated with reference to the market value of Serica Energy Corporation as at the date of the reorganisation. As 
a UK company, under Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is entitled to merger relief on its share 
reorganisation with Serica Energy Corporation, and the excess of US$112,174,000 over the nominal value of shares 
issued (US$7,475,000) has been credited to a merger reserve. Following the impairment charges recorded in 2010 
and 2013 against the Company’s investment in subsidiary undertakings, all amounts initially credited to the merger 
reserve have been eliminated. 
Management has assessed the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries in the parent company balance sheet 
for impairment by reference to the recoverable amount. The reduction of US$17,909,000 (2016: US$12,954,000) in 
provision for impairment against amounts owed by Group undertakings (see note 18) has been made following an 
increase in value attributed to certain of the oil and gas assets held by the Company’s subsidiary undertakings.

Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties. The gas put option commodity 
contract with BP (fair value hierarchy level 2) is measured based on a consensus of mid-market values from third 
party providers based on the Black Scholes model with inputs of observable spot commodities price, interest rates 
and the volatility of the commodity.
BKR prepayment facility
Non-current liabilities of US$3.8 million as at 31 December 2017 represent amounts drawn under the prepayment 
facility made between Serica and BP Gas and dated 21 November 2017. Under this facility, BP Gas has agreed to 
provide for drawings to cover the initial consideration and cost of premiums payables for gas price puts (hedging 
instruments which set a floor price for certain volumes of gas production) which have been purchased by Serica in 
conjunction with signing the acquisition agreement. The prepayment facility of up to £16 million carries interest at 
one-month LIBOR plus 4.5% per annum compounded monthly and added to the outstanding amount and has a 
maximum duration of three years from initial drawings. Repayments will commence six months after completion 
and be based on 35% of Serica’s retained share of gas sales revenues from the BKR Assets including any price related 
hedging gains and after deduction of those proportions due to BP under the Net Cash Flow Sharing Deed.

As at 31 December 2017, the cash balance of US$28.3 million contains an amount of US$3.1 million that is secured 
against a bank guarantee given in respect of operational and capital expenditure to be carried out during 2018 on the 
Erskine field in the UK. The funds are freely transferrable but alternative collateral would need to be put in place to 
replace the cash security.
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short-term deposits and term deposits 
are made for varying periods of between one and ninety-five days depending on the immediate cash requirements of 
the Group, and earn interest at the respective short to medium term deposit rates. The Group’s exposure to credit risk 
arises from potential default of a counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount. The Group 
seeks to minimise counterparty credit risks by only depositing cash surpluses with major banks of high quality credit 
standing, and spreading the placement of funds over a range of institutions. 
Financial institutions, and their credit ratings, which held greater than 10% of the Group’s cash and short-term

Under the terms of the Erskine acquisition, certain contingent payments may be made by Serica related to savings in field 
operating costs. The current fair value estimated provision for these amounts is US$2.7 million which has been capitalised 
as an asset acquisition cost (see note 15). Uncertainties currently exist as to the quantification of any final payment.
No provision for decommissioning liabilities for the Erskine field is recorded as at 31 December 2016 or 2017 as the 
Group’s current estimate for such costs is under the agreed capped level to be funded by BP. This has been fixed at a 
gross £174.0 million (£31.32 million net to Serica) with this figure adjusted for inflation.
Company
The Company has no provisions.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
66 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 24. Financial Instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, bank loans and borrowings, accounts payable 
and accounts receivable. It is management’s opinion that the Group is not exposed to significant interest, credit or 
currency risks arising from its financial instruments other than as discussed below:
 ■ Serica has exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its cash deposits and the BP consideration liability; given 
the level of expenditure plans over 2018/19 this is managed in the short-term through selecting treasury deposit 
periods of one to three months. Cash and treasury credit risks are mitigated through spreading the placement 
of funds over a range of institutions each carrying acceptable published credit ratings to minimise concentration 
and counterparty risk.
 ■ Where Serica operates joint ventures on behalf of partners it seeks to recover the appropriate share of costs from 
these third parties. The majority of partners in these ventures are well established oil and gas companies. In the 
event of non payment, operating agreements typically provide recourse through increased venture shares. 
 ■ Serica retains certain non US$ cash holdings and other financial instruments relating to its operations. The US$ 
reporting currency value of these may fluctuate from time to time causing reported foreign exchange gains and 
losses. Serica maintains a broad strategy of matching the currency of funds held on deposit with the expected 
expenditures in those currencies. Management believes that this mitigates most of any actual potential currency 
risk from financial instruments.
 ■ It is management’s opinion that the fair value of its financial instruments approximate to their carrying values, 
unless otherwise noted.

Credit risk
The Group’s and Company’s exposure to credit risk relating to financial assets arises from the default of a 
counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value as at the balance sheet date. The Group’s oil and 
gas sales are all contracted with well established oil and gas or energy companies. Also, where Serica operates joint 
ventures on behalf of partners it seeks to recover the appropriate share of costs from the third party counterparties. 
The majority of partners in these ventures are well established oil and gas companies. In the event of non-payment, 
operating agreements typically provide recourse through increased venture shares. Cash and treasury credit risks are 
mitigated through spreading the placement of funds over a range of institutions each carrying acceptable published 
credit ratings to minimise counterparty risk.

Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk. Where and when appropriate the Group will put in place suitable 
hedging arrangements to mitigate the risk of a fall in commodity prices.
During 2016, 9% of the Group’s gas production was sold at fixed prices under a contract which expired on 30 
September 2016. All gas production is now sold at prices linked to the spot market. All oil and NGL production was 
sold at prices linked to the spot market. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group held put options covering 2018, 2019 and 1H 2020 daily volumes of 230,000, 240,000 
and 160,000 therms per day respectively, of gas at floor prices of 35 pence per therm.
At 31 December 2017, the Group held put options, which place no ceiling on sales prices, giving coverage for daily 
volumes of 900 barrels of oil at a floor price of US$55 per barrel to end Q1 2018.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
Management assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, other 
current liabilities and the non-current financial liability under the BKR prepayment facility approximate their carrying 
amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. As such the fair value hierarchy is not provided.
Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to maintain appropriate levels of funding to meet the 
commitments of its forward programme of exploration, production and development expenditure, and to safeguard 
the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and create shareholder value. At 31 December 2017, capital 
employed of the Group amounted to US$106.1 million (comprised of US$102.3 million of equity shareholders’ funds 
and US$3.8 of borrowings), compared to US$85.1 million at 31 December 2016 (comprised of US$85.1 million of equity 
shareholders’ funds and US$nil of borrowings).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
72 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 27. Share–Based Payments
The Company operates three discretionary incentive share option plans: the Serica Energy Plc Long Term Incentive 
Plan (the “LTIP”), which was adopted by the Board on 20 November 2017 which permits the grant of share-based 
awards, the 2017 CSOP, which was adopted by the Board on 20 November 2017, and the Serica 2005 Option Plan, 
which was adopted by the Board on 14 November 2005. Awards can no longer be made under the Serica 2005 Option 
Plan, however, options remain outstanding under the Serica 2005 Option Plan. The LTIP and the 2017 CSOP together 
are known as the “Discretionary Plans”. The Board has not yet made any grants under the 2017 CSOP but announced 
in November 2017 that certain share awards, detailed below, under the LTIP would be granted in due course. 
A separate plan, the Serica Energy plc Company Share Option Plan (“2016 CSOP”), was approved for adoption at the 
Company’s AGM in June 2016, but this was terminated with effect from 29 November 2017 following the adoption of 
two further discretionary plans on 20 November 2017, and there are no outstanding options under the 2016 CSOP.
The Discretionary Plans will govern all future grants of options by the Company to Directors, officers, key employees 
and certain consultants of the Group. The Directors intend that the maximum number of ordinary shares which may 
be utilised pursuant to the Discretionary Plans will not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary shares of the Company from 
time to time in line with the recommendations of the Association of British Insurers. 
The objective of these plans is to develop the interest of Directors, officers, key employees and certain consultants 
of the Group in the growth and development of the Group by providing them with the opportunity to acquire an 
interest in the Company and to assist the Company in retaining and attracting executives with experience and ability.
Serica 2005 Option Plan
As at 31 December 2017, the Company has granted 24,332,460 options under the Serica 2005 Option Plan, 8,196,330 
of which are currently outstanding. 400,000 of these options were granted to a consultant subject to performance 
conditions, and the 2,500,000 options granted to a director in July 2015 were all awarded at prices higher than the 
current market price at the time of the grant to establish firm performance targets.
The Company calculates the value of share-based compensation using a Black-Scholes option pricing model (or 
other appropriate model for those Directors’ options subject to certain market conditions) to estimate the fair value 
of share options at the date of grant. There are no cash settlement alternatives. The estimated fair value of options 
is amortised to expense over the options’ vesting period. US$98,000 has been charged to the income statement 
in continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: US$90,000) and a similar amount credited to 
the share-based payments reserve, classified as ‘Other reserve’ in the Balance Sheet. A charge of US$46,000 (2016: 
US$22,000) of the total continuing operations charge was in respect of key management personnel (defined in note 
9). The charge of US$98,000 expensed in 2017 includes an amount of US$50,000 (US$25,000 attributable to key 
management personnel) in relation to awards that are to be granted under the LTIP in 2018 and detailed below. This 
charge was attributable for the December 2017 period as the relevant Directors and employees were considered to be 
rendering services in consideration for awards that were deemed as granted at that time under IFRS2. 
No options were granted in 2016 or 2017 under the Serica 2005 Option Plan. 
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of, and movements in, share 
options during the year:

The weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding as at 31 December 2017 is 5.6 years (2016:

For the Serica 2005 option plan, the exercise price for outstanding options at the 2017 year-end ranges from £0.07 to

In March 2017, the Group entered into an extension of its existing London office operating lease with a minimum 
commitment of a rolling three-month period.
In December 2017, the Group entered into a new and additional office operating lease with a minimum commitment 
period until June 2018.
29. Capital Commitments and Contingencies
At 31 December 2017, other amounts contracted for but not provided in the financial statements for the acquisition 
of exploration and evaluation assets amounted to US$nil for the Group and US$nil for the Company (2016: US$nil and 
US$nil respectively). 
The Company also has obligations to carry out defined work programmes on its oil and gas properties, under the 
terms of the award of rights to these properties. The Company is not obliged to meet other joint venture partner 
shares of these programmes.
Non-Erskine commitments
The Group has no significant exploration commitments. 
Other less material minimum obligations include G&G, seismic work and ongoing licence fees in the UK, Namibia and 
Ireland.
Erskine field commitments
The Erskine field acquisition has brought certain financial commitments. Net revenues from the Erskine field 
are expected to assist Serica in building its cash resources over coming months and years, but the Group has an 
obligation to pay to BP the remaining tranche of US$2.775 million (excluding interest) cash consideration on or before 
1 July 2018. 
Other
The Group occasionally has to provide security for a proportion of its future obligations to defined work programmes 
or other commitments. As at 31 December 2017, the cash balance of US$28.3 million contains an amount of US$3.1 
million that is secured against a bank guarantee given in respect of operational and capital expenditure to be carried 
out during 2018 on the Erskine field in the UK. The funds are freely transferrable but alternative collateral would need 
to be put in place to replace the cash security. No such obligations and cash collateral existed as at 31 December 2016.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts and guarantees the indebtedness of other companies 
within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this 
respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time that it becomes probable 
that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
