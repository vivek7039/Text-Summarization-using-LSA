HEADLINES
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
• Total Group revenue, excluding VAT, was up 5.7% on the previous year to £127.9m.
• Group like-for-like* sales of £131.5m, including VAT, up 5.3% (2015/16: up 8.2%):
 – Like-for-like* retail sales up 6.0% (2015/16: up 7.6%)
 – Like-for-like* hire sales, representing 13.7% of sales, up 1.5% (2015/16: up 11.7%)
• E-commerce sales including VAT up 15.7% (2015/16: up 36.3%) now 11% of total sales
 – Mobile and tablet sales growth strong and now 43% of total e-commerce sales
• Proﬁt before tax up 20.3% at £7.1m (2015/16: £5.9m before exceptional items).
•  EBITDA** up 8.8% to £13.6m (2015/16: EBITDA** £12.5m), driven by improved sales, more targeted 
discounting and tight control of costs.
• Gross margin improved in total for the year by 1.5% to 61.3%, due to lower levels of discounting. 
•  Strong cash balance of £19.5m (30 January 2016: £17.3m) through close management of working 
capital and notwithstanding a further £8.8m capital investment across the business. Cash generated 
from operating activities of £16.0m (2015/16: £11.6m).
•  Basic earnings per share of 5.51 pence, up 17% (2015/16: 4.71 pence before exceptional items, 2015/16: 
4.65 pence after exceptional items).
•  Final dividend proposed of 3.98 pence, total dividend for the year 5.89 pence, up 6.1% on the previous 
year (2015/16: total dividend 5.55 pence).
OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
•  Beneﬁts from ongoing investment in a strong brand identity and store reﬁt programme continue, 
delivering an environment to showcase our enhanced product range.
•  E-commerce sales continue to grow, leveraging the process improvements and ‘back-end’ 
infrastructure investments made during the year.
• ‘Tailor Me’ custom tailoring service gaining traction with customers, nationwide.
•  Senior team strengthened during the year with the recruitment of a new Finance Director, Chief 
Operating Ofﬁcer and Customer Director, driving our focus on service delivery.
CURRENT TRADING
•  Retail like-for-like* sales, including VAT, in the ﬁrst 7 weeks of the new ﬁnancial year are up 4.3% 
(7 week period avoids a non LFL Easter bank holiday in week 8 last year).
•  Easter, which marks the start of the wedding season, falls 3 weeks later in 2017, temporarily delaying 
some hire order collections and therefore revenues by three weeks. Hire orders booked for collection in 
2017/18 are currently -1% on the previous year.
•  Hire like for like*, reported on a ‘cash taken’ basis, is -14.3% in the ﬁrst 7 weeks, due to the 
implementation of our “£10 deposit” offer in store. This clearly impacts LFL revenues and means that 
during the early part of the Hire season we are holding a materially smaller value of deposits on a ‘cash 
taken’ basis. 
•  Early responses to the Spring Summer 2017 range across Retail and to the new Hire ranges have been 
good.
• We continue to grow our presence on the high street and online.
• The Group’s trading performance continues in line with the Board’s expectations.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to report another year of considerable progress for the Group. 
Total like-for-like* sales including VAT reﬂected a 5.3% increase on the prior year. Proﬁt before taxation 
was up 20.3% to £7.1m, compared with £5.9m in the previous year. EBITDA** continued on a positive trend 
to £13.6m, compared with £12.5m in the previous year. Similarly, our cash position continues to be very 
strong, despite the ongoing reﬁt programme. 
The retail environment became one of the most highly competitive we have seen for some considerable 
time, with heavy and intense discounting. We remained focused on our multi-branded and segmented 
pricing architecture and traded our way through what was an unforgiving market, which saw a number of 
new branded entrants to the Menswear market and the exit or reduction in market share for a couple of 
long established brands, reinforcing the need for us to keep close to consumer trends and to modernise 
our offer accordingly.
The core Moss Bros master brand is now well established and we saw reasonable growth in each of our 
supporting sub-brands of Moss London, Moss 1851, and Moss Esq, with Moss London expanding our reach 
to a younger customer, capitalising on the growing trend of occasions like School Proms. 
Actions to develop our product offer have included the growth of ‘Tailor Me’, which is achieving signiﬁcant 
traction as a more accessible form of bespoking, enabling a signiﬁcant proportion of our suit range to be 
personalised. This unique proposition is now available across our entire estate and we have grown sales 
throughout the last 12 months, undoubtedly adding to our growth in market share.
We have almost completed our store reﬁt programme this year, completing 11 reﬁts, which means almost 
all of our store estate has now been modernised over the last four years. This increased investment 
has impacted cash in the short term as planned but the proven payback means we are achieving the 
returns predicted and we turn our attention now to maintaining and reﬁning our estate to reﬂect the more 
premium positioning of our brands amongst our target customers. 
We opened a further 7 stores in Westﬁeld Stratford City, the Merry Hill shopping centre, Worcester, Belfast, 
Harrogate, Newbury and on Teesside. We also relocated our Hatﬁeld store and closed 4 stores, giving us 
an overall store count of 127 stores, compared with 124 last year.
We continued the development of the organisation and talent by the recruitment of a new Group Finance 
Director Tony Bennett, who joined us in August 2016. We have also recruited a new Buying Director, 
Nick Reed, who joins us from Charles Tyrwhitt, the multi-channel Menswear retailer, which he joined in 
2000. He has a strong product, brand and commercial background in online, multi-site and international 
consumer businesses, with highly relevant experience in Menswear. He will join us in April 2017. 
We have a strong and stable team of Non-Executive Directors and continue to review our succession plans 
with rigour to be sure we manage the succession of the Board and its various Committees in a seamless 
way, ensuring we retain the highest levels of governance. 
The team continues to apply strong cash and working capital controls and the business continues to 
be debt free, with a healthy cash balance, supporting the Board’s progressive dividend and investment 
policies.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED
The Board is proposing the payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 3.98 pence per share to be paid on 23 June 2017 
to all shareholders on the register on 2 June 2017 (ex dividend date 1 June 2017). The recommended 
total dividend for the year will be 5.89 pence per share, an increase of 6.1% on the previous year. It is our 
intention to continue this progressive dividend policy balanced against the wider investment needs of the 
business. 
In the coming year, we will leverage our roll out of ‘Tailor Me’, accelerate the reinvention of our Hire 
offer and leverage and continue to build the infrastructure to modernise our multi-channel offer, whilst 
investing more in our colleague and service propositions. This will be done in the context of signiﬁcant 
external cost pressures from the increases in the National Living Wage, the Apprenticeship Levy, the 
revaluation of business rates and increased purchasing costs due to the combined effects of a devalued 
pound. We expect the trading environment for the business in 2017 to remain challenging.
Although we recognise external macro challenges, we are well placed to leverage our specialist 
credentials and to enhance our position as ‘the ﬁrst choice for men’s tailoring’.
Finally, I would like to recognise the fact that we differentiate ourselves through the highest levels of 
customer service, which is the result of substantial training and hard work of all of our people. I would like 
to thank them all for their continued dedication and contribution to another successful year for the Group.

STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVE
Moss Bros Group PLC (“the Group”) retails and hires formal wear for men, predominantly in the UK. 
The Group operates mainly through Moss Bros branded mainstream stores, promoting a number of own 
branded sub brands and third party brands. The Group also trades through the premium Savoy Taylors 
Guild fascia, where there is a historical link in areas such as the Strand in London. 
The Group’s vision is to be the ‘ﬁrst choice for men’s tailoring’ through creating a multi-channel menswear 
business focused on our target customer groups. There are three pillars to this strategy:
1)  Implement a clear brand strategy leveraging the Moss Bros master brand and complementary sub-
brands.
2) Achieve full omni-channel capability so that customers can shop seamlessly across all channels.
3)  Deliver a consistently outstanding customer experience across all channels through great service and 
great environments. 
Through the customer insight project completed in 2013 our customers have told us very clearly how much 
they value the Moss Bros brand for its expertise, heritage, product quality and value for money. Some 
potential customers lacked awareness of our retailing credentials and product offer. We have therefore 
continued to develop the positioning of the brand, and we re-launched our sub-brands under the master 
brand of Moss Bros in Autumn 2014. Our sub-brands now comprise:
– Moss London – Slim ﬁt styles targeted at younger, style conscious 
– Moss 1851 – Great quality suits with a tailored ﬁt for business and leisure 
– Moss Esq. – Great value suits for everyday wear with regular ﬁt 
A key objective of our e-commerce initiatives is to provide a full omni-channel offer to all customers, 
offering a number of ways to shop. The project to create a single customer database, including full 
customer transaction history, is complete and offers signiﬁcant customer relationship management 
(“CRM”) opportunities for the business. Our online performance continues to grow, with signiﬁcant 
increases in conversion rates and sales, driven by the launch of our fully responsive website, particularly 
through mobile and tablet channels. 
There are also opportunities to exploit online international growth and to grow and develop our UK store 
estate. The UK store refurbishment programme is nearing completion, with positive results seen from 
reﬁtted stores compared to non-reﬁtted stores. Reﬁtted stores are achieving our three year payback target 
and an enhanced customer experience.

The first choice for
men’s tailoring 
 
Supply chain and Infrastructure
In order that staff throughout the business are inspired and motivated to work to achieve the strategy and 
objectives of the business, we have launched an initiative to articulate these to the wider business. The 
initiative, titled ‘The Moss Bros Way’ is centred on four themes:
• Proud to Sell
• Customer for Life
• Passionate Experts
• Winning Teams
RETAIL
There are 105 Moss Bros stores (2015/16: 101 in total) and 22 Moss Bros outlet stores (2015/16: 23) as at 
28 January 2017, which trade Moss Bros own brands and carefully selected third party brands including 
Hugo Boss, Canali, Ted Baker, DKNY and French Connection, where the store proﬁle demonstrates a 
demand for this type of product. The vast majority of the stores also have a Moss Bros Hire ‘store within a 
store’ operation within them. 
In parallel with operational improvements, we have continued to review the positioning of the Moss Bros 
brand with current and potential customers and the overall perceived value of the offering. The concept 
of Moss Bros for Hire, Ready to Wear or Bespoke underpins our vision to be ‘the ﬁrst choice for men’s 
tailoring’. 
HIRE
Moss Bros Hire is the market leader in the UK hire market and the number one recognised name for hire. 
We had 124 Moss Bros Hire outlets as at 28 January 2017 (2015/16:120); all contained within core Moss 
Bros Retail and Savoy Taylors Guild Stores. 
The gross margin for Hire has seen a small decline in recent years as a result of improvements in quality 
assurance and more thorough garment ﬁnishing within the dry cleaning process along with the shorter life 
of ﬁner fabrics used for our most contemporary Hire ranges. This has improved customer experience and 
underpinned the Hire business.  MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 7 
E-COMMERCE
During 2016 we launched a fully responsive website which automatically optimises itself for the device 
upon which a customer is browsing. We are seeing improved customer conversion as a result. Our 
international reach has been refocused on local currency websites in the USA, the Republic of Ireland and 
Australia. 
Our transactional Hire website continues to grow with ‘group booking’ functionality gaining traction. 
Whilst still at an early stage of growth the results are encouraging and there is strong evidence of wedding 
hire customers beginning their journey online before engaging with our store estate to complete the 
transaction. Based on experience to date a number of further enhancements are planned for 2017 to 
improve customer experience and grow the business.
SUPPLY CHAIN AND COSTS
The buying team continually assesses supplier performance, to ensure the most commercially beneﬁcial 
results for the Group and to minimise lead times. Over the last few years, we have broadened direct 
sourcing from China and neighbouring countries and continued to achieve better buying margins and 
product quality. Costs remain tightly controlled with all expenditure carefully planned and monitored. With 
a continued increase in sales, the focus has shifted to process efﬁciencies, enabling us to further simplify 
the business. 
INFRASTRUCTURE
Appropriate deployment of information technology is vitally important to the success of our business and in 
enabling the establishment of a multi-channel shopping environment. We will continue to ensure that we 
have a ﬂexible, resilient and scalable technology platform which will underpin our future business growth. 
Additionally, we need to ensure that our customer facing technology facilitates the delivery of a consistently 
outstanding customer service through whichever channel a customer chooses to shop with us.
The operational efﬁciency of our distribution centre based in Barking is closely monitored. Options for 
improving its performance, including space management, are continually appraised by the operations 
team to streamline the business. 
PEOPLE
The need for talented and committed people across all areas of the Group requires a continuing focus on 
effective recruitment, induction and performance appraisal and management. Developing and nurturing 
talent will play a central and enhanced role in the business going forward, with our People strategy 
gaining momentum in 2016. The launch of the Moss Bros Way in 2016 focused our culture and behaviours 
around common goals to further build the business and our annual company-wide staff survey will help to 
benchmark progress.
Employment policies do not discriminate between employees or potential employees on the grounds of 
gender, colour, race, nationality, ethnic origin, national origin, religion, religious beliefs, sexual orientation 
or age. It remains the Group’s policy to give full and sympathetic consideration to the employment, 
training, career development and promotion of disabled employees. Special consideration is given to the 
continuity of employment of any employee becoming disabled after their employment has commenced and, 
where practicable, to the provision of alternative employment. 8 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS 
The Group has continued to make strong progress throughout the year. The ongoing store reﬁt programme 
in 2016/17 means that 97 of our 127 stores were trading in the new format at the year end. This, combined 
with our ongoing focus on product and brand development, has meant that our customer offer continues to 
go from strength to strength. Building brand equity in this way, alongside signiﬁcant improvements in our 
multi-channel proposition, leaves us well placed to capitalise on the tailoring expertise which we possess 
in-store and online. Our ‘Tailor Me’ personalisation service further adds to our proposition, making us the 
ideal destination whether a customer wishes to buy, rent or tailor their perfect suit.
RETAIL
We continued to pursue operational improvements across the business, which when combined with our 
ongoing investment in store reﬁts during the year, beneﬁted like-for-like* sales, which were up by 6.0% 
on the previous year (2015/16: up by 7.6%). Retail gross margins improved on the previous year by 2.2% 
as a result of more focused promotional activity. Stock levels were kept closely under control throughout 
the year. 
We opened 7 brand new stores, and closed 4 in the UK during the year. A further store was relocated into a 
larger and better location. We are considering additional new store opening opportunities in the UK in the 
next 12 months and currently have 4 conﬁrmed openings for 2017. The Group now trades from 127 stores 
(30 January 2016: 124 stores).
The inherent ﬂexibility in our property estate gives us options in what we anticipate will be a fast changing 
retail landscape. The average lease length across the store portfolio is only 56 months and we are 
targeting improved lease terms on renewal, of a 10 year term, with a tenant only break clause at year 5. 
The underpinning of hire and the demand for e-commerce ‘click & collect’ and ‘click & return’ points, 
together with advantageous lease deals, means there is an opportunity to expand our store footprint on a 
selective and cost effective basis, with good returns.
HIRE
Overall like-for-like* hire sales increased by 1.5% in the year, following very strong growth in the previous 
ﬁnancial year (2015/16: 11.7%). The broadening of the range to include lounge suits has proved very 
successful and has received enthusiastic positive customer feedback. We continue to invest in our Hire 
business both in terms of additional Hire product lines and improvements in our underlying Hire systems. 
Although currently small, our online Hire offer is increasing in its contribution to the overall Hire business.
We are conﬁdent our position as the leading hire brand will be maintained through the product and 
technology initiatives currently underway.
E-COMMERCE
Sales grew very strongly, up 15.7% on the previous year. Online sales now represent 11% of total sales 
(2015/16: 10%). Visitor conversion shows strong growth across all electronic devices and is growing 
particularly rapidly from customers reaching us via mobile devices since the introduction of a fully device 
responsive website in the second half of 2016.
Mobile and tablet sales growth was particularly strong and now comprises 43% of total e-commerce sales. 
Investment of both capital and expertise into the e-commerce customer experience has seen a signiﬁcant 
reduction in the number of customer contacts received regarding their online shopping experience. This 
improvement has provided us with the conﬁdence to actively acquire additional new customers and also 
focus attention on building on our existing customer repurchase behaviour.

The Hire website continues to gain traction and we believe it will achieve further growth, with wedding hire 
customers more frequently beginning their journey online before engaging with our stores to complete 
their transaction. We will continue to invest in enhancements to the Hire website in order to further 
improve the customer experience and subsequent conversion rates.
SUPPLY CHAIN AND COSTS
The effective clearance of residual stock through stores and online has enabled new seasons’ stock to be 
introduced into stores earlier, improving the customer offer and enabling much greater scope for tactical 
promotions. 
The increase in direct sourcing of stock from the Far East has increased our exposure to foreign exchange 
risk, but this was fully mitigated by our hedging policy during 2016/17.
We increased capacity at our warehouse during 2016 both in terms of volumes of stock which we can hold 
and also the volume of e-commerce orders which we can process.
PEOPLE
Ongoing plans are in place to establish a stronger service culture within the business, to support our aim 
to become the ‘ﬁrst choice for men’s tailoring’. Investment in people through recruitment, induction, and 
performance management continues, with a broad range of programmes available to all of our colleagues. 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Performance improvement across the business continued in 2016/17 with strong like-for-like* sales 
growth and continued control over costs. Proﬁt before taxation on continuing operations was £7.1m, 
compared with an underlying proﬁt of £5.9m in the previous year, an increase of 20.3%.
REVENUE
Overall revenue was up 5.7% (up 5.3% like-for-like*) on the previous year to £127.9m. Retail was up 6.7% 
(up 6.0% like-for-like*) on the previous year . Hire was 0.4% lower (up 1.5% like-for-like) on the previous year . 
GROSS MARGIN
Underlying overall gross margin increased by 1.5% in the year (61.3% vs 59.8%), due to removal of the 
Spring 2016 mid-season sale and more targeted promotional campaigns leading to lower levels of 
discounting.
COSTS
Administrative and shops’ selling and marketing costs before exceptional items increased by 7.3% on the 
prior year, as planned. Costs remain tightly controlled with expenditure focused on areas that will add 
value and support the development of the strategic goals of the Group. 
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional items are signiﬁcant items of an unusual or non-recurring nature which are disclosed 
separately in the Income Statement to provide a clearer understanding of the underlying ﬁnancial 
performance in the period. See note 6 for further details.
There were no exceptional items during the year 2016/17. Last year, an exceptional credit and an 
exceptional debit were incurred during the year, and in accordance with our accounting policies have been 
separately reported as exceptional, due to their size and one-off nature.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CONTINUED
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share on total earnings were 5.51 pence compared with 4.65 pence (after exceptional 
items) per share last year. Diluted earnings per share, on total earnings, were 5.39 pence per share 
compared with 4.50 pence (after exceptional items) per share last year.
TAXATION
The Group’s effective tax rate for 2016/17 is 22.7% compared with 21.2% for 2015/16. The increase in 
2016/17 is mainly due to timing differences between depreciation charged and capital allowances. 
DIVIDEND
Given the strong progress made in 2016/17 and ongoing cash generation the Board feels it is appropriate to 
propose the payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 3.98 pence per share (2015/16: 3.75 pence) bringing the total for 
the year to 5.89 pence per share, compared with 5.55 pence per share for the year ended 30 January 2016, 
an increase of 6.1%. The ﬁnal dividend is to be paid on 23 June 2017 to all shareholders on the register as 
at 2 June 2017 (ex dividend date 1 June 2017). 
INVESTMENT
Total capital expenditure in the year was £8.8m (2015/16: £9.6m) and depreciation and amortisation 
was £6.5m (2015/16: £6.6m). This included the opening of 7 new stores, 1 store relocation and the 
refurbishment of 11 stores. The total capital expenditure included further investment in new Moss Bros 
hire inventory of £1.9m (2015/16: £2.4m), whilst depreciation on hire inventory was £1.6m (2015/16: £1.5m).
CASH AND LIQUIDITY
The year end cash balance was £19.5m compared with £17.3m last year after investment in new stores, 
store reﬁts and hire stock, and payment of dividends in line with our progressive dividend policy. Reduction 
in working capital partly results from timing of year end.
INVENTORY
The mix and volume of inventory in the business was reviewed during the year to ensure sufﬁcient 
inventory was available to support sales across the business including earlier intake of new season’s lines 
to maximise full price sales and gross margin. Stock at the year end was £16.7m (2015/16: £14.4m). 
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
The terms and conditions with our suppliers are regularly reviewed and adjusted so as to maximise the 
average cash balance, whilst improving the product gross margin.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
The Board continues to believe Moss Bros has an exciting future, with the growth of e-commerce 
underpinning the move to full omni-channel retailing. The adoption of Moss Bros as the master brand 
supported by complementary sub brands and introduction of carefully targeted marketing activity has 
proved very successful. In order to maximise this opportunity, and with the increasing role that digital 
has to play in marketing, we will add further resource and investment during 2017 to support our omni-
channel proposition. 
Continuity of brand presentation and pricing across all our channels is paramount in ensuring excellent 
customer service and therefore customer experience. The introduction of customer relationship 
management (“CRM”) and the leveraging of our customer database will enhance communication with the 
customer and perception of the brand. 
Our ongoing investment in our People Strategy continues to establish a service culture across the business 
– our people are critically important to the future of the business. Our “Tailor Me” personalisation service 
is available in all stores - a simpliﬁed set of bespoke options offering a custom made suit, ready for 
collection within 30 days of placing an order.  MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 11 
RETAIL
The store reﬁt programme is now entering its sixth year, with 97 new or reﬁtted stores trading in the 
new look store format. Given the strength of our combined retail and hire offer we are continuing to 
seek expansion opportunities both through new outlets and relocations where we move to larger, better 
positioned sites. 
HIRE
We will continue to leverage the opportunities to grow our market share through all distribution channels 
including online. Investment in new product areas in 2016, such as lounge suits, has proved very 
successful and more investment is planned for 2017. Investment in new hire stock totalled £1.9m in 2016 
and is planned at a further £1.8m in 2017. 
Early season booking numbers for collection in the current year (FY 2017/18) are -1% last year’s bookings 
at this point. It should be noted that Easter, which typically marks the start of the wedding season, falls 
three weeks later this year. The newly introduced product areas continue to show the most rapid growth. 
The business continues to be in excellent shape to gain market share.
Moss Hire provides us with a rich source of customer data, many of whom are currently unaware of, or do 
not consider the Moss Retail or Tailor Me offer. We continue to believe the opportunities for CRM, in the 
context of a multi-channel offer, are signiﬁcant.
E-COMMERCE
We plan to exploit further growth opportunities both in the UK and overseas by strengthening our 
e-commerce capability and building on our success, leveraging the advantages that full omni-channel 
capability will bring, including investment in CRM to better communicate with both existing customers and 
potential new customers.

Our supply chain continues to be of signiﬁcant importance in delivering service and efﬁciencies. 
In the year ahead, in common with many retailers, we expect to see higher input costs; in product from a 
weaker pound, business rates and employee costs. We are therefore preparing the company for a more 
competitive trading environment and we are seeking to ﬁnd ways in which to mitigate these rising costs 
whilst protecting the investment we are making in building and sustaining growth.
We anticipate central costs will increase broadly in line with turnover in 2017/18 as we maintain our 
investment in our omni-channel capability, our people and our technology infrastructure alongside 
increases in our occupational and employment related costs.
Capital expenditure for 2017/18 is estimated at £10.2m, including £4.5m for investment in 17 new or 
reﬁtted stores, £2.9m in Technology and £1.8m for hire stock. 
INFRASTRUCTURE
We successfully upgraded our retail website and commenced integration of our Hire system into our core 
business systems during 2017. We will continue to invest in IT as appropriate to ensure that we have a 
resilient and scalable platform on which to support the development of the business in all areas. 
As well as introducing the latest technology, the IT investments will focus on improving business efﬁciency 
and delivering a better customer experience.
PEOPLE
During 2016 we have continued to develop our key people initiatives and have made good progress in 
establishing a strong training and development portfolio; The Moss Bros. Academy. We have integrated 
The Moss Bros. Way, our values framework, across key people processes and in particular recruitment.  12 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CONTINUED
We have established an employee recognition scheme, a communication platform and an engagement 
survey which is now in its second year. We have made progress on internal promotions, including Store 
career paths and appointments from Stores to Head Ofﬁce. 
The focus for 2017 is building management capability, change management and embedding customer 
behaviours and to support this we are equipping 4 Centres of Excellence; model stores that will showcase 
a multi-functional store with the customer experience at its core. These regional training stores will 
signiﬁcantly increase our training reach and further boost the cultural change that is vital to delivering our 
growth. 
OUTLOOK
We continue to make good progress in the delivery of our strategic priorities. The modernisation of the 
store portfolio is achieving the anticipated returns and we are continuing to make good progress on the 
implementation of our omni-channel proposition, which is reﬂected in continued growth in our online 
sales. Our people strategy is an important part of the future development of the Moss Bros brand, through 
improvements in our customer experience, leading to improved customer satisfaction and retention.
The retail landscape in 2017 will undoubtedly be tough, with an uncertain consumer environment set 
against the wider political backdrop and alongside rising costs of operation and a weaker pound. We 
continue to anticipate and prepare for a more competitive trading environment, whilst ensuring that we 
protect our ongoing investment in the business in order to sustain growth. 
The early response to the 2017 Spring/Summer ranges is positive, with retail like-for-like* sales continuing 
to improve year on year. 
The Group’s trading performance continues in line with the Board’s expectations.

This Strategic report has been prepared solely to provide information to shareholders to assess how the directors have performed their duty to 
promote the success of the company. 
The Strategic report contains certain forward-looking statements. These statements are made by the directors in good faith based on the information 
available to them up to the time of their approval of this report and such statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties, 
including both economic and business risk factors, underlying any such forward-looking information.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 14 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk
The Board monitors principal risks and uncertainties and implement measures to mitigate their risk on 
the business. An assessment of these is shown below.
 
Business area
 
Risk to Company
 
Mitigation of risk
Assessment of change in 
risk year on year
Hire The Hire business demands 
the highest level of customer 
service.
This is delivered through a 
highly developed and efﬁcient 
infrastructure which enables 
consistent ‘delivery to promise’. 
Any disruption to this 
infrastructure would affect our 
ability to maintain customer 
service levels.
We have a dedicated customer 
service team which actively 
seek to resolve any customer 
service issues arising. 
We are continually refreshing 
and replenishing our stock of 
hire garments to ensure we are 
able to cater for all occasions 
whenever they fall due.
We have previously 
strengthened our market 
position through the 
introduction of a new 
transactional Hire website and 
back-end system improvements 
are in development.
The risk is ongoing; however 
we have expanded our 
customer service team and 
have carried out a full review of 
all systems and processes. 
Retail and  
Tailor Me
Factors outside our control, 
such as an economic downturn 
affecting the UK or any wider 
economic downturn as a 
result of the vote to leave 
the EU, may have a material 
adverse effect on results.
As a retail business based and 
operating predominantly in the 
UK, we are particularly exposed 
to any economic downturn 
in the UK which could affect 
consumer conﬁdence and 
therefore spending.
We continually focus on 
maintaining our product quality, 
customer service and supplier 
relationships, whilst retaining 
our competitive position, 
including value and pricing.
Foreign currency exposure, 
principally the US Dollar, is 
hedged for between 6 to 9 
months in advance.
The risk has remained 
consistent.
The macro risks associated 
with the EU referendum 
are difﬁcult to quantify until 
we have further clarity on 
timelines and approach from 
both UK government and EU 
negotiators.
 E-Commerce Customer satisfaction is as 
important online as ofﬂine.
Ease of navigation/ability to 
transact quickly on the website 
is key to generating sales 
online.
Maintaining a competitive edge 
through customers being able 
to interact with the product 
online, offering product choice 
and availability, and allowing 
multiple payment and delivery 
options are important in 
growing our online presence.
Ensuring a secure online 
marketplace is also vital 
for customers to be able to 
transact safely.
We are continually developing 
our website offering in order to 
become fully multi-channel. 
Our Retail website has 
continued to see increases in 
conversion rates and average 
order values.
We have developed a fully 
responsive website during 
the year which provides a 
more appropriate browsing 
experience for the increasing 
proportion of visitors to the 
site using mobile or tablet 
technology.
We have security policies, rules 
and technical measures in place 
to protect customer data.
With the continuous increase in 
trade through e-commerce and 
the market trend on moving to 
a fully multi-channel operation, 
the risk has increased during 
the year. 
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 15 
 
Business area
 
Risk to Company
 
Mitigation of risk
Assessment of change in 
risk year on year
Brand image Maintaining our store 
presentation is important 
for attracting customers and 
growing our brand.
The historical underinvestment 
in the store estate in previous 
years has meant that some 
of our stores lack the level of 
presentation that we require 
to grow the business and the 
brand. 
We are undergoing a store 
redevelopment programme to 
both modernise the look and 
feel of the stores and to meet 
more routine maintenance that 
has been deferred for many 
years.
The development and launch 
of a new sub brand line up, 
under the master brand ‘Moss 
Bros’, in Autumn 2014 has 
strengthened the brand identity.
The risk has been reduced 
during the year with the 
progression of the store 
redevelopment programme. 
Costs Supply chain cost price 
increases and currency 
ﬂuctuation could have a 
materially adverse affect 
on results.
A ﬂuctuation in currency rates 
could materially affect the 
Group’s cost base and margins. 
A re-emergence of general 
price inﬂation could affect 
proﬁtability.
There are signiﬁcant external 
cost pressures from the 
increases in the National Living 
Wage, the National Minimum 
Wage, the Apprenticeship Levy, 
the revaluation of business 
rates, higher energy taxes and 
increased purchasing costs due 
to the combined effects of a 
devalued pound. 
Management mitigates cost 
price risk by continual review of 
supplier arrangements.
In addition, the Group operates 
a treasury policy which hedges 
a signiﬁcant proportion of the 
foreign exchange risk from such 
direct sourcing arrangements. 
Management closely monitor 
the effectiveness of these 
arrangements.
If general price inﬂation returns 
this may allow an increase 
in retail selling prices albeit 
subject to market conditions.
Ongoing review of store 
proﬁtability, combined with 
shorter lease durations.
Remuneration policies are 
under review to ensure we 
remain competitive in the 
marketplace.
The risk is ongoing, however, 
and is continually monitored 
and addressed.
The risk has increased but 
we continually monitor and 
evaluate planned and proposed 
expenditure to ensure that it 
remains commercially sensible. 
Supply chain A disruption to supplier 
continuity may adversely 
affect our operation.
Suppliers going out of business 
could have a signiﬁcant impact 
on our ability to meet demand 
in store and online.
We are continually reviewing 
and refreshing our supplier 
list. The diversiﬁcation of 
product buying across a 
range of suppliers limits the 
Group’s over reliance upon any 
individual supplier.
The risk is ongoing, however, 
and is continually monitored 
and addressed.
Supplier 
dependency – 
Failure of major 
supplier
In an uncertain economic 
environment, supplier failure 
and subsequent failure to 
supply product or services will 
impact business performance.
Monitor supplier ﬁnancial 
performance through constant 
dialogue to reveal evidence of 
supplier in difﬁculty. 
Review ability to source 
product/services from 
alternative supplier at pace. 
Review and document 
contingency plans should 
supplier fail. 
Risk likely to increase 
with greater uncertainty in 
macroeconomic environment.  16 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

Risk to Company
 
Mitigation of risk
Assessment of change in 
risk year on year
Distribution  
centre (DC)
Operating our distribution 
centre from one location 
leaves the Group exposed 
to business catastrophes 
occurring at that location.
Any business catastrophe 
affecting our distribution 
centre could severely affect 
the Group’s ability to supply to 
stores and customers.
We continually review and 
monitor our disaster recovery 
plan to ensure that all business 
risks are adequately covered. 
Our ﬁnancial risk of operating 
from one location is mitigated 
through our comprehensive 
insurance cover.
With new and increased 
operating pressures on the 
DC through multi-channel, 
the reliance and consequent 
exposure to risk of the DC 
failing has increased during 
the year.
Cyber crime A cyber crime attack could 
disable the Group’s key IT 
systems and compromise data 
security. 
Customer bank or payment 
card details are not processed 
or stored in the Group’s IT 
systems.
Comprehensive security 
measures are in place with 
regular tests carried out. 
Development in cyber crime 
and preventative strategies are 
constantly reviewed.
Frequency and severity of 
cyber crime attacks against 
companies have increased 
signiﬁcantly.
People The Group’s reliance on 
key management and other 
personnel could put pressure 
on the business if they were to 
leave.
Attracting and retaining high 
calibre people is a key priority 
and a central focus in striving 
for excellent customer service 
across the Group’s business 
channels. 
Effective recruitment policies 
and people development 
means the Group can take full 
advantage of the recovery in 
its performance. Long-term 
incentive share awards were 
granted to senior employees 
during the year to more closely 
align their interests to those of 
the Group and a SAYE scheme 
is in operation. 
The risk is ongoing, however 
is continually monitored and 
addressed.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
The Board has a wide range of responsibilities and my overall objective is to ensure that the Board has 
the right mix of skills and experience to leverage the opportunities and overcome the challenges that the 
Company faces and that it works effectively as a team to identify, prioritise, communicate and review the 
delivery of the goals of the Company. We ensure that there is the right mix of enquiry and support to the 
Executive Directors from the Non-Executives.
The Non-Executive Directors discuss and agree the strategy with the Executive Directors and hold the 
Executives accountable for its execution; we ensure that we have the most talented team to execute this 
strategy; and we set the tone for governance.
The Board is committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance, speciﬁcally 
ensuring that we send out consistent messages on the core values of the Company and acceptable 
behaviours. We have made good progress in achieving best practice and we regularly review the context, 
progress and maintenance of these standards, for the beneﬁt of all of our stakeholders.
DEBBIE HEWITT
CHAIRMAN
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 2014 (“the Code”)
The Group is committed to the principles of corporate governance contained in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code that was issued in 2012 by the Financial Reporting Council (‘the Code’) for which the 
Board is accountable to shareholders. The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems, which is further discussed on pages 28 and 29. 
Compliance with the Code reviewed regularly and throughout the period ended 28 January 2017, the Board 
conﬁrms that it has fully complied with the provisions set out in the code. 
The Company has applied the principles set out in the Code, including both the main principles and 
the supporting principles, by complying with the Code as reported above. Further explanation of how 
the principles have been applied is set out below and in the Directors’ Remuneration Report and Audit 
Committee Report.
LEADERSHIP
THE ROLE OF THE BOARD
At 5 April 2017, the Board consisted of the Chairman, three Non-Executive Directors and two Executive 
Directors. The Chairman of the Board is Debbie Hewitt who joined the Board as an Independent Non-
Executive Director on 1 June 2009 and was appointed acting Chairman from 25 March 2010 and Chairman 
from 27 April 2010. Maurice Helfgott is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. The Group 
considers Maurice Helfgott, Bryan Portman, Zoe Morgan and the Chairman, Debbie Hewitt, to continue to 
display all of the qualities of independence as set out in the Code. 
Board papers containing relevant commercial and ﬁnancial information are normally provided to all 
Board members in the week prior to a Board meeting to enable the Directors to consider the issues for 
discussion. The Board regularly reviews the type and amount of information provided. The Board plans 
to meet at least six times a year including two meetings to review and discuss the strategic issues facing 
the Company. The Board also holds meetings as appropriate, to fulﬁl the ongoing requirements of the 
business during the year.
BOARD COMMITTEES
In accordance with the Code and corporate governance best practice, the Board has established a number 
of committees. All of the committees have written terms of reference, approved by the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee is chaired by Bryan Portman (MBA, FCCA, FCIS), and also comprises Zoe Morgan 
and Maurice Helfgott (MBA). The terms of reference for the Audit Committee provide that the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer and Finance Director are invited to attend the meetings as appropriate. 
There is an opportunity for any employee, in conﬁdence, to raise any concerns with management about 
possible impropriety in ﬁnancial or other matters. The Company has established an internal conﬁdential 
helpline which is independent of line management.
The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee responsibility for ensuring the ﬁnancial statements, 
when taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable. The Audit Committee has considered 
all matters brought to its attention during the year. The Audit Committee has also considered whether 
there were any areas where they required more information in order to decide if the annual report is 
fair, balanced and reasonable and made arrangements for this information to be reported to them. The 
Committee met three times during the year and reported to the Board on all matters relating to the 
regulatory and accounting requirements affecting the Group, together with the ﬁnancial reporting and 
internal control procedures including the annual and interim ﬁnancial statements. 
In addition, the Audit Committee ensures that an objective and professional relationship is maintained with 
the external auditor. The external auditor may attend all meetings of the Audit Committee and have direct 
access to the Audit Committee and its Chairman.
The Audit Committee also reviews the possible risks facing the Group, the risk management function and 
internal controls. The Committee’s review of the interim and full year ﬁnancial statements focused on the 
following key areas affecting the Group’s ﬁnancial reporting: 
Valuation of property plant and equipment
The estimated useful lives of non-current assets is considered to be a key area of judgement, particularly 
given the nature of the business.
Valuation of inventory and related provisions
Inventory is a signiﬁcant value on the Group’s statement of ﬁnancial position and there is an element of 
judgement relating to the inventory provision.
Measurement and accounting for share-based payments 
The assumptions behind the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest is considered 
a key area of judgement.
Revenue recognition on hire and bespoke deposits
Revenue is deferred until collection of goods arises. The movement and amount deferred is signiﬁcant to 
the ﬁnancial statements. 
Other areas of focus considered by the Committee were:
Onerous leases
The assumptions underlying these calculations are highly sensitive to small changes.
Deferred taxation 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and a judgement 
made over the probability of there being sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts arising in the future to allow all or part of 
the asset to be recovered.
Dilapidations
The estimation of costs arising from dilapidations is considered a key area of judgement given the nature 
of the business. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
CONTINUED MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 25 
A memorandum was prepared by the Board at the interim and year end which was reviewed by the Audit 
Committee which sets out these key risks and judgements and how they have been addressed by the 
Board in their preparation of the ﬁnancial statements. These areas of focus were also addressed at the 
planning stage of the external audit and the external auditor’s conclusions were closely monitored by the 
Committee.
The terms of reference for the Audit Committee are available from the Company Secretary and at http://
corp.moss.co.uk/about/governance.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Zoe Morgan and during the ﬁnancial year also comprised 
Debbie Hewitt, Bryan Portman and Maurice Helfgott. The Annual Statement on Directors’ Remuneration is 
set out on pages 32 and 33.
The terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee are available from the Company Secretary and at 
http://corp.moss.co.uk/about/governance.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Debbie Hewitt and all the Non-Executive Directors are members. 
It monitors and reviews the membership of the succession to the Board of Directors. It identiﬁes and 
recommends potential Executive and Non-Executive Directors to the Board.
The terms of reference for the Nomination Committee are available from the Company Secretary and at 
http://corp.moss.co.uk/about/governance.
EXECUTIVE TRADING COMMITTEE
The Executive Management team of the Group consists of the two Executive Directors, and senior 
members of the management team.
The Executive Management team, as well as monitoring and controlling the day-to-day management of 
the business, regularly reviews the strategic aims of the Group and capital and revenue expenditure.
DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES
Brian Brick is the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and together with the Executive Management team is responsible 
for co-ordination of the Group’s business activities. The structure of the Board provides a balance whereby 
no individual or group can dominate the Board’s decision making. Brief details of each Director’s other 
directorships are disclosed on page 19.
The Board is responsible for setting the Group’s strategic direction, the establishment of Group policies 
and internal controls and the monitoring of operational performance. It meets regularly throughout the 
year and in addition to the routine reporting of ﬁnancial and operational issues, reviews each of the trading 
areas and key functions.
The Board has a schedule of matters speciﬁcally reserved to it for decision and delegates certain issues 
and powers to the Board Committees. The schedule of reserved matters is reviewed by the Board annually.
EFFECTIVENESS
THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD
The Articles provide that one-third of the Directors shall retire from ofﬁce by rotation. Furthermore, 
Article 92 of the existing Articles requires a Director to stand for re-election if they were not appointed or 
re-appointed at either of the last two Annual General Meetings and article 90 requires Directors to stand 
for re-election if they have served as a Director for a continuous period of more than nine years.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the Articles, in compliance with best practice, all Directors offer 
themselves for re-election annually. 26 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk
Evaluation of the Board’s performance has been conducted through individual questionnaires, followed 
by a review of the output by the Board and an action plan of improvements. This includes a review of 
progress on the actions agreed in the previous year’s review, a review of the individual contribution of 
Non-Executives and a review of the Chairman.
APPOINTMENTS TO THE BOARD
Board members are appointed by the Board on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, which 
is chaired by the Chairman and consists of the Non-Executive Directors, although the Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer is invited to meetings as appropriate.
Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts with the Company and copies of the Non-Executive 
Directors’ letters of appointment with the Company are available from the Company Secretary.
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
On appointment to the Board and to any Board Committee, every Director is provided with appropriate 
induction and training to enable them to discharge their duties as a Director. Additional training may be 
sought as necessary.
The Board has conducted a review of its effectiveness and the effectiveness of each individual Director. 
The conclusions of the review have been presented to and discussed by the Board as a whole and 
actions resulting from this review will be kept under review during the forthcoming year. The Senior 
Independent Director separately reviews the performance of the Chairman, with input from Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors.
RE-ELECTION
Subject to re-election at the ﬁrst AGM after which they were appointed, Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed initially for a three year term. The Group will take into account the balance of skills and 
experience on the Board, their contribution and level of independence when considering whether to extend 
their appointment beyond the initial term. The Board may ask a Non-Executive Director to remain for a 
further term. The Non-Executive Directors’ contracts are terminable on three months’ notice and the 
Chairman’s on six months’ notice.
MEETINGS AND ATTENDANCE
The Board held six meetings during the year. The attendance of each of the Directors at these meetings 
and committee meetings where appropriate is detailed below:

INFORMATION AND SUPPORT
All Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for 
ensuring that procedures are followed. In addition the Directors are able to seek appropriate independent 
professional advice at the Group’s expense.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
CONTINUED MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 27 
The Board takes signiﬁcant measures to ensure that all Board members are kept aware of both the views 
of the major shareholders and changes in the major shareholdings of the Group.
The Board ensures two-way communication with major shareholders, through Broker brieﬁngs and 
feedback from the Executive Directors following meetings with major shareholders. The Chairman also 
meets with major shareholders on a regular basis. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE AND AUDITOR
During the period ended 28 January 2017, the Group’s external auditor, Deloitte LLP, provided advice to 
the Group. In addition, the senior statutory audit partner was rotated in the year. The fees paid to Deloitte 
for non-audit services were £7,000 (2015/16: £7,000). The use of Deloitte LLP for non-audit work was 
carefully evaluated by the Audit Committee and the Board.
The Audit Committee views the independence and objectivity of the Group’s auditor as essential and 
ensures that Deloitte is not instructed on any issues which would prejudice this. The Audit Committee 
obtains written conﬁrmation on at least an annual basis of the independence of the external auditor.
To fulﬁl its responsibility regarding the independence of the external auditor, the Audit Committee also 
reviewed:
•  the external auditor’s plan for the current year, noting the role of the senior statutory audit partner, 
and any changes in the key audit staff;
• the arrangements for day-to-day management of the audit relationship;
• the overall extent of non-audit services provided by the external auditor; and
• the past service of the auditor that was ﬁrst appointed for the year ended 31 January 2009.
It is also the Committee’s policy to consider every year whether there should be an audit tender process.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditor, the Audit Committee reviewed:
• the arrangements for ensuring the external auditor’s independence and objectivity;
• the external auditor’s fulﬁlment of the agreed audit plan and any variations from the plan;
•  the robustness and perceptiveness of the external auditor in their handling of the key accounting and 
audit judgements; and
• the content of the external auditor’s reporting on internal control.
ACCOUNTABILITY 
Each person who is a Director at the date of approval of this Annual Report conﬁrms that:
•  so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware; and
•  the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make 
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Act.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in ofﬁce as auditor and a Resolution to re-
appoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 28 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s Business 
Review. The latter describes the ﬁnancial position of the Group, its cash ﬂows, liquidity position, together 
with the Group’s objectives, key risks and uncertainties. The Group’s ﬁnancial risk management objectives 
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk are described in note 24.
As also highlighted in note 24 to the ﬁnancial statements, the Group meets its day-to-day working capital 
requirements through surplus cash balances. 
The Board of Directors has undertaken a recent thorough review of the Group’s budgets and forecasts and 
has produced detailed cash ﬂow projections, which take account of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, showing that the Group is expected to operate within the level of its current surplus cash 
balances. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts for the 52 weeks 
ended 28 January 2017.
LONGER TERM VIABILITY STATEMENT
The Directors have assessed the Group’s viability over the three year period to January 2020. This is based 
on the Group’s strategic planning time horizon and reﬂects the period over which long-term operational 
decisions are assessed. 
In making their assessment the Directors have taken into account the Group’s current ﬁnancial and 
operational position, plans for future development and the principal risks and uncertainties that face 
the Group, as set out on pages 14 to 16. The most relevant of these risks and uncertainties in terms of 
potential ﬁnancial and operational impact viability were included in the scenario analysis. Sensitivity 
analysis was also performed which modelled the impact of the risks occurring individually or in unison in 
order to stress-test the resilience of the Group. 
Based on their assessment of the results of this analysis, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to meet their liabilities, as they fall due, until January 2020.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board has applied principle C.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code by establishing a continuous 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks the Group faces and for determining 
the nature and extent of the signiﬁcant risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives. The 
Board regularly reviews the process, which has been in place from the start of the year to the date of 
approval of this report and which is in accordance with revised guidance on internal control published in 
October 2005 (the Turnbull Guidance). The Board is also responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with provision C.2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board regularly reviews 
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems. The Board’s monitoring 
covers all material controls, including ﬁnancial, operational and compliance controls. It is based 
principally on reviewing reports from management to consider whether signiﬁcant risks are identiﬁed, 
evaluated, managed and controlled and whether any signiﬁcant weaknesses are promptly remedied and 
indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The Board has also performed a speciﬁc assessment for 
the purpose of this annual report. This assessment considers all signiﬁcant aspects of risk management 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
CONTINUED MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 29 
and internal control arising during the period covered by the report including the work of internal audit and 
loss prevention function. The audit committee assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilities.
During the course of its review of the risk management and internal control systems, the Board has 
not identiﬁed nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has determined to be signiﬁcant. 
Therefore a conﬁrmation in respect of necessary actions has not been considered appropriate.
The Board recognises that no system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against losses 
arising from mismanagement and that the Group’s systems must be designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risk. Internal control and risk management is an ongoing process designed to identify, evaluate 
and manage the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group. The system of internal control includes internal 
ﬁnancial controls, operational procedures, risk management and compliance matters. The system has 
been in place throughout the period ended 28 January 2017 and up to the date of this Report.
The signiﬁcant risks the Board has identiﬁed are detailed in the Chief Executive’s Business Review.
During the period the Board has reviewed the adequacy of the current internal audit department in 
accordance with the Code. In view of the size and scale of the Group, the Board decided it was not 
appropriate to expand the current scope of the internal audit function which focuses on inventory and cash 
control.
The Group’s work to review the risk management structure and ensure a robust mechanism is in place for 
logging and monitoring risks continues.

IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT, THE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT AND THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that 
law the Directors are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and have chosen to prepare the parent Company ﬁnancial statements under IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU. Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisﬁed that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company 
for that period.
In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
•  present information including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information;
•  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs are insufﬁcient 
to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial 
position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
•  the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and 
proﬁt or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
•  the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 31 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Board considers the report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable and that it provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FINANCE DIRECTOR AND COMPANY SECRETARY

Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Directors’ remuneration report for the period ended 28 January 2017. During 
the year we continued to operate within the Remuneration Policy that was put to a binding shareholder 
vote at the 2014 AGM. This policy was adopted for three years. As this period is coming to an end, the 
Committee has reviewed the policy during the year to assess its appropriateness and alignment to 
business strategy.
As a result of this review, including consultation with major shareholders, the Committee have decided 
that the current policy remains appropriate and no changes are proposed to the structure of remuneration 
or the quantum of incentives. Some minor amendments have been made to clarify areas of ﬂexibility in the 
policy and to add to some of the measures.
In this Annual Statement, which precedes our Annual Report on Remuneration, I have summarised our 
performance in 2016/17 and how this relates to remuneration decisions and outcomes. 
Performance has continued to improve throughout 2016/17. We have remained focused on delivering 
a clear strategy to leverage the Moss Bros brand, growing our e-commerce business and continuing 
to implement our store reﬁt programme. Careful management of stock and strong cash generation 
contributed to the team delivering a robust ﬁnancial performance, with annual pre-tax proﬁt growth, 
before exceptional items, of 20.3% and a 6.1% increase in the annual dividend payment.
The Committee’s underlying policy on salary increases is that they will normally be in line with increases 
for employees within the business. This approach has been applied consistently by the Committee for 
all executive directors in recent years and this year too. It is worth noting that the Committee may award 
larger increases where appropriate, such as to reﬂect change in the size and complexity of the Company 
or the scope of the role, or to reﬂect market positioning following a new, less experienced appointment. 
This is relevant to our newly appointed Finance Director in the coming years.
The annual bonus performance targets for 2016/17 were based 50% on proﬁt targets and 50% on strategic 
performance objectives. The 20.3% growth meant that the team hit the maximum proﬁt target and 50% 
of bonus entitlement will be paid for this target. The strategic objectives included brand development, net 
promoter score, development of the hire strategy, e-commerce growth and employee engagement. The 
business made progress on some, but not all of these measures and 25% of bonus entitlement will be paid 
for progress on these measures. A total bonus payment of 75% of entitlement will be paid. The detail of 
this is described in the Annual Report on Remuneration that follows.
The April 2014 LTIP award has matured, the performance condition for which was based on the 3 year 
cumulative proﬁt before tax from 26 January 2014 to 28 January 2017. 50% of the original share award will 
vest. Detail of this award is described in the Annual Report on Remuneration that follows. 
Looking forward, the Committee intends to keep the same annual bonus structure in 2017/18, 
with strategic performance objectives alongside proﬁt targets. These objectives will include brand 
development, hire and e-commerce performance and customer satisfaction. The proﬁt and strategic 
targets will each account for half of the bonus entitlement. As in prior years, the bonus will continue to be 
self-funding and as such, no bonus will be payable if the minimum proﬁt target is not met. 
In relation to the LTIP for 2017-20, the Committee intends to make awards which up to 70% will vest after 
3 years if a demanding cumulative PBT performance target is satisﬁed. We will also add a measure of 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) for the ﬁrst time this coming year, to further align executive incentives 
with outcomes for shareholders. Up to 30% of the potential will relate to this measure.
ANNUAL STATEMENT ON DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 33 
At the 2017 Annual General Meeting, the Annual Statement and Annual Report on Remuneration for 
2016/17 will be put to an advisory vote and the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be put to a 
binding shareholder vote, which, if approved, will apply for the next three years. This meeting provides 
shareholders with the opportunity to vote on how the Committee has implemented the previous 
remuneration policy and on the proposed remuneration policy. 2016/17 was another year of good 
progress for Moss Bros and, in this context, we look forward to receiving your support on our approach to 
Remuneration at the Annual General Meeting.
Zoe Morgan
CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 34 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk
The Remuneration Committee determines the Company’s policy on the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and other senior executives. The principles which underpin the remuneration policy for the 
Company are to:
•  ensure Executive Directors’ rewards and incentives are directly aligned with the interests of the 
shareholders in order to reinforce the strategic priorities of the Group, optimise the performance of 
the Group and create sustained growth in shareholder value, without encouragement to take excessive 
undue risk;
•  provide the level of remuneration required to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and 
senior executives of an appropriate calibre;
•  ensure a proper balance of ﬁxed and variable performance related components, linked to short and 
longer-term objectives; and
• reﬂect market competitiveness, taking account of the total value of all the beneﬁt elements.
Remuneration for the Executive Directors is structured so that the variable pay elements (annual bonus 
and long-term incentives) form a signiﬁcant proportion of the overall package. This provides a strong link 
between the remuneration paid to Executive Directors and the performance of the Company. This also 
provides a strong alignment of interest between the Executive Directors and shareholders (particularly as 
half of the annual bonus and all of the long-term incentive is payable in the form of shares).
For the purposes of section 226D(6)(b) of the Companies Act 2006 this policy will take effect from the date 
of the 2017 AGM, which is scheduled to be held on 19 May 2017.

Salaries for the Executive Directors are 
determined by the Remuneration Committee 
taking into account the experience and 
performance of the individual and comparing 
the levels of remuneration with the salaries 
of comparable UK based retailers. They also 
reﬂect the overall package in relation to ﬁxed 
and variable pay.
Base salaries are reviewed annually, unless 
responsibilities change. In setting appropriate 
salary levels for the Executive Directors and 
considering whether there should be any 
increases, the Committee takes into account 
pay and employment conditions of employees 
elsewhere in the Group.
We would only expect a material adjustment 
of salaries in the event that the scale 
and complexity of the business changed 
substantially over time.
The salaries of any newly appointed Executive 
Director would reﬂect the scale and nature 
of the role and the relevant experience of 
any newly appointed individual. There may 
be annual adjustments as a newly recruited 
Executive develops into a role. 
Annual increases 
are normally capped 
at the general

increases above

made in exceptional

Based on a range of stretching targets 
measured over one year. These might include

Bonus payments are determined as follows:
•  Performance below the threshold 
performance target results in zero 
payment.
•  Achievement of the threshold performance 
target results in a threshold payment 
no greater than 20% of the maximum 
opportunity.
•  Payments rise from the threshold payment 
to 100% of the maximum opportunity 
for levels of performance between the 
threshold and maximum targets.
The committee has discretion to reduce 
or amend the formulaic bonus outcome if 
individual performance is determined to 
be unsatisfactory or if the individual is the 
subject of disciplinary action.
50% of any bonus payment is invested in 
shares and deferred for a three year period.

CHOICE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND TARGET SETTING
For the annual bonus and long-term incentive, our policy is to choose performance measures which help 
drive and reward the achievement of our strategy and also provide alignment between employees and 
shareholders. The Committee reviews metrics each year to ensure they remain appropriate and reﬂect the 
future strategic direction of the Group.
Targets for each performance measure are set by the Committee with reference to internal plans and 
external expectations. Performance is generally measured on a ‘sliding scale’ so that incentive pay outs 
increase pro-rata for levels of performance in between the threshold and maximum performance targets.
Performance measures and targets are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration. In cases where 
targets are commercially sensitive, for example annual proﬁt targets for the annual bonus, they will only 
be disclosed retrospectively.
DIFFERENCES IN PAY POLICY FOR EMPLOYEES AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
No beneﬁt of the Executive Director remuneration policy is operated exclusively for Executive Directors, 
and, as stated in the introduction to this Policy Report on page 34, the principles applied to the 
remuneration of Executive Directors are the same as those for the Company. The difference between pay 
for Executive Directors and employees is that Executive Director pay is structured so that the variable pay 
element forms a signiﬁcant proportion of the overall package and the total remuneration opportunity is 
higher to reﬂect the increased responsibility of the role.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
CONTINUED MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 37 
EXECUTIVE SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES
In any event, 50% of the value awarded as part of the annual bonus scheme will be awarded as deferred 
shares, to be held for a period of no less than three years, and shares vesting under the LTIP scheme, if 
exercised, to be held for a minimum of two years after the vesting date. 
Furthermore, to encourage Executive Directors to use vested LTIP shares to build and maintain a 
signiﬁcant shareholding, executives who receive a long-term incentive award which exceeds 50% of salary 
are required to retain all of the post-tax number of shares until a minimum shareholding of 100% has been 
achieved. 
Executives who receive a long-term incentive award of 50% of salary are expected to build a holding 
of 50% of salary, along the same lines as above. Executives who receive an award below 50% of salary 
are expected to build a holding of 15% of salary, along the same lines as above. For the purpose of this 
calculation, the value of shares is calculated using the higher of their acquisition price and current market 
price.

Fees for the Non-Executive Directors are

set by the Articles of Association and are 
based on information on fees paid in similar 
companies, taking into account the experience 
of the individuals and the relative time 
commitments involved.

can be reimbursed.

Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to bonus payments, any other beneﬁts (except where the beneﬁt 
is historical) or pension arrangements nor do they participate in the Company’s long-term incentive 
schemes. 
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT
The principle applied in recruitment of a new Executive Director is for the remuneration package to be 
set in accordance with the terms of the approved remuneration policy for existing directors in force at the 
time of appointment. In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based ‘buy out’ 
awards when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and, therefore, shareholders, 
including awards made under Listing Rule 9.4.2 R. Any such ‘buy out’ payments would be based solely 
on remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and would reﬂect the delivery mechanism (i.e. 
cash, shares, options), time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that remuneration. 
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
As a result of this policy, the maximum ongoing variable remuneration (i.e. excluding buyout awards) 
which could be granted to a new Executive Director is 200% of salary. 38 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role 
may be allowed to pay out according to its terms on grant, adjusted as relevant to take into account 
the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment 
may continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval at the ﬁrst AGM following their 
appointment.
Other aspects of our recruitment policy include:
•  Where it is appropriate to offer a below median salary initially, a series of increases to the desired 
salary positioning may be given over the proceeding few years subject to individual performance and 
experience in role.
•  Different performance measures may be set initially for the annual bonus, taking into account the 
responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the ﬁnancial year that they joined.
• An LTIP award can be made shortly after a new Director is appointed.
• A new Director may receive fees for professional advice as appropriate.
• A new Director may receive relocation assistance if applicable.
POLICY ON PAYMENT FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
Elements of ﬁxed remuneration are treated as follows: 
Upon termination by either party the Executive Directors are entitled to salary and beneﬁts for the duration 
of the notice period. It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to seek to mitigate termination 
payments. 
In addition, the Company can make a payment in lieu of notice equal to base salary that would have been 
paid over the notice period. In addition, any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims 
in connection with the termination would be paid as necessary.
Elements of variable remuneration would be treated as follows:
Annual bonus
Under the Annual Incentive Plan, an employee who ceases employment or is under notice prior to the 
payment of bonus typically will not receive any payment. However, the Committee has discretion, where an 
individual is considered a ‘good leaver’, to make a bonus payment, payable in cash, but pro-rated for the 
period of time served from the start of the ﬁnancial year to the date of termination and not for any period 
in lieu of notice or garden leave. Any such bonus payment typically would be subject to the normal bonus 
targets, tested at the end of the year, and would take into account performance over the notice period.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
Under the LTIP, unvested awards will normally lapse upon cessation of employment. However, in line 
with the plan rules, the Committee has discretion, where an individual is considered a ‘good leaver’, to 
allow awards to vest at the normal vesting date, or earlier, if circumstances warrant it. If the Committee 
exercises this discretion, awards are normally pro-rated to reﬂect time served since the date of grant and 
based on the achievement of the performance criteria.
SAYE
The Executive Directors participate on the same basis as for other employees.
APPROACH TO SERVICE CONTRACTS AND LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT
The Committee’s policy is to offer service contracts for Executive Directors with notice periods of six to 
twelve months. In addition, the Executive Directors are subject to a six month non-compete clause from 
the date of termination.
For the Chairman, appointment is terminable on six months’ notice. All other Non-Executive Directors’ 
appointments are terminable on three months’ notice on either side.

STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP
The Moss Bros Remuneration Committee does not consult directly with employees when determining 
remuneration policy for Executive Directors. However, remuneration and pay increases across the Group 
are taken into account when setting pay levels for Directors.
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each 
year. When any material changes are proposed to the remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee 
Chairman will inform major shareholders in advance, and will generally offer a meeting to discuss these. 
KEY AREAS OF DISCRETION
Finally, we have chosen to highlight key areas of discretion in the application of our remuneration policy. 
These discretions are implicit in the policy stated above, but we have listed them for clarity. Key areas of 
discretion include, but are not limited to:
• Whether annual bonus is paid to Executive Directors once notice has been served;
•  Discretion in exceptional circumstances to amend previously set annual incentive targets or to adjust 
the proposed payout to ensure a fair and appropriate outcome.
•  Certain decisions relating to the Long-Term Incentive Plan awards for which the Committee has 
discretion as set out in the rules of the relevant share plans which have been approved by shareholders. 
• The decisions on exercise of malus and/or clawback rights.
LEGACY ARRANGEMENTS
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to honour 
any commitments entered into with current or former Executive Directors before this remuneration policy 
came into force or before an individual became an Executive Director (such as the payment outstanding 
incentive awards, and clothing allowance for Directors) even where it is not consistent with the policy 
prevailing at the time such commitment is fulﬁlled. Details of any payments to former Executive Directors 
will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. 
EXTERNAL DIRECTORSHIPS FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Company believes that there are beneﬁts to the Company and for Executive Directors accepting 
non-executive directorships in other organisations. Executive Directors may accept one non-executive 
directorship with the prior agreement of the Board provided it does not conﬂict with the Group’s interests 
and the time commitment does not impact upon the Executive Director’s performance. The Executive 
Directors may retain the fees from their external directorship.
In the case of the CEO, the Committee approved two non-executive directorships, which were held prior 
to him joining the Board and which were fulﬁlled through Mr Brick’s consulting Company, Ambleside 
Consulting Limited. Brian Brick has stepped down from one of these roles. The second role, which he 
retains, is with SFD, a visual display and merchandising company. In the view of the Committee, this 
role is not overly burdensome on his time and the Committee has approved him retaining these fees. 
The Committee keeps this role under review and reserves the right to ask him to step down if time 
commitments require him to do so. In any case, no Executive Director, including the CEO would be allowed 
more than one paid Non-Executive Directorship.
Details of outside directorships held by the Executive Directors and any fees that they received are provided 
on pages 45 and 46 of the Annual Report on Remuneration.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
CONTINUED MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 41 
This part of the report has been prepared in accordance with Part 3 of The Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and [9.8.8R] of the Listing 
Rules. The Annual Remuneration Report will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM which 
is scheduled to be held on 19 May 2017. The information on pages 41 to 52 has been audited, except for the 
disclosure under payments for other directorship on pages 45 and 46.
IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2017/18
Executive Directors’ Base Salaries
The Remuneration Committee has awarded a cost of living salary increase of 2.0% for the forthcoming 
year, with effect from 1 February 2017. This increase will take Brian Brick’s base salary from £321,000 
to £327,500 and Tony Bennett’s base salary from £220,000 to £224,500.This increase reﬂects the annual 
increase awarded to all other employees which is 2.6%.
Pension and Beneﬁts
There will be no changes to pension or beneﬁts provision.
Annual Bonus
The annual bonus in 2017/18 will be consistent with the policy detailed in the Director’s Remuneration 
Policy in relation to the maximum bonus opportunity. Similar to last year performance measures will be 
based 50% on the achievement of PBT targets, and 50% on the achievement of strategic objectives. To 
ensure that the bonus is self-funding, no bonus will be payable if the minimum PBT target is not met.
The performance measures together with the level of performance against each objective, will be 
disclosed in the 2017/18 Annual Report on Remuneration.
The targets relating to the 2016/17 bonus payments are shown below and as this is a transistion year to 
our new policy, we are also disclosing 2015/16 and 2014/15 bonus targets and achievement against those 
targets. 
Clawback will apply to any bonus payments from the 2014/15 ﬁnancial year onwards. 
Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
LTIP Awards will be made in April 2017 on the same terms as set out in the policy table. These will be 
subject to clawback provisions and a two year holding period for executive directors. For Brian Brick this 
award will be equivalent to 100% of salary and for Tony Bennett this award will be equivalent to 70% of 
salary. As well as the holding period, the executives have to achieve a shareholding guideline of 100% of 
salary (post shares sold to cover any tax) before they can sell any shares that vest.

Cumulative Proﬁt Before Tax for these purposes means operating proﬁt after any charges arising from the 
LTIP, excluding exceptional proﬁts, onerous lease provision release, movement in hire deposits and other 
material accruals unless the Remuneration Committee considers them appropriate to include.
TSR for these purposes is the percentage increase over the performance period of the value of a holding of 
shares, assuming that any dividends are re-invested and appropriate adjustments made to reﬂect changes 
in share capital. It is intended that the calculation of TSR will be based on data provided by an external 
ﬁnancial information provider. 
Note that the Committee may adjust the targets in order to neutralise the effect of any changes to the 
capital base.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN RESPECT OF THE SINGLE FIGURE TABLE
Annual Bonus
Our previous policy was to disclose annual bonus targets retrospectively after two years. Following a 
review of our policy, the Committee has decided to disclose annual bonus targets in the annual report 
to which the annual bonus payment relates. As a result, this year is a transition year in which we are 
disclosing the targets for three annual bonus awards: the 2016/17 annual bonus; the 2015/16 annual 
bonus, and; the 2014/15 annual bonus. These disclosures are set out below:
2016/17 Annual Bonus
For 2016/17, the maximum bonus opportunity for Brian Brick was 100% of salary, and for Tony Bennett 
was 80% of salary, paid pro rata to the number of full months of service he had completed in the year. 
The bonus opportunity for Robin Piggott was 80% but no bonus was payable as outlined in Payments for 
Loss of Ofﬁce. The bonus was payable 50% on the achievement of PBT targets, and 50% based on the 
achievement of strategic objectives, subject to the achievement of a minimum level of PBT. A total bonus of 
75% of potential was paid, 50% of which was in deferred shares. The performance measures, targets and

PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
Robin Piggott stepped down from the Board at the 2016 AGM. Thereafter he remained employed as 
Finance Director until 12 August 2016 when Tony Bennett joined as his replacement. No compensation was 
paid for his loss of ofﬁce. He was treated as outlined in the 2015/16 Remuneration Report and in line with 
the remuneration policy and his contract. As a result, he received his base salary, pension and beneﬁts 
up to 12 August 2016, but he was not granted an LTIP award in 2016 and will not receive an annual bonus 
for performance during 2016/17. His outstanding LTIP awards were pro-rated based on the ﬁnancial years 
and full months of service he served during the vesting period and will vest, subject to performance, at the 
normal vesting dates and his deferred bonus awards will vest in full on their normal vesting dates. 
PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS
No payments were made to past Directors during the year.
PAYMENTS FOR OTHER DIRECTORSHIPS
Brian Brick is a director of Ambleside Consulting Limited. He is the only fee earning Director of Ambleside 
Consulting Limited. His continuation as a Director of Ambleside was agreed by the Board when he became 
CEO of Moss Bros in March 2009. At that time, Ambleside had two consulting assignments, one with SFD, 
a visual display and merchandising company and one with Admiral Recruitment, a recruitment company. 
The work to Admiral Recruitment ceased during 2012.
The Board has continued to allow Brian Brick to provide the consultancy services to SFD, on the 
understanding that the consulting work has no conﬂict with his responsibilities as a Director and CEO of 
Moss Bros. In reviewing the potential for any conﬂicts, the Committee established that SFD had been a 
supplier of visual display and merchandise to Moss Bros from 1998 until March 2012. During the period 
that Brian Brick has been CEO of Moss Bros, SFD has invoiced Moss Bros £82,742 inc VAT. This was 
invoiced during the period September 2008 to March 2012. 46 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk
SFD has provided no services to Moss Bros since March 2012. 
Brian Brick received total fees during the period to 28 January 2017 of £90,300 relating to the consulting 
activities of Ambleside Consulting Limited, which was entirely for the services provided to SFD. The Board 
has reviewed and considers that the work he performs has no conﬂicts with Moss Bros and that the time 
committed has no detrimental impact on his role as CEO of Moss Bros. The Committee have approved him 
retaining the fees earned from consulting with SFD.
In reviewing Brian Brick’s time commitment and fees during 2017, the Committee noted that Brian Brick 
has received fees from SFD every year since his appointment as CEO. Whilst his directorship of Ambleside 
Consulting Limited had been disclosed, the speciﬁc fees received by Brian Brick that relate to this activity 
have not been. The Committee is disclosing these fees in line with its policy. 
Brian Brick’s fees earned from Ambleside Consulting Limited since he became CEO are listed below. With 
the exception of FY 2010, 2011 and 2012 all fees quoted have been earned exclusively from his consultancy 
work with SFD.

The Remuneration Committee considered that the performance condition should be based on PBT and 
that the targets may be adjusted in order to neutralise the effect of any changes to the capital base. The 
Committee did consider the inclusion of measures like TSR in the past, but given the stage at that time of 
the Company’s turnaround, the Company’s scale and the absence of direct competitors in this market, the 
Committee felt that for the current time PBT was an appropriate measure. Furthermore, by making it a 
cumulative measure, it would avoid a windfall from the performance of one particular year and therefore 
promotes reward for a more progressive growth pattern. Going forward, as highlighted in the Annual 
Statement, TSR will be introduced as a performance condition.
The awards are based on a number of ordinary shares in the Company issued in the future at a nil exercise 
price, subject to continued employment, regular dividend payments and consistent underlying proﬁt 
performance.

Share ownership
As set out in the Policy Report, executives will be required to retain all of the post-tax number of shares 
until a minimum shareholding has been achieved. Executives who receive an award which exceeds 50% of 
salary are expected to build a holding equal in value to 100% of salary, before they are allowed to sell the 
vested shares. Executives who receive an award of 50% of salary are expected to build a holding of 50% of 
salary, along the same lines as above. Executives who receive an award below 50% salary are expected to 
build a holding of 15% of salary, along the same lines as above.
As at 28 January 2017, Brian Brick met the guideline. Tony Bennett was appointed to the Board in 2016 
and will be required to retain all vesting share awards until he complies with the ownership guideline.

MEMBERSHIP AND ATTENDANCE
During the period ended 28 January 2017, the Committee consisted of the following Non-Executive Directors:
• Zoe Morgan (Chairman)
• Maurice Helfgott 
• Debbie Hewitt (Chairman of the Company) 
• Bryan Portman 
Maurice Helfgott, Bryan Portman and Zoe Morgan are independent Non-Executive Directors. The 
Company Chairman, Debbie Hewitt (who is considered independent), is also a member of the 
Committee. Moss Bros Group PLC falls under the category of a ‘small company’ as deﬁned by the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, which only requires two independent Non-Executive Directors to sit on the 
Remuneration Committee. The Committee met three times during the year. Committee attendance is set 
out on page 26.
Adviser to the committee
During 2016/17, the Committee received advice from New Bridge Street (a trading name of AON 
Corporation) on senior executive remuneration and employee share schemes. Neither New Bridge Street 
nor AON Corporation provided other services to the Company during the period. New Bridge Street is a 
member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and complies with its code of conduct. The Committee is 
comfortable that NBS’s advice remains objective and independent. For the year under review NBS’s total 
fees charged were £10,400. 52 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF MOSS BROS GROUP PLC
In our opinion:
•  the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s 
affairs as at 28 January 2017 and of the group’s proﬁt for the period then ended;
•  the group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
•  the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006; and
•  the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The ﬁnancial statements comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Financial Position, the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement and the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 26. The ﬁnancial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union and, as regards the parent company ﬁnancial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Key risks The key risks that we identiﬁed in the current year were:
•  Store impairments
•  The valuation of inventory and related provisions
•  The measurement and accounting for share-based payments
•  The accounting for property leases
•  Revenue recognition in relation to hire and Tailor Me deposits and the 
provision for customer returns
The key risks in the current year are consistent with those identiﬁed in the 
prior year. 
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £0.59m which was 
determined on the basis of Proﬁt Before Tax. 
Scoping The scope of our work is a full audit of the Group which consists of Moss Bros 
Group PLC as the only trading entity and a number of dormant subsidiaries 
which are subject to analytical procedures. All audit work for the group was 
performed directly by the audit engagement team.
Signiﬁcant changes in 
our audit approach
There have been no signiﬁcant changes in our audit approach compared to 
the prior year. 
GOING CONCERN AND THE DIRECTORS’ ASSESSMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL RISKS THAT 
WOULD THREATEN THE SOLVENCY OR LIQUIDITY OF THE GROUP
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness 
of the going concern basis of accounting contained within note 1 to the ﬁnancial statements and the 
directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the group contained within the corporate governance 
report on page 28.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF MOSS BROS GROUP PLC 54 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
CONTINUED
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
•  the directors’ conﬁrmation on page 28 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity;
•  the disclosures on pages 14-16 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or 
mitigated;
•  the directors’ statement in note 1 to the ﬁnancial statements about whether they considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identiﬁcation 
of any material uncertainties to the group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve 
months from the date of approval of the ﬁnancial statements;
•  the directors’ explanation on page 28 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement 
as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualiﬁcations or assumptions.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any 
such material uncertainties. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
INDEPENDENCE
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we 
conﬁrm that we are independent of the group and we have fulﬁlled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with those standards. We also conﬁrm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit 
services referred to in those standards.
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our 
audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Store Impairments
As at 28 January 2017, the group held £16.4m 
of tangible ﬁxed assets, excluding hire inventory 
(30 January 2016: £14.6m) (see Note 14). As 
described in the accounting policies in Note 1 and 
within key sources of estimation uncertainty in 
Note 2, there is a risk that the carrying value of 
these assets may be higher than the recoverable 
amount, particularly where stores are loss-
making or performing below budget. Management 
has performed an assessment of indicators of 
impairment for each store. Impairments are 
subject to an element of judgement due to the 
assumptions made within cash ﬂow projections. 
These assumptions relate to forecast sales 
growth and margin ﬁgures which are based on 
management estimates. No impairment charge 
has been recorded in the period (period to 30 
January 2016: no charge).
We assessed the impairment model and 
calculations by:
•  challenging the completeness of management’s 
assessment of indicators of impairment to 
include consideration of stores with declining 
margins, those performing below budget, those 
with a marginal positive income compared with 
the carrying value of those assets, and those 
being considered for closure or relocation;
•  assessing the cash ﬂow projections through 
comparison of forecasts to historical 
performance; and
•  evaluating management’s longer-term plans 
for each store where there was an indicator 
of impairment through our knowledge of the 
business. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 55 
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
The valuation of inventory and related provisions
Inventory is presented net of provisions for:
•  obsolescence and items to be sold at less than 
cost; and
• shrinkage
There is an element of judgement relating to 
these provisions which are based on historical 
evidence and the current economic conditions. 
The changing trends and economic environment 
require judgements in respect of provisions to be 
reassessed at each reporting date.
Total net inventory valuation as at 28 January 
2017 is £16.7m (30 January 2016: £14.4m) with 
provisions held against inventory of £0.5m 
(30 January 2016; £0.5m) (see Note 16). This is 
identiﬁed as a key source of estimation uncertainty 
in Note 2 and within the accounting policy on page 
65-70.
We performed testing of the operating effectiveness 
of key controls around the valuation of provisions 
within the inventory business cycle. We visited 
the Distribution Centre (‘DC’) in Barking to test 
controls around the perpetual counting process, in 
addition to attending a sample of ﬁve store counts.
We considered the inventory provision for 
obsolescence and items to be sold at less than cost 
through evaluating:
•  historical inventory and sales data; 
•  management’s latest forecasts and trading 
plans; and
•  selling prices achieved subsequent to the year 
end. 
We recalculated the shrinkage provision using data 
from the loss prevention team and attended stock 
counts where we witnessed the controls in place 
around recording the volume of shrinkage.
The measurement and accounting for share-
based payments
The share awards are measured at the fair value 
at the date of the grant and expensed on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period. The judgement 
of the fair value and number of awards expected 
to vest is based on management estimates. These 
estimates include the volatility of the share price 
and the expected number of options which will vest.
In the period to 28 January 2017 there has been an 
IFRS 2 charge of £0.4m (period to 30 January 2016: 
£0.3m) (see Note 9). The Share-Based Payment 
reserve at 28 January 2017 is £0.6m (30 January 
2016: £0.8m) (see Note 19).
See accounting policy on page 65-70 and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty within Note 2.
We assessed management’s accounting under 
the principles of IFRS 2 Share-based payments. 
We tested the fair value calculations for all new 
share awards granted in the year and the vesting 
conditions and assessed the ongoing fair value of 
the existing share-based payments. This included:
•  a review of the share option award agreements;
•  an assessment of the reasonableness of 
assumptions around the likelihood of meeting 
vesting conditions;
•  an assessment of the reasonableness of inputs 
including the volatility with analysis provided by 
internal experts;
•  recalculation of the amounts recognised over 
the vesting period; and
•  recalculation of the National Insurance amounts 
recognised in relation to these awards. 56 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
The accounting for property leases
Where the Group is the lessee of a property which 
is either vacant, loss-making or sublet, a provision 
may be required to recognise the onerous element 
of the lease. The key judgements in the calculation 
of the provision are the discount rate applied and 
forecast earnings at stores.
The total value of the provision at 28 January 2017 
was £1.5m (30 January 2016: £1.7m) (see Note 22).
The Group also maintains a provision in respect 
of dilapidation costs for closed stores and stores 
anticipated to be closed in the near future. 
Management judgement is involved in calculating 
these provisions which are based on management’s 
best estimate of the future dilapidation costs 
to be incurred upon exiting these stores. The 
dilapidations provision has increased from £0.8m 
as at 30 January 2016 to £1.1m as at 28 January 
2017 (see Note 22).
See accounting policy on page 65-70 and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty within Note 2.
We tested the utilisation of the onerous lease 
provision and assessed whether the year-
end provision is reasonable given the actual 
performance of the stores for which there 
is an onerous lease provision compared to 
management’s forecasts. 
We challenged all store forecasts in terms of 
future earnings projections and costs associated 
with running stores to determine if the provision 
is complete. Where stores do not have a provision, 
we considered management’s stated turnaround 
strategies in relation to the length of the lease 
remaining or plans to relocate the stores.
We challenged management’s assumptions used 
within the dilapidation provision model. We have 
veriﬁed the inputs to the provision calculation by 
agreeing them to supporting documentation where 
possible. We also assessed the past accuracy of the 
provision by assessing previously provided amounts 
to settled dilapidations payments.
Revenue recognition in relation to hire and Tailor 
Me deposits and the provision for customer 
returns
Where the Group holds deposits in relation to hire 
or Tailor Me sales, where the suit has not yet been 
collected by the customer, deposits must be held 
as deferred revenue until collection. A risk exists 
that revenue could be released early before the 
collection has taken place. As at 28 January 2017, 
hire and Tailor Me deposits of £1.4m (30 January 
2016: £1.4m) were recognised in deferred 
revenue in relation to future transactions. See the 
accounting policy on page 65-70.
The Group offers a full refund on retail sales within 
28 days. Management holds a provision to estimate 
the value of returns made in the 28 days following 
the year end where the sale was made during the 
period. As at 28 January 2017, the Group held a 
refund provision of £0.2m (30 January 2016: £0.1m). 
We tested the deferred revenue balance in relation 
to hire and Tailor Me deposits through inspection 
of sales invoices and recalculation of the deferred 
element. 
We assessed the refund provisioning policy 
with reference to post period end refund 
information and performed sensitivity analysis on 
management’s assumptions around the proportion 
of refunds relating to the period to 28 January 2017.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the signiﬁcant issues considered by the 
Audit Committee discussed on page 24.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
CONTINUED MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 57 
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We deﬁne materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements that makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or inﬂuenced. We 
use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the group to be £0.59m (2015/16: £0.55m), which is below 0.5% (2015/16: 
0.5%) of Revenue, below 9% (2015/16: 10%) of Proﬁt Before Taxation and below 2% (2015/16: 2%) of Equity. 
The increase in materiality for the period ended 28 January 2017 reﬂects the increased Revenue and Proﬁt 
Before Tax recorded in the period. Proﬁt Before Tax has been chosen for the basis for materiality as this is 
the measure by which stakeholders and the market assess the wider performance of the entity. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in 
excess of £29,000 (2015/16: £11,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We have increased the threshold to reﬂect the low levels of 
misstatements identiﬁed historically. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we 
identiﬁed when assessing the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our audit work is designed to provide a full audit of the Group which consists of Moss Bros Group PLC as 
the only trading entity and a number of dormant subsidiaries which are subject to analytical procedures. 
All work is performed by the Group audit team at the head ofﬁce where all books and records are kept.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
•  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and
•  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which 
the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements; and
•  the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements. 
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identiﬁed any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
CONTINUED
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, information in the annual report is:
•  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited ﬁnancial statements; or
•  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group 
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
•  otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identiﬁed any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is 
fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We conﬁrm 
that we have not identiﬁed any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with International Standard 
on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality 
control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our 
dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements 
sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-
ﬁnancial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 30 JANUARY 2017
1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Moss Bros Group PLC (“the Company”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under 
the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered ofﬁce is 8 St Johns Hill, London, SW11 1SA. The nature of the Group’s 
operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Review on pages 5 to 7. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
of the Company for the 52 weeks ended 28 January 2017 (“the period”) comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together “the 
Group”).
BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The Group and Company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs). The ﬁnancial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore 
the group ﬁnancial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
The preparation of ﬁnancial information in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting policies are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except where IFRSs require an alternative treatment. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The Group’s signiﬁcant accounting policies are set out in this note, together with the judgements made by management in applying 
these policies, which have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements, apart from those 
involving estimations, which are dealt with separately in note 2. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all 
periods presented in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements except as set out below. The estimates and underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The Group and Company ﬁnancial statements are presented in sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates and all values in tables are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds except when 
otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies adopted for the period are consistent with those adopted in the ﬁnancial statements for the 52 weeks 
ended 30 January 2016. These can be seen via http://corp.moss.co.uk/reports/ 
Management believe the most signiﬁcant areas of judgement to be:
Deferred tax
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and a judgement made over the probability of 
there being sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts arising in the future to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Share-based payments
The assumptions behind the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest is considered a key area of judgement.
Property Plant and Equipment
The estimated useful lives of non-current assets are considered to be a key area of judgement, particularly given the nature of the 
business. 
Onerous property leases
The assumptions underlying these calculations are highly sensitive to small changes.
NEW AND REVISED IFRSs IN ISSUE BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE 
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied 
in these ﬁnancial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments) Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture 66 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed.
CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated Group accounts incorporate the accounts of Moss Bros Group PLC and its subsidiaries, all of which have made up 
their accounts to 28 January 2017. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the 
power, directly or indirectly, to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. In 
assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The ﬁnancial statements 
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control 
ceases. All intercompany balances, income, expenditure and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and under the historical cost 
convention. The following Company accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered 
material in relation to the Company’s ﬁnancial statements. As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has 
elected not to present its own proﬁt and loss account for the year. The Company only cash ﬂow statement is the same as the Group as 
presented in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. The movements in the Company only equity balances are the same as detailed 
in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Company made a proﬁt after taxation for the 52 week period to 28 January 2017 of £5,523,000 (52 week period to 30 January 2016: 
proﬁt of £4,605,000).
GOING CONCERN
The Directors, have at the time of approving the ﬁnancial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources in place for operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the ﬁnancial statements. Further detail is contained in the Corporate Governance Report on page 28.
REVENUE
Revenue comprises sales to third parties (excluding VAT) and is derived from the retail sale and hire of clothing and ancillary goods. 
Revenue is recognised on exchange of goods; for the hire of clothing, the exchange of goods occurs when the hire clothing and 
ancillary goods are collected for use by the customer. At this point it is deemed that all risks and rewards have been transferred. 
Hire deposits are held within deferred revenue until this date. For Tailor Me, the exchange of goods occurs upon collection. Tailor Me 
advances are held within deferred revenue until this date. E-commerce revenue is recognised at despatch date as this is the point 
where it is deemed all risks and rewards have been transferred. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, 
VAT and other sales related taxes.
COST OF SALES
Cost of sales includes all costs of purchases and costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition. Costs 
of purchase comprise the purchase price, other taxes and transport costs. Inventory write downs are included in cost of sales when 
recognised.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and gains or 
losses on translation are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 67 
LEASES
Leases under the terms of which the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁed as ﬁnance 
leases. Assets acquired under ﬁnance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in payables. As 
at 28 January 2017 and 30 January 2016, the Company had no ﬁnance leases. All other leases are deﬁned as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the 
term of the lease. Amounts payable in respect of contingent rents are recognised in the period to which the sales relate.
Lease incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate beneﬁt of incentives is recognised as a reduction of expense on a 
straight-line basis.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk. Further details of 
derivative ﬁnancial instruments are disclosed in note 24.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to 
their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in proﬁt or loss immediately unless the derivative 
is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in proﬁt or loss depends on the 
nature of the hedge relationship.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a ﬁnancial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised 
as a ﬁnancial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the 
instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented 
as current assets or current liabilities. 
HEDGE ACCOUNTING 
Hedges of foreign exchange risk on ﬁrm commitments are accounted for as cash ﬂow hedges. 
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged 
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the 
inception of the hedge and at interim and period end, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in 
offsetting changes in cash ﬂows of the hedged item. 
Cash ﬂow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss, and is 
included in the ‘other gains and losses’ line item. 
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss in the 
periods when the hedged item is recognised in proﬁt or loss, in the same line of the Statement of Comprehensive Income as the 
recognised hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-ﬁnancial asset, the 
gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of 
the non-ﬁnancial asset. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁes for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at 
that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in proﬁt or loss. When a 
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
DIVIDENDS
Dividends are not accrued until approved by Shareholders.
TAXATION
Group
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
CURRENT TAX
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁts as reported in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 68 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
DEFERRED TAX
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if a temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable proﬁt nor the 
accounting proﬁt.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax is not discounted.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional items are those signiﬁcant credits or charges which, in the opinion of the Directors, should be separately disclosed by 
virtue of their size and one-off nature, to enable a full understanding of the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. Therefore, such items are 
disclosed as exceptional on the face of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
TRADE RECEIVABLES AND DEBTORS
Trade receivables and debtors represent amounts due from retailers in respect of sub-tenant income and concessions from which the 
Group trades, less commissions due.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Grants/compensation received in respect of expenses incurred are credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income to match 
the related expense. Grants/compensation received in respect of capital expenditure incurred are credited to property, plant and 
equipment and amortised to the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the lives of the related assets.
PENSIONS
Contributions payable to the Group Personnel Pension Plan and other post retirement beneﬁts are charged to the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the period to which they relate. Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions 
actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date. Details 
are set out in note 9. The fair value determined at grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet 
date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non market-
based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the proﬁt or loss such that the 
cumulative expense reﬂects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Computer software and the directly related development costs that are not an integral part of the related hardware are classiﬁed as 
an intangible asset and stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over three to 
ﬁve years. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 69 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Depreciation is calculated so as to write down on a straight-line basis the cost of non-current assets over their estimated useful lives 
to their estimated residual values. The rates used are as follows:
Fixtures and ﬁttings   5 – 10 years
Computer hardware   5 years
Computer software   3 – 5 years
Vehicles    6 years
Hire inventory   4 -7 years
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying value of its property plant and equipment and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that these assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
The Group considers all the assets of a particular store to be one cash generating unit for the purposes of impairment estimate 
and the related assets of a particular store are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. In assessing value in use of a store cash 
generating unit, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value.
If the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the cash 
generating unit is reduced to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS
Leasehold improvements are written off over the shorter of the period of the lease or the useful economic life of the assets on a 
straight-line basis.
Location premiums are paid to enter a property which is in a desirable location, stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision 
for impairment. Depreciation is calculated on location premiums over the useful economic life on a straight-line basis.
INVESTMENTS
Investments are stated at cost, less amounts written off for any impairment in value.
INVENTORIES
Retail inventory is valued at the lower of cost (weighted average by season) and estimated net realisable value (estimated selling price 
less estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in selling and distribution). Net realisable value is estimated as discussed 
in note 16. Volume discounts received and receivable are deducted from the cost of inventories.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash 
ﬂows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash ﬂows. 
Provisions for onerous property lease contracts are recognised when the Group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting the 
lease obligations exceed the economic beneﬁts to be received under the lease. Where material, these provisions are discounted to 
their present value. Provisions are recognised on a lease by lease basis.
Provisions for dilapidations for leases terminating are recognised when the Group believes that the costs of rectifying the store is 
probable and a reliable estimate can be made for the obligation. We will assess all leases that are due to be exited within 18 months 
from the year end date. We do not discount these provisions to present value as the value of discount is immaterial. 
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market conﬁdence and to sustain 
future development of the business. To achieve this, the Board of Directors monitors the balance sheet, working capital, the cash 
ﬂows and the level of dividends paid to shareholders.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the 
advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position. 70 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED
1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The Company’s approach to capital management and policy is to spread cash deposits across three UK based banks to minimise the 
risks associated with default by any one bank. The banks selected carry the highest available credit ratings. 
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
2. KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In applying the above accounting policies, management has made appropriate estimates in many areas and the actual outcome 
may differ from those calculated. The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a signiﬁcant risk of 
causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial period are:
IMPAIRMENT CALCULATIONS
The carrying amount of non-current assets on the balance sheet is dependent on the estimates of future proﬁts and cash ﬂows 
arising from the Company’s operations.
The key assumptions for the value used in calculating any impairment loss referred to in the property, plant and equipment 
accounting policy note, are regarding expected growth rates to individual stores during the year and discount rates applied to the 
forecast cash ﬂows. Management estimates discount rates using a pre-tax discount rate based on the weighted average cost of 
capital for the Group. Sales and cost growth rates are based on the managements’ best expectations of future business performance 
over a maximum period of ﬁve years.
There has been no impairment charge recognised during 2016/17 (2015/16: £nil) in relation to loss making stores.
ONEROUS PROPERTY LEASE CONTRACTS
The Company provides for onerous property lease contracts where the Group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease 
obligations exceed the economic beneﬁt until the end of the lease. The provision is calculated as the lower of contracted rental costs, 
estimated net exit costs and the forecast operating losses through to the end of the lease. These provisions are based on the best 
estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date, the actual liability being dependent on future events such as economic conditions 
and marketplace demand. Expectations will be revised at each period until the actual liability arises, with any difference accounted 
for in the period in which the revision is made.
The provision for onerous property lease contracts is discounted to reﬂect the time value of money.
A credit of £207,000 was recognised within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in relation to onerous property lease 
contracts for continuing operations for the period ended 28 January 2017 (2015/16: £180,000 credit). 
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS
The fair values of the options granted, and shares granted under the LTIP and SAYE, that are referred to in the accounting policies 
note, are measured using the Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options and shares 
were granted. Details of the assumptions used are set out in note 9. 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2 ‘Share-based Payments’. The Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 
‘Share-based Payments’. 
The amount recorded in the statement of comprehensive income and statement of changes in equity in respect of share-based 
payment transactions, is an IFRS 2 charge of £392,000 and employer’s National Insurance charge of £52,000 (2015/16: IFRS 2 charge 
of £347,000 and employer’s National Insurance charge £104,000) and relates to the LTIP and SAYE. 
INVENTORY PROVISIONS
Net realisable value is the selling price of inventory in the ordinary course of business less estimated selling costs. Provision is made 
for the estimated obsolescence of old seasons’ lines based on historical margin trends and for the estimated loss of inventory from 
shop theft based on historical data. The provision at 28 January 2017 was £460,000 (2015/16: £467,000).
DILAPIDATIONS
In 2015/16, an exceptional charge of £748,000 was incurred in respect of property dilapidations. In line with our policy, the provision 
has been increased by £347,000 in 2016/17. See note 22.  MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 71 
3. REVENUE AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS
OPERATING SEGMENTS
The majority of the Company’s turnover arose in the United Kingdom, with the exception of two stores in Ireland.
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires operating segments to be identiﬁed on the basis of internal reports about components of 
the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their 
performance.
Information reported to the Group’s Chief Executive Ofﬁcer for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment 
performance is focused on the split between Mainstream Retail and Hire. 
Information regarding the Group’s continuing operating segments is reported below.
The following is an analysis of the Group’s revenue and gross proﬁt in the current and prior periods:

The accounting policies for the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies described in note 1.
Only revenue and gross proﬁt have been reported for the Group’s business segments; Retail and Hire, as the main operating costs, 
being property, related overheads and staff, cannot be separately identiﬁed as they both use the same stores and hence operating 
proﬁt is not reported to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer split by Retail and Hire. Revenue and gross proﬁt are the measures reported to the 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segmental performance.
On the same basis, assets cannot be allocated between Retail and Hire, and are not reported to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer separately. 72 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

from the London Development Agency (LDA) resulting from the ﬁnalisation of a compulsory purchase compensation claim made 
in 2007 on the Group’s former distribution centre following the successful London Olympics bid. £423,000 of this amount related to 
revenue and £1,017,000 related to ﬁxed assets. Of the £1,017,000 which related to ﬁxed assets, £610,000 was recognised in 2012/13 as 
an exceptional item representing six years accumulated depreciation and £407,000 was deferred into future years to be released over 
the useful economic lives of the relevant replacement assets. This ongoing annual release has not been treated as an exceptional 
item in subsequent years but netted off the annual depreciation charge for the replacement assets.

In 2015/16, an exceptional credit had been received following the negotiated exit from a retail location where the landlord paid 
compensation, for the release of certain lease obligations, of £650,000.
An exceptional charge of £748,000 was incurred in respect of property dilapidations. As a result of the portfolio of stores increasingly 
moving away from the high street and towards shopping centres and retail parks, we reﬁned our estimation technique for calculating 
the dilapidation provision in 2015/16.
Given this change in estimate and the unusually high number of dilapidation claims received in 2015/16 there was a large 
dilapidations charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. While dilapidation claims are generally part of the underlying 
operations of the business, the size of the charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the prior year means that this meets 
our deﬁnition of an exceptional item. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 73

A save as you earn scheme was approved and adopted in 2012/13. Under the terms of the scheme, the Board may offer options to 
purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each ﬁnancial year to those employees who enter into an HM Revenue & Customs 
(HMRC) approved Save As You Earn (SAYE) savings contract. For the 2016/17 plan, in line with HMRC regulations, the Board limited 
the maximum amount saved to £500 per month per employee (2015/16 plan: £500 per month). The price at which options were offered 
is the average closing price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the offer date. For 2016, the exercise price offered was 
discounted by 20%. The options may normally be exercised during the six month period after the completion of the SAYE contract, 
three years after entering the scheme.

At 28 January 2017 the deferred tax asset in respect of capital allowances, share-based payments and other short term temporary 
differences was recognised on the basis that the Company is proﬁtable in 2016/17 and forecasts to be proﬁtable in future years. 
At the balance sheet date, the Finance (No 2) Act 2015 had been substantively enacted conﬁrming that the main UK corporation tax 
rate will reduce from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and then to 18% from 1 April 2020. Therefore, at 28 January 2017, 
deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated at the rate at which the temporary difference is expected to reverse after 1 
April 2017. These reductions may also reduce the Group’s future current tax charges accordingly.
11. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Underlying* basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the weighted average of 100,211,983 (2015/16: 99,084,852) ordinary shares 
in issue during the period after deducting for shares held by the Employee Beneﬁt Trust and are calculated by reference to the proﬁt 
attributable to shareholders of £5,523,000 (2015/16: £4,669,000). 
Underlying* diluted earnings per ordinary share is based upon the weighted average of 102,559,814 (2015/16: 102,324,496) ordinary 
shares after deducting shares held by the Employee Beneﬁt Trust, which include the effects of shares under SAYE, LTIP and Deferred 
Bonus Shares of 2,347,831, that were non-dilutive for the period presented and could dilute earnings per share in the future and are 
calculated by reference to the proﬁt attributable to shareholders as stated above.

Included within leasehold improvements at 28 January 2017 are £110,000 of location premiums (30 January 2016: £114,000). Location 
premiums relate to premiums paid to enter a property which is in a desirable location.
During 2016/17 the Group progressed with the store development programme which commenced during 2012/13. A charge of £0.5m 
was taken in 2012/13 to reﬂect accelerated depreciation on existing ﬁxtures and ﬁttings in those stores, so that the value of ﬁxtures 
and ﬁttings replaced on reﬁt will be written off by the date of reﬁt. Management have reassessed the useful economic lives of these 
assets and a £71,000 charge (2015/16: £51,000 charge) to the Statement of Comprehensive Income has been made during the year 
ended 28 January 2017. This has been treated as a prospective revision to the Group’s estimate for depreciation in accordance with

**  The utilisation of £113,000 of Dilapidations provision and £207,000 of onerous property lease provision was in respect of continuing and closed stores.
The onerous property lease provision at 28 January 2017 of £1,478,000 (2015/16: £1,685,000) is the estimated future cost of the 
Group’s onerous property lease contracts and will be released over the lease terms up until 2024. The net release to the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income on stores which closed during the year and on continuing stores was £267,000 (2015/16: release of £214,000). 
This has been discounted to reﬂect the time value of money. The effect of the unwinding of the discount rate on the release for the 
year was a debit of £59,000 (2015/16: debit of £34,000).
The dilapidations provision at 28 January 2017 of £1,095,000 (2015/16: £793,000) is the estimated future cost of the Group’s 
dilapidations costs and is expected to be released within two years. 
23. PENSIONS
The Group currently operates a deﬁned contribution scheme. As at 28 January 2017 there were £42,000 outstanding contributions 
relating to the deﬁned contribution scheme (2015/16: £41,000). 88 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

24. ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
(A) MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
The Company’s ﬁnancial instruments comprise cash and various items such as derivative forward foreign currency transactions, 
trade receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations. 
The main purpose of these ﬁnancial instruments is to manage the Company’s liquidity.
The main risks arising from the Company’s ﬁnancial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate 
risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
CREDIT RISK
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is maintained on an ongoing basis. At the Balance Sheet date, 
there were no signiﬁcant concentrations of credit risk.
The carrying amount of each ﬁnancial asset represents the maximum credit exposure.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Cash balances are managed and monitored on a daily basis and the peaks and troughs in the cash cycle are well known through 
experience. The Company continues to operate the business from a debt free position and current trading levels generate a healthy 
cash ﬂow.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Company’s policy is to mitigate all currency exposures on purchases either by buying the amount of currency required at the 
time the obligation is known and holding it in a designated bank account until it is needed or by taking out forward foreign currency 
contracts and applying hedge accounting. Details of forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at 28 January 2017 are 
detailed in note (E) below.
INTEREST RATE RISK
Interest rate risk arises from investment of cash balances on short term deposits. The Company is not exposed to any other interest 
rate risk.
(B) FINANCIAL ASSETS

Allowance for doubtful debts    – –
    291 177
The Company recognised an allowance for doubtful debts where the trade receivable was considered irrecoverable on the basis of 
ageing and historical experience. In the current period £nil was provided for (2015/16: £nil). If the Company believes that a speciﬁc 
balance is irrecoverable, it will be written off. The Company does not require collateral in respect of these ﬁnancial assets.
(ii) Cash and cash equivalents

Currency
Sterling    18,800 16,530
Other    718 729
Total    19,518 17,259
Cash and cash equivalents generate interest income on short term deposits. The Company has no ﬁxed rate ﬁnancial instruments. 
Based on the average cash balance, the effective interest rate on ﬁnancial assets is 0.25% (2015/16: 0.43%). MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 89 
(C) FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
There were no ﬁnancial liabilities after excluding derivative ﬁnancial instruments, as detailed below, and current trade payables as at 
28 January 2017 (2015/16: £nil).
(D) FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
As at 28 January 2017 and 30 January 2016, there was no material difference between the fair values and book values of the 
Company’s ﬁnancial assets or liabilities.

 Forward foreign currency contracts  – –
  – –
In the current year the Group entered into several forward foreign currency contracts, to protect the cost to the Group of 2016/17 
inventory purchases and hedge against the risk of exchange rate ﬂuctuations. During 2016/17 the Group had entered into £12,934,382 
(2015/16: £7,645,000) US dollar forward contracts which were outstanding at 28 January 2017. In the current year, these have been 
designated as cash ﬂow hedges. The associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to inventories when the purchases 
occur during the next 12 months, at which time the amount deferred in equity will be reclassiﬁed to the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. At 28 January 2017, £418,000 has been deferred in equity (2015/16: £630,000). The ineffective portion of cash ﬂow hedges 
recognised in “Other gains and losses” within the Statement of Comprehensive Income is a credit of £26,000 (2015/16: credit of 
£3,000).
CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group manages its capital to ensure that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to 
stakeholders through the optimism of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2011/12.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 19.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. 
The Group’s risk management committee reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the committee 
considers the cost of capital and risks associated with each class of capital.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Details of the signiﬁcant accounting policies and methods adopted (including criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the bases for recognition of income and expenses) for each class of ﬁnancial asset, ﬁnancial liability and equity instrument are 
disclosed in note 1. 90 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

 Deferred in equity – Hedge Reserve  (41) (59)
 Proﬁt or loss ineffectiveness  – –
The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash ﬂow hedges results from retranslation of forward purchases of US Dollars 
used to hedge 2016/17 inventory purchases. A negative number indicates a credit to equity where Sterling strengthens 10% against 
the US Dollar. The associated fair value gains and losses are deferred in equity until the purchases occur. 
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying amount of trade and other payables 
and receivables, due to the low associated sensitivity, and are reported before the effect of tax. It has been prepared on the basis that 
the Group’s hedging activities, hedge accounting designations and derivate contracts remain constant, reﬂecting the position at 28 
January 2017. Consequently, the analysis relates to the position at that date and is not necessarily representative of 2016/17 then 
ended. In preparing the sensitivity analysis, it is assumed that all hedges are fully effective.
The effect shown above would be reversed in the event of an equal and opposite change in foreign exchange rate.
All derivatives are categories as level 2 under the requirements of IFRS 7 and they are valued using techniques based signiﬁcantly on 
observed market data.

TRADING TRANSACTIONS
The Group entered into the following transactions with related parties who are not members of the Group: 
Berkeley Burke Trustee Company Limited is considered a related party of the Group because Brian Brick, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of 
Moss Bros Group plc is a beneﬁciary of the pension fund. On 8 December 2011, Moss Bros Group plc agreed a long-term lease with 
Berkeley Burke Trustee Company Limited, a pension fund and the superior landlord, for a store in Hounslow, on an arm’s length 
basis.
AAK Limited is considered a related party of the Group because Maurice Helfgott, Senior Independent Non- Executive Director of 
Moss Bros Group plc, has a close relative holding a key management position with signiﬁcant inﬂuence and who is a signiﬁcant 
shareholder at AAK Limited. All transactions with AAK Limited have been on an arm’s length basis. At 28 January 2017, total 
purchase from AAK Limited was £4.3m, including VAT, (30 January 2016: £4.1m, including VAT), of which £177,000 was outstanding at 
year end.
Moss Bros agreed a sublet of a store lease to White Stuff Ltd. Debbie Hewitt, Chairman of Moss Bros Group plc, is also Chairman 
and director of White Stuff. The transaction was on arm’s length commercial terms and Debbie Hewitt took no part in determining 
the commercial terms offered by Moss Bros or in the decision to accept them taken by White Stuff. The sublet is from June 2014 
until December 2021 at a rent of £50,000 per year. A capital contribution of £50,000 was paid to White Stuff on completion of the 
agreement. At 28 January 2017 the balance due from White Stuff was £212 in respect of service charges payable in arrears.  92 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

“Act”) to make one or more market purchases (within the meaning of section 693(4) of the Act) of any of its ordinary shares of 5p 
each in the capital of the Company on such terms and in such manner as the Directors may from time to time determine provided 
that:
 (a)  the maximum number of ordinary shares which may be purchased is 10,079,987 ordinary shares of 5p each (representing 
10 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company at 11 April 2017, being the last practicable date prior to the 
date of this document)
 (b)  the minimum price that may be paid for each ordinary share shall be 5p which is an amount exclusive of expenses, if any;
 (c)  the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for each ordinary share is the higher of:
  (i)  105 per cent. of the average of the middle market quotations for an ordinary share of the Company as derived from the 
Daily Ofﬁcial List of the London Stock Exchange plc for the ﬁve business days immediately preceding the day on which 
such is contracted to be purchased; and
  (ii)  the higher of the price of the last independent trade of an ordinary share and the highest current independent bid for an 
ordinary share on the trading venues where the purchase is carried out;
 (d)  unless previously renewed, revoked or varied, the authority conferred by this resolution shall expire at the conclusion of the 
next Annual General Meeting of the Company (or, if earlier, on 28 July 2018); and
 (e)  the Company may, before the expiry of the authority granted by this resolution, enter into a contract to purchase ordinary 
shares which would or might be executed wholly or partly after the expiry of this authority, and may make purchases of 
ordinary shares pursuant to it as if this authority had not expired.
16.  That a general meeting of the Company (other than an annual general meeting) may be called on not less than 14 clear days’ 
notice.

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
CONTINUED
NOTES
1.  Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts with the Company and copies of the Non-Executive Directors’ letters of 
appointment with the Company will be available for inspection at the registered ofﬁce of the Company during normal business 
hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and public bank holidays excepted) from the date of this notice until the close of the 
Company’s 2017 Annual General Meeting on 19 May 2017 and will also be available for inspection at the place of the meeting for 
at least 15 minutes prior to, and throughout, the meeting. A copy of this notice and other information required by section 311A of 
the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) can be found at http://corp.moss.co.uk/reports/ 
2.  Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001 and section 360(B)(2) of the Act, the Company 
speciﬁes that in order to have the right to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting (and also for the purpose of determining 
how many votes a person entitled to attend and vote may cast), a person must be entered on the register of members of the 
Company at close of business on 17 May 2017 or, in the event of any adjournment, at close of business on the date which is two 
days before the day of the adjourned meeting. Changes to entries on the register of members after this time shall be disregarded 
in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
3.  A member of the Company entitled to attend, speak and vote at the Annual General Meeting may appoint a proxy to attend, speak 
and vote in their place. A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that 
each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A proxy need not be a 
member of the Company.
4.  A form of proxy for the 2017 Annual General Meeting is enclosed. To be valid, the completed and signed form of proxy, together 
with the power of attorney or authority, if any, under which it is signed (or a duly certiﬁed copy of any such power or authority), 
or other instrument appointing a proxy must be received by post or by hand (during normal business hours) with the Company’s 
registrars, Capita Asset Services at PXS1, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, BR3 4ZF as soon as possible but not less than 48 
hours before the time of the meeting. If you are a CREST member, see note 5 below. Alternatively, a member may appoint a proxy 
electronically, or may wish to vote electronically online, at www.capitashareportal.com. Please see the form of proxy for further 
details.
  Return of a completed form of proxy, or other instrument appointing a proxy or any CREST Proxy Instruction will not preclude a 
member from attending and voting personally at the meeting if he/she wishes to do so.
5.  Alternatively, if you are a member of CREST, you may register the appointment of a proxy by using the CREST electronic proxy 
appointment service. Further details are contained below.
  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for 
the Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures, and to the address, described in the CREST 
Manual (available via www.euroclear .com/CREST) subject to the provisions of the Company’s articles of association. CREST personal 
members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should 
refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a 
“CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited’s (“Euroclear”) 
speciﬁcations and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, 
regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously 
appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA10) by the latest time(s) 
for receipt of proxy appointments speciﬁed in the notice of the Annual General Meeting, being 12 noon on 17 May 2017. For this 
purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the time stamp applied to the message by the CREST 
Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by 
CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee 
through other means.
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that Euroclear does not 
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore 
apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if 
the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure 
that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is 
transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, 
their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning 
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 95 
6.  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person currently nominated by a member of the Company to enjoy information 
rights under section 146 of the Act (a “nominated person”) may have a right under an agreement between him/her and such 
member by whom he/she was nominated, to be appointed, or to have someone else appointed, as a proxy for the Annual General 
Meeting. If a nominated person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may have a right 
under such an agreement to give instructions to the member concerned as to the exercise of voting rights. The statement of the 
above rights of the members in relation to the appointment of proxies does not apply to a nominated person. Such rights can only 
be exercised by a member of the Company.
7.  Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its 
powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
8.  Any member attending the Annual General Meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered 
any such question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so would 
interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of conﬁdential information, (b) the answer has 
already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question, or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or 
the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
9.  Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the 
Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including 
the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance 
connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold ofﬁce since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports 
were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act, (in each case) that the members propose to raise at the Annual General 
Meeting. The Company may not require the members requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying 
with sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the 
Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the 
website. The business which may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required under 
section 527 of the Act to publish on a website.
10.  As at 11 April 2017 (being the last practicable date prior to the date of this document) the Company’s issued share capital consists 
of 100,799,873 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at that date are 
100,799,873.
11.  You may not use any electronic address (within the meaning of section 333(4) of the Act) provided in this notice (or in any related 
documents including the proxy form) to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.
12.  Under section 338 and section 338A of the Act, members meeting the threshold requirements in those sections have the right to 
require the Company (i) to give, to members of the Company entitled to receive notice of the Annual General Meeting, notice of a 
resolution which may properly be moved and is intended to be moved at the meeting and/or (ii) to include in the business to be dealt 
with at the meeting any matter (other than a proposed resolution) which may be properly included in the business. A resolution 
may properly be moved or a matter may properly be included in the business unless (a) (in the case of a resolution only) it would, 
if passed, be ineffective (whether by reason of inconsistency with any enactment or the Company’s constitution or otherwise), (b) it 
is defamatory of any person, or (c) it is frivolous or vexatious. Such a request may be in hard copy form or in electronic form, must 
identify the resolution of which notice is to be given or the matter to be included in the business, must be authorised by the person 
or persons making it, must be received by the Company not later than the date 6 clear weeks before the meeting, and (in the case of 
a matter to be included in the business only) must be accompanied by a statement setting out the grounds for the request.
13.  Voting on all resolutions at the Annual General Meeting will be by way of a poll. This means that you will be asked to complete 
a poll card if you attend in person. The Company believes that this is the best way of representing the views of as many 
shareholders as possible in the voting process.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
1.  Resolution 2. This resolution is to approve the Directors’ remuneration report (other than the part containing the Directors’ 
remuneration policy) for the ﬁnancial year ended on 28 January 2017. You can ﬁnd the report on pages 41 to 52 of the Company’s 
Annual Report and Accounts 2016/2017, which is available on the Company’s website http://corp.moss.co.uk/reports/. As this vote 
is an advisory vote, no entitlement of a Director to remuneration is conditional on it. This resolution is put annually as required by 
the Act.
2.  Resolution 3. This resolution is to approve the Directors’ remuneration policy contained in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
You can ﬁnd the policy on pages 34 to 40 of the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts 2016/2017. This vote is a binding vote 
and, subject to limited exceptions, no remuneration payment or loss of ofﬁce payment may be made to a prospective, current or 
former Director unless consistent with the approved remuneration policy (or otherwise speciﬁcally approved by shareholders of 
the Company). If approved by shareholders, the Directors’ remuneration policy will take effect immediately after the end of the 
Annual General Meeting. This resolution should be put at least every three years as required by the Act. 96 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk
NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
CONTINUED
3.  Resolutions 4 to 9. As required by the UK Corporate Governance Code, biographical details of each of the Directors standing 
for election and re-election appear on page 19 of the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts 2016/2017. Under the Company’s 
articles of association, one-third of the Directors are required to retire by rotation each year. However, in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, all the Directors will submit themselves for annual re-election by shareholders. The Chairman is 
satisﬁed that, following individual formal performance evaluations, the performance of the Directors standing for election and 
re-election continues to be effective and to demonstrate commitment to the role.
4.  Resolution 13. Your Directors may allot shares and grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares only if 
authorised to do so by shareholders. The authority granted at the last Annual General Meeting is due to expire at this year’s 
Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, resolution 13 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to grant new authorities to allot 
shares and grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares. If given, these authorities will expire at the Annual 
General Meeting in 2018 or on 28 July 2018, whichever is earlier. Resolution 13 will allow the Directors to allot ordinary shares up 
to a maximum nominal amount of £1,678,317, representing approximately one-third (33.33 per cent.) of the Company’s existing 
issued share capital and calculated as at 11 April 2017 (being the latest practicable date prior to the date of this document).
  As at 11 April 2017 (being the last practicable date prior to the date of this document) the Company holds no treasury shares.
5.  Resolution 14. Your Directors also require a power from shareholders to allot equity securities for cash and otherwise than to 
existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings. The power granted at the last Annual General Meeting is due to expire at this 
year’s Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, resolution 14 will be proposed as a special resolution to grant such a power. Apart 
from offers or invitations in proportion to the respective number of shares held, the power will be limited to the allotment of 
equity securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £251,999.68 (being ﬁve per cent. of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital at 11 April 2017, being the latest practicable date prior to the date of this document). If given, this power will expire 
on 28 July 2018 or at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2018, whichever is the earlier. Your Directors will have due 
regard to institutional guidelines in relation to any exercise of this power, in particular the requirement for advance consultation 
with shareholders before making any non pre-emptive cash issue pursuant to this resolution which exceeds 7.5 per cent of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital in any rolling three year period.
6.  Resolution 15. This resolution will give the Company authority to purchase its own shares in the markets up to a limit of 10 per 
cent of its issued ordinary share capital. The maximum and minimum prices are stated in the resolution. Your Directors believe 
that it is advantageous for the Company to have this ﬂexibility to make market purchases of its own shares. Your Directors will 
exercise this authority only if they are satisﬁed that a purchase would result in an increase in expected earnings per share and 
would be in the interests of shareholders generally.
  In the event that shares are purchased, they may either be cancelled (and the number of shares in issue would be reduced 
accordingly) or, in accordance with the Act, be retained as treasury shares. The Company will consider holding repurchased 
shares pursuant to the authority conferred by this resolution as treasury shares. This would give the Company the ability to re-
issue treasury shares quickly and cost effectively and would provide the Company with additional ﬂexibility in the management of 
its capital base.
  As at 11 April 2017, being the last practicable date prior to the date of this document, the total number of options over ordinary 
shares in the capital of the Company that were outstanding under all of the Company’s share option plans was 2,873,075, which 
if exercised would represent 2.85 per cent. of the Company’s issued share capital at that date. If the Company were to purchase 
its own shares to the fullest possible extent of its authority from shareholders (existing and being sought), this number of 
outstanding options could potentially represent 3.2 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company.
7.  Resolution 16. Changes made to the Act by the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 increase the notice period 
required for general meetings of the Company to at least 21 clear days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period, 
which cannot however be less than 14 clear days. (Annual General Meetings will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ 
notice.)
  Until the coming into force of the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 on 3 August 2009, the Company was able to 
call general meetings other than an annual general meeting on at least 14 clear days’ notice without obtaining such shareholder 
approval. In order to preserve this ability, resolution 14 seeks the necessary shareholder approval. The approval will be effective 
until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
  The ﬂexibility offered by this resolution will be used where, taking into account the circumstances, the directors consider this 
appropriate in relation to the business to be considered at the meeting.
  Note that the changes to the Act mean that, in order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, the 
Company must make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 97 
8. Recommendation
  Your Directors believe that all the proposed resolutions to be considered at the 2017 Annual General Meeting as set out in this 
document are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, your Directors unanimously 
recommend that you vote in favour of them as they intend to do in respect of their own beneﬁcial holdings.
9. Note from the Chairman:
  “I can conﬁrm, as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code, that having fully evaluated their performances, the Board is of 
the view that each of the Directors offering themselves for re-appointment at the Annual General Meeting continue to be effective 
and to demonstrate commitment to their role.”
